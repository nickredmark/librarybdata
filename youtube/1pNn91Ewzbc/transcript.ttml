<p begin="00:00:39.760" end="00:00:44.980" style="s2">it&#39;s been a busy time since the last</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.830" end="00:00:47.739" style="s2">time I did a QA some of you probably</p>

<p begin="00:01:05.860" end="00:01:09.250" style="s2">would say and so I made a bit of a video</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.960" end="00:01:12.940" style="s2">about that today which I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.250" end="00:01:14.860" style="s2">launched yet it contains a message to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.940" end="00:01:17.470" style="s2">junior high and high school students I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.860" end="00:01:20.009" style="s2">recommending to them that they well I</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.470" end="00:01:21.729" style="s2">guess you&#39;ll have to watch the video I</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.009" end="00:01:23.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t mean to make it a cliffhanger</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.729" end="00:01:24.970" style="s2">like that but then as soon as I said</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.440" end="00:01:28.630" style="s2">that I thought better of it and thought</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.970" end="00:01:30.729" style="s2">maybe I&#39;ll just wait but anyways let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.630" end="00:01:32.649" style="s2">take a look here Steve a has the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.729" end="00:01:35.020" style="s2">question how can we know the difference</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.649" end="00:01:38.500" style="s2">between unhealthy repression and healthy</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.020" end="00:01:44.490" style="s2">self restraint of sexuality well I would</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.500" end="00:01:47.050" style="s2">say you know part of what constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.490" end="00:01:49.000" style="s2">ethics let&#39;s say first of all let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.050" end="00:01:52.869" style="s2">start let&#39;s think about ethics to begin</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.000" end="00:01:55.000" style="s2">with so what&#39;s the point of conducting</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.869" end="00:01:57.940" style="s2">your life ethically the answer that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.000" end="00:02:00.970" style="s2">isn&#39;t so that you follow the proper</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.940" end="00:02:02.920" style="s2">rules precisely the the answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.970" end="00:02:05.410" style="s2">is so that you balance your life so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.920" end="00:02:07.330" style="s2">it says productive and meaningful as it</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.410" end="00:02:09.429" style="s2">can possibly be and that would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.330" end="00:02:12.520" style="s2">productive and meaningful for you with</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.429" end="00:02:14.440" style="s2">any luck but also for people around you</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.520" end="00:02:17.349" style="s2">that would even be better and and for</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.440" end="00:02:20.080" style="s2">you now and next week and into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.349" end="00:02:22.380" style="s2">future so it&#39;s sort of a variation of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.080" end="00:02:25.630" style="s2">the philosopher Immanuel Kant&#39;s moral</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.380" end="00:02:28.330" style="s2">dictum which was act such that your</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.630" end="00:02:29.470" style="s2">action becomes a moral universal</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.330" end="00:02:32.200" style="s2">something like that although I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.470" end="00:02:37.209" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s better phrased across</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.200" end="00:02:38.769" style="s2">time and across people like that so when</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.209" end="00:02:40.450" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking about an ethic that has</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.769" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">to do with any fundamental motivation</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.450" end="00:02:42.599" style="s2">like sexual</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:46.280" style="s2">you have to think about it in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.599" end="00:02:49.980" style="s2">context of the rest of your life</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.280" end="00:02:51.810" style="s2">the question is whether or not but what</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.980" end="00:02:53.250" style="s2">did I say what what did I read at one</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.810" end="00:02:58.799" style="s2">point that I really liked with regards</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.250" end="00:03:01.620" style="s2">to sexuality who&#39;s in control that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.799" end="00:03:04.590" style="s2">issue is it you or is it the sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.620" end="00:03:07.590" style="s2">that&#39;s in control is have you integrated</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.590" end="00:03:10.019" style="s2">your sexual life into the rest of your</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.590" end="00:03:12.510" style="s2">life so that the whole thing makes a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.019" end="00:03:15.230" style="s2">harmonious balance and are you in charge</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.510" end="00:03:17.579" style="s2">or is it in charge so to speak because</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.230" end="00:03:19.139" style="s2">if you&#39;re not in charge with that</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.579" end="00:03:21.480" style="s2">harmonious balance then things are going</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.139" end="00:03:22.980" style="s2">to waver wildly out of control and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.480" end="00:03:25.799" style="s2">you&#39;re going to find yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.980" end="00:03:29.040" style="s2">dreadful trouble that happens whenever</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.799" end="00:03:31.530" style="s2">any given drive or me really any given</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.040" end="00:03:35.269" style="s2">value predominates to the exclusion of</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.530" end="00:03:38.189" style="s2">all else now it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.269" end="00:03:41.700" style="s2">sexuality is best handled within the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.189" end="00:03:44.430" style="s2">confines of a relationship that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.700" end="00:03:47.760" style="s2">classic ethical solution to the problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.430" end="00:03:49.829" style="s2">it&#39;s because sexuality brings with it a</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.760" end="00:03:50.940" style="s2">tremendous amount of responsibility now</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.829" end="00:03:52.889" style="s2">people don&#39;t like to think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.940" end="00:03:54.599" style="s2">especially people who I would say are</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.889" end="00:03:57.359" style="s2">low in conscientiousness let&#39;s say or</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.599" end="00:04:00.449" style="s2">high and impulsivity it&#39;s easy for</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.359" end="00:04:02.639" style="s2">people to believe in what would you call</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.449" end="00:04:04.319" style="s2">it casual sex which is not something</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.639" end="00:04:06.709" style="s2">that I think exists because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.319" end="00:04:09.329" style="s2">think you can divorce sex from its</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.709" end="00:04:11.220" style="s2">sociological or political or economic or</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.329" end="00:04:14.430" style="s2">psychological consequences and I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.220" end="00:04:17.070" style="s2">say the endless scandals that have</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.430" end="00:04:20.070" style="s2">plagued the United States in particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.070" end="00:04:23.580" style="s2">in the last year with regards to sexual</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.070" end="00:04:26.280" style="s2">behavior are proof positive that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.580" end="00:04:27.659" style="s2">no such thing as casual sex I think the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.280" end="00:04:31.470" style="s2">reason for that is that the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.659" end="00:04:33.900" style="s2">of sex are too dramatic it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.470" end="00:04:39.360" style="s2">pregnancy and disease let&#39;s say which</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.900" end="00:04:42.470" style="s2">are both as dramatic as consequences can</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.360" end="00:04:45.330" style="s2">be in life but also the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.470" end="00:04:47.009" style="s2">there&#39;s no disentangling sexual behavior</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.330" end="00:04:48.330" style="s2">from emotional behavior or maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.009" end="00:04:50.099" style="s2">could say even worse if you try to</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.330" end="00:04:51.930" style="s2">disentangle your sexual behavior from</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.099" end="00:04:54.120" style="s2">your emotional behavior then I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.930" end="00:04:56.850" style="s2">what happens is that you end up</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.120" end="00:05:00.660" style="s2">cynical I mean if you&#39;re let&#39;s say if</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.850" end="00:05:02.669" style="s2">you&#39;re a serial if you&#39;re us if you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.660" end="00:05:05.729" style="s2">a lot of one-night stands and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.669" end="00:05:07.740" style="s2">casual partners then first of all</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.729" end="00:05:09.449" style="s2">there&#39;s not much discrimination between</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.740" end="00:05:11.490" style="s2">one partner and the other and so in some</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.449" end="00:05:13.260" style="s2">sense you&#39;re in a loop and and just</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.490" end="00:05:16.290" style="s2">repeating the same act over and over but</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.260" end="00:05:18.449" style="s2">you can&#39;t there&#39;s nothing deep about it</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.290" end="00:05:19.979" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing that that enables you to</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.449" end="00:05:22.290" style="s2">establish a relationship with another</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.979" end="00:05:24.449" style="s2">person and I think that that&#39;s a I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.290" end="00:05:27.060" style="s2">that you corrupt your soul in that way</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.449" end="00:05:28.350" style="s2">and that you hurt yourself across time</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.060" end="00:05:30.389" style="s2">and of course you&#39;re going to hurt other</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.350" end="00:05:32.870" style="s2">people as well so I&#39;m not a big admirer</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.389" end="00:05:35.840" style="s2">of the casual sex idea I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.870" end="00:05:38.280" style="s2">demented adolescents fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.840" end="00:05:40.620" style="s2">fundamentally it just doesn&#39;t work out</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.280" end="00:05:43.050" style="s2">in the real world now</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.620" end="00:05:44.310" style="s2">healthy self restraint well with regards</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.050" end="00:05:46.620" style="s2">to sexuality it&#39;s the same with</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.310" end="00:05:49.470" style="s2">everything else is that there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.620" end="00:05:51.479" style="s2">the necessity to forego immediate</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.470" end="00:05:55.110" style="s2">gratification for the purpose of medium</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.479" end="00:05:58.350" style="s2">to long term thriving let&#39;s say so if</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.110" end="00:05:59.880" style="s2">your sexuality is integrated in an ethic</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.350" end="00:06:02.520" style="s2">that encompasses the rest of your life</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.880" end="00:06:05.970" style="s2">and if it serves that ethic then I would</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.520" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">say it&#39;s properly restrained if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.970" end="00:06:10.940" style="s2">unhealthily repressed well then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.680" end="00:06:13.410" style="s2">angry and bitter and resentful and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.940" end="00:06:15.720" style="s2">cursing the opposite sex or perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.410" end="00:06:18.000" style="s2">same sex if you happen to be gay for</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.720" end="00:06:20.520" style="s2">failing to recognize your particular</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.000" end="00:06:21.510" style="s2">form of sexual what would you call</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.520" end="00:06:23.639" style="s2">attractiveness</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.510" end="00:06:24.990" style="s2">I think resentment and anger are a good</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.639" end="00:06:27.000" style="s2">indication that there&#39;s something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.990" end="00:06:29.639" style="s2">with the manner in which your sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.000" end="00:06:31.560" style="s2">is restrained so I hope hopefully that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.639" end="00:06:34.169" style="s2">a decent answer</p>

<p begin="00:06:55.320" end="00:06:59.789" style="s2">cat snake bird the idea in the book was</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.020" end="00:07:01.860" style="s2">that the dragon was a imagistic</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.789" end="00:07:04.469" style="s2">representation of the class of all</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.860" end="00:07:08.070" style="s2">predators which means also might be why</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.469" end="00:07:10.260" style="s2">dragons also breathe fire because</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.070" end="00:07:12.090" style="s2">fire was undoubtedly a common</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.260" end="00:07:15.570" style="s2">destructive agent in our evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.090" end="00:07:18.660" style="s2">past but the dragon is the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.570" end="00:07:22.050" style="s2">primordial symbol of that which lurks</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.660" end="00:07:24.180" style="s2">beyond which is known in fact it&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.050" end="00:07:26.250" style="s2">more primordial than that because it</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.180" end="00:07:28.050" style="s2">even is that which lurks beyond what is</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.250" end="00:07:31.140" style="s2">unknown in some sense remember Don</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.050" end="00:07:33.540" style="s2">Rumsfeld unknowns unknown unknowns well</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.140" end="00:07:35.520" style="s2">that&#39;s basically the dragon there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.540" end="00:07:36.840" style="s2">unknowns that pop up that you can master</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.520" end="00:07:39.120" style="s2">right away and you could kind of think</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.840" end="00:07:40.830" style="s2">of those as known unknowns but unknown</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:42.780" style="s2">unknowns are those things that pop up</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.830" end="00:07:45.060" style="s2">that you don&#39;t know how you didn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.780" end="00:07:47.910" style="s2">you had no idea whatsoever that they</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.060" end="00:07:50.340" style="s2">even existed anyways what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.910" end="00:07:52.710" style="s2">character of an unknown unknown well</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.340" end="00:07:55.710" style="s2">part of its terrifying because it can it</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.710" end="00:07:59.850" style="s2">can it can do you in right but part of</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.710" end="00:08:02.130" style="s2">its also positive and and because it</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.850" end="00:08:03.930" style="s2">anything that&#39;s truly unknown brings it</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.130" end="00:08:06.120" style="s2">with it a tremendous amount of new</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.930" end="00:08:08.370" style="s2">possibility that&#39;s why dragon&#39;s hoard</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.120" end="00:08:10.860" style="s2">gold or why they also hoard princesses</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.370" end="00:08:13.860" style="s2">or guard princesses hoard I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.860" end="00:08:15.690" style="s2">the right word so I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.860" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">dragon in the West is a fully negative</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.690" end="00:08:19.530" style="s2">symbol because the dragon has gold</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:21.060" style="s2">associated with it or virgins and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.530" end="00:08:23.160" style="s2">reason for that is that the hero who</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.060" end="00:08:25.500" style="s2">confronts the dragon gets the virgin and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.160" end="00:08:27.540" style="s2">that hasn&#39;t changed that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.500" end="00:08:29.070" style="s2">story as old as time and and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.540" end="00:08:32.460" style="s2">think it&#39;ll ever change as long as there</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.070" end="00:08:36.900" style="s2">are human beings now why the Chinese put</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.460" end="00:08:39.060" style="s2">stress on the positive side and the West</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.900" end="00:08:42.360" style="s2">put stress on the negative side is</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.060" end="00:08:45.900" style="s2">difficult to say I might say because the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.360" end="00:08:48.750" style="s2">Chinese got organized so early I have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.900" end="00:08:50.850" style="s2">sneaking suspicion that it was easier</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.750" end="00:08:53.250" style="s2">for them to see a little bit of chaos as</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.850" end="00:08:55.080" style="s2">something positive something necessary</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.250" end="00:08:57.990" style="s2">and positive as a counterbalance to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.080" end="00:09:02.400" style="s2">tremendous organizational weight of</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.990" end="00:09:08.100" style="s2">their state that&#39;s the best best answer</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.400" end="00:09:09.870" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been able to formulate so so</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.100" end="00:09:11.430" style="s2">anyways the dragon is a very complex and</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.870" end="00:09:13.800" style="s2">ambivalent symbol it it combines</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.430" end="00:09:15.060" style="s2">everything into one symbol positive and</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.800" end="00:09:16.860" style="s2">negative and then you can stress the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.060" end="00:09:18.420" style="s2">positive or you can stress the negative</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.860" end="00:09:20.880" style="s2">you could also say to some degree that</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.420" end="00:09:24.780" style="s2">whether a dragon is positive or negative</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.880" end="00:09:26.840" style="s2">depends to some degree on the manner in</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.780" end="00:09:30.150" style="s2">which you approach it because the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.840" end="00:09:32.520" style="s2">psychological reality is that Dragons</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.150" end="00:09:35.010" style="s2">approached voluntarily well small are</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.520" end="00:09:36.420" style="s2">most likely to be positive and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.010" end="00:09:39.390" style="s2">really good thing to know in your life</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.420" end="00:09:41.790" style="s2">it&#39;s a good reason it&#39;s a good rule of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.390" end="00:09:43.260" style="s2">thumb to help you stop avoiding things</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.790" end="00:09:45.780" style="s2">that you shouldn&#39;t avoid so that they</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.260" end="00:09:50.040" style="s2">don&#39;t grow and magnify beyond your</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.780" end="00:09:51.600" style="s2">capacity to deal with them you often</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.040" end="00:09:54.240" style="s2">mention disciplining children so they</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.600" end="00:09:55.950" style="s2">behave what is your advice for making</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.240" end="00:09:58.320" style="s2">them behave without resorting to</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.950" end="00:09:59.700" style="s2">corporal punishment well first of all it</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.320" end="00:10:01.050" style="s2">depends on what you mean by corporal</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.700" end="00:10:03.210" style="s2">punishment</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.050" end="00:10:05.190" style="s2">timeout could be regarded as corporal</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.210" end="00:10:08.400" style="s2">punishment it also depends very much on</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.190" end="00:10:11.640" style="s2">the age of the child let&#39;s say a two</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.400" end="00:10:15.720" style="s2">year old well in my new book by the way</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.640" end="00:10:17.460" style="s2">I have a chapter in there called don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.720" end="00:10:20.130" style="s2">let your children do anything that makes</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.460" end="00:10:22.130" style="s2">you dislike them and the reason that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.130" end="00:10:24.930" style="s2">wrote a chapter about that is because</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.130" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">people who let their children do things</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.930" end="00:10:29.100" style="s2">that make them dislike them end up</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:30.750" style="s2">disliking them and because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.100" end="00:10:32.490" style="s2">huge power differential generally</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.750" end="00:10:33.990" style="s2">speaking between adults and children if</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.490" end="00:10:35.300" style="s2">you end up disliking your children</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.990" end="00:10:37.890" style="s2">because they&#39;re not behaving well</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.300" end="00:10:40.830" style="s2">they&#39;re behaving disgracefully say or</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.890" end="00:10:43.290" style="s2">their or they&#39;re challenging your</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.830" end="00:10:45.540" style="s2">position in the Authority hierarchy to</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.290" end="00:10:47.010" style="s2">regularly something you won&#39;t put up</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.540" end="00:10:49.200" style="s2">with by the way even if you think you</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.010" end="00:10:51.270" style="s2">will it&#39;s necessary to get your</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.200" end="00:10:53.940" style="s2">disciplinary routine straight so the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.270" end="00:10:56.160" style="s2">first thing I would say is figure out</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.940" end="00:10:59.220" style="s2">what the rules are there shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.160" end="00:11:02.820" style="s2">too many for two-year-olds basically</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.220" end="00:11:05.910" style="s2">they have to know what no means and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.820" end="00:11:09.300" style="s2">also have to learn as they approach 3</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.910" end="00:11:11.880" style="s2">not to kick hit bite or steal</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.300" end="00:11:13.800" style="s2">essentially now it&#39;s easy to train a</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.880" end="00:11:15.630" style="s2">two-year-old but no means you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.800" end="00:11:18.540" style="s2">actually start with a child that&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.630" end="00:11:21.510" style="s2">13 months old a child that can cry let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.540" end="00:11:22.830" style="s2">say that or that can crawl let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.510" end="00:11:24.450" style="s2">that you have a child is starting to</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.830" end="00:11:26.190" style="s2">crawl and wants to explore the house so</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.450" end="00:11:28.440" style="s2">the first thing you do if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.190" end="00:11:30.600" style="s2">sense is try to get rid of most things</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.440" end="00:11:34.050" style="s2">that the child could cause a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.600" end="00:11:35.170" style="s2">amount of trouble with to to the things</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.050" end="00:11:39.220" style="s2">or to the chair</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.170" end="00:11:41.260" style="s2">so that it&#39;s reasonably safe and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.220" end="00:11:42.910" style="s2">the child is gonna want to want to crawl</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.260" end="00:11:44.500" style="s2">around and get into everything and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.910" end="00:11:46.810" style="s2">but maybe there are things you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.500" end="00:11:50.680" style="s2">want him or her to get into like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.810" end="00:11:53.110" style="s2">there&#39;s a Oh what would we say maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.680" end="00:11:54.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a tablecloth and on top of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.110" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">tablecloth there&#39;s a plant or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.460" end="00:11:59.560" style="s2">there&#39;s some plants on the floor and</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:12:01.770" style="s2">when the child is crawling and goes off</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.560" end="00:12:05.230" style="s2">to do something that he or she shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.770" end="00:12:09.760" style="s2">you can just grab his leg and you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.230" end="00:12:11.410" style="s2">gently but firmly and say no and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.760" end="00:12:12.520" style="s2">child will keep trying to move forward</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.410" end="00:12:14.710" style="s2">because they&#39;re stubborn little</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.520" end="00:12:18.940" style="s2">blighters and you can continue to say no</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.710" end="00:12:21.339" style="s2">and if you persist with saying no then</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.940" end="00:12:25.240" style="s2">the child will eventually give up and</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.339" end="00:12:27.430" style="s2">sort of go limp now now and often the</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.240" end="00:12:28.930" style="s2">child will cry when you do that and of</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.430" end="00:12:31.270" style="s2">course that might make you feel guilty</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.930" end="00:12:32.890" style="s2">but what that means is that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.270" end="00:12:36.160" style="s2">effectively brought the behavior to a</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.890" end="00:12:38.440" style="s2">halt and if you do that ten times you</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.160" end="00:12:40.720" style="s2">got to watch your child and don&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.440" end="00:12:42.550" style="s2">them from exploring things that they</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.720" end="00:12:45.700" style="s2">need to explore and you want to use this</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.550" end="00:12:48.640" style="s2">sort of thing with judiciously you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.700" end="00:12:52.270" style="s2">grab them by the leg and say no and no</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.640" end="00:12:53.650" style="s2">no and wait until they give up usually</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.270" end="00:12:55.930" style="s2">they&#39;ll cry and then you can let them go</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.650" end="00:12:58.540" style="s2">and then soon after you do that about 10</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.930" end="00:13:00.540" style="s2">times soon then if you just say no with</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.540" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">the same tone of voice the child will</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.540" end="00:13:04.780" style="s2">generally what happens the child will</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:07.000" style="s2">immediately cry and then stop and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.780" end="00:13:09.400" style="s2">after about ten repeats of no without</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.000" end="00:13:12.040" style="s2">having the leg grabbed then no will just</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.400" end="00:13:14.500" style="s2">produce stopping of the behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.040" end="00:13:17.260" style="s2">that&#39;s unbelievably useful because as</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.500" end="00:13:19.930" style="s2">soon as you&#39;re you train your child to</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.260" end="00:13:22.839" style="s2">understand what no means then they</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.930" end="00:13:24.640" style="s2">really have free rein of the house in</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.839" end="00:13:26.470" style="s2">some sense with relative minimal</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.640" end="00:13:27.550" style="s2">supervision from you first of all they</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.470" end="00:13:29.050" style="s2">can learn what things they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.550" end="00:13:30.880" style="s2">supposed to get into and it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.050" end="00:13:33.490" style="s2">how fast children can learn that and how</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.880" end="00:13:35.170" style="s2">fast they can generalize to the class of</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.490" end="00:13:36.310" style="s2">things that they shouldn&#39;t get into like</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.170" end="00:13:37.930" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to teach them every</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.310" end="00:13:39.640" style="s2">single thing they can generalize very</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.930" end="00:13:43.570" style="s2">rapidly that&#39;s not much different than</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.640" end="00:13:45.310" style="s2">thinking but also once they are capable</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.570" end="00:13:47.920" style="s2">of understanding what no means you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.310" end="00:13:48.520" style="s2">an extremely potent means of helping</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.920" end="00:13:50.470" style="s2">them regulate</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.520" end="00:13:52.390" style="s2">their behavior with a minimum of</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.470" end="00:13:55.570" style="s2">intervention so that&#39;s unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.390" end="00:13:57.160" style="s2">useful so now let&#39;s say you have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.570" end="00:13:58.930" style="s2">two-year-old who&#39;s pretty contentious</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.160" end="00:14:00.580" style="s2">and two-year-olds are pretty contentious</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.930" end="00:14:02.740" style="s2">some of them in particular because about</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.580" end="00:14:04.990" style="s2">5% of two-year-olds most of them are</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.740" end="00:14:06.520" style="s2">male are quite aggressive by temperament</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.990" end="00:14:08.230" style="s2">and those are the ones that if you put</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.520" end="00:14:11.710" style="s2">with other two-year-olds will frequently</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.230" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">kick hit bite or steal not all kids are</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.710" end="00:14:15.370" style="s2">like that but some are and most of them</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:16.900" style="s2">get socialized out of that by the time</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.370" end="00:14:19.180" style="s2">they&#39;re about four now let&#39;s say you</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.900" end="00:14:22.450" style="s2">have and at two they also start to</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.180" end="00:14:24.040" style="s2">experiment with saying no back and also</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.450" end="00:14:25.960" style="s2">with misbehaving although they can do</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.040" end="00:14:27.270" style="s2">that even younger than that so if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.960" end="00:14:29.920" style="s2">have a two-year-old who&#39;s particularly</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.270" end="00:14:32.140" style="s2">rambunctious and who decides he isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.920" end="00:14:33.880" style="s2">going to listen to you we use he in this</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.140" end="00:14:36.550" style="s2">example because it&#39;s boys that are more</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.880" end="00:14:39.640" style="s2">likely to misbehave and not not listen</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.550" end="00:14:41.440" style="s2">you can you can pick them up and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.640" end="00:14:43.750" style="s2">know by the arms now you got to get your</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.440" end="00:14:45.190" style="s2">attitude right because you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.750" end="00:14:46.630" style="s2">be stupid you don&#39;t want to let your kid</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.190" end="00:14:47.920" style="s2">make you mad especially when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.630" end="00:14:50.170" style="s2">really little because you&#39;re really big</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.920" end="00:14:52.180" style="s2">and you can hurt them and so you got it</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.170" end="00:14:53.890" style="s2">you got to have us a clue that&#39;s why you</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.180" end="00:14:55.660" style="s2">want to get the rules of discipline and</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.890" end="00:14:57.340" style="s2">order the minimum rules of discipline</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.660" end="00:15:00.070" style="s2">and why you want to have a strategy but</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.340" end="00:15:01.960" style="s2">let&#39;s say your two-year-old is insisting</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.070" end="00:15:04.870" style="s2">upon doing something that you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.960" end="00:15:06.700" style="s2">them to do like inserting a fork into an</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.870" end="00:15:09.270" style="s2">electrical outlet and you just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.700" end="00:15:11.320" style="s2">have that and so you can say no</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.270" end="00:15:13.870" style="s2">hopefully you&#39;ve already done the no</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.320" end="00:15:15.520" style="s2">training that I recommended and and if</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.870" end="00:15:17.830" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t work what I recommend doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.520" end="00:15:20.050" style="s2">is picking the child up by the arms and</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.830" end="00:15:22.630" style="s2">then putting them on the steps say look</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.050" end="00:15:26.830" style="s2">you sit there until you&#39;re ready to</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.630" end="00:15:28.390" style="s2">listen now or usually the child will sit</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.830" end="00:15:30.160" style="s2">there and then the rule has to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.390" end="00:15:31.630" style="s2">something like you can get up as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.160" end="00:15:33.700" style="s2">you&#39;re ready to be a civilized human</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.630" end="00:15:36.370" style="s2">being again and you can refer to</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.700" end="00:15:38.140" style="s2">yourself your own attitude during a</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.370" end="00:15:40.150" style="s2">process like that because if the child</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.140" end="00:15:41.710" style="s2">does comply and sits on the steps and</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.150" end="00:15:43.840" style="s2">then comes and says I&#39;m ready to be good</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.710" end="00:15:45.940" style="s2">and you like him again you&#39;ve got to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.840" end="00:15:48.970" style="s2">honest about this then you can tell that</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.940" end="00:15:51.610" style="s2">he&#39;s honest in his decision to rejoin</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.970" end="00:15:53.080" style="s2">the civilized world now sometimes if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.610" end="00:15:55.390" style="s2">put a two-year-old that&#39;s particularly</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.080" end="00:15:56.740" style="s2">rambunctious on the staircase that as</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.390" end="00:15:59.110" style="s2">soon as you let go of their arms they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.740" end="00:16:00.760" style="s2">run off and that can be a game or it can</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.110" end="00:16:02.050" style="s2">just be an act of defiance and in that</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.760" end="00:16:03.760" style="s2">case then you go</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.050" end="00:16:05.500" style="s2">get him and he put him back on the steps</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.760" end="00:16:07.510" style="s2">and you do that several times if</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.500" end="00:16:10.060" style="s2">necessary and if that that becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.510" end="00:16:11.980" style="s2">game then you sit on the step and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.060" end="00:16:13.810" style="s2">hold him by the arms remember no anger</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.980" end="00:16:15.640" style="s2">cuz he&#39;s just - for God&#39;s sake you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.810" end="00:16:17.740" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to be angry just put him</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.640" end="00:16:21.070" style="s2">on the steps and hold him say look I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.740" end="00:16:22.899" style="s2">not letting you go until you sit there</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.070" end="00:16:24.459" style="s2">and behave and so if you hold him for a</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.899" end="00:16:26.230" style="s2">while he&#39;ll squirm and look away and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.459" end="00:16:27.790" style="s2">forth but you can get his attention if</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.230" end="00:16:28.899" style="s2">you&#39;re a little bit stubborn you hold</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.790" end="00:16:31.990" style="s2">him there and say you&#39;re gonna sit there</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.899" end="00:16:34.089" style="s2">till I decide that you can leave and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.990" end="00:16:35.680" style="s2">you hold them and he&#39;ll squirm and but</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.089" end="00:16:37.390" style="s2">you can outweigh them if you&#39;re patient</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.680" end="00:16:38.860" style="s2">but you got to make the time and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.390" end="00:16:40.810" style="s2">eventually he&#39;ll stop squirming and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.860" end="00:16:42.430" style="s2">can let him go and then you can sit</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.810" end="00:16:45.430" style="s2">there and watch him and when you think</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.430" end="00:16:47.110" style="s2">he&#39;s you know decided that he&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.430" end="00:16:48.430" style="s2">be a civilized creature then you can say</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.110" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">that&#39;s good and you can give him a pat</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.430" end="00:16:52.149" style="s2">on the head and you can say let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:53.529" style="s2">back and do what we&#39;re doing and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.149" end="00:16:56.230" style="s2">rule has to be you see that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.529" end="00:16:58.480" style="s2">punishment not only has to bring the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.230" end="00:17:00.610" style="s2">behavior to halt in the most merciful</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.480" end="00:17:03.459" style="s2">manner possible but that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.610" end="00:17:05.650" style="s2">effective but it also has to satisfy</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.459" end="00:17:08.130" style="s2">your need for order and justice so that</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.650" end="00:17:10.630" style="s2">you don&#39;t carry resentment and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.130" end="00:17:12.550" style="s2">irritation about the child&#39;s misbehavior</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.630" end="00:17:14.199" style="s2">forward with you because you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.550" end="00:17:16.030" style="s2">to kid yourself about what sort of nice</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.199" end="00:17:18.040" style="s2">person you are you&#39;re not nearly as nice</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.030" end="00:17:21.850" style="s2">a person as you think and no one likes</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.040" end="00:17:23.949" style="s2">to be brought down the authority</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.850" end="00:17:27.690" style="s2">hierarchy by a recalcitrant two-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.949" end="00:17:30.370" style="s2">so in almost all circumstances those</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.690" end="00:17:32.830" style="s2">processes will suffice</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.370" end="00:17:34.210" style="s2">there&#39;s other disciplinary strategies</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.830" end="00:17:36.340" style="s2">that you can use too that are more</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.210" end="00:17:39.730" style="s2">positive I mean one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.340" end="00:17:41.140" style="s2">you can do for example if you&#39;re let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.730" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">say you want to get your child to go to</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.140" end="00:17:45.100" style="s2">bed which is a really good idea you</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:46.870" style="s2">should set a stable bedtime for your</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.100" end="00:17:50.230" style="s2">child and I would say if they&#39;re under 4</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.870" end="00:17:51.490" style="s2">it should be around 8 or 7 or something</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.230" end="00:17:53.169" style="s2">like that because you want to have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.490" end="00:17:54.570" style="s2">life and you want to have a life with</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.169" end="00:17:57.730" style="s2">your wife so that you don&#39;t end up</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.570" end="00:17:59.620" style="s2">hating your child and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.730" end="00:18:01.600" style="s2">things you can do if you want to train</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.620" end="00:18:03.940" style="s2">your child to go to bed at 8:00 so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.600" end="00:18:06.070" style="s2">he&#39;s not going to bed until 10:00 right</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.940" end="00:18:08.530" style="s2">now and you want to fix that so you say</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.070" end="00:18:10.530" style="s2">okay go to the grocery store or a little</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.530" end="00:18:12.910" style="s2">convenience store buy ten little gifts</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.530" end="00:18:14.620" style="s2">and it can be cheap kids don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.910" end="00:18:16.390" style="s2">they&#39;re not very bright you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.620" end="00:18:17.770" style="s2">fool them so by 10:00</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.390" end="00:18:20.440" style="s2">things that you think your kid would</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.770" end="00:18:21.880" style="s2">like and wrap them up and then put them</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.440" end="00:18:24.880" style="s2">up on the shelf where he can see them</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.880" end="00:18:26.440" style="s2">but can&#39;t get out them then you say look</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:29.680" style="s2">kid I&#39;m gonna put you to bed at 9:30</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.440" end="00:18:32.650" style="s2">tonight and if you don&#39;t get out of bed</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.680" end="00:18:34.690" style="s2">then I&#39;m going to give you one of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.650" end="00:18:38.110" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna give you one of these gifts in</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.690" end="00:18:39.460" style="s2">the morning so or if the or you can do</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.110" end="00:18:40.690" style="s2">it another way too if the child is</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.460" end="00:18:42.070" style="s2">always giving you a rough time about</p>

<p begin="00:18:42.070" end="00:18:46.480" style="s2">you can say look if you&#39;re if you put on</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.110" end="00:18:48.220" style="s2">your pajamas without fussing and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.480" end="00:18:50.650" style="s2">climb into bed then they&#39;ll give you one</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.220" end="00:18:52.090" style="s2">of these little gifts and so then if</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.650" end="00:18:54.130" style="s2">that works then the child can have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.090" end="00:18:55.840" style="s2">little gift and he&#39;s in bed at 9:30 and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.130" end="00:18:57.430" style="s2">then you can make it 9:00 and then you</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.840" end="00:18:59.200" style="s2">can make it 8:30 and then you can make</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.430" end="00:19:00.970" style="s2">it 8:00 and those are called that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.200" end="00:19:02.590" style="s2">called successive approximation right</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.970" end="00:19:03.910" style="s2">you hit the target you specify the</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.590" end="00:19:07.240" style="s2">target that you want the child to</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.910" end="00:19:09.790" style="s2">achieve and then use small rewards not</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.240" end="00:19:11.860" style="s2">too often in order to attain that goal</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.790" end="00:19:13.420" style="s2">and those are unbelievably effective</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.860" end="00:19:16.600" style="s2">strategies and they can actually be</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.420" end="00:19:18.310" style="s2">pretty fun but I would say the advice to</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.600" end="00:19:20.580" style="s2">not let your child do anything that</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.310" end="00:19:23.890" style="s2">makes you dislike them is really really</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.580" end="00:19:25.420" style="s2">useful you want to talk this over with</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.890" end="00:19:27.780" style="s2">your partner too so that you have your</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.420" end="00:19:30.070" style="s2">disciplinary strategies and your rules</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.780" end="00:19:33.340" style="s2">talked out so that you don&#39;t work across</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.070" end="00:19:36.340" style="s2">purposes to one another so okay so</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.340" end="00:19:38.770" style="s2">that&#39;s probably good enough for that can</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.340" end="00:19:40.420" style="s2">we take the biblical Andrew Wells asks</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.770" end="00:19:42.760" style="s2">can we take the biblical story seriously</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.420" end="00:19:44.980" style="s2">enough with us without also keeping</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.760" end="00:19:47.140" style="s2">biblical traditions what&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:19:47.140" end="00:19:55.570" style="s2">church-going I think we could take the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.410" end="00:19:59.070" style="s2">biblical stories seriously enough but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.570" end="00:20:01.690" style="s2">don&#39;t think that it&#39;s particularly easy</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.070" end="00:20:03.250" style="s2">the traditions bind the community</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.690" end="00:20:05.590" style="s2">together now I&#39;m saying now and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.250" end="00:20:07.600" style="s2">go to church you know and the reason I</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.590" end="00:20:09.730" style="s2">don&#39;t go to church is because well it</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.600" end="00:20:11.980" style="s2">drives me crazy to speak frankly I</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.730" end="00:20:14.830" style="s2">haven&#39;t been able to sit in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.980" end="00:20:17.020" style="s2">like that ever since I was while ever</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.830" end="00:20:20.680" style="s2">really that&#39;s really the truth and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.020" end="00:20:23.410" style="s2">ever I&#39;m not convinced that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.680" end="00:20:25.510" style="s2">good thing because I do believe and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.410" end="00:20:27.690" style="s2">had good conversations about this with</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.510" end="00:20:29.350" style="s2">Jonathan pazzo I do believe that</p>

<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:37.870" style="s2">ethics is actually a necessary thing and</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.419" end="00:20:39.309" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m atoning for my past sins by</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.870" end="00:20:40.419" style="s2">doing these biblical lectures at the</p>

<p begin="00:20:40.419" end="00:20:46.539" style="s2">communal so and then because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.240" end="00:20:48.820" style="s2">also something about going where a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.539" end="00:20:51.640" style="s2">of other people are to reaffirm your</p>

<p begin="00:20:51.640" end="00:20:56.200" style="s2">also all aiming out that&#39;s that&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.710" end="00:20:57.340" style="s2">some power in it and and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.200" end="00:20:59.470" style="s2">that that&#39;s something that we should</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.340" end="00:21:01.929" style="s2">forego I think it&#39;s dangerous I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.470" end="00:21:03.700" style="s2">look even if you&#39;re cynical about Church</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.929" end="00:21:06.909" style="s2">and I guess I would put myself in that</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.700" end="00:21:10.179" style="s2">category it&#39;s it&#39;s certainly the case</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.909" end="00:21:12.760" style="s2">that communal church-going in the 1950s</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.179" end="00:21:14.650" style="s2">a provided the average person with at</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.760" end="00:21:19.980" style="s2">least an hour a week where they were</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.650" end="00:21:23.350" style="s2">contemplating no matter how poorly the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.980" end="00:21:24.909" style="s2">purpose of ethics in life and and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.350" end="00:21:26.559" style="s2">idea of a higher purpose and a higher</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.909" end="00:21:28.090" style="s2">meaning in life and you got to think</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.559" end="00:21:30.280" style="s2">that spending an hour a week thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.090" end="00:21:33.760" style="s2">about that is better than never doing it</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.280" end="00:21:35.470" style="s2">at all so I don&#39;t know how to that</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.760" end="00:21:37.450" style="s2">tradition can be revivified in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.470" end="00:21:39.250" style="s2">meaningful way but I think it&#39;s I really</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.450" end="00:21:41.140" style="s2">do think it&#39;s a catastrophe that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.250" end="00:21:43.690" style="s2">lost it because we don&#39;t have a center</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.140" end="00:21:45.340" style="s2">an ethical center that holds our</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.690" end="00:21:47.140" style="s2">community together and the consequence</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.340" end="00:21:53.860" style="s2">of that is that we&#39;re fragmenting quite</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.140" end="00:21:55.030" style="s2">badly so Edwin rajkumar or says I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.860" end="00:21:57.100" style="s2">wondering what your thoughts are on</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.030" end="00:22:00.130" style="s2">meditation and if you practice it</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.100" end="00:22:05.169" style="s2">yourself well that&#39;s a good question I</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.130" end="00:22:07.990" style="s2">think I practice it a lot and look when</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.169" end="00:22:10.870" style="s2">I listen to someone or even when I</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.990" end="00:22:12.520" style="s2">listen to myself but let&#39;s say when I</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.870" end="00:22:14.770" style="s2">listen to someone in my clinical</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.520" end="00:22:19.120" style="s2">practice I think I do it in a meditative</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.770" end="00:22:21.220" style="s2">way in that I sit and listen and I wait</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.120" end="00:22:24.039" style="s2">for thoughts to appear rather than</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.220" end="00:22:27.789" style="s2">voluntarily thinking so I clear my mind</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.039" end="00:22:30.100" style="s2">I try to keep my agendas off the table</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.789" end="00:22:32.230" style="s2">my agendas whatever they are except that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.100" end="00:22:34.419" style="s2">I want the best for my client in in this</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.230" end="00:22:36.760" style="s2">hour and the best say by their</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.419" end="00:22:38.350" style="s2">definition and mine jointly decided</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.760" end="00:22:40.360" style="s2">because that&#39;s all part of discussion</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.350" end="00:22:41.700" style="s2">and then I listened very carefully and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.360" end="00:22:44.860" style="s2">wait for</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.700" end="00:22:47.530" style="s2">the reactions that occur within me and</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.860" end="00:22:49.000" style="s2">then I share them and I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.530" end="00:22:50.710" style="s2">meditative exercise I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.000" end="00:22:52.720" style="s2">different than voluntary thinking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.710" end="00:22:55.660" style="s2">like you know there&#39;s a statement in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.720" end="00:22:58.230" style="s2">New Testament that says knock and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.660" end="00:23:04.390" style="s2">door will open ask and you will receive</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.230" end="00:23:06.210" style="s2">now that&#39;s a meditative that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.390" end="00:23:09.460" style="s2">a call to a meditative mode of existence</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.210" end="00:23:11.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like well often what I do for</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.460" end="00:23:13.360" style="s2">example if I want to solve a problem is</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.320" end="00:23:16.059" style="s2">I if I have a problem with my own</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.360" end="00:23:18.940" style="s2">behavior maybe I&#39;m having problems in my</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.059" end="00:23:21.490" style="s2">family as I&#39;ll go sit on a bed or a</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.940" end="00:23:24.040" style="s2">chair and I&#39;ll think okay I would like</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.490" end="00:23:25.450" style="s2">an answer to this I would like to know</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.040" end="00:23:28.840" style="s2">what the answer to this and I&#39;m willing</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.450" end="00:23:31.059" style="s2">to accept whatever answer is appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.840" end="00:23:32.500" style="s2">and because usually you get an answer</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.059" end="00:23:33.820" style="s2">that you don&#39;t like right if it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.500" end="00:23:36.420" style="s2">answer it&#39;s not something that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.820" end="00:23:39.160" style="s2">gonna be all that happy about and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.420" end="00:23:41.440" style="s2">magically so to speak an answer appears</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.160" end="00:23:45.340" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s a meditative practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.440" end="00:23:48.540" style="s2">and the meditative practice is part to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.340" end="00:23:52.540" style="s2">clear your mind of your proximal</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.540" end="00:23:56.020" style="s2">concerns and to concentrate more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.540" end="00:23:58.600" style="s2">on what might be regarded as eternally</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.020" end="00:24:01.390" style="s2">true and to open yourself up for a</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.600" end="00:24:03.790" style="s2">revelation in relationship to what is</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.390" end="00:24:06.400" style="s2">eternally true and I found that</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.790" end="00:24:09.670" style="s2">incredibly effective and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.400" end="00:24:13.870" style="s2">you can live like that you just have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.670" end="00:24:15.940" style="s2">abandon your proximal pursuits now in my</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.870" end="00:24:18.160" style="s2">new book again I wrote a chapter about</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.940" end="00:24:20.679" style="s2">that called do what is meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.160" end="00:24:23.110" style="s2">what not what is expedient and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.679" end="00:24:24.640" style="s2">bit of a meditation on the Sermon on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.110" end="00:24:26.350" style="s2">Mount I would say because the essential</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.640" end="00:24:28.510" style="s2">message in the Sermon on the Mount which</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.350" end="00:24:30.160" style="s2">is the foundational document of Western</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.510" end="00:24:33.490" style="s2">civilization as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.160" end="00:24:36.820" style="s2">essentially is that you should orient</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.490" end="00:24:40.059" style="s2">yourself ultimately towards the highest</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.820" end="00:24:41.920" style="s2">good that you can conceive and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.059" end="00:24:44.020" style="s2">tried to formulate that and I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.920" end="00:24:46.570" style="s2">it earlier in this Q&amp;A that the highest</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.020" end="00:24:47.830" style="s2">good that you can conceive should be</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.570" end="00:24:50.260" style="s2">something like what would be good for</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.830" end="00:24:52.420" style="s2">you now and good for you tomorrow and</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.260" end="00:24:54.580" style="s2">next week and next month and next year</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.420" end="00:24:55.719" style="s2">so good for you and all the future used</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.580" end="00:24:58.629" style="s2">that might exist</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.719" end="00:25:01.179" style="s2">and also at the same time good for your</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.629" end="00:25:04.299" style="s2">family and good for the community</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.179" end="00:25:06.820" style="s2">you know conceptualized narrowly and</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.299" end="00:25:08.289" style="s2">broadly and good now for your family in</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.820" end="00:25:09.940" style="s2">the community and then also into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.289" end="00:25:12.159" style="s2">future so it&#39;s something like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.940" end="00:25:14.709" style="s2">it&#39;s a balance of goods that stretches</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.159" end="00:25:16.479" style="s2">across time you you have to decide if</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.709" end="00:25:18.759" style="s2">that&#39;s what you really want and my sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.479" end="00:25:20.799" style="s2">would be you haven&#39;t got anything better</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.759" end="00:25:22.179" style="s2">to aim at and that you should aim at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.799" end="00:25:24.820" style="s2">best thing that you can aim at for a</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.179" end="00:25:26.139" style="s2">whole bunch of reasons is one is if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.820" end="00:25:28.269" style="s2">don&#39;t aim at something you&#39;re certainly</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.139" end="00:25:29.709" style="s2">not going to attain it and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.269" end="00:25:31.209" style="s2">going to aim at something why not aim</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.709" end="00:25:33.549" style="s2">for the best thing that you can think of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.209" end="00:25:34.959" style="s2">and if you do aim for the best thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.549" end="00:25:36.879" style="s2">that you can think of and you make any</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.959" end="00:25:39.609" style="s2">progress whatsoever it&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.879" end="00:25:41.169" style="s2">exciting and if you do aim for the best</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.609" end="00:25:43.269" style="s2">thing you can think of and you make some</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.169" end="00:25:45.309" style="s2">progress then it&#39;s very life-affirming</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.269" end="00:25:47.409" style="s2">and validating and that sort of quells</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.309" end="00:25:50.829" style="s2">your anxiety and your existential pain</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.409" end="00:25:53.019" style="s2">and so you get yourself properly</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.829" end="00:25:55.479" style="s2">oriented and and the Sermon on the Mount</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.019" end="00:25:57.969" style="s2">basically suggests that you do that by</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.479" end="00:25:59.469" style="s2">orienting yourself towards God and for</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.969" end="00:26:02.259" style="s2">the psychological purposes we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.469" end="00:26:04.599" style="s2">conceptualize God as the highest good</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.259" end="00:26:07.149" style="s2">that you can conceive of and then you</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.599" end="00:26:08.440" style="s2">concentrate on the day and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.149" end="00:26:10.749" style="s2">get up in the morning and you can think</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.440" end="00:26:13.899" style="s2">well I want the best possible thing to</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.749" end="00:26:16.869" style="s2">happen and so what is it that I should</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.899" end="00:26:19.059" style="s2">do to serve that and if you ask that</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.869" end="00:26:20.889" style="s2">genuinely and that&#39;s in a meditative way</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.059" end="00:26:22.809" style="s2">I will say you get an answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.889" end="00:26:24.339" style="s2">right away now the problem is is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.809" end="00:26:26.379" style="s2">it&#39;s usually an answer that involves</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.339" end="00:26:28.479" style="s2">some kind of sacrifice it means that</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.379" end="00:26:30.669" style="s2">instead of doing what you would like to</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.479" end="00:26:32.859" style="s2">do impulsively right now you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.669" end="00:26:34.209" style="s2">likely to have to go do something you</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.859" end="00:26:38.019" style="s2">know that you&#39;ve been avoiding and</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.209" end="00:26:40.570" style="s2">that&#39;s difficult but if you do that then</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.019" end="00:26:43.599" style="s2">you&#39;ll have some you know you can also</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.570" end="00:26:45.070" style="s2">leave in your day with some pleasure to</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.599" end="00:26:46.989" style="s2">reward yourself for doing something</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.070" end="00:26:48.909" style="s2">difficult but if you if you live that</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.989" end="00:26:50.559" style="s2">way then I think that your your house</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.909" end="00:26:53.320" style="s2">stays clean and your family stays</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.559" end="00:26:55.389" style="s2">organized and the state doesn&#39;t Rock and</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.320" end="00:26:59.739" style="s2">all that and all that&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.389" end="00:27:01.029" style="s2">extremely good so anonymous says how do</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.739" end="00:27:03.669" style="s2">I deal with the fact that I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.029" end="00:27:07.269" style="s2">pedophile and should I tell my family</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.669" end="00:27:09.190" style="s2">and friends it I can&#39;t answer the second</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.269" end="00:27:10.840" style="s2">part of that should I tell my family and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.190" end="00:27:13.030" style="s2">friends because I don&#39;t know your family</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.840" end="00:27:15.190" style="s2">and friends and I don&#39;t know how you</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.030" end="00:27:17.290" style="s2">would go about telling them so I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.190" end="00:27:18.760" style="s2">make a piece of I can&#39;t make any advice</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.290" end="00:27:21.850" style="s2">about that or I can&#39;t offer you any</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.760" end="00:27:24.040" style="s2">advice about that I would say that if</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.850" end="00:27:25.870" style="s2">you have the opportunity you should</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.040" end="00:27:28.680" style="s2">probably go speak to a counselor or</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.870" end="00:27:31.090" style="s2">priest or someone that you trust</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.680" end="00:27:33.040" style="s2">because you&#39;re going to have to figure</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.090" end="00:27:34.720" style="s2">out how to deal with that and but you</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.040" end="00:27:36.250" style="s2">should also maybe and that&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.720" end="00:27:38.230" style="s2">best I can do with that I&#39;m not an</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.250" end="00:27:40.570" style="s2">expert in the treatment of pedophilia</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.230" end="00:27:43.870" style="s2">and so I can&#39;t offer you any great</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.570" end="00:27:44.740" style="s2">clinical wisdom but I would say that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.870" end="00:27:47.500" style="s2">need a plan</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.740" end="00:27:49.690" style="s2">you need to plan and you have to and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.500" end="00:27:52.330" style="s2">would include in that plan the</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.690" end="00:27:54.460" style="s2">absolutely catastrophic consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.330" end="00:27:55.840" style="s2">not regulating that behavior properly</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.460" end="00:27:59.110" style="s2">and you should really think it through</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.840" end="00:28:00.820" style="s2">because that pedophilic impulse let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.110" end="00:28:03.460" style="s2">say could lead you into seven different</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.820" end="00:28:05.910" style="s2">sorts of Hell you and whoever you happen</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.460" end="00:28:09.070" style="s2">to tangle up in it and you might want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.910" end="00:28:11.920" style="s2">avoid sever and if you might want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.070" end="00:28:13.900" style="s2">avoid seven different seven different</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.920" end="00:28:15.730" style="s2">forms of Hell and in order to do that</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.900" end="00:28:17.470" style="s2">given the proclivity that you describe</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.730" end="00:28:20.200" style="s2">then you&#39;re gonna have to have a plan</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.470" end="00:28:21.460" style="s2">now look lots of people have impulses</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.200" end="00:28:23.530" style="s2">that they have a hard time controlling</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.460" end="00:28:25.690" style="s2">you know alcoholics can&#39;t drink alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.530" end="00:28:27.760" style="s2">and cocaine addicts can&#39;t take cocaine</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.690" end="00:28:30.460" style="s2">and most people can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.760" end="00:28:34.450" style="s2">what manifest untrammeled sexual</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.460" end="00:28:37.120" style="s2">behavior and so and certainly within the</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.450" end="00:28:39.430" style="s2">capacity of human beings to regulate</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.120" end="00:28:41.380" style="s2">impulses that aren&#39;t in there or others</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.430" end="00:28:43.480" style="s2">best interests so I wouldn&#39;t regard it</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.380" end="00:28:44.890" style="s2">as a hopeless pursuit but it does seem</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.480" end="00:28:46.420" style="s2">to me that it&#39;s something that you might</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.890" end="00:28:50.080" style="s2">want to talk to someone you trust about</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.420" end="00:28:53.800" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s a complicated issue</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.080" end="00:28:56.380" style="s2">and it&#39;s a proclivity that&#39;s likely to</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.800" end="00:29:01.150" style="s2">lead you in a direction that would be</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.380" end="00:29:03.190" style="s2">let&#39;s call it suboptimal I was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.150" end="00:29:05.760" style="s2">what you thought of Santa Claus if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.190" end="00:29:08.380" style="s2">a healthy thing for parents to practice</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.760" end="00:29:11.920" style="s2">what&#39;s the psychological impact of lying</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.380" end="00:29:14.170" style="s2">to your child look I think that I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.920" end="00:29:16.750" style="s2">lying is the wrong way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.170" end="00:29:19.360" style="s2">this Santa Claus is a game it&#39;s a game</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.750" end="00:29:22.440" style="s2">of pretend and children play games have</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.360" end="00:29:24.539" style="s2">pretend all the time you know so</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.440" end="00:29:28.049" style="s2">I don&#39;t see any harm in it at all now</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.539" end="00:29:30.779" style="s2">you know you don&#39;t want to prolong that</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.049" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">belief beyond its natural end point but</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.779" end="00:29:35.100" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a massive game and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:37.529" style="s2">lovely game and I don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.100" end="00:29:40.740" style="s2">there&#39;s anything harmful in it in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.529" end="00:29:43.470" style="s2">least so now what&#39;s the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.740" end="00:29:44.789" style="s2">impact of lying to your child let&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.470" end="00:29:47.340" style="s2">can think about that more generally</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.789" end="00:29:50.220" style="s2">don&#39;t lie to your children don&#39;t lie</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.340" end="00:29:53.820" style="s2">period lying is a really bad idea it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.220" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">really bad idea it never works you might</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.820" end="00:29:57.059" style="s2">think it works but that&#39;s only because</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:29:59.340" style="s2">you&#39;re blind to the consequences isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.059" end="00:30:01.259" style="s2">probably willfully blind plus it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.340" end="00:30:03.090" style="s2">terrible weight you know if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.259" end="00:30:04.620" style="s2">don&#39;t lie there&#39;s a lot fewer things to</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.090" end="00:30:10.230" style="s2">keep track of your life is a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.620" end="00:30:12.539" style="s2">pristine and crystalline and and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.230" end="00:30:14.840" style="s2">things that you that come your way maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.539" end="00:30:17.669" style="s2">you deserve in some small measure and</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.840" end="00:30:19.110" style="s2">it&#39;s a bad idea to lie now but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.669" end="00:30:20.789" style="s2">think it&#39;s a bad idea to play pretend</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.110" end="00:30:23.549" style="s2">games with your children I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.789" end="00:30:25.590" style="s2">okay you once mentioned you were</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.549" end="00:30:27.720" style="s2">planning on making an IQ test available</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.590" end="00:30:30.840" style="s2">alongside the big five aspects scale one</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.720" end="00:30:33.480" style="s2">is that in the works yes we have an IQ</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.840" end="00:30:35.940" style="s2">test that we use for business testing</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.480" end="00:30:38.669" style="s2">although we haven&#39;t made it available</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.940" end="00:30:41.789" style="s2">publicly yet it is in the works but not</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.669" end="00:30:44.490" style="s2">for a while what we&#39;re doing instead and</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.789" end="00:30:45.840" style="s2">that&#39;s because it has to be while</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.490" end="00:30:48.809" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of work we still have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.840" end="00:30:50.370" style="s2">do on it to generate the reports so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.809" end="00:30:52.259" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be truly useable to</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.370" end="00:30:55.460" style="s2">people now I would say is about three or</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.259" end="00:30:57.779" style="s2">four months work is necessary to do that</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.460" end="00:30:59.549" style="s2">what we are doing right now with the Big</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.779" end="00:31:03.059" style="s2">Five aspect scale though so that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.549" end="00:31:05.460" style="s2">understand myself calm is producing a</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.059" end="00:31:07.110" style="s2">dyad version and so we&#39;re working on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.460" end="00:31:08.759" style="s2">boyfriend-girlfriend version right now</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.110" end="00:31:11.159" style="s2">so what that&#39;ll mean is that when you go</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.759" end="00:31:12.870" style="s2">there and you do your personality test</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.159" end="00:31:15.000" style="s2">and your girlfriend say does her</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.870" end="00:31:18.000" style="s2">personality test that you&#39;ll both be</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.000" end="00:31:20.159" style="s2">able to generate a dual report that</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.000" end="00:31:21.720" style="s2">describes the similarities and</p>

<p begin="00:31:21.720" end="00:31:25.740" style="s2">and where you&#39;re likely to see</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.000" end="00:31:27.480" style="s2">eye-to-eye on things where you&#39;re likely</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.740" end="00:31:29.100" style="s2">to differ and what that&#39;s going to mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.480" end="00:31:30.899" style="s2">and what you might want to do about it</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.100" end="00:31:32.879" style="s2">if you know what you might be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.899" end="00:31:35.200" style="s2">about it and this we&#39;re hoping this will</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.879" end="00:31:36.880" style="s2">be really useful because temper</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.200" end="00:31:38.260" style="s2">mental differences are a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.880" end="00:31:40.120" style="s2">reason that people have a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.260" end="00:31:41.740" style="s2">getting along that and complete</p>

<p begin="00:31:45.580" end="00:31:49.179" style="s2">different issue I want to build a</p>

<p begin="00:31:49.179" end="00:31:53.470" style="s2">some point in the future that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.919" end="00:31:55.240" style="s2">our future plan but the next development</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.470" end="00:31:57.070" style="s2">plan is to well there&#39;s two of them is</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.240" end="00:31:59.139" style="s2">to get the high school version of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.070" end="00:32:02.320" style="s2">self authoring program up and running</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.139" end="00:32:04.690" style="s2">and that my programmer keeps promising</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.320" end="00:32:06.370" style="s2">it in two weeks and I these things</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.690" end="00:32:07.779" style="s2">always take longer than expected but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.370" end="00:32:11.500" style="s2">sure we&#39;ll get it out in the first</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.779" end="00:32:13.630" style="s2">quarter of 2018 and then also the diad</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.500" end="00:32:15.610" style="s2">version of the big five aspect scale</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.630" end="00:32:18.669" style="s2">that should be out in the first quarter</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.610" end="00:32:20.080" style="s2">of 2018 as well and then I&#39;m not sure if</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.669" end="00:32:21.970" style="s2">the IQ test will be next on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.080" end="00:32:24.940" style="s2">development track see one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.970" end="00:32:29.909" style="s2">we&#39;d like to do with understand myself</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.940" end="00:32:34.059" style="s2">is to expand it out into a career</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.909" end="00:32:36.010" style="s2">planning process because look at it this</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.059" end="00:32:38.260" style="s2">way you know if you have an IQ of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.010" end="00:32:40.059" style="s2">hundred which is the average IQ so that</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.260" end="00:32:42.159" style="s2">would place you sort of in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.059" end="00:32:44.260" style="s2">the average high school class being a</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.159" end="00:32:45.610" style="s2">lawyer is probably not a great career</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.260" end="00:32:47.769" style="s2">choice for you unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.610" end="00:32:49.299" style="s2">unbelievably conscientious because</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.769" end="00:32:51.880" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be competing with people</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.299" end="00:32:53.649" style="s2">who have a verbal facility say and a</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.880" end="00:32:55.960" style="s2">problem-solving capacity that far</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.649" end="00:33:00.370" style="s2">exceeds yours and you&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.960" end="00:33:03.399" style="s2">work like mad too to just be reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.370" end="00:33:06.360" style="s2">competent and so what seems to be more</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.399" end="00:33:10.029" style="s2">logical is to take a good look at your</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.360" end="00:33:12.039" style="s2">intellectual prowess as given because</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.029" end="00:33:14.970" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very powerfully biologically</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.039" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">influenced and to pick a domain of of</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.970" end="00:33:21.309" style="s2">career that you could excel in because</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.360" end="00:33:22.330" style="s2">why not pick a domain that you can excel</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.309" end="00:33:24.539" style="s2">and there&#39;s lots of different things</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.330" end="00:33:26.769" style="s2">that you can be and so you want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.539" end="00:33:28.269" style="s2">consult your temperament so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.769" end="00:33:29.830" style="s2">agreeable then you probably want to work</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.269" end="00:33:31.000" style="s2">with people and if you&#39;re disagreeable</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.830" end="00:33:32.470" style="s2">you probably want to work with things</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.000" end="00:33:34.059" style="s2">and if you&#39;re extroverted you want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.470" end="00:33:35.860" style="s2">have a job that involves sales and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.059" end="00:33:37.450" style="s2">social activities if you&#39;re introverted</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.860" end="00:33:38.980" style="s2">you want to work alone and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.450" end="00:33:40.899" style="s2">open you need to do something creative</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.980" end="00:33:42.940" style="s2">and entrepreneurial and so on so you</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.899" end="00:33:45.460" style="s2">have to consult your temperament to see</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.940" end="00:33:46.870" style="s2">where you would be properly slotted and</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.460" end="00:33:48.570" style="s2">then you have to consider your</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.870" end="00:33:50.009" style="s2">intelligence so</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.570" end="00:33:53.130" style="s2">you can find a niche where you&#39;re most</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.009" end="00:33:56.429" style="s2">likely to excel and those niches exist</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.130" end="00:33:58.289" style="s2">so we&#39;d like to combine the IQ test with</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.429" end="00:34:00.330" style="s2">the big five aspect scale so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.289" end="00:34:02.580" style="s2">give people reasonable career advice</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.330" end="00:34:05.070" style="s2">it&#39;s being a long-term goal and so those</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.580" end="00:34:06.990" style="s2">are all on the table and I have good</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.070" end="00:34:08.609" style="s2">program team working on them but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.990" end="00:34:10.020" style="s2">very complicated things and they take a</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.609" end="00:34:12.929" style="s2">lot of time and we don&#39;t want to make a</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.020" end="00:34:14.280" style="s2">mistake and all of that so but maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.929" end="00:34:15.990" style="s2">couple&#39;s version and the high school</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.280" end="00:34:17.970" style="s2">version of the the couple&#39;s version of</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.990" end="00:34:19.829" style="s2">the personality test and the high school</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.970" end="00:34:23.929" style="s2">version of the self authoring in this</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.829" end="00:34:26.069" style="s2">quarter and maybe maybe the career</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.929" end="00:34:27.899" style="s2">counseling version of the big five</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.069" end="00:34:28.470" style="s2">aspect scale in the next year that would</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.899" end="00:34:30.960" style="s2">be lovely</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.470" end="00:34:34.290" style="s2">that&#39;s probably overly optimistic for</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.960" end="00:34:35.819" style="s2">the second part but you often give</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.290" end="00:34:37.649" style="s2">advice to young adults to help them</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.819" end="00:34:39.690" style="s2">avoid some of the pitfalls of life any</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.649" end="00:34:43.319" style="s2">advice for those of us who are 40-plus</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.690" end="00:34:45.599" style="s2">who have already faltered look first</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.319" end="00:34:48.480" style="s2">Graham this is Graham everybody who is</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.599" end="00:34:51.750" style="s2">40 pluses has already faltered but but</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.480" end="00:34:53.369" style="s2">I&#39;m presuming that you mean faulted in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.750" end="00:34:57.540" style="s2">manner that appears to you to be above</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.369" end="00:34:59.579" style="s2">that above the average right well what I</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.540" end="00:35:00.930" style="s2">would really recommend is I think that</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.579" end="00:35:02.160" style="s2">you should if you haven&#39;t already you</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.930" end="00:35:03.720" style="s2">should go do the future authoring</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.160" end="00:35:05.760" style="s2">program and maybe the past authoring</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.720" end="00:35:09.300" style="s2">program too because you should figure</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.760" end="00:35:12.150" style="s2">out exactly how you faltered like what</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.300" end="00:35:14.460" style="s2">exactly did you do wrong by your own by</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.150" end="00:35:16.440" style="s2">your own analysis right I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.460" end="00:35:17.970" style="s2">well what social rules did you break</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.440" end="00:35:20.730" style="s2">although that&#39;s not a bad initial</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.970" end="00:35:22.560" style="s2">guideline it&#39;s like so in the self</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.730" end="00:35:24.180" style="s2">authoring suite there&#39;s a past authoring</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.560" end="00:35:26.400" style="s2">module and it asks you to break your</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.180" end="00:35:28.980" style="s2">life into seven epochs and then to</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.400" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">consider the emotionally significant or</p>

<p begin="00:35:36.329" end="00:35:40.800" style="s2">might want to figure out is well when</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.010" end="00:35:44.069" style="s2">you say that you faltered like what do</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.800" end="00:35:45.510" style="s2">you mean exactly and I mean exactly go</p>

<p begin="00:35:57.869" end="00:36:02.160" style="s2">right so that you can orient yourself</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:02.340" style="s2">now and then you want to think and this</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.160" end="00:36:04.110" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.340" end="00:36:07.950" style="s2">why we built a future authoring program</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.110" end="00:36:10.830" style="s2">well look you got 40 years left man so</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.950" end="00:36:13.230" style="s2">what do you want them to be like so what</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.830" end="00:36:16.020" style="s2">do you want to Emad at least how are you</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.230" end="00:36:18.930" style="s2">gonna minimize the misery if nothing</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.020" end="00:36:20.550" style="s2">else and so you need a plan and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.930" end="00:36:23.420" style="s2">what you need to do is to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.550" end="00:36:25.950" style="s2">to work day to day so that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.420" end="00:36:28.400" style="s2">incremental II approach that plan so I</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.950" end="00:36:31.260" style="s2">have another chapter in this new book</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.400" end="00:36:33.030" style="s2">called compare yourself to who you were</p>

<p begin="00:36:33.030" end="00:36:38.790" style="s2">else is today that&#39;s really a useful</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.660" end="00:36:40.650" style="s2">psychological stance for someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.790" end="00:36:42.270" style="s2">thirty and over in particular talk</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.650" end="00:36:43.740" style="s2">twenty year olds can still kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.270" end="00:36:45.030" style="s2">compare themselves to other twenty year</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.740" end="00:36:47.460" style="s2">olds because all twenty year olds in</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.030" end="00:36:48.510" style="s2">some way are the same but forty year</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.460" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">olds are really different from each</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.510" end="00:36:54.530" style="s2">other and so our thirty year olds for</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.920" end="00:36:57.240" style="s2">that matter so you might think okay well</p>

<p begin="00:36:57.240" end="00:37:01.560" style="s2">for for ceasing to falter you could wake</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.270" end="00:37:02.970" style="s2">up in the morning or you could do this</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.560" end="00:37:04.620" style="s2">at night before you go to bed and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.970" end="00:37:07.340" style="s2">could think okay look I want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.620" end="00:37:11.310" style="s2">structure my day tomorrow so that when I</p>

<p begin="00:37:11.310" end="00:37:17.910" style="s2">slightly better order than it was when I</p>

<p begin="00:37:17.910" end="00:37:22.980" style="s2">better because incremental progress is</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.160" end="00:37:27.150" style="s2">massively massively effective because it</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.980" end="00:37:31.020" style="s2">bears exponential fruit just like a bank</p>

<p begin="00:37:31.020" end="00:37:34.710" style="s2">compounds with time so you can get up in</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.510" end="00:37:36.480" style="s2">the morning and you can think okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.710" end="00:37:38.280" style="s2">there&#39;s some things in my life that I</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.480" end="00:37:39.720" style="s2">could put in order today there are</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.280" end="00:37:42.590" style="s2">usually things you don&#39;t want to do as I</p>

<p begin="00:37:44.760" end="00:37:49.860" style="s2">that I would do you have to ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.360" end="00:37:52.050" style="s2">you can&#39;t tell yourself you have to ask</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.860" end="00:37:54.090" style="s2">yourself what would you do and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.050" end="00:37:56.130" style="s2">maybe you have to say well or maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.090" end="00:37:58.230" style="s2">have to say under what conditions would</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.130" end="00:38:00.330" style="s2">I be willing to do something to put my</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.230" end="00:38:02.130" style="s2">life in further order today what little</p>

<p begin="00:38:03.840" end="00:38:07.440" style="s2">like take out the whip and boss yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.090" end="00:38:10.400" style="s2">around because you&#39;ll find that you&#39;re a</p>

<p begin="00:38:10.400" end="00:38:15.600" style="s2">you can get a long ways if you look low</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.290" end="00:38:17.010" style="s2">enough one of the things Carl Jung said</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.600" end="00:38:18.780" style="s2">I really liked was that modern people</p>

<p begin="00:38:24.450" end="00:38:30.510" style="s2">humility already intact so I would say</p>

<p begin="00:38:33.420" end="00:38:37.770" style="s2">because you&#39;ll know it make a list of</p>

<p begin="00:38:37.770" end="00:38:42.600" style="s2">and then start thinking about small</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.380" end="00:38:44.490" style="s2">things you can do like trivial things</p>

<p begin="00:38:47.010" end="00:38:50.790" style="s2">right direction and help straighten out</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.840" end="00:38:52.410" style="s2">your life and try that for a year before</p>

<p begin="00:38:54.540" end="00:38:59.190" style="s2">put that into practice for a year that</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.880" end="00:39:00.930" style="s2">things will be a lot better and like I</p>

<p begin="00:39:02.160" end="00:39:09.960" style="s2">and so the other thing I would say too</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.060" end="00:39:11.940" style="s2">is it isn&#39;t exactly that I would say</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.960" end="00:39:14.100" style="s2">forgive yourself because you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.940" end="00:39:16.320" style="s2">just a cliche but I would say that once</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.100" end="00:39:19.470" style="s2">you&#39;ve decided once you what you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.320" end="00:39:22.550" style="s2">wrong and you&#39;ve put into practice some</p>

<p begin="00:40:18.150" end="00:40:22.490" style="s2">for example was it partly her decision</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.540" end="00:40:34.020" style="s2">here&#39;s a possibility maybe you could ask</p>

<p begin="00:41:14.250" end="00:41:18.330" style="s2">have to differentiate each of those 30</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.050" end="00:41:20.340" style="s2">into ten more right maybe there&#39;s 300</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.330" end="00:41:23.330" style="s2">reasons and then see if you can start</p>

<p begin="00:44:48.450" end="00:44:52.979" style="s2">says why is self-sabotage such a future</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.089" end="00:44:54.900" style="s2">feature in human life you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.979" end="00:45:01.049" style="s2">have a chapter about that in my new book</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.900" end="00:45:03.989" style="s2">- which chapter is it now I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.049" end="00:45:07.819" style="s2">it I can&#39;t always match the content with</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.989" end="00:45:07.819" style="s2">the chapter title oddly enough</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.140" end="00:45:17.550" style="s2">I think it&#39;s the chapter about picking</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.240" end="00:45:18.840" style="s2">friends that are good for you see oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.550" end="00:45:21.330" style="s2">I have it right here</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.840" end="00:45:23.700" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t set that up by the way I</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.330" end="00:45:27.510" style="s2">genuinely did remember make friends with</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.700" end="00:45:29.400" style="s2">the people who want the best for you was</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.510" end="00:45:31.530" style="s2">that it no treat yourself like someone</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.400" end="00:45:33.710" style="s2">you are responsible for helping there we</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.530" end="00:45:33.710" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.820" end="00:45:39.420" style="s2">why are self-sabotage such a feature</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.650" end="00:45:41.850" style="s2">okay here&#39;s a couple of reasons the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.420" end="00:45:46.140" style="s2">first is is that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.850" end="00:45:50.310" style="s2">responsibility with success right so if</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.140" end="00:45:52.500" style="s2">you if you say yes to things and you do</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.310" end="00:45:54.090" style="s2">a good job and and you bear a large</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.500" end="00:45:55.950" style="s2">burden then you have to carry it and a</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.090" end="00:45:58.410" style="s2">lot of that might be success but you</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.950" end="00:46:00.120" style="s2">know failure is a lot easier than</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.410" end="00:46:01.950" style="s2">success plus you can complain about it</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.120" end="00:46:04.650" style="s2">and whine about it and be a victim and</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.950" end="00:46:06.870" style="s2">you know garner all sorts of kudos from</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.650" end="00:46:09.360" style="s2">yourself and others that way so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.870" end="00:46:11.040" style="s2">that it&#39;s just failure to adopt</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.360" end="00:46:13.680" style="s2">responsibility but then I would say too</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.040" end="00:46:15.540" style="s2">there&#39;s also revenge on on the self and</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.680" end="00:46:17.130" style="s2">god that&#39;s partly why I like the Cain</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.540" end="00:46:23.460" style="s2">and Abel story so much once I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.130" end="00:46:27.630" style="s2">figured out what it meant people have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.460" end="00:46:29.880" style="s2">hard time not having the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.630" end="00:46:32.100" style="s2">contempt that borders on self-hatred for</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.880" end="00:46:35.370" style="s2">themselves partly because you know we</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.100" end="00:46:37.440" style="s2">are fragile and mortal creatures and</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.370" end="00:46:39.150" style="s2">prone to error and malevolence and we</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.440" end="00:46:42.660" style="s2">know that of ourselves better than</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.150" end="00:46:44.550" style="s2">anyone else and because we know that</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.660" end="00:46:47.220" style="s2">we&#39;re prone to punish ourselves and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.550" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">to think ill of ourselves and you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.220" end="00:46:51.870" style="s2">one of the things I learned from young</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:53.670" style="s2">was that the injunction to do unto your</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.870" end="00:46:56.880" style="s2">neighbor as you would have him do unto</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.670" end="00:46:59.190" style="s2">you was an equation rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.880" end="00:47:01.980" style="s2">statement about how to be nice to people</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.190" end="00:47:03.500" style="s2">and that you have an ethical obligation</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.980" end="00:47:06.090" style="s2">to treat yourself as if you&#39;re some</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.500" end="00:47:09.420" style="s2">person of value even if you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.090" end="00:47:12.240" style="s2">feel that that you owe yourself that</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.420" end="00:47:13.800" style="s2">that you owe yourself the same treatment</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.240" end="00:47:15.870" style="s2">that you would give someone that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.800" end="00:47:17.730" style="s2">cared for and loved that&#39;s a really hard</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.870" end="00:47:19.500" style="s2">thing to learn you know because you kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.730" end="00:47:21.690" style="s2">of have to detach yourself from your</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.500" end="00:47:23.970" style="s2">knowledge of all your insufficiencies</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.690" end="00:47:26.490" style="s2">and your flaws and treat yourself with</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.970" end="00:47:26.820" style="s2">dignity and respect at least the dignity</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.490" end="00:47:29.850" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.820" end="00:47:32.340" style="s2">effect do someone who&#39;s faulty that</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.850" end="00:47:34.260" style="s2">could conceivably learn and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.340" end="00:47:35.910" style="s2">very difficult ethical lesson to learn</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.260" end="00:47:37.770" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s easier to beat yourself</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.910" end="00:47:40.260" style="s2">continually on the hit back of the head</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.770" end="00:47:42.870" style="s2">with a club and to feel it&#39;s justified</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.260" end="00:47:46.710" style="s2">given how much you know about how</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.870" end="00:47:51.090" style="s2">wretched and useless you are so so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.710" end="00:47:52.800" style="s2">say there&#39;s two reasons one is that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.090" end="00:47:54.510" style="s2">don&#39;t want the responsibility so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.800" end="00:47:56.070" style="s2">not really self-sabotage it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.510" end="00:47:59.180" style="s2">avoidance of responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.070" end="00:48:01.860" style="s2">consequent failure and the second is</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.180" end="00:48:03.870" style="s2">punishment self punishment that seems</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.860" end="00:48:08.030" style="s2">only just given what you know about all</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.870" end="00:48:10.760" style="s2">your pathology and and an error and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.030" end="00:48:17.070" style="s2">insufficiencies so I would say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.760" end="00:48:18.860" style="s2">that&#39;s the big two there hmm any advice</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.070" end="00:48:22.920" style="s2">for a grieving parent who lost a child</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.860" end="00:48:24.570" style="s2">unexpectedly well one I would say make</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.920" end="00:48:27.690" style="s2">sure that you turn to the people that</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.570" end="00:48:30.060" style="s2">you have left that you love the second I</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.690" end="00:48:33.360" style="s2">would say is don&#39;t be guilty about</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.060" end="00:48:36.180" style="s2">grieving you know and if you have</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.360" end="00:48:38.340" style="s2">friends you could tell them you could</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.180" end="00:48:40.260" style="s2">let them do something nice for you</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.340" end="00:48:41.970" style="s2">because they would like that you could</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.260" end="00:48:43.350" style="s2">figure out something they could do that</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.970" end="00:48:45.450" style="s2">would be nice that you would appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.350" end="00:48:47.730" style="s2">and let them do it because you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.450" end="00:48:49.680" style="s2">other people are going to grieve at some</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.730" end="00:48:51.390" style="s2">point in the future too and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.680" end="00:48:59.100" style="s2">they&#39;ll be able to ask you for help if</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.390" end="00:49:00.330" style="s2">you do that and then well I would the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.100" end="00:49:03.210" style="s2">next thing I would say is give yourself</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.330" end="00:49:06.230" style="s2">time you know it takes a year maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.210" end="00:49:10.670" style="s2">longer to adapt to adjust even</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.230" end="00:49:10.670" style="s2">reasonably to such a catastrophic loss</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.829" end="00:49:27.230" style="s2">and then I would say try not to allow</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.170" end="00:49:30.200" style="s2">that terrible wound to make you bitter</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.230" end="00:49:32.450" style="s2">because then not only will you have lost</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.200" end="00:49:34.520" style="s2">your child and grieve but you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.450" end="00:49:36.140" style="s2">bitter and then you&#39;ll be resentful and</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.520" end="00:49:39.140" style="s2">then you&#39;ll be hateful and that&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.140" end="00:49:44.380" style="s2">like a terrible not allowed insult to</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.140" end="00:49:44.380" style="s2">injury so that&#39;s too bad</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.430" end="00:49:49.400" style="s2">are there ever situations where you</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.869" end="00:49:53.859" style="s2">should hold your tongue and not speak</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.400" end="00:49:57.170" style="s2">what you believe yeah most of the time</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.859" end="00:49:59.089" style="s2">look it&#39;s really a tricky thing to</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.170" end="00:50:00.920" style="s2">figure out when to say what you have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.089" end="00:50:03.500" style="s2">say but I can give you a couple of rules</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.920" end="00:50:05.329" style="s2">of thumb it&#39;s a general question aim and</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.500" end="00:50:07.609" style="s2">I can&#39;t list all the situations but I</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.329" end="00:50:14.540" style="s2">can give you some strategic advice so</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.609" end="00:50:17.359" style="s2">for example if someone is has said rude</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.540" end="00:50:18.020" style="s2">things to you for example says a rude</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.359" end="00:50:19.849" style="s2">thing to you</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.020" end="00:50:21.170" style="s2">maybe you shouldn&#39;t respond immediately</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.849" end="00:50:23.089" style="s2">even though you&#39;re very irritated</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.170" end="00:50:25.730" style="s2">because maybe that&#39;s just an impulsive</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.089" end="00:50:27.530" style="s2">response and one that you&#39;ll regret one</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.730" end="00:50:29.690" style="s2">you make an anger that you&#39;ll regret so</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.530" end="00:50:31.430" style="s2">I would say when you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.690" end="00:50:34.160" style="s2">someone and you want to chastise them</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.430" end="00:50:36.380" style="s2">then you should wait for them to sin 3</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.160" end="00:50:39.290" style="s2">times right so the first time they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.380" end="00:50:40.700" style="s2">rude to you you think oh well they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.290" end="00:50:43.940" style="s2">probably having a bad day or I</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.700" end="00:50:45.829" style="s2">misunderstood or I&#39;m rude sometimes too</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.940" end="00:50:47.510" style="s2">and you know I&#39;ll just let it go but you</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.829" end="00:50:50.390" style="s2">don&#39;t forget and you don&#39;t pretend it</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.510" end="00:50:53.329" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen and then it happens again</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.390" end="00:50:57.290" style="s2">and you think well that could still be</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.329" end="00:50:59.390" style="s2">fluke that could still be that could</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.290" end="00:51:01.520" style="s2">still be situational so maybe I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.390" end="00:51:03.589" style="s2">hold my damn tongue and but I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.520" end="00:51:05.750" style="s2">remember that I&#39;ll remember and then the</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.589" end="00:51:07.910" style="s2">third time they do it then you think no</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.750" end="00:51:09.440" style="s2">no three times that&#39;s a pattern and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.910" end="00:51:12.980" style="s2">then you can go to them and you can say</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.440" end="00:51:15.079" style="s2">look this happened and then maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.980" end="00:51:16.819" style="s2">die and you say well yeah you can deny</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.079" end="00:51:18.559" style="s2">it but then this happened and maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.819" end="00:51:23.480" style="s2">did I need to say why you can deny that</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.559" end="00:51:26.720" style="s2">but then this happened and you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.480" end="00:51:27.980" style="s2">three times the charm and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.720" end="00:51:29.930" style="s2">time when you should stand up for</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.980" end="00:51:30.840" style="s2">yourself and and say what you have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.930" end="00:51:32.400" style="s2">say look</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.840" end="00:51:34.230" style="s2">you have to put yourself in a position</p>

<p begin="00:51:34.230" end="00:51:37.080" style="s2">you have to think it through you have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.180" end="00:51:39.270" style="s2">have a plan</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.080" end="00:51:40.800" style="s2">and you can&#39;t just launch yourself off</p>

<p begin="00:51:56.010" end="00:51:59.310" style="s2">there&#39;s things that have to be said but</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.200" end="00:52:01.710" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean you can just blurt</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.310" end="00:52:03.270" style="s2">them out you have to have a plan you</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.710" end="00:52:04.890" style="s2">have to figure out what you want to say</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.270" end="00:52:07.080" style="s2">you have to make it as minimally</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.890" end="00:52:10.080" style="s2">troublesome as possible you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.080" end="00:52:11.820" style="s2">the goal that you want in mind and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.080" end="00:52:13.770" style="s2">have to have a back-up plan like this</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.820" end="00:52:15.210" style="s2">the sort of thing that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.770" end="00:52:17.520" style="s2">about you know where you need to say</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.210" end="00:52:19.230" style="s2">something that&#39;s like a little war you</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.520" end="00:52:21.270" style="s2">don&#39;t want to walk into that unarmed and</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.230" end="00:52:23.400" style="s2">unprepared and now that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.270" end="00:52:25.340" style="s2">that you should that means that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.400" end="00:52:28.020" style="s2">should set up your life so that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.340" end="00:52:29.970" style="s2">firmly enough anchored in a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.020" end="00:52:32.910" style="s2">different ways so that you can say what</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.970" end="00:52:36.350" style="s2">you need to say without dying as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.910" end="00:52:36.350" style="s2">consequence so</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.110" end="00:52:50.540" style="s2">yo Josh gates oh good Josh asked me an</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.080" end="00:52:53.300" style="s2">easy question young suggested that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.540" end="00:52:56.090" style="s2">Christian myth failed to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.300" end="00:52:58.340" style="s2">Christ&#39;s descent into hell and that this</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.090" end="00:53:07.010" style="s2">resulted in the mass shadow projection</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.340" end="00:53:09.200" style="s2">of the West&#39;s thoughts yeah well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.010" end="00:53:11.270" style="s2">gonna refer to my book again I talked</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.200" end="00:53:13.700" style="s2">about this in rule 7 pursue what is</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.270" end="00:53:17.240" style="s2">meaningful not what is expedient in that</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.700" end="00:53:19.280" style="s2">chapter I discussed there&#39;s this idea in</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.240" end="00:53:21.140" style="s2">Christianity that Christ took the sins</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.280" end="00:53:23.300" style="s2">of the world onto himself and I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.140" end="00:53:27.920" style="s2">that&#39;s very much related to the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.300" end="00:53:30.620" style="s2">descent into hell they&#39;re not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.920" end="00:53:33.140" style="s2">the same thing but I but I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.620" end="00:53:36.770" style="s2">address the first one and it&#39;ll shed</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.140" end="00:53:39.050" style="s2">light on the second so what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.770" end="00:53:40.910" style="s2">that the Messiah is archetype Li the</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.050" end="00:53:42.670" style="s2">figure who takes the sins of the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.910" end="00:53:46.010" style="s2">onto himself</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.670" end="00:53:47.900" style="s2">what it means practically speaking or</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.010" end="00:53:49.400" style="s2">psychologically speaking and I&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.900" end="00:53:52.820" style="s2">this with some of my clients who were</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.400" end="00:53:54.590" style="s2">very naive it means to read the history</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.820" end="00:53:56.660" style="s2">of the world as if you were the</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.590" end="00:53:59.060" style="s2">perpetrator of the evils that you read</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.660" end="00:53:59.870" style="s2">about instead of the victim or the noble</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.060" end="00:54:02.150" style="s2">intervener</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.870" end="00:54:04.010" style="s2">you know I talked to somebody the other</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.150" end="00:54:05.810" style="s2">day about the movie Schindler&#39;s List and</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.010" end="00:54:07.760" style="s2">Schindler was this German industrialist</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.810" end="00:54:10.780" style="s2">who saved a very large number of Jews</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.760" end="00:54:14.090" style="s2">that were in danger of well in danger of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.780" end="00:54:15.650" style="s2">the final solution and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.090" end="00:54:17.300" style="s2">he said was well you know when people</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.650" end="00:54:19.430" style="s2">watch Schindler&#39;s List they always think</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.300" end="00:54:20.810" style="s2">they&#39;d be Schindler and and if they</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.430" end="00:54:22.640" style="s2">don&#39;t think they&#39;d be Schindler maybe</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.810" end="00:54:24.410" style="s2">they think maybe the Jewish victim of</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.640" end="00:54:26.390" style="s2">the Nazis but they almost never think</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.410" end="00:54:29.030" style="s2">that they&#39;d be the Nazi persecutor and</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.390" end="00:54:32.510" style="s2">that&#39;s a big mistake because when you</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.030" end="00:54:35.930" style="s2">read about history then you&#39;re reading</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.510" end="00:54:38.420" style="s2">about you even if the U is the</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.930" end="00:54:40.010" style="s2">perpetrator and unless you understand</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.420" end="00:54:42.530" style="s2">that then someone else has to be the</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.010" end="00:54:44.030" style="s2">perpetrator and if someone else is the</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.530" end="00:54:46.400" style="s2">perpetrator well then you have a devil</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.030" end="00:54:48.080" style="s2">that you can chase and you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.400" end="00:54:50.090" style="s2">you&#39;ve identified the devil properly</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.080" end="00:54:52.670" style="s2">because you know now and then it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.090" end="00:54:54.050" style="s2">John Wayne Gacy or Ted Bundy or someone</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.670" end="00:54:56.400" style="s2">like that and you&#39;ve actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.050" end="00:55:02.069" style="s2">you&#39;ve identified a perpetrator but so</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.400" end="00:55:04.109" style="s2">often far too often the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.069" end="00:55:06.480" style="s2">constrain the malevolence outside is to</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.109" end="00:55:08.579" style="s2">constrain the malevolence within and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.480" end="00:55:09.690" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have a locale for the evil</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.579" end="00:55:11.309" style="s2">of the world then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.690" end="00:55:14.720" style="s2">externalize it because the evil of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.309" end="00:55:22.770" style="s2">world certainly exists now it&#39;s a better</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.720" end="00:55:24.390" style="s2">solution to assume that you&#39;re fully</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.770" end="00:55:26.039" style="s2">capable of the terrible things that</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.390" end="00:55:28.170" style="s2">people have been capable of throughout</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.039" end="00:55:30.599" style="s2">the history of humanity and to contend</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.170" end="00:55:32.400" style="s2">with that genuinely and there&#39;s massive</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.599" end="00:55:34.589" style="s2">advantages to that I mean first of all</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.400" end="00:55:37.740" style="s2">it can actually produce an remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.589" end="00:55:41.160" style="s2">increment and self-esteem because you</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.740" end="00:55:43.020" style="s2">know if you&#39;re just a rabbit and you</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.160" end="00:55:44.520" style="s2">freeze whenever a wolf looks at you then</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.020" end="00:55:45.930" style="s2">you&#39;re just a frozen rabbit and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.520" end="00:55:48.059" style="s2">not so good you&#39;re just a scared rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.930" end="00:55:49.740" style="s2">but maybe you learn one day that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.059" end="00:55:51.180" style="s2">not a rabbit that you like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.740" end="00:55:52.440" style="s2">actually quite the damn monster and</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.180" end="00:55:54.119" style="s2">you&#39;ve got teeth and you could really</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.440" end="00:55:56.069" style="s2">use them in an underhanded and horrible</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.119" end="00:55:58.289" style="s2">way this is why people like antihero</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.069" end="00:56:00.750" style="s2">movies so much hay because they go and</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.289" end="00:56:02.730" style="s2">see the villains the Mafia guys and</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.750" end="00:56:04.710" style="s2">these tough guys and they anti-heroes</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.730" end="00:56:06.660" style="s2">that populate our imagination and think</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.710" end="00:56:08.670" style="s2">oh yeah well I&#39;d really really like to</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.660" end="00:56:11.369" style="s2">be someone like that and the thing is is</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.670" end="00:56:13.140" style="s2">that being useless and weak it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.369" end="00:56:14.700" style="s2">to be a monster than to be useless and</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.140" end="00:56:16.589" style="s2">weak and that&#39;s because being useless</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.700" end="00:56:18.960" style="s2">and weak makes you a worst monster than</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.589" end="00:56:20.940" style="s2">a monster that&#39;s why it&#39;s not like being</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.960" end="00:56:22.890" style="s2">a monster is good but weak useless</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.940" end="00:56:24.240" style="s2">monster is the worst kind of monster</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.890" end="00:56:26.099" style="s2">because that&#39;s the sort of monster</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.240" end="00:56:27.720" style="s2">that&#39;ll jump you in the dark and sink</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.099" end="00:56:29.520" style="s2">its teeth into the back of your neck</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.720" end="00:56:32.220" style="s2">instead of confronting you forthrightly</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.520" end="00:56:33.900" style="s2">in the alley and so if you start to see</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.220" end="00:56:35.579" style="s2">yourself as the perpetrator of</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.900" end="00:56:37.559" style="s2">historical malevolence you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.579" end="00:56:40.950" style="s2">can imagine yourself as an ostrich camp</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.559" end="00:56:43.470" style="s2">guard if you see yourself as as the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.950" end="00:56:44.460" style="s2">vicious villain of the human story then</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.470" end="00:56:46.109" style="s2">all of a sudden you&#39;ve got a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.460" end="00:56:48.329" style="s2">respect for yourself and you can unlock</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.109" end="00:56:50.099" style="s2">that internal monster and that internal</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.329" end="00:56:52.559" style="s2">monster and then maybe you contain the</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.099" end="00:56:54.000" style="s2">damn thing or at least bring it bring it</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.559" end="00:56:55.319" style="s2">into some sort of partnership with</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.000" end="00:56:57.059" style="s2">yourself and then when someone pushes</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.319" end="00:56:59.130" style="s2">you around you can let a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.059" end="00:57:01.650" style="s2">that out in your eyes just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.130" end="00:57:03.539" style="s2">and you can say it would be better for</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.650" end="00:57:05.430" style="s2">you and for me if you didn&#39;t continue to</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.539" end="00:57:07.589" style="s2">do that and you can actually mean it and</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.430" end="00:57:09.359" style="s2">then actually it will stop because if</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.589" end="00:57:10.460" style="s2">you let a little bit of that out when</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.359" end="00:57:12.140" style="s2">you tell someone just</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.460" end="00:57:15.800" style="s2">the probability that they&#39;ll stop is</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.140" end="00:57:17.780" style="s2">extremely high and then just a tiny like</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.800" end="00:57:20.119" style="s2">vision of the monster you could become</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.780" end="00:57:23.480" style="s2">is enough to keep order in your house a</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.119" end="00:57:25.220" style="s2">and maybe in your state and so the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.480" end="00:57:28.490" style="s2">masked shadow projection of the West</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.220" end="00:57:30.109" style="s2">well you know here&#39;s another thing so</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.490" end="00:57:33.680" style="s2">one of the things the Christians figured</p>

<p begin="00:58:15.170" end="00:58:20.510" style="s2">gripping well it can be gripping for a</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.010" end="00:58:23.869" style="s2">variety of reasons it can be gripping</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.510" end="00:58:25.970" style="s2">because you are let&#39;s see because you</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.869" end="00:58:32.119" style="s2">are high in neuroticism that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.970" end="00:58:33.650" style="s2">possibility and and why is it so</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.119" end="00:58:37.309" style="s2">gripping well that&#39;s another potential</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.650" end="00:58:40.369" style="s2">reason it&#39;s hard for me to say let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.309" end="00:58:47.390" style="s2">I have a another chapter like that</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.369" end="00:58:49.190" style="s2">what&#39;s it called there yeah it again</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.390" end="00:58:50.839" style="s2">it&#39;s rule to treat yourself like someone</p>

<p begin="00:58:50.839" end="00:58:54.260" style="s2">why the hell wouldn&#39;t you pity yourself</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.010" end="00:58:56.329" style="s2">I mean people are life is tragic</p>

<p begin="00:58:56.329" end="00:59:00.260" style="s2">you have will be taken away from you</p>

<p begin="00:59:02.839" end="00:59:06.890" style="s2">could you not have self-pity well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.940" end="00:59:08.540" style="s2">really the answer but but the next</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.890" end="00:59:10.549" style="s2">answer is yeah well despite that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.540" end="00:59:12.680" style="s2">not good enough you have to rise above</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.549" end="00:59:14.450" style="s2">all that even though you have every</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.680" end="00:59:16.790" style="s2">reason for it that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.450" end="00:59:18.470" style="s2">paradoxical is you have to rise above it</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.790" end="00:59:20.059" style="s2">even though you have every reason for it</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.470" end="00:59:21.740" style="s2">and part of the reason you have to rise</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.059" end="00:59:23.540" style="s2">above it is because if you don&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.740" end="00:59:24.200" style="s2">makes everything worse you and</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.540" end="00:59:28.220" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.200" end="00:59:31.810" style="s2">and being itself and so it&#39;s gripping</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.220" end="00:59:33.680" style="s2">because well it does grip you you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.810" end="00:59:35.900" style="s2">malevolence and tragedy and</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.680" end="00:59:38.000" style="s2">vulnerability and mortality there</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.900" end="00:59:39.320" style="s2">gripping and I would say well you have</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.000" end="00:59:41.330" style="s2">to find something that&#39;s even more</p>

<p begin="00:59:41.330" end="00:59:45.050" style="s2">most the thing that&#39;s most gripping the</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.730" end="00:59:47.930" style="s2">only thing that&#39;s more gripping than</p>

<p begin="01:28:09.869" end="01:28:14.309" style="s2">I&#39;d ask him a whole bunch of questions I</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.119" end="01:28:15.929" style="s2">try to figure out how he thought cuz I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.309" end="01:28:18.599" style="s2">really curious about God I&#39;d ask him all</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.929" end="01:28:19.769" style="s2">sorts of questions ask see if I could</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.599" end="01:28:21.719" style="s2">find out what he was up to</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.769" end="01:28:23.459" style="s2">I&#39;d like to know what he&#39;s aiming at I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.719" end="01:28:25.530" style="s2">like to know why he think he became</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.459" end="01:28:28.889" style="s2">president what he did right what he did</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.530" end="01:28:30.719" style="s2">wrong what what he dreads like what he</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.889" end="01:28:33.149" style="s2">would consider a catastrophic failure</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.719" end="01:28:35.880" style="s2">where he thinks his biggest weaknesses</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.149" end="01:28:40.860" style="s2">are what he&#39;d like to leave as a as a</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.880" end="01:28:43.860" style="s2">legacy that would be fascinating but see</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.860" end="01:28:45.929" style="s2">I find generally speaking it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.860" end="01:28:48.360" style="s2">interesting to ask people questions</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.929" end="01:28:49.709" style="s2">especially people like that than ever to</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.360" end="01:28:52.050" style="s2">try to convince them of things because</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.709" end="01:28:53.969" style="s2">the thing is I already know what I know</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.050" end="01:28:55.709" style="s2">but I have no idea what he knows or what</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.969" end="01:28:58.320" style="s2">he&#39;s like and so it&#39;d be amazing to be</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.709" end="01:28:59.820" style="s2">able to talk to him and so I have a bit</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.320" end="01:29:01.289" style="s2">of that opportunity now in Canada</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.820" end="01:29:02.939" style="s2">because I&#39;ve been speaking to a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.289" end="01:29:04.769" style="s2">political figures in Canada I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.939" end="01:29:07.949" style="s2">have that opportunity in Europe but a</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.769" end="01:29:09.719" style="s2">lot of a lot of what you want to do when</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.949" end="01:29:11.130" style="s2">you meet people is ask them questions</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.719" end="01:29:12.570" style="s2">because you know they&#39;ll tell you all</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.130" end="01:29:15.059" style="s2">sorts of things you don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.570" end="01:29:16.889" style="s2">that&#39;s also an entry point to a really</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.059" end="01:29:18.659" style="s2">good conversation is to ask questions so</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.889" end="01:29:24.539" style="s2">that&#39;s what I would do I&#39;d ask questions</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.659" end="01:29:26.219" style="s2">like mad until he chased me away so one</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.539" end="01:29:28.229" style="s2">more Daniel Schell I like this question</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.219" end="01:29:30.269" style="s2">how would you give a speech to soldiers</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.229" end="01:29:32.070" style="s2">entering the army about responsibility I</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.269" end="01:29:34.169" style="s2">will command a basic training unit and</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.070" end="01:29:36.209" style="s2">address young soldiers advice Daniel</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.169" end="01:29:38.789" style="s2">what I would do is you can think about</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.209" end="01:29:40.979" style="s2">this you could ask them to complete the</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.789" end="01:29:42.300" style="s2">future authoring program I think that</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.979" end="01:29:44.849" style="s2">would be a really good idea but if you</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.300" end="01:29:47.280" style="s2">don&#39;t want to do that and but you should</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.849" end="01:29:50.309" style="s2">ask them to like get them to sit down</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.280" end="01:29:51.840" style="s2">for 90 minutes or an hour even I would</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.309" end="01:29:55.439" style="s2">use the Future authoring program because</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.840" end="01:29:57.050" style="s2">it&#39;s just easier but ask them what sort</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.439" end="01:29:58.639" style="s2">of soldiers they want to be in</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.050" end="01:30:00.739" style="s2">three to five years like if they could</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.639" end="01:30:05.420" style="s2">put themselves together and be the best</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.739" end="01:30:07.250" style="s2">military and serve the purpose that they</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.420" end="01:30:09.770" style="s2">enrolled in the military for in the best</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.250" end="01:30:12.320" style="s2">possible manner what would they look</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.770" end="01:30:16.340" style="s2">like as their own future ideal they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.320" end="01:30:17.750" style="s2">have to think it through so and then the</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.340" end="01:30:19.010" style="s2">other thing you can ask them and this is</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.750" end="01:30:21.290" style="s2">also part of the future authoring</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.010" end="01:30:23.030" style="s2">program is like what would your life</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.290" end="01:30:25.909" style="s2">look like three to five years down the</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.030" end="01:30:29.239" style="s2">road if you fail in your in your desire</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.909" end="01:30:31.369" style="s2">to to become a proper soldier</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.239" end="01:30:33.739" style="s2">what sort of hell are you courting by</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.369" end="01:30:35.059" style="s2">failing to take on the responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.739" end="01:30:37.190" style="s2">and if you can get them to think that</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.059" end="01:30:38.690" style="s2">through you know the probability that</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.190" end="01:30:41.329" style="s2">they&#39;ll do a good job will vastly</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.690" end="01:30:42.409" style="s2">increase really vastly increase lots of</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.329" end="01:30:44.510" style="s2">young people have never thought about</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.409" end="01:30:46.309" style="s2">who it is that they could be if they</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.510" end="01:30:48.469" style="s2">started to be the person they could be</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.309" end="01:30:49.849" style="s2">and so getting them to think about that</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.469" end="01:30:52.130" style="s2">and write about it would be extremely</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.849" end="01:30:54.469" style="s2">important so what I would do first of</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.130" end="01:30:56.059" style="s2">all is get them to do the writing and</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.469" end="01:30:59.329" style="s2">the thinking and then give the speech</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.059" end="01:31:01.070" style="s2">and maybe once they&#39;ve done it you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.329" end="01:31:02.840" style="s2">you can ask them if they&#39;d be willing to</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.070" end="01:31:04.070" style="s2">share with you some of what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.840" end="01:31:05.540" style="s2">written I wouldn&#39;t make that mandatory</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.070" end="01:31:07.550" style="s2">because then they might not be able to</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.540" end="01:31:08.449" style="s2">write about it honestly so that&#39;s how it</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.550" end="01:31:15.469" style="s2">would go about it</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.449" end="01:31:18.619" style="s2">so okay well I&#39;m done so thank you very</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.469" end="01:31:28.790" style="s2">much for tuning in and thank you all for</p>
