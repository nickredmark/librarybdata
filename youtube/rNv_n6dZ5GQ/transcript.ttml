<p begin="00:02:27.520" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">almost like your arms are filled with</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.120" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">water flowing through them</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:34.560" style="s2">they&#39;re flexible but they&#39;re not limp</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">and they&#39;re not locked</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.560" end="00:02:40.400" style="s2">okay so pump and so when i&#39;m turning</p>

<p begin="00:02:46.400" end="00:02:49.519" style="s2">and my heart so there&#39;s a full body</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.920" end="00:02:51.360" style="s2">block</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.519" end="00:02:53.120" style="s2">that&#39;s my what&#39;s my left hand is doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.360" end="00:02:54.879" style="s2">my right hand is coming</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.120" end="00:02:57.200" style="s2">up it&#39;s spiraling up so it&#39;s palm</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.879" end="00:02:57.920" style="s2">towards me with this finger the middle</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.200" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">finger</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.920" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">just around the tip of just above the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">tip of my nose but in line with the tip</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:05.599" style="s2">of my nose</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.400" end="00:03:09.120" style="s2">so that looks like this</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.599" end="00:03:09.120" style="s2">and notice i&#39;m turning my hips</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.159" end="00:03:14.959" style="s2">okay okay so once i do this then i start</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.840" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">the tai chi walk</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.959" end="00:03:18.400" style="s2">walking right the meditative walking</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:20.239" style="s2">right remember heel to toe</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.400" end="00:03:21.599" style="s2">and as my heel goes down remember i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.239" end="00:03:23.200" style="s2">straightening my hips and what that</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.599" end="00:03:26.319" style="s2">straightening my hips does</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.200" end="00:03:28.400" style="s2">is it moves this hand past my knee</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.319" end="00:03:31.360" style="s2">it&#39;s called brush knee and when i finish</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.400" end="00:03:32.080" style="s2">the move my hand comes beside my thigh</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.360" end="00:03:34.560" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.080" end="00:03:35.280" style="s2">and as if i&#39;m touching a board like this</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.560" end="00:03:38.480" style="s2">this hand</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.280" end="00:03:40.640" style="s2">is like a curved l so it doesn&#39;t go on</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.480" end="00:03:43.360" style="s2">the diagonal it doesn&#39;t go like this</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.640" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">it spirals into the center that nose to</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.360" end="00:03:46.640" style="s2">navel</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:48.400" style="s2">line spirals into the center and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.640" end="00:03:49.920" style="s2">down and notice how i keep a deep bend</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.400" end="00:03:52.720" style="s2">in my arm i am not</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.920" end="00:03:53.680" style="s2">this is very mistaken and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.720" end="00:03:55.120" style="s2">i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.680" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">okay so what does that look like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.120" end="00:03:59.680" style="s2">turning turning turning</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">stepping straightening the hips brushing</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.680" end="00:04:03.280" style="s2">the knee</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:05.439" style="s2">spiraling down the center coming in</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.280" end="00:04:06.640" style="s2">okay so remembering in tai chi walking</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.439" end="00:04:08.879" style="s2">meditative walking</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.640" end="00:04:11.760" style="s2">i set my weight back and my i come up</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.879" end="00:04:15.040" style="s2">onto my left heel as i do that my hands</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.760" end="00:04:19.040" style="s2">my palms rotate in and then as i</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.040" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">turn right remember i do this i align</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.040" end="00:04:22.240" style="s2">everything my knee remember aligning the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:24.080" style="s2">knees in my</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.240" end="00:04:25.520" style="s2">left knee coming into place my hands are</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.080" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">aligned like this</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.520" end="00:04:30.080" style="s2">okay keep this hand like</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:32.479" style="s2">when i say a line there don&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:32.720" style="s2">directly below it hold slightly ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.479" end="00:04:35.440" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.720" end="00:04:37.040" style="s2">so slightly this way okay so like this</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.440" end="00:04:38.479" style="s2">and then now this is the difficult part</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.040" end="00:04:39.440" style="s2">i&#39;m going to try and do it as slowly as</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.479" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.440" end="00:04:44.000" style="s2">remember what i do is i do this with my</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:45.680" style="s2">weight i bring my weight i turn all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.000" end="00:04:46.639" style="s2">my weight onto my left leg no weight</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.680" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">going into my</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.639" end="00:04:51.280" style="s2">right heel and that brings up my right</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:54.639" style="s2">foot now as i&#39;m doing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.280" end="00:04:57.440" style="s2">these hands are switching so that this</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.639" end="00:04:59.440" style="s2">is now like this and then this is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.440" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">full body block here</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.440" end="00:05:06.080" style="s2">okay so like this right</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:11.280" style="s2">i&#39;m aligned i turn</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.080" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">okay my line i turn</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.280" end="00:05:17.120" style="s2">okay i&#39;m aligned i turn</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.400" end="00:05:18.639" style="s2">and then i brush the knee on this side i</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.120" end="00:05:22.000" style="s2">brush the knee on this side</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.639" end="00:05:24.960" style="s2">i brush the knee on this side okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.000" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">so let&#39;s say i brush my knee now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:29.440" style="s2">the name of the move</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.840" end="00:05:31.440" style="s2">brush knees okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.440" end="00:05:32.720" style="s2">so i think like i said i&#39;ll do it first</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.440" end="00:05:35.600" style="s2">this way</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.720" end="00:05:36.479" style="s2">i got the full camera i want to turn i</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.600" end="00:05:37.919" style="s2">got a brush knee</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.479" end="00:05:40.240" style="s2">and i want to turn so let&#39;s just do the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.919" end="00:05:42.800" style="s2">footwork again up</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.240" end="00:05:44.400" style="s2">pivot no weight yet shift weight from</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.800" end="00:05:46.400" style="s2">here to here pivot more</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.400" end="00:05:48.720" style="s2">let this foot slide a bit let the right</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.400" end="00:05:52.240" style="s2">foot slide a bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.720" end="00:05:54.080" style="s2">and then up and over okay so</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.240" end="00:05:55.680" style="s2">but i&#39;m doing the first part of the of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.080" end="00:05:58.240" style="s2">the weight shift with the footwork</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.680" end="00:05:59.840" style="s2">i&#39;m spiraling this down and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.240" end="00:06:00.240" style="s2">spiraling this up what i&#39;m doing is i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.840" end="00:06:03.600" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.240" end="00:06:04.880" style="s2">storing energy in the elasticity of my</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.600" end="00:06:06.800" style="s2">tissues</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.880" end="00:06:08.319" style="s2">right so what when you when the martial</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.800" end="00:06:09.919" style="s2">arts you&#39;re learning to coordinate not</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.319" end="00:06:11.520" style="s2">just the large piston muscles you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.919" end="00:06:12.479" style="s2">learning to coordinate all the small</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.520" end="00:06:14.080" style="s2">that&#39;s why you&#39;re doing all this</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.479" end="00:06:16.160" style="s2">spiraling you&#39;re first of all you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.080" end="00:06:17.600" style="s2">coordinating all the control muscles and</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.160" end="00:06:19.280" style="s2">getting it&#39;s like a laser</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:21.280" style="s2">you know ambient light the light bounces</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.280" end="00:06:23.039" style="s2">off in all directions in the laser</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.280" end="00:06:24.960" style="s2">it&#39;s reflected right so that it all</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.039" end="00:06:26.639" style="s2">becomes coherent and it moves</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.960" end="00:06:28.319" style="s2">in a unified pattern and so i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.639" end="00:06:30.639" style="s2">to get all the muscles</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.319" end="00:06:32.240" style="s2">to have that coherence to them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.639" end="00:06:34.319" style="s2">part of what qi is</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.240" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">and then also i&#39;m storing energy in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.319" end="00:06:36.400" style="s2">elasticity of the tissue so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.400" end="00:06:40.160" style="s2">muc so like if i&#39;m striking someone</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:43.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.160" end="00:06:44.400" style="s2">when i strike it&#39;s not just piston</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.520" end="00:06:46.400" style="s2">muscles</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.400" end="00:06:48.400" style="s2">it&#39;s also the small control muscles and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.400" end="00:06:49.599" style="s2">it&#39;s also the elasticity of the tissue</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.400" end="00:06:51.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s the weight shift and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.599" end="00:06:51.919" style="s2">getting everything coherent into one</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.440" end="00:06:55.360" style="s2">strike</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.919" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">okay hopefully you&#39;ll never use this for</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.360" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">fighting</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:06:59.759" style="s2">but the idea is you understand the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:01.120" style="s2">function it helps you to do the form</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.759" end="00:07:05.280" style="s2">correctly</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.120" end="00:07:08.800" style="s2">okay so i&#39;m like this i rotate</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.280" end="00:07:11.759" style="s2">and then now right shift from</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.800" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">right this leg to this leg i start to</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.759" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">unwrap my hands</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:20.240" style="s2">over and now you see i&#39;m ready i&#39;m ready</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.520" end="00:07:20.240" style="s2">for a brushing</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.960" end="00:07:25.919" style="s2">what would that look like on this side</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.560" end="00:07:25.919" style="s2">same thing wrapping</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.800" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">starting to unwrap over</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.319" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">brush me</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.759" end="00:07:40.720" style="s2">wrapping getting into place</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.319" end="00:07:42.160" style="s2">see this starting to unwrap right here</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.720" end="00:07:45.919" style="s2">right here</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.160" end="00:07:49.199" style="s2">over brush knee</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.919" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">okay i think this is better right here</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.199" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">right wrapping and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:55.919" style="s2">start to unwrap and that gets this hand</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:57.680" style="s2">down into place the lower hand</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.919" end="00:08:01.280" style="s2">this is now right in front of my nose</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.680" end="00:08:01.280" style="s2">ready to go and boom</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.080" end="00:08:09.120" style="s2">so remember whenever i&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:10.560" style="s2">inhale because i&#39;m getting everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.120" end="00:08:11.520" style="s2">ready i&#39;m drawing everything in this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.560" end="00:08:15.440" style="s2">the end part</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.520" end="00:08:19.360" style="s2">and then yang exhale and then in</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.440" end="00:08:22.080" style="s2">right and then exhale then in</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.360" end="00:08:22.080" style="s2">and then exhale</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:26.639" style="s2">so you&#39;re meditating on the flow of your</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.479" end="00:08:30.560" style="s2">breath you&#39;re meditating on your</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.639" end="00:08:32.560" style="s2">center your root</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.560" end="00:08:36.159" style="s2">obviously your flow and now the final</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.560" end="00:08:37.599" style="s2">part your right the final part is this</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.159" end="00:08:38.640" style="s2">and this is a word that should not be</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.599" end="00:08:39.760" style="s2">translated because whenever it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.640" end="00:08:41.200" style="s2">mistranslated it</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.760" end="00:08:42.800" style="s2">gives people all kinds of crazy</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.200" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">metaphysical ideas</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.800" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">but this is the this is the key that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:50.399" style="s2">chi or the key</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">if you she is chinese key is japanese</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.399" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.519" end="00:08:59.600" style="s2">sense of laser-like coherence</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.560" end="00:09:02.800" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.600" end="00:09:05.920" style="s2">an awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.800" end="00:09:08.279" style="s2">like it&#39;s an intelligent flowing</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.920" end="00:09:09.760" style="s2">living coherence that&#39;s sort of the</p>

<p begin="00:09:09.760" end="00:09:13.760" style="s2">of your own perspectival and</p>

<p begin="00:24:59.760" end="00:25:03.440" style="s2">to be fairly a barely</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.120" end="00:25:05.360" style="s2">visual thinker i&#39;ve had a brain injury</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.440" end="00:25:06.720" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry to hear that by the way</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.360" end="00:25:08.640" style="s2">pressure due to inflammation that i</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.720" end="00:25:10.799" style="s2">associate with the loss of my ability to</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.640" end="00:25:13.360" style="s2">access visual memories thinking</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.799" end="00:25:16.080" style="s2">the same is true for the auditory i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.360" end="00:25:18.559" style="s2">sorry to hear that</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.080" end="00:25:19.279" style="s2">um i have some sense of what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.559" end="00:25:21.600" style="s2">lose</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.279" end="00:25:22.799" style="s2">the veneers has cost me my hearing in my</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.600" end="00:25:26.840" style="s2">my left ear</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.799" end="00:25:28.720" style="s2">um so i have some sense of what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.840" end="00:25:30.159" style="s2">like i think there&#39;s value in</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.720" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">cultivating these skills to proclaim</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.159" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">some of what i&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:35.600" style="s2">i&#39;ve been able to have limited access</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:39.919" style="s2">after intense concentration</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.600" end="00:25:43.200" style="s2">no doubt um so the veins plasticity</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.919" end="00:25:46.480" style="s2">its capacity to rewire</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.200" end="00:25:47.679" style="s2">and make use of other areas</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.480" end="00:25:49.520" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about this a little</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.679" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">bit more on monday</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.520" end="00:25:54.640" style="s2">it is is very significant</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.120" end="00:25:56.480" style="s2">recently during meditation i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.640" end="00:25:59.120" style="s2">developing my ability to perceive and</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.480" end="00:26:00.960" style="s2">influence really limited visual and also</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:02.320" style="s2">some auditory experience after intense</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.960" end="00:26:03.679" style="s2">concentration</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.320" end="00:26:05.279" style="s2">during recent meditation i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.679" end="00:26:07.200" style="s2">developing my ability to perceive and</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.279" end="00:26:09.120" style="s2">influence really limited visual and also</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.200" end="00:26:12.640" style="s2">some auditory experience</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.120" end="00:26:15.679" style="s2">so um this makes great sense um so</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.640" end="00:26:17.200" style="s2">we know that meditators</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.679" end="00:26:18.799" style="s2">what seems to happen and we&#39;ll talk a</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.200" end="00:26:20.080" style="s2">lot about this on monday when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.799" end="00:26:22.000" style="s2">about savory</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.080" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">right there is a bottom-up aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.000" end="00:26:26.640" style="s2">taking information in from the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:29.039" style="s2">and then a top-down inhibition that</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.640" end="00:26:30.960" style="s2">screens off a lot of that and tries to</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.039" end="00:26:32.080" style="s2">find the familiar patterns what</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.960" end="00:26:34.559" style="s2">meditation does</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.080" end="00:26:36.559" style="s2">is it relaxes that top-down influence</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.559" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">and opens it up makes it more flexible</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.559" end="00:26:39.840" style="s2">so more of the bottom up influence comes</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:41.919" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.840" end="00:26:43.840" style="s2">and this is what what i mean when i say</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.919" end="00:26:46.799" style="s2">you can use imagination which is the top</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.840" end="00:26:48.400" style="s2">down to make this top down more flexible</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.799" end="00:26:49.600" style="s2">in order to train perception the more</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.400" end="00:26:52.880" style="s2">bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.600" end="00:26:54.480" style="s2">and so meditation uh actually tends to</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.880" end="00:26:57.679" style="s2">create synesthesia in people</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.480" end="00:26:58.880" style="s2">uh this is when you s you have a color</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.679" end="00:27:02.400" style="s2">experience that you see</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.880" end="00:27:06.320" style="s2">colors in sound or all right or you</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.400" end="00:27:08.080" style="s2">taste shapes right um and so we know</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.320" end="00:27:11.360" style="s2">that meditation can in fact</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.080" end="00:27:14.000" style="s2">do that kind of rewiring and because the</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.360" end="00:27:16.080" style="s2">way it probably functions</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.000" end="00:27:18.080" style="s2">i&#39;ve had experience when i took my first</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.080" end="00:27:20.720" style="s2">dose of an ssri</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.080" end="00:27:22.480" style="s2">um is that i perhaps there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.720" end="00:27:23.600" style="s2">depression associated with the chronic</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.480" end="00:27:25.600" style="s2">loss</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.600" end="00:27:27.279" style="s2">uh where i unleashed an uncontrollable</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.600" end="00:27:29.679" style="s2">flow of thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.279" end="00:27:31.919" style="s2">so with with this context my question is</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.679" end="00:27:33.919" style="s2">twofold so that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.919" end="00:27:36.000" style="s2">excellent explication of the context</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.919" end="00:27:38.159" style="s2">manual i want to ask for methods of</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.000" end="00:27:40.240" style="s2">cultivation of the visual and auditory</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.159" end="00:27:41.840" style="s2">and if there is a threat to engaging and</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.240" end="00:27:44.320" style="s2">not fully integrated part of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.840" end="00:27:48.320" style="s2">and this might grow out of control</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.320" end="00:27:50.480" style="s2">okay so first of all</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.320" end="00:27:51.520" style="s2">and this this is not delivered this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.480" end="00:27:53.919" style="s2">just how it</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.520" end="00:27:54.960" style="s2">uh fell together when uh the thing i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.919" end="00:27:58.720" style="s2">going to be teaching you</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.960" end="00:28:02.559" style="s2">on monday as part of extended um</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.720" end="00:28:07.679" style="s2">epicureanism the the savoring</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.559" end="00:28:10.159" style="s2">of of simple experience will really help</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.679" end="00:28:11.440" style="s2">get that better relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.159" end="00:28:13.279" style="s2">bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.440" end="00:28:15.279" style="s2">perception and the top-down uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.279" end="00:28:18.000" style="s2">pre-hending</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.279" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">prehending is the the find the seeing of</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.000" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">relations and patterns it&#39;s in like</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:23.279" style="s2">comprehension apprehension pre-ending uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.880" end="00:28:25.679" style="s2">it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.279" end="00:28:26.960" style="s2">idea from ultimately from whitehead uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.679" end="00:28:29.679" style="s2">it means sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.960" end="00:28:31.440" style="s2">getting the the the way you&#39;re that</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.679" end="00:28:33.120" style="s2">we&#39;re sizing things up</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.440" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">mentally mentally getting an optimal</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.120" end="00:28:38.799" style="s2">grip on them and so savoring is about</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:41.440" style="s2">uh making that um a much more flowing</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.799" end="00:28:43.840" style="s2">and participatory experience that should</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.440" end="00:28:44.880" style="s2">help and because you&#39;re doing it outside</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.840" end="00:28:47.679" style="s2">the meditation</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.880" end="00:28:49.279" style="s2">i&#39;ll explain the context um there&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.679" end="00:28:50.240" style="s2">of a chance of it sort of running away</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.279" end="00:28:52.720" style="s2">on its own</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.240" end="00:28:53.279" style="s2">so there&#39;s going to be that and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.720" end="00:28:57.679" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.279" end="00:28:59.840" style="s2">the road when we move into the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.679" end="00:29:02.159" style="s2">the neoplatonic part of the course</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.840" end="00:29:04.320" style="s2">will be trying to engage in active</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.159" end="00:29:06.799" style="s2">imagination and dream work</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.320" end="00:29:09.039" style="s2">uh which also will help uh use</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.799" end="00:29:12.399" style="s2">imagination to better train perception</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.039" end="00:29:15.520" style="s2">but in a very sort of um</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.399" end="00:29:17.520" style="s2">disciplined context uh that will</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.520" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">integrate with mindfulness so that</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.520" end="00:29:20.880" style="s2">there&#39;ll be less of a chance</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:22.640" style="s2">of there being that sort of runaway</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.880" end="00:29:24.640" style="s2">rumination and spiraling</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.640" end="00:29:26.399" style="s2">that you&#39;re concerned for manual so i</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.640" end="00:29:28.399" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.399" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">that should help you now perhaps we</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.399" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">could take another question</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.600" end="00:29:48.640" style="s2">so mike allison asks a question hi john</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.039" end="00:29:50.159" style="s2">i have done your in-person meditation</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.640" end="00:29:53.200" style="s2">class a few times</p>

<p begin="00:31:08.159" end="00:31:11.360" style="s2">by my friend and colleague evan thompson</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.760" end="00:31:15.120" style="s2">called self no self</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.360" end="00:31:18.000" style="s2">um and part of the uh is that i think um</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.120" end="00:31:18.960" style="s2">the presupposition that behind this</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.000" end="00:31:21.200" style="s2">debate</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.960" end="00:31:22.960" style="s2">that we clearly understand what we mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.200" end="00:31:24.559" style="s2">when we make this distinction</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.960" end="00:31:26.880" style="s2">um i i want to challenge that</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.559" end="00:31:29.919" style="s2">presupposition</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.880" end="00:31:31.919" style="s2">i think that what the project does</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.919" end="00:31:32.960" style="s2">because it&#39;s very intense absorption is</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.919" end="00:31:36.240" style="s2">you obviously</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.960" end="00:31:37.279" style="s2">lose uh the narrative egocentric sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.240" end="00:31:40.399" style="s2">of self</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.279" end="00:31:43.600" style="s2">but if what we mean by self is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.399" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">capacity to be here</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.600" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">now sort of heightened sense of design</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.840" end="00:31:54.720" style="s2">with some kind of awareness</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:58.240" style="s2">so an awareness of our here now-ness</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.720" end="00:31:59.440" style="s2">and the unity of our experience the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.240" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">oneness</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.440" end="00:32:05.760" style="s2">um if the self is our capacity</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.120" end="00:32:07.840" style="s2">for an awareness of that so that</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.760" end="00:32:09.039" style="s2">although my mug has the human madness</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.840" end="00:32:10.320" style="s2">and it togetherness it doesn&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.039" end="00:32:13.600" style="s2">awareness of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.320" end="00:32:16.720" style="s2">um then i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.600" end="00:32:19.840" style="s2">that part of the self</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.720" end="00:32:22.159" style="s2">um comes to the fore and</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.840" end="00:32:24.640" style="s2">things like non-duality practices of</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.159" end="00:32:28.240" style="s2">prajna</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.640" end="00:32:28.640" style="s2">so often by the way here&#39;s just one one</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.240" end="00:32:30.080" style="s2">indi</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:31.840" style="s2">this is not a complete argument well one</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.080" end="00:32:33.840" style="s2">indication of what i mean by how people</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.840" end="00:32:35.200" style="s2">are slippery about this is they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.840" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">there&#39;s no self</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.200" end="00:32:38.640" style="s2">and then what they do is they just shift</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:39.919" style="s2">functions that have been traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.640" end="00:32:42.799" style="s2">associated to the self</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.919" end="00:32:43.679" style="s2">to consciousness and consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.799" end="00:32:46.159" style="s2">aware</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.679" end="00:32:47.039" style="s2">of itself and right and then and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.159" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.039" end="00:32:50.640" style="s2">really answer the problem it just shifts</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:54.640" style="s2">it around</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.640" end="00:32:58.080" style="s2">um so i think there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.640" end="00:33:00.480" style="s2">science and philosophy needed</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.080" end="00:33:01.760" style="s2">in order to bring clarity conceptual and</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.480" end="00:33:03.200" style="s2">theoretical clarity</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.760" end="00:33:05.360" style="s2">to this debate and many people are</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.200" end="00:33:07.600" style="s2">engaged in it and i&#39;m engaging in it</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.360" end="00:33:08.640" style="s2">um and so i want to be careful how i</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.600" end="00:33:12.000" style="s2">answer your question</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.640" end="00:33:15.360" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to say that i think our</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.000" end="00:33:18.880" style="s2">narrative egocentric sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.360" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">diminishes but the functionality</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.880" end="00:33:25.039" style="s2">of an awareness of here now togetherness</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:25.039" style="s2">what the harder</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.039" end="00:33:32.480" style="s2">um i i think that um</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.159" end="00:33:34.399" style="s2">is is comes to the fore and even in</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.480" end="00:33:35.279" style="s2">traditions that talk about the self as</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.399" end="00:33:37.440" style="s2">illusory</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.279" end="00:33:40.320" style="s2">like zen you&#39;ll hear people talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.440" end="00:33:42.559" style="s2">about and then you find your true self</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.320" end="00:33:43.919" style="s2">and so um like i said i think this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.559" end="00:33:46.320" style="s2">all very slippery</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.919" end="00:33:47.360" style="s2">and what we should do is we should do</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.320" end="00:33:50.000" style="s2">two different things</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.360" end="00:33:51.360" style="s2">and not confuse them together in the in</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.000" end="00:33:52.480" style="s2">the realm of explaining we should do a</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.360" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">lot more cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.480" end="00:33:55.360" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:58.000" style="s2">and in the realm of training we should</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.360" end="00:33:59.600" style="s2">really zero in on the phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.000" end="00:34:01.039" style="s2">that is actually functional for</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.600" end="00:34:03.200" style="s2">transformation for us</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.039" end="00:34:05.120" style="s2">and so and then get those two to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.200" end="00:34:06.960" style="s2">each other as much as possible i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.120" end="00:34:09.440" style="s2">to working on that</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.960" end="00:34:10.560" style="s2">eventually after i teach this course i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.440" end="00:34:12.720" style="s2">going to release</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.560" end="00:34:14.159" style="s2">a video series on the nature of the self</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.720" end="00:34:14.800" style="s2">i know there&#39;s a lot of video series</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.159" end="00:34:17.119" style="s2">coming and</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.800" end="00:34:19.200" style="s2">they&#39;re all and they&#39;re all unfolding um</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.119" end="00:34:20.720" style="s2">because i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.200" end="00:34:22.879" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to be a good teacher for all</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.720" end="00:34:25.440" style="s2">of you my job is to</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.879" end="00:34:25.919" style="s2">do do a lot of the work because you guys</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.440" end="00:34:27.119" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.919" end="00:34:29.040" style="s2">you have your own lives and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.119" end="00:34:30.480" style="s2">have the time i get that</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.040" end="00:34:33.679" style="s2">and i&#39;m in a sort of a privileged</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.480" end="00:34:36.720" style="s2">position uh but to but how i can</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.679" end="00:34:38.159" style="s2">how i can respond to that gift that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.720" end="00:34:41.200" style="s2">been given by others</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.159" end="00:34:43.440" style="s2">is to be a very good teacher to learn as</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.200" end="00:34:47.119" style="s2">much as i can and share that learning</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.440" end="00:34:49.440" style="s2">as much as i can as succinctly and as</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.119" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">powerfully as i can for as many of you</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.440" end="00:34:53.520" style="s2">as possible and so uh that&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:34:57.440" style="s2">endeavoring to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.520" end="00:35:00.480" style="s2">with the help of many other good people</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.440" end="00:35:03.520" style="s2">of good faith and good talent gabe</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.480" end="00:35:05.920" style="s2">uh we have one more i think um</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.520" end="00:35:07.280" style="s2">gabriel rubinstein any tips for</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.920" end="00:35:09.280" style="s2">encouraging someone who could</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.280" end="00:35:10.720" style="s2">uh benefit from meditation but can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.280" end="00:35:12.079" style="s2">motivate themselves to do it and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.720" end="00:35:15.520" style="s2">resistance to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.079" end="00:35:18.800" style="s2">don&#39;t start with the seated practice</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.520" end="00:35:20.320" style="s2">get them involved with moving practices</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.800" end="00:35:22.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen some of the moving practices</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.320" end="00:35:25.599" style="s2">here uh even the tai chi one</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.480" end="00:35:27.280" style="s2">like the brush knees i&#39;ll talk on on</p>

<p begin="00:35:46.720" end="00:35:50.160" style="s2">going to treat the wisdom of my teacher</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.320" end="00:35:52.640" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to just teach you what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.160" end="00:35:53.040" style="s2">in the book i&#39;m going to supplement it</p>

<p begin="00:35:56.160" end="00:35:59.440" style="s2">back to the original question there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.920" end="00:36:00.720" style="s2">get them involved in things where</p>
