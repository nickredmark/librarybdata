<p begin="00:00:00.060" end="00:00:05.220" style="s2">welcome everyone today I&#39;m talking with</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.829" end="00:00:07.620" style="s2">Daniel Craig about a book project that</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.220" end="00:00:10.559" style="s2">we are working on together Daniel is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.620" end="00:00:13.110" style="s2">former student of mine he&#39;s also done a</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.559" end="00:00:13.950" style="s2">lot of work putting together a set of</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.110" end="00:00:16.340" style="s2">conferences</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.950" end="00:00:19.650" style="s2">having to do with the effects of</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.340" end="00:00:21.750" style="s2">psychedelics on cognition and the way</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.650" end="00:00:23.369" style="s2">they might perhaps afford zappy eventual</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.750" end="00:00:25.080" style="s2">development and Daniel&#39;s had a</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.369" end="00:00:27.029" style="s2">significant influence on my father</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.080" end="00:00:31.170" style="s2">around those topics</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.029" end="00:00:33.960" style="s2">when Daniel is also somebody who is</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.170" end="00:00:36.300" style="s2">currently actually working with me on</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.960" end="00:00:37.410" style="s2">the book were in the process of writing</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.300" end="00:00:39.300" style="s2">it right now</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.410" end="00:00:44.180" style="s2">the book is called the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.300" end="00:00:44.180" style="s2">continuum from insight to enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.460" end="00:00:53.370" style="s2">so let&#39;s jump right in to what exactly</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.490" end="00:00:55.410" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be discussing the title</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.370" end="00:00:57.270" style="s2">in particular is very significant</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.410" end="00:00:59.040" style="s2">would you like to provide an elaboration</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.270" end="00:01:02.160" style="s2">of why this book is called the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.040" end="00:01:07.280" style="s2">continuum right so the main idea about</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.160" end="00:01:10.170" style="s2">that is the thesis that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.280" end="00:01:12.330" style="s2">continuum between the kinds of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.170" end="00:01:14.190" style="s2">machinery that&#39;s at work in something</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.330" end="00:01:16.740" style="s2">like insight problem-solving like when</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.190" end="00:01:19.170" style="s2">we are having a farm moment and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.740" end="00:01:21.899" style="s2">that machinery is taken up and extended</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.170" end="00:01:23.160" style="s2">into something like what people call the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.899" end="00:01:24.420" style="s2">flow experience and we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.160" end="00:01:27.690" style="s2">each one of these in more detail as we</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.420" end="00:01:29.340" style="s2">go along and then in turn that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.690" end="00:01:32.940" style="s2">machinery the flow experience is</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.340" end="00:01:37.140" style="s2">extended and exacted up into mystical</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.940" end="00:01:40.890" style="s2">experiences and then that machinery is</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.140" end="00:01:42.720" style="s2">in turn can sometimes have an impact on</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.890" end="00:01:45.149" style="s2">people in which they seek to transform</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.720" end="00:01:46.289" style="s2">the structure of their identity the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.149" end="00:01:49.410" style="s2">structure of their lives and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.289" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">transformative experience and then when</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.410" end="00:01:57.990" style="s2">that in turn is making available a set</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:02:01.560" style="s2">of practices and skills and virtues that</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.990" end="00:02:03.740" style="s2">allows people to address the perennial</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.560" end="00:02:05.729" style="s2">problems that beset human beings</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.740" end="00:02:08.070" style="s2">problems of self-deception and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.729" end="00:02:09.600" style="s2">self-destructive behavior then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.070" end="00:02:11.730" style="s2">arguing at least that that&#39;s at least a</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.600" end="00:02:14.370" style="s2">good operational definition of what it</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.730" end="00:02:16.799" style="s2">is to have achieved enlightenment and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.370" end="00:02:19.110" style="s2">in a sense right what you&#39;re seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.799" end="00:02:21.989" style="s2">the same machinery being recursively</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.110" end="00:02:24.390" style="s2">exact it and expanded and complexified</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.989" end="00:02:26.130" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a continuum and what that</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.390" end="00:02:30.329" style="s2">means is we can take some of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.130" end="00:02:31.820" style="s2">mystique that has been typically</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.329" end="00:02:33.989" style="s2">associated with things like</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.820" end="00:02:36.239" style="s2">enlightenment or even with mystical</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.989" end="00:02:39.150" style="s2">experiences or awakening experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.239" end="00:02:42.780" style="s2">by putting it on a continuum with this</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.150" end="00:02:45.209" style="s2">machinery that&#39;s more readily understood</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.780" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">and studied within cognitive psychology</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.209" end="00:02:48.959" style="s2">and cognitive science we can bring a</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:51.989" style="s2">deeper understanding which of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.959" end="00:02:53.880" style="s2">affords both you know better science but</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.989" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">we also are going to emphasize in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.880" end="00:02:58.320" style="s2">book how that deeper understanding</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:03:00.010" style="s2">affords enhancing people&#39;s ability to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.320" end="00:03:02.590" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.010" end="00:03:04.590" style="s2">you know well basically a course of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.590" end="00:03:07.540" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom and enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.590" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">that practical edge is I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.540" end="00:03:11.799" style="s2">the things I&#39;m looking forward to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:13.180" style="s2">most in elaborating this framework and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.799" end="00:03:14.860" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna be providing some guidelines</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.180" end="00:03:16.239" style="s2">on how to structure your own</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.860" end="00:03:21.909" style="s2">enlightenment practice based on this</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.239" end="00:03:24.549" style="s2">definition now regarding the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.909" end="00:03:26.440" style="s2">demystification I want to talk a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.549" end="00:03:28.209" style="s2">bit about that because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.440" end="00:03:29.530" style="s2">interesting things about the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.209" end="00:03:31.569" style="s2">experiences associated different</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.530" end="00:03:33.489" style="s2">Lightman&#39;s if that&#39;s the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.569" end="00:03:35.200" style="s2">divine union where you are your egos</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.489" end="00:03:39.489" style="s2">sort of shattered into the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.200" end="00:03:42.040" style="s2">expanse or the more visionary types of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.489" end="00:03:43.209" style="s2">experiences attains by angels demons etc</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.040" end="00:03:44.950" style="s2">you know the Buddha during his</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.209" end="00:03:46.510" style="s2">enlightenment process he&#39;s visited by</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.950" end="00:03:50.200" style="s2">Mara who tells him with all of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.510" end="00:03:55.000" style="s2">visionary material and there is a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.200" end="00:03:57.790" style="s2">very it&#39;s almost very likely that at</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.000" end="00:03:59.980" style="s2">many times during the process of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.790" end="00:04:02.500" style="s2">exploring these experiences that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.980" end="00:04:04.030" style="s2">content is going to be conflated with</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.500" end="00:04:05.319" style="s2">the reality of what&#39;s happening right</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.030" end="00:04:06.489" style="s2">because there&#39;s this issue that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.319" end="00:04:08.470" style="s2">talked about with higher states of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.489" end="00:04:09.730" style="s2">consciousness that they&#39;re infused with</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.470" end="00:04:12.459" style="s2">the sense of truth in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.730" end="00:04:13.810" style="s2">significance yeah so that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.459" end="00:04:17.530" style="s2">things that really interests me about</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.810" end="00:04:19.660" style="s2">these these experiences it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.530" end="00:04:22.590" style="s2">problem when I presented some work on it</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.660" end="00:04:26.500" style="s2">and an issue I call on to normativity</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.590" end="00:04:28.690" style="s2">what that means is let&#39;s say let&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.500" end="00:04:30.610" style="s2">think it&#39;s non controversial to say that</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.690" end="00:04:31.990" style="s2">mystical experiences are some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.610" end="00:04:34.570" style="s2">altered state of consciousness I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.990" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">that&#39;s fairly non-controversial but</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.570" end="00:04:38.260" style="s2">these experiences tend to have and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.120" end="00:04:41.110" style="s2">there&#39;s work supporting this by other</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.260" end="00:04:44.020" style="s2">people Newburgh Gate and Taylor people</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.110" end="00:04:46.000" style="s2">like that but anyways they when people</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.020" end="00:04:47.380" style="s2">have these experiences they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.000" end="00:04:48.520" style="s2">different from how they normally relate</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.380" end="00:04:50.590" style="s2">to their other altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.520" end="00:04:52.750" style="s2">consciousness so for example if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.590" end="00:04:54.099" style="s2">dreaming when you wake up out of your</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.750" end="00:04:56.110" style="s2">dream and notice how we use the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.099" end="00:04:57.340" style="s2">awakening metaphor when you wake up out</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.110" end="00:05:01.680" style="s2">of your dream you say oh well the dream</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.340" end="00:05:04.150" style="s2">wasn&#39;t real this is reality right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.680" end="00:05:07.530" style="s2">what&#39;s really interesting is why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.150" end="00:05:10.630" style="s2">going on and it has to do I think very</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.530" end="00:05:11.830" style="s2">very quickly with the fact that we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.630" end="00:05:13.660" style="s2">this sort of overall pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.830" end="00:05:15.460" style="s2">intelligibility that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.660" end="00:05:17.050" style="s2">and not just in an intellectual sense it</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.460" end="00:05:19.300" style="s2">gives us kind of a good optimal grip on</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.050" end="00:05:21.760" style="s2">the world and when when the dream state</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.300" end="00:05:23.740" style="s2">we can&#39;t fit that in and any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.760" end="00:05:27.220" style="s2">sort of coherent fashion to that and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.740" end="00:05:28.990" style="s2">that&#39;s not real that makes sort of sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.220" end="00:05:31.150" style="s2">to everybody&#39;s you know okay but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.990" end="00:05:34.150" style="s2">interesting is when people go into these</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.150" end="00:05:35.620" style="s2">higher states of consciousness they do</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.150" end="00:05:38.560" style="s2">something very different they come back</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.620" end="00:05:41.320" style="s2">and say no no that was really real and</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.560" end="00:05:44.500" style="s2">all of this this everyday experience is</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.320" end="00:05:47.260" style="s2">somehow less real less illusory that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.500" end="00:05:49.540" style="s2">and that&#39;s the Anto part being reality</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.260" end="00:05:53.500" style="s2">the normativity that comes in onto</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.540" end="00:05:55.930" style="s2">normativity is that they feel called to</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.500" end="00:05:58.330" style="s2">transform themselves and their lives and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.930" end="00:06:00.040" style="s2">often quite radical manner so that they</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.330" end="00:06:02.530" style="s2">can come into a greater existential</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.040" end="00:06:04.480" style="s2">conformity to that that increased</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.530" end="00:06:06.340" style="s2">realness they want to get back to it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.480" end="00:06:08.890" style="s2">this sort of speaks to that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.340" end="00:06:10.990" style="s2">drive for human beings to a drive for a</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.890" end="00:06:12.970" style="s2">realization in both senses of the word</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.990" end="00:06:16.240" style="s2">like the sense of insight and the sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.970" end="00:06:18.280" style="s2">of coming into contact with which with</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.280" end="00:06:24.640" style="s2">font or normativity as you said people</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.770" end="00:06:26.020" style="s2">come out of it and they feel called and</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.640" end="00:06:29.650" style="s2">they feel called to what is most real</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.020" end="00:06:34.270" style="s2">and what could happen is they can attach</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.650" end="00:06:37.090" style="s2">that to any particular proposition or</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.270" end="00:06:40.030" style="s2">content or pictorial content they might</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.090" end="00:06:43.960" style="s2">use to try and make sense or interpret</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.030" end="00:06:46.390" style="s2">that and so what can happen is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.960" end="00:06:49.180" style="s2">sense of entre normativity can get</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.390" end="00:06:51.640" style="s2">transferred into a kind of authority for</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.180" end="00:06:55.480" style="s2">their particular claims and that that</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.640" end="00:06:56.980" style="s2">can be very very very dangerous because</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.480" end="00:06:59.590" style="s2">I think you can make a very good case</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.980" end="00:07:02.980" style="s2">where as we do in the book that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.590" end="00:07:04.720" style="s2">a procedural or perspectival even a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.980" end="00:07:08.920" style="s2">participatory sense these are different</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.720" end="00:07:10.150" style="s2">kinds of knowing that in which we can</p>

<p begin="00:07:10.150" end="00:07:15.310" style="s2">really optimized and enhanced in their</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.210" end="00:07:17.470" style="s2">function so another way of saying it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.310" end="00:07:20.170" style="s2">your cognition is being made to function</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.470" end="00:07:22.900" style="s2">much much better and its abilities to</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.170" end="00:07:25.420" style="s2">sort of get a grip on reality and to</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.900" end="00:07:27.040" style="s2">cool and to work coordinate right the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.420" end="00:07:29.080" style="s2">conformity of your sense of idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.040" end="00:07:30.910" style="s2">to how you&#39;re identifying with the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.080" end="00:07:32.200" style="s2">and how you&#39;re identifying the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.910" end="00:07:35.890" style="s2">that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.200" end="00:07:37.960" style="s2">procedurally being enhanced and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.890" end="00:07:39.970" style="s2">very different from whatever particular</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.960" end="00:07:41.590" style="s2">metaphysical claims people make because</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.970" end="00:07:43.630" style="s2">people can come out of these experiences</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.590" end="00:07:45.220" style="s2">and they&#39;ll say oh now I know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.630" end="00:07:47.320" style="s2">god or they can come out of these</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.220" end="00:07:49.090" style="s2">experiences and they&#39;re equally ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.320" end="00:07:51.580" style="s2">and saying now I know there&#39;s no God and</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.090" end="00:07:53.830" style="s2">so if you try and get any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.580" end="00:07:55.780" style="s2">consent so this is not like a hug it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.830" end="00:07:57.340" style="s2">not like a hugs knee and perennialism I</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.780" end="00:08:00.010" style="s2">don&#39;t mean I don&#39;t think you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.340" end="00:08:02.650" style="s2">find sort of a set of core propositions</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.010" end="00:08:04.170" style="s2">that everybody&#39;s going to agree on other</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.650" end="00:08:06.040" style="s2">than propositions that are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.170" end="00:08:09.430" style="s2">reflectively descriptive of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.040" end="00:08:12.060" style="s2">phenomenology right but any attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.430" end="00:08:14.890" style="s2">describe to sort of extrapolate that</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.060" end="00:08:16.570" style="s2">because of the entre normativity into a</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.890" end="00:08:19.120" style="s2">claim about the metaphysical structure</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.570" end="00:08:20.950" style="s2">of reality that&#39;s very very questionable</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:22.480" style="s2">so the distinction we make is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.950" end="00:08:23.920" style="s2">distinction between giving up on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.480" end="00:08:28.650" style="s2">idea that we&#39;re getting you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.920" end="00:08:31.090" style="s2">arcane metaphysical knowledge of reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.650" end="00:08:32.349" style="s2">and instead thinking what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.090" end="00:08:35.530" style="s2">these states and what they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.349" end="00:08:37.630" style="s2">calling to you is towards wisdom right</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.530" end="00:08:39.220" style="s2">with that and enlightenment and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.630" end="00:08:41.020" style="s2">you&#39;ll even see this in the traditions</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.220" end="00:08:43.450" style="s2">where for example the Buddha you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.020" end="00:08:45.850" style="s2">famously does not want to offer any</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.450" end="00:08:48.070" style="s2">metaphysical speculations and true</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.850" end="00:08:50.860" style="s2">metaphysical questions make metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.070" end="00:08:52.930" style="s2">claims about Nirvana the state of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.860" end="00:08:56.080" style="s2">enlightenment instead he wants to help</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.930" end="00:08:58.330" style="s2">people cultivate the wisdom to realize</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.080" end="00:08:59.650" style="s2">that statement right relationships at</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.330" end="00:09:02.020" style="s2">the end of the day are the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.650" end="00:09:03.700" style="s2">important yes enlightenment is an</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.020" end="00:09:06.040" style="s2">existential mode right it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.700" end="00:09:09.220" style="s2">relating to self to world to other which</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.040" end="00:09:11.680" style="s2">promotes an optimal sort of interaction</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.220" end="00:09:14.110" style="s2">and within that definition of optimal we</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.680" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">also need to include a definition of</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.110" end="00:09:17.860" style="s2">ethics and how Ethics manifests yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:20.050" style="s2">there is no enlightenment without ethics</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.860" end="00:09:21.220" style="s2">however there could be wisdom I think an</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.050" end="00:09:22.900" style="s2">interesting distinction that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.220" end="00:09:25.960" style="s2">learned from looking into Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.900" end="00:09:27.370" style="s2">philosophy is the difference between you</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.960" end="00:09:28.960" style="s2">could call it microcosmic wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.370" end="00:09:32.590" style="s2">macrocosmic wisdom the wisdom with a</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.960" end="00:09:36.040" style="s2">lowercase or a capital W but wisdom is</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.590" end="00:09:38.440" style="s2">just a kind of expertise in Hebrew you</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.040" end="00:09:39.320" style="s2">can use the word wisdom to refer to</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.440" end="00:09:40.459" style="s2">Graham</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.320" end="00:09:42.949" style="s2">who&#39;s really good at knitting she has</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.459" end="00:09:45.380" style="s2">wisdom in let&#39;s get it huh yeah but um</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.949" end="00:09:48.620" style="s2">there&#39;s something greater least when you</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.380" end="00:09:50.240" style="s2">say Street was that can right be another</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.620" end="00:09:52.160" style="s2">kind of expertise right but if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.240" end="00:09:53.329" style="s2">you have to be Street buys you know that</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:54.410" style="s2">might mean that for example you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.329" end="00:09:55.970" style="s2">really gonna like physically defending</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.410" end="00:09:56.930" style="s2">yourself you have to right right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.970" end="00:09:58.430" style="s2">just not necessarily something that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.930" end="00:10:02.779" style="s2">really want people to have to be that</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.430" end="00:10:04.430" style="s2">while it&#39;s still good skill but the one</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.779" end="00:10:06.350" style="s2">of the fundamentally distinctive things</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.430" end="00:10:09.649" style="s2">about enlightenment compared to just</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.350" end="00:10:11.630" style="s2">wisdom per se is the ethical norm that</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.649" end="00:10:13.100" style="s2">comes with it there is no action that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.630" end="00:10:14.089" style="s2">unethical that is an enlightened action</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.100" end="00:10:15.259" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a pretty good standard</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.089" end="00:10:17.329" style="s2">asset for that mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.259" end="00:10:19.370" style="s2">one framing that came up as you were</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.329" end="00:10:21.709" style="s2">talking about the auto normativity of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.370" end="00:10:25.790" style="s2">the states and such is the difference</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.709" end="00:10:28.370" style="s2">between expression and explanation so if</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.790" end="00:10:30.500" style="s2">you look into ancient philosophy I have</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.370" end="00:10:31.880" style="s2">a double major in cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.500" end="00:10:33.560" style="s2">in philosophy specialized in ancient</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.880" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">philosophy they do a lot of good</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.560" end="00:10:37.130" style="s2">thinking about things like prophetic</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:39.680" style="s2">visionary states of consciousness which</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.130" end="00:10:43.819" style="s2">I&#39;m particularly fascinated in one thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.680" end="00:10:46.639" style="s2">that comes up is that the transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.819" end="00:10:50.209" style="s2">state the transcendent quality of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.639" end="00:10:52.190" style="s2">universe of the universe is just too</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.209" end="00:10:54.139" style="s2">much for human beings to handle and this</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.190" end="00:10:56.029" style="s2">is something that you emphasized I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.139" end="00:10:57.589" style="s2">even in the first lecture of the intro</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.029" end="00:11:00.529" style="s2">to cognitive science course we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.589" end="00:11:02.300" style="s2">epidemic about there are very real</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.529" end="00:11:03.560" style="s2">constraints on our cognition such that</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.300" end="00:11:04.579" style="s2">certain things we actually can&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.560" end="00:11:07.130" style="s2">directly yes</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.579" end="00:11:09.260" style="s2">so our cognition has all these</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.130" end="00:11:11.540" style="s2">interesting mechanisms these excitation</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.260" end="00:11:14.600" style="s2">mechanisms to cross reference</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.540" end="00:11:17.060" style="s2">information to bounce information around</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.600" end="00:11:19.639" style="s2">different parts of the brain so for</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.060" end="00:11:20.810" style="s2">example in the psychedelic state if</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.639" end="00:11:22.850" style="s2">you&#39;re on under the influence of LSD</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.810" end="00:11:25.939" style="s2">there is an increase in activation</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.850" end="00:11:28.639" style="s2">between the part of your temporal lobe</p>

<p begin="00:11:31.399" end="00:11:36.439" style="s2">likelihood of personally relevant mental</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.500" end="00:11:38.899" style="s2">imagery coming into your experience so</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.439" end="00:11:42.230" style="s2">your visual cortex in these states is</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.899" end="00:11:44.269" style="s2">actually translating non visual</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.230" end="00:11:46.910" style="s2">information into a visual metaphor yes</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.269" end="00:11:50.000" style="s2">so that you can more readily grasp the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.910" end="00:11:52.310" style="s2">relationship underlying the image right</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.000" end="00:11:52.970" style="s2">and this comes up in the philosophy of</p>

<p begin="00:12:31.730" end="00:12:36.110" style="s2">of the things that comes up and I know</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.980" end="00:12:38.180" style="s2">Jordan Peterson has mentioned that ideas</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.110" end="00:12:40.670" style="s2">will first show up to you in your dreams</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.180" end="00:12:42.410" style="s2">in their sort of inchoate form and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.670" end="00:12:44.029" style="s2">as they become more and more refined you</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.410" end="00:12:47.360" style="s2">are may be able to articulate them more</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.029" end="00:12:48.800" style="s2">but at first they might seem as though</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.360" end="00:12:50.990" style="s2">they have a lot of weight a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.800" end="00:12:52.370" style="s2">magnitude you might be perplexed even by</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.990" end="00:12:54.560" style="s2">a dream even though it doesn&#39;t have this</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.370" end="00:12:55.819" style="s2">aunt enormity thing going on there might</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.560" end="00:12:57.680" style="s2">be something that sticks with you and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.819" end="00:12:58.519" style="s2">your dream and you&#39;re like hmm why is</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.680" end="00:13:00.860" style="s2">that happening</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.519" end="00:13:04.670" style="s2">and why do I feel so compelled to dig</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.860" end="00:13:06.920" style="s2">deeper so these imaginative flourishes</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.670" end="00:13:11.660" style="s2">that your mind is capable of performing</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.920" end="00:13:14.959" style="s2">are ways of getting us to comprehend</p>

<p begin="00:13:14.959" end="00:13:18.769" style="s2">are fundamentally a little bit beyond</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.510" end="00:14:29.810" style="s2">of wisdom right it certainly gives you</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.340" end="00:14:31.610" style="s2">some perspective yes there was something</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.810" end="00:14:35.390" style="s2">I wanted to talk about regarding the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.610" end="00:14:36.890" style="s2">particularity of different languages</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.390" end="00:14:40.250" style="s2">used to train the brain okay it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.890" end="00:14:41.660" style="s2">back okay so one question that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.250" end="00:14:45.650" style="s2">gotten from a few people when I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.660" end="00:14:47.510" style="s2">discussing my progress in book is why</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.650" end="00:14:51.590" style="s2">the term enlightenment mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.510" end="00:14:53.090" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s the whole idea of set</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.590" end="00:14:54.500" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been discussing here oh well</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.090" end="00:14:56.000" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a whole set of</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.500" end="00:14:57.290" style="s2">traditions which have this particular</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.000" end="00:14:59.690" style="s2">kind of language which helps you to</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.290" end="00:15:01.610" style="s2">train yourself in a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.690" end="00:15:03.460" style="s2">way is actually you can have more ideal</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.610" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">relationships with self world at other</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.460" end="00:15:07.880" style="s2">the term enlightenment is actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:09.920" style="s2">really important because it&#39;s nested in</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.880" end="00:15:11.980" style="s2">with this network of associations coming</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.920" end="00:15:14.090" style="s2">from the spiritual heritage of</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.980" end="00:15:17.120" style="s2">intellectual history and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.090" end="00:15:19.700" style="s2">would be very remiss to forego that for</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.120" end="00:15:21.440" style="s2">a more neutral term you know I returned</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.700" end="00:15:22.760" style="s2">before I started looking into a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.440" end="00:15:24.680" style="s2">the stuff that I&#39;ve used which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.760" end="00:15:26.540" style="s2">analogous is like cognitive optimization</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.680" end="00:15:28.970" style="s2">for example that&#39;s a perfectly good</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.540" end="00:15:31.880" style="s2">neutral term that you could use but it</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.970" end="00:15:35.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really help us to yoke these</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.880" end="00:15:37.820" style="s2">ideas to the traditions that have</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.000" end="00:15:40.490" style="s2">provided us languages and practices that</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.820" end="00:15:43.430" style="s2">we can utilize to actually cultivate the</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.490" end="00:15:45.410" style="s2">state I agree and that and it&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.430" end="00:15:48.470" style="s2">the history that we don&#39;t want to lose</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.410" end="00:15:50.240" style="s2">thread the thread of we&#39;re losing some</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.470" end="00:15:54.200" style="s2">of the phenomenology listen to the word</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.240" end="00:15:56.690" style="s2">insight we typically use perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.200" end="00:15:59.180" style="s2">attentional metaphors to try and explain</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.690" end="00:16:00.550" style="s2">significant cognitive changes in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.180" end="00:16:02.330" style="s2">sight sight is being invoked</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.550" end="00:16:05.000" style="s2">enlightenment has to do with it</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.330" end="00:16:07.340" style="s2">transformation of your ability to look</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.000" end="00:16:08.960" style="s2">and see because now things are lit in a</p>

<p begin="00:16:08.960" end="00:16:15.890" style="s2">dark to you now of course there&#39;s other</p>

<p begin="00:16:15.890" end="00:16:19.850" style="s2">when the awakening is also a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.200" end="00:16:22.700" style="s2">because that&#39;s again if you think</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.850" end="00:16:24.560" style="s2">when you wake up your this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.700" end="00:16:26.840" style="s2">comprehensive transformation of your</p>

<p begin="00:16:26.840" end="00:16:31.850" style="s2">only sort of liberating you from the</p>

<p begin="00:16:31.850" end="00:16:36.650" style="s2">you exploring and entering into a</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.650" end="00:16:42.610" style="s2">and and so I think not only should we as</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.100" end="00:16:45.200" style="s2">you said not only should we keep</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.610" end="00:16:47.210" style="s2">continuity with this historical heritage</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.200" end="00:16:50.060" style="s2">because we want to be able to connect</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.210" end="00:16:52.820" style="s2">that literature it might not be as</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.060" end="00:16:54.830" style="s2">theoretically valuable as we people</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.820" end="00:16:57.350" style="s2">might think but as we&#39;ve just said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.830" end="00:16:59.330" style="s2">sappy enchilada training valuable as</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.350" end="00:17:01.250" style="s2">training value is undeniable and we also</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.330" end="00:17:03.350" style="s2">want to keep I think the connection with</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.250" end="00:17:05.150" style="s2">this language precisely because that</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.350" end="00:17:06.800" style="s2">language the terms of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.150" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">optimization I think should be paired</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.800" end="00:17:10.760" style="s2">with things like enlightenment because</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:12.589" style="s2">cognitive opponet optimization gives</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.760" end="00:17:13.910" style="s2">priority to the functional aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.589" end="00:17:16.100" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about terms like</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.910" end="00:17:17.839" style="s2">enlightenment gives priority to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.100" end="00:17:19.220" style="s2">existential and the phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.839" end="00:17:21.199" style="s2">aspects of what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.220" end="00:17:24.800" style="s2">right different languages for different</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.199" end="00:17:27.439" style="s2">times for this yes yeah so one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.800" end="00:17:29.660" style="s2">want to talk about a little bit but is</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.439" end="00:17:31.130" style="s2">relevant because recently I watched one</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.660" end="00:17:33.170" style="s2">of your conversations with Jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.130" end="00:17:35.510" style="s2">Paige oh yes and there was a point where</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.170" end="00:17:36.980" style="s2">you had mentioned oh I&#39;m not taking an</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.510" end="00:17:38.060" style="s2">eclectic approach to this and he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.980" end="00:17:40.340" style="s2">laughed and said I don&#39;t know about that</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.060" end="00:17:42.490" style="s2">John yes so I want to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.340" end="00:17:45.320" style="s2">differences between the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.490" end="00:17:47.540" style="s2">autodidactic new-age eclecticism you</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.320" end="00:17:48.920" style="s2">mentioned the perennialism of Huxley</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.540" end="00:17:50.450" style="s2">it was kind of like the opposite yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.920" end="00:17:51.860" style="s2">those two poles I want to avoid both</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.450" end="00:17:54.230" style="s2">yeah so let&#39;s unstrap a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.860" end="00:17:57.860" style="s2">that where are we fitting into those</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.230" end="00:18:00.380" style="s2">bowls so I mean I for me and I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.860" end="00:18:01.730" style="s2">this is also the case for you the model</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.380" end="00:18:05.420" style="s2">that I take from this is the model from</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.730" end="00:18:07.700" style="s2">cognitive science and so as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.420" end="00:18:09.410" style="s2">collective system I argue that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.700" end="00:18:11.180" style="s2">sort of the the most powerful the most</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.410" end="00:18:14.900" style="s2">prescriptive vision of cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.180" end="00:18:16.490" style="s2">is one of synoptic integration and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.900" end="00:18:19.520" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to do as a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.490" end="00:18:21.650" style="s2">scientist is I&#39;m trying to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.520" end="00:18:23.630" style="s2">the fact that we have all these</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.650" end="00:18:26.780" style="s2">specialized disciplines that study</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.630" end="00:18:29.020" style="s2">different acts aspects or levels of the</p>

<p begin="00:19:25.880" end="00:19:30.710" style="s2">need a discipline that does synoptic</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.039" end="00:19:33.919" style="s2">integration it tries to of provide a</p>

<p begin="00:20:09.169" end="00:20:12.380" style="s2">back towards sort of an integrative</p>

<p begin="00:20:17.600" end="00:20:21.380" style="s2">that picks up on the interactions we</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.370" end="00:20:23.600" style="s2">also need to go back down into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.380" end="00:20:25.070" style="s2">particular disciplines for what their</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:29.029" style="s2">particular knowledge about what each</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.070" end="00:20:31.850" style="s2">level is doing and I propose that we are</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.029" end="00:20:33.890" style="s2">using that same model when we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.850" end="00:20:36.049" style="s2">to explain the cognitive continuum we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.890" end="00:20:38.149" style="s2">using the current scientific method of</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.049" end="00:20:40.580" style="s2">trying to afford a synoptic integration</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.149" end="00:20:41.990" style="s2">for example between these discourses</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.580" end="00:20:44.389" style="s2">that have to do with the phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.990" end="00:20:46.010" style="s2">and training and between the discourses</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.389" end="00:20:46.430" style="s2">that have to do with the functionality</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.010" end="00:20:48.500" style="s2">it makes</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.430" end="00:20:50.210" style="s2">right so something that I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.500" end="00:20:51.650" style="s2">about just yesterday as I was working on</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.210" end="00:20:53.030" style="s2">some of the writing is that it seems</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.650" end="00:20:54.920" style="s2">that one thing we might actually be</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.030" end="00:20:56.390" style="s2">doing is pulling another set of</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.920" end="00:20:57.800" style="s2">disciplines into this synoptic</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.390" end="00:21:00.110" style="s2">integration process and that would be</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.800" end="00:21:01.850" style="s2">the more spiritual and philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.110" end="00:21:03.470" style="s2">oriented traditions which are much more</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.850" end="00:21:05.870" style="s2">pragmatically oriented yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.470" end="00:21:08.060" style="s2">and I think I mean well philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.870" end="00:21:10.130" style="s2">itself has a huge and important role</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.060" end="00:21:11.870" style="s2">within cognitive science precisely</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.130" end="00:21:14.780" style="s2">because one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.870" end="00:21:17.180" style="s2">philosophy has been very good at is</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.780" end="00:21:19.670" style="s2">exactly this process of trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.180" end="00:21:21.800" style="s2">different domains of discourse and human</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.670" end="00:21:23.630" style="s2">endeavor and human existence to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.800" end="00:21:25.070" style="s2">each other reliably you can even see</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.630" end="00:21:26.660" style="s2">this in ancient philosophy the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.070" end="00:21:28.040" style="s2">philosophers are trying to say well you</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.660" end="00:21:30.170" style="s2">know how does our ethics and our</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.040" end="00:21:32.000" style="s2">knowledge and our relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.170" end="00:21:33.920" style="s2">gods and how do we get these to all talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.000" end="00:21:37.160" style="s2">to each other so there&#39;s some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.920" end="00:21:40.190" style="s2">coherent integrated life that is livable</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.160" end="00:21:42.230" style="s2">for us hmm stoicism in particular is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.190" end="00:21:42.530" style="s2">good example of that yes Platonism as</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.230" end="00:21:44.810" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.530" end="00:21:46.760" style="s2">yes very much oriented on living the</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.810" end="00:21:48.050" style="s2">good life yes very much and if we have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.760" end="00:21:49.610" style="s2">discipline of studying the mind then</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.050" end="00:21:52.040" style="s2">like why would we also not want to study</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.610" end="00:21:54.050" style="s2">the good life as well I think I think a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.040" end="00:21:56.300" style="s2">good analogy in the ancient world in</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.050" end="00:21:58.100" style="s2">fact for modern cognitive science is</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.300" end="00:22:02.140" style="s2">ancient philosophy because ancient</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.100" end="00:22:05.240" style="s2">philosophy isn&#39;t as limited in its scope</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.140" end="00:22:06.950" style="s2">and self-identification as modern</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.240" end="00:22:08.750" style="s2">academic philosophy I believe in modern</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.950" end="00:22:10.550" style="s2">academic philosophy I&#39;m not criticizing</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.750" end="00:22:13.280" style="s2">you and you do too obviously but what I</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.550" end="00:22:15.680" style="s2">mean is in ancient philosophy you you</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.280" end="00:22:17.690" style="s2">had something much more like the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.680" end="00:22:19.340" style="s2">integration of what you might call</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.690" end="00:22:21.650" style="s2">modern conceptual analysis and</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.340" end="00:22:24.110" style="s2">theorization with you know what hadou</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.650" end="00:22:27.020" style="s2">calls Spiritual Exercises so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.110" end="00:22:28.910" style="s2">psychology and sort of philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.020" end="00:22:30.380" style="s2">the best science of the time and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.910" end="00:22:32.930" style="s2">best training practices the best</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.380" end="00:22:34.820" style="s2">pedagogy how to educate people how to</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.930" end="00:22:37.250" style="s2">how to inspire them to aspire you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.820" end="00:22:38.750" style="s2">doing much much more and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.250" end="00:22:40.580" style="s2">a little bit closer analogy from</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.750" end="00:22:41.780" style="s2">cognitive sciences in fact what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.580" end="00:22:43.070" style="s2">kind of doing I think what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.780" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">suggesting is we&#39;re taking cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.070" end="00:22:46.280" style="s2">science and we&#39;re trying to bring in</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:49.040" style="s2">that that missing piece of inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.280" end="00:22:51.110" style="s2">people to aspiration and to afford them</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.040" end="00:22:52.370" style="s2">actually training that you see present</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.110" end="00:22:53.570" style="s2">in ancient philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.370" end="00:22:56.150" style="s2">I would definitely concur with that</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.570" end="00:22:58.430" style="s2">definitely there is a lot of benefit to</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.150" end="00:23:00.380" style="s2">bringing back this sort of integrative</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.430" end="00:23:01.670" style="s2">approach and on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.380" end="00:23:04.370" style="s2">the integrative approach I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.670" end="00:23:08.510" style="s2">a really good jumping point to talk</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.370" end="00:23:11.480" style="s2">about the role of mystical experiences</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.510" end="00:23:13.190" style="s2">and also how various traditions have</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.480" end="00:23:15.650" style="s2">gone about the process of particular</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.190" end="00:23:17.900" style="s2">izing those mystical experiences to fit</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.650" end="00:23:20.030" style="s2">the context of their time there was a</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.900" end="00:23:22.070" style="s2">conversation that you had recently which</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.030" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">you posted on your channel about this</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.070" end="00:23:27.020" style="s2">sort of religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.840" end="00:23:29.240" style="s2">yes one of the ideas that really stood</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.020" end="00:23:31.910" style="s2">out to me about that video was the idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.240" end="00:23:33.050" style="s2">of the trade-off between compression and</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.910" end="00:23:36.200" style="s2">particular ization</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.050" end="00:23:38.270" style="s2">yet in the process of taking a more sort</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.200" end="00:23:41.210" style="s2">of mystical experience all engaged</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.270" end="00:23:45.410" style="s2">approach to a spiritual tradition or</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.210" end="00:23:47.510" style="s2">philosophy so one thing to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.410" end="00:23:49.610" style="s2">that discussion about perennialism</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.510" end="00:23:52.340" style="s2">versus eclecticism one thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.610" end="00:23:55.250" style="s2">really important to notice is that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.340" end="00:23:56.720" style="s2">various spiritual traditions which are</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.250" end="00:23:58.400" style="s2">oriented towards something like</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.720" end="00:24:00.440" style="s2">enlightenment and admittedly they use</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.400" end="00:24:01.790" style="s2">different terminology format so just by</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.440" end="00:24:04.010" style="s2">using enlightenment we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.790" end="00:24:05.900" style="s2">applying an integrative norm by saying</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.010" end="00:24:08.810" style="s2">well you know let&#39;s explain these things</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.900" end="00:24:12.920" style="s2">by collecting the invariance and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.810" end="00:24:14.540" style="s2">our definition but it&#39;s also important</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.920" end="00:24:16.130" style="s2">to note which particular traditions are</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.540" end="00:24:17.390" style="s2">good for which things right so if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.130" end="00:24:19.310" style="s2">look at Christianity and Buddhism which</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.390" end="00:24:20.840" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be contrasting there are</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.310" end="00:24:23.450" style="s2">certain trends of interpretation in</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.840" end="00:24:26.960" style="s2">those which are exactly the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.450" end="00:24:29.690" style="s2">right so Buddha comes from a rich family</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.960" end="00:24:31.700" style="s2">and he decides to leave that to live in</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.690" end="00:24:33.620" style="s2">a sea decline he has first off the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.700" end="00:24:34.130" style="s2">choice to do that and he has material</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.620" end="00:24:36.020" style="s2">comfort</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.130" end="00:24:38.360" style="s2">whereas Christ as somebody who&#39;s coming</p>

<p begin="00:25:29.240" end="00:25:32.300" style="s2">something like a perennialism going on</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.160" end="00:25:34.790" style="s2">because we all have the same</p>

<p begin="00:25:51.410" end="00:25:56.840" style="s2">know there is a perennial state of mind</p>

<p begin="00:26:04.130" end="00:26:07.670" style="s2">different just because of the society in</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.750" end="00:26:09.260" style="s2">which she lives and so the approach that</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.670" end="00:26:11.630" style="s2">becomes dominant there is what buglar</p>

<p begin="00:26:11.630" end="00:26:15.020" style="s2">lived in a very rigid hierarchical</p>

<p begin="00:26:15.020" end="00:26:19.820" style="s2">really very possible so he sets aside a</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.570" end="00:26:21.680" style="s2">place outside of society to which people</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.820" end="00:26:23.840" style="s2">go and we work on just overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.680" end="00:26:26.390" style="s2">attachment overcoming desire and just</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.840" end="00:26:28.190" style="s2">being simply happy here and now the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.390" end="00:26:30.830" style="s2">Christian view on the other hand very</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.190" end="00:26:33.980" style="s2">very different it&#39;s something that many</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.830" end="00:26:35.930" style="s2">thinkers have argued has informed the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.980" end="00:26:38.060" style="s2">products of modern liberalism and</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.930" end="00:26:40.610" style="s2">romanticism etc it&#39;s hard to divorce</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.060" end="00:26:42.800" style="s2">those from the religious history and</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.610" end="00:26:44.960" style="s2">within the Christian view there&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.800" end="00:26:47.240" style="s2">more of an imperative on transforming</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.960" end="00:26:48.410" style="s2">the world right so Buddhism is very much</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.240" end="00:26:50.960" style="s2">transform the self</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.410" end="00:26:52.610" style="s2">whereas in Christianity you have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.960" end="00:26:55.100" style="s2">participate in a community and actively</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.610" end="00:26:57.320" style="s2">transform your relationships and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.100" end="00:26:58.550" style="s2">society such that it is more worthy of</p>

<p begin="00:26:58.550" end="00:27:03.980" style="s2">judgement and so one thing that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.360" end="00:27:05.930" style="s2">to become apparent in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.980" end="00:27:08.240" style="s2">this book is that we&#39;re gonna be taking</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.930" end="00:27:11.690" style="s2">lessons from different traditions based</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.240" end="00:27:14.360" style="s2">on which ones have the best language to</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.690" end="00:27:16.550" style="s2">explain and promote engagement with a</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.360" end="00:27:18.680" style="s2">particular issue Buddhism for example</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.550" end="00:27:20.510" style="s2">and parasitic processing go very well</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.680" end="00:27:22.220" style="s2">together yes you know that&#39;s you had a</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.510" end="00:27:25.430" style="s2">whole episode on that denier awakened</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.220" end="00:27:26.480" style="s2">the meeting crisis series but again for</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.430" end="00:27:27.720" style="s2">Christianity there&#39;s other problems</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:29.039" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.720" end="00:27:31.020" style="s2">tradition is a little bit better suited</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.039" end="00:27:34.380" style="s2">to responsive I think that&#39;s excellent</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.020" end="00:27:36.990" style="s2">so one way of thinking about that and</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.380" end="00:27:39.059" style="s2">that&#39;s to do with sort of broader scope</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.990" end="00:27:41.730" style="s2">of my work you&#39;ve heard me use this</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.059" end="00:27:43.919" style="s2">analogy before is evolution by natural</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.730" end="00:27:47.039" style="s2">selection and the idea is there are</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.919" end="00:27:49.559" style="s2">perennial aspects as you said because</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.039" end="00:27:51.090" style="s2">across all environments creatures have</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.559" end="00:27:55.470" style="s2">to adapt they have to survive that to</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.090" end="00:27:57.090" style="s2">reproduce and so what Darwin does is he</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.470" end="00:28:00.150" style="s2">comes up with the sort of universal</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.090" end="00:28:02.730" style="s2">principles by which that process occurs</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.150" end="00:28:04.710" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that all of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.730" end="00:28:07.409" style="s2">particular adaptations are homogeneous</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.710" end="00:28:10.020" style="s2">in fact what it predicts is exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.409" end="00:28:12.090" style="s2">opposite in this context right this</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.020" end="00:28:14.190" style="s2">niche adaptivity we&#39;ll look this way</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.090" end="00:28:16.980" style="s2">well having this morphology in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.190" end="00:28:18.809" style="s2">right so it&#39;s neither it&#39;s neither a</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.980" end="00:28:20.880" style="s2">kind of perennialism that every every</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.809" end="00:28:23.580" style="s2">every every creature because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.880" end="00:28:25.470" style="s2">adaptive is altima the same but neither</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.580" end="00:28:28.500" style="s2">is it a kind of relativism or</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.470" end="00:28:30.870" style="s2">eclecticism it&#39;s no no no the very fact</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.500" end="00:28:33.289" style="s2">that they&#39;re so well suited to these</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.870" end="00:28:36.929" style="s2">varying environments can be given a</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.289" end="00:28:38.070" style="s2">comprehensive integrated explanation and</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.929" end="00:28:40.070" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly I think what we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.070" end="00:28:42.840" style="s2">to do here we&#39;re trying to show that</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.070" end="00:28:45.059" style="s2">synaptic integration tries to get both</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.840" end="00:28:47.820" style="s2">of those it tries to say there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.059" end="00:28:50.909" style="s2">aspects that we can explain that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.820" end="00:28:53.309" style="s2">universal in the processing but because</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.909" end="00:28:56.130" style="s2">of the nature of our explanation that</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.309" end="00:28:59.100" style="s2">will predict that we should see that</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.130" end="00:29:02.059" style="s2">right the various instantiations are</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.100" end="00:29:04.710" style="s2">going to be fitted to their historical</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.059" end="00:29:05.789" style="s2">cultural context right Clayton is I</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.710" end="00:29:07.799" style="s2">think it&#39;s us a really good language for</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.789" end="00:29:11.640" style="s2">sort of grappling with this problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.799" end="00:29:14.280" style="s2">there is this sort of universal simple</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.640" end="00:29:17.460" style="s2">one which everyone can happen to contact</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.280" end="00:29:20.450" style="s2">with but its nature is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.460" end="00:29:23.100" style="s2">absolutely simple absolutely good and</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.450" end="00:29:25.080" style="s2">simplicity is just fundamentally opposed</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.100" end="00:29:27.120" style="s2">to the kind of world that we live in</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.080" end="00:29:30.020" style="s2">it&#39;s like the opposite almost we live in</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.120" end="00:29:33.210" style="s2">the world of maximal complexity thus</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.020" end="00:29:36.679" style="s2">simply residing in the unit of bliss of</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.210" end="00:29:39.899" style="s2">that simplistic unit of frame of mind</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.679" end="00:29:40.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really allow you the license to</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.899" end="00:29:42.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.200" end="00:29:44.820" style="s2">and collapse all particularity of</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.000" end="00:29:46.289" style="s2">complexity into that that&#39;s not where we</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.820" end="00:29:47.940" style="s2">live right now I live in the world of</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.289" end="00:29:51.090" style="s2">complexity in fact I think it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.940" end="00:29:53.909" style="s2">what you see in evolution where you get</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.090" end="00:29:55.799" style="s2">you know variation and then selection on</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.909" end="00:29:57.720" style="s2">it or what you see in machine learning</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.799" end="00:29:59.940" style="s2">you get variation and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.720" end="00:30:01.980" style="s2">compression and then but you cycle you</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.940" end="00:30:03.809" style="s2">cycle and that&#39;s part of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.980" end="00:30:06.240" style="s2">arguing to right that you shouldn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.809" end="00:30:09.720" style="s2">should what you should see is that this</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.240" end="00:30:11.850" style="s2">state as you say of unity isn&#39;t to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.720" end="00:30:14.519" style="s2">equated with the cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.850" end="00:30:16.909" style="s2">it&#39;s actually the ability to cycle and</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.519" end="00:30:20.250" style="s2">open just enhance your overall activity</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.909" end="00:30:21.750" style="s2">that&#39;s what that is how these states can</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.250" end="00:30:24.029" style="s2">actually contribute to enlightenment and</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.750" end="00:30:27.960" style="s2">and and that goes towards our point that</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.029" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">we are not just taking sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.960" end="00:30:31.320" style="s2">traditional meanings of enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:32.909" style="s2">where we&#39;re doing we&#39;re treating them</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.320" end="00:30:34.980" style="s2">with respect but we&#39;re not just taking</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.909" end="00:30:36.809" style="s2">them again because of the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.980" end="00:30:38.279" style="s2">phenomenological language of training</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.809" end="00:30:40.289" style="s2">we&#39;re actually giving sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.279" end="00:30:43.409" style="s2">operational definition of enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.289" end="00:30:46.139" style="s2">in terms of its ability right - we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:31:18.090" end="00:31:22.740" style="s2">sort of like well this is what we need</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.620" end="00:31:25.080" style="s2">enlightenment to do because given the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.740" end="00:31:26.190" style="s2">nature of the machinery the adaptive</p>

<p begin="00:31:35.970" end="00:31:40.620" style="s2">going to be a component of that that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.909" end="00:31:42.179" style="s2">can sort of specify in universal terms</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.620" end="00:31:43.289" style="s2">and then we&#39;re going to predict whether</p>

<p begin="00:31:45.630" end="00:31:50.279" style="s2">is going to be specified I think it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:32:23.000" end="00:32:25.370" style="s2">metaphors are sort of a networking of</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.440" end="00:32:27.889" style="s2">various things that have happened in</p>

<p begin="00:32:27.889" end="00:32:31.880" style="s2">this example because it&#39;s one of my</p>

<p begin="00:32:37.010" end="00:32:40.820" style="s2">profound and so powerful you barely even</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:43.029" style="s2">have to try to make it happen especially</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.820" end="00:32:45.260" style="s2">if you are under the influence of</p>

<p begin="00:32:45.260" end="00:32:48.740" style="s2">psilocybin and these things that allow</p>

<p begin="00:32:48.740" end="00:32:55.970" style="s2">of order there is a paper that was</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.799" end="00:32:59.059" style="s2">published in 2017 I think it was and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.970" end="00:33:02.029" style="s2">authors were merely exploring whether or</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.059" end="00:33:03.799" style="s2">not the imagery in the LSD experience</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.029" end="00:33:06.049" style="s2">was similar to the imagery that comes up</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.799" end="00:33:07.610" style="s2">in dreams so they&#39;re trying to look at a</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.049" end="00:33:10.580" style="s2">measure which is called cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.610" end="00:33:13.610" style="s2">bizarreness it&#39;s like an okay measure</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.580" end="00:33:15.980" style="s2">but very subjective of course you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.610" end="00:33:19.639" style="s2">to have a number of writers decide if</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.980" end="00:33:22.130" style="s2">it&#39;s bizarre or not so one of the people</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.639" end="00:33:24.559" style="s2">who are in this study they have no</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.130" end="00:33:26.269" style="s2">mental health conditions they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.559" end="00:33:27.320" style="s2">know just average as normal as you could</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.269" end="00:33:29.590" style="s2">possibly get because we&#39;re just looking</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.320" end="00:33:32.840" style="s2">at this very basic functional thing and</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.590" end="00:33:34.340" style="s2">they ask very minimal questions so</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.840" end="00:33:35.990" style="s2">they&#39;ll have it the researcher in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.340" end="00:33:37.370" style="s2">room and he&#39;ll just be like oh what do</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.990" end="00:33:40.789" style="s2">you see what next</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.370" end="00:33:42.769" style="s2">etc and so one of the participants has</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.789" end="00:33:45.590" style="s2">the following experience he says okay so</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.769" end="00:33:47.120" style="s2">I&#39;m in a field and I see there&#39;s a beach</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.590" end="00:33:48.799" style="s2">over there and it&#39;s a pirate ship I</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.120" end="00:33:49.909" style="s2">gotta go hang out in the pirate ship all</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.799" end="00:33:51.980" style="s2">right now I&#39;m in the basement of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.909" end="00:33:53.720" style="s2">pirate ship and there is a treasure</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.980" end="00:33:56.450" style="s2">chest I can open this treasure chest and</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.720" end="00:33:58.880" style="s2">it&#39;s empty and oh my god I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.450" end="00:34:00.320" style="s2">focusing too much of my time on work and</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.880" end="00:34:01.580" style="s2">neglecting my relationships I really</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.320" end="00:34:05.120" style="s2">need to go like tell my wife that I love</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.580" end="00:34:07.810" style="s2">her it&#39;s so funny like no intention at</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.120" end="00:34:09.130" style="s2">all but already his imagination is just</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.810" end="00:34:11.800" style="s2">Italy structured in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.130" end="00:34:13.290" style="s2">there are meaningful insights lurking</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.800" end="00:34:16.830" style="s2">just beneath the surface of this imagery</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.290" end="00:34:19.300" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s amazing I think I</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.830" end="00:34:21.070" style="s2">mean if you think about it that that</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.300" end="00:34:22.870" style="s2">movement between compression and</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.070" end="00:34:25.600" style="s2">particular ization well this is part of</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.870" end="00:34:28.690" style="s2">what we argue it has a lot to do with</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.600" end="00:34:30.100" style="s2">the processes you need and in solving an</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.690" end="00:34:32.170" style="s2">inside problem not to break up in an</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.100" end="00:34:33.730" style="s2">appropriate frame if to expand back out</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.170" end="00:34:35.410" style="s2">but then you have to come back in and</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.730" end="00:34:38.320" style="s2">you can even see that be playing out and</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.410" end="00:34:39.940" style="s2">ships between the hemisphere between you</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.320" end="00:34:42.160" style="s2">know the left hemisphere which tends to</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.940" end="00:34:44.530" style="s2">emphasize details step-by-step program</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.160" end="00:34:46.090" style="s2">progress the right hemisphere that tends</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.530" end="00:34:48.430" style="s2">to emphasize the squished all trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.090" end="00:34:50.140" style="s2">gather it all together and what insight</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.430" end="00:34:52.540" style="s2">is is not to be in one place or the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.140" end="00:34:55.660" style="s2">other but to have this optimal kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.540" end="00:34:58.930" style="s2">movement between them but also you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.660" end="00:35:03.460" style="s2">if we want to ask well why exactly does</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.930" end="00:35:05.620" style="s2">the state of mystical insight feel as</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.460" end="00:35:07.120" style="s2">though it&#39;s so infused with truth that</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.620" end="00:35:09.760" style="s2">our normal everyday experience isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.120" end="00:35:11.530" style="s2">well the right temporal lobe is also</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.760" end="00:35:13.540" style="s2">something that processes comprehension</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.530" end="00:35:15.790" style="s2">right there is hemispheric</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.540" end="00:35:17.110" style="s2">lateralization in much of your</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.790" end="00:35:18.340" style="s2">processing especially when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.110" end="00:35:20.860" style="s2">things like language and sense making</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.340" end="00:35:21.850" style="s2">and your left hemisphere is more</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.860" end="00:35:23.110" style="s2">specialized in the production of</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.850" end="00:35:24.490" style="s2">language which whereas the right is more</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.110" end="00:35:26.320" style="s2">specialized in the comprehension of</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.490" end="00:35:27.820" style="s2">language so you&#39;re basically having like</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.320" end="00:35:29.560" style="s2">a tiny seizure in the area of your brain</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.820" end="00:35:30.520" style="s2">that processes comprehension so of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.560" end="00:35:32.710" style="s2">course you&#39;re gonna feel Oh</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.520" end="00:35:34.900" style="s2">comprehension just immersing everything</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.710" end="00:35:38.230" style="s2">because that&#39;s where the source of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.900" end="00:35:40.600" style="s2">moment is coming from yeah and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.230" end="00:35:42.870" style="s2">that that because it tends to move to</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.600" end="00:35:47.560" style="s2">that more Gestalt which overall</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.870" end="00:35:49.870" style="s2">integration that&#39;s also paired up with a</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.560" end="00:35:52.360" style="s2">sense of not just comprehension but</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.870" end="00:35:55.540" style="s2">importance because the Gestalt things</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.360" end="00:35:56.920" style="s2">were usually these are areas where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.540" end="00:35:58.570" style="s2">dealing with very messy ill-defined</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.920" end="00:36:03.040" style="s2">problems often that have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.570" end="00:36:04.720" style="s2">urgency to them so when so the left</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.040" end="00:36:07.000" style="s2">hemisphere is very good at handling</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.720" end="00:36:09.630" style="s2">there&#39;s familiar well-defined problems</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.000" end="00:36:11.860" style="s2">the right hemisphere is much better for</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.630" end="00:36:14.200" style="s2">unfamiliar ill-defined things and</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.860" end="00:36:15.970" style="s2">typically unfamiliar they&#39;ll defined</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.200" end="00:36:18.010" style="s2">things are either very threatening or</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.970" end="00:36:21.400" style="s2">very wonderful and therefore they carry</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.010" end="00:36:23.080" style="s2">with them you sort of they portend</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.400" end="00:36:24.010" style="s2">since right and important so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.080" end="00:36:25.840" style="s2">only that you&#39;re getting sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.010" end="00:36:27.430" style="s2">enhanced sense of intelligibility you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.840" end="00:36:32.440" style="s2">getting an enhanced sense of oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.430" end="00:36:34.030" style="s2">really important but as we&#39;ve said like</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.440" end="00:36:35.500" style="s2">if you get caught up with the imagery</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.030" end="00:36:36.700" style="s2">and thinking it&#39;s giving you a literal</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.500" end="00:36:39.070" style="s2">account you can get my stuff but if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.700" end="00:36:41.410" style="s2">realize oh but that sense of importance</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.070" end="00:36:44.950" style="s2">is actually if it&#39;s true of you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.410" end="00:36:46.810" style="s2">solving problems then something really</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.950" end="00:36:49.260" style="s2">significant in terms of training you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.810" end="00:36:52.030" style="s2">processing is going on so for example we</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.260" end="00:36:54.700" style="s2">following earlier work that I&#39;ve done we</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.030" end="00:36:57.310" style="s2">argue that you know what you can do is</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.700" end="00:36:58.810" style="s2">you can trim you can chain a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.310" end="00:37:01.210" style="s2">insights together into getting an</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.810" end="00:37:03.580" style="s2">insight cascade where one insight sort</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.210" end="00:37:05.290" style="s2">of you know provides and provokes</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.580" end="00:37:06.430" style="s2">another one and so on and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.290" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">people doing this when they&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.430" end="00:37:10.450" style="s2">jazz right or when they&#39;re rock climbing</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:11.860" style="s2">or when you&#39;re sparring and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.450" end="00:37:13.450" style="s2">and that&#39;s when you primarily get into a</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.860" end="00:37:15.070" style="s2">flow state by doing that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.450" end="00:37:17.470" style="s2">now the thing about the flow state is</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.070" end="00:37:19.720" style="s2">you know chicks have Mahad calls it</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.470" end="00:37:21.340" style="s2">optimal experiences it&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.720" end="00:37:23.320" style="s2">related to our ideas of optimal gripping</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.340" end="00:37:25.000" style="s2">of reality right now because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.320" end="00:37:26.620" style="s2">optimal in two ways both people regard</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.000" end="00:37:28.180" style="s2">it is a really great experience not</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.620" end="00:37:30.880" style="s2">pleasurable but more this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.180" end="00:37:33.070" style="s2">discovery and importance and at one mid</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.880" end="00:37:34.390" style="s2">with reality but also this is where well</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.070" end="00:37:36.430" style="s2">think of the jazz musician or the</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.390" end="00:37:37.840" style="s2">athlete in the zone or the martial</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.430" end="00:37:40.090" style="s2">artist or the rock climbing I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.840" end="00:37:41.770" style="s2">athletes try to get into the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.090" end="00:37:44.770" style="s2">precisely because it&#39;s also optimal</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.770" end="00:37:47.050" style="s2">performance and that&#39;s ultimately what</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.770" end="00:37:48.520" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get point people towards</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.050" end="00:37:50.800" style="s2">thinking about this more in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.520" end="00:37:53.650" style="s2">optimal performance rather than you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.800" end="00:37:56.530" style="s2">the the semantic veracity of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.650" end="00:37:57.610" style="s2">propositions so the nature enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.530" end="00:38:00.670" style="s2">one thing that we&#39;re arguing is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.610" end="00:38:02.920" style="s2">well it&#39;s not let me a property we have</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.670" end="00:38:04.750" style="s2">in the historical discourse claims</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.920" end="00:38:07.240" style="s2">bottom line to people but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.750" end="00:38:09.580" style="s2">seem that enlightenment is best</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.240" end="00:38:11.110" style="s2">described as a property that a person</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.580" end="00:38:14.530" style="s2">can obtain and if you look at for</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.110" end="00:38:16.090" style="s2">example the christian the orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.530" end="00:38:19.270" style="s2">christian writer from the 4th century</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.090" end="00:38:23.050" style="s2">gregory eveness is it was what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.270" end="00:38:25.210" style="s2">heard ok so he talks about epic TASIS</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.050" end="00:38:26.950" style="s2">that&#39;s correct right so that was great I</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.210" end="00:38:29.740" style="s2">I&#39;m glad that you threw that my</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.950" end="00:38:31.930" style="s2">direction so epic Isis is described as</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.740" end="00:38:34.360" style="s2">so it translates into like a straining</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.930" end="00:38:35.109" style="s2">towards and it&#39;s this never-ending</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.360" end="00:38:37.239" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.109" end="00:38:39.160" style="s2">of trying to keep pace with this</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.239" end="00:38:41.529" style="s2">transcendent ideal yeah it&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.160" end="00:38:44.289" style="s2">that God is the inexhaustible nosov God</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.529" end="00:38:46.480" style="s2">is is perpetually affording the self</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.289" end="00:38:48.819" style="s2">transcendence that human beings fine</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.480" end="00:38:51.880" style="s2">gives them such a tremendous sense of</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.819" end="00:38:54.009" style="s2">connectedness to what&#39;s most real so</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.880" end="00:38:58.630" style="s2">it&#39;s different from more typical</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.009" end="00:39:01.059" style="s2">mythology in which what you&#39;re what</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.630" end="00:39:02.799" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do for example perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.059" end="00:39:06.279" style="s2">in a Christian life is to get to a state</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.799" end="00:39:09.640" style="s2">of sort of blessed rest a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.279" end="00:39:11.769" style="s2">final a final place a final position of</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.640" end="00:39:14.380" style="s2">final status and epic thesis was this</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.769" end="00:39:17.140" style="s2">much this interesting idea that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.380" end="00:39:18.819" style="s2">happening is instead no no our</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.140" end="00:39:22.599" style="s2">relationship to the sacred isn&#39;t to try</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.819" end="00:39:24.849" style="s2">and finalize any kind of grasp of it and</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.599" end="00:39:27.579" style="s2">think about again but the analogy with</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.849" end="00:39:30.210" style="s2">evolution there is no final fitted &#39;no</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.579" end="00:39:32.829" style="s2">sporran isms they constantly have to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.210" end="00:39:35.680" style="s2">evolving across generations or they will</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.829" end="00:39:39.309" style="s2">fall out of sync with reality and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.680" end="00:39:41.140" style="s2">again the epic thesis is is is that idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.309" end="00:39:42.489" style="s2">and this has even picked up by people</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.140" end="00:39:44.170" style="s2">like Schlegel when he talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.489" end="00:39:46.680" style="s2">finite constantly longing for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.170" end="00:39:50.140" style="s2">infinite that well so this that this</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.680" end="00:39:52.450" style="s2">understanding and I like this which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.140" end="00:39:54.460" style="s2">why I recommended it to you because this</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.450" end="00:39:56.980" style="s2">notion of the sacredness of these</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.460" end="00:39:59.859" style="s2">experience does not give you this idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.980" end="00:40:02.440" style="s2">of well here&#39;s the final content that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.859" end="00:40:04.599" style="s2">have to hold on to it&#39;s rather no this</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.440" end="00:40:06.220" style="s2">is an ongoing performance of self</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.599" end="00:40:09.150" style="s2">transcendence and what I have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.220" end="00:40:12.400" style="s2">find out how to keep the music flowing</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.150" end="00:40:15.700" style="s2">I&#39;m glad to use the music metaphor as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.400" end="00:40:17.829" style="s2">musician very accessible I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.700" end="00:40:19.900" style="s2">really bringing a lot of my experience</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.829" end="00:40:22.480" style="s2">playing music into looking at how to</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.900" end="00:40:25.779" style="s2">work with the flow state in particular</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.480" end="00:40:27.730" style="s2">in service of this idea of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.779" end="00:40:29.470" style="s2">keeping pace with the transcendent I</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.730" end="00:40:31.239" style="s2">metaphor that I realize might be pretty</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.470" end="00:40:32.950" style="s2">good for this I hope that as science</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.239" end="00:40:35.319" style="s2">progresses it doesn&#39;t make this metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.950" end="00:40:37.239" style="s2">irrelevant but the ideal of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.319" end="00:40:39.190" style="s2">transcendent which enlightenment is</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.239" end="00:40:42.160" style="s2">oriented towards something like a black</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.190" end="00:40:43.539" style="s2">hole you can&#39;t really fully see it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.160" end="00:40:46.210" style="s2">something that is a little bit beyond</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.539" end="00:40:48.519" style="s2">our capacity to comprehend but it has an</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.210" end="00:40:49.120" style="s2">immense pole once you&#39;re in its horizon</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.519" end="00:40:50.020" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.120" end="00:40:52.780" style="s2">so they can like mint - something like</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.020" end="00:40:56.050" style="s2">that it&#39;s an ideal to aspire towards and</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.780" end="00:40:59.380" style="s2">once we do end up bringing our state of</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.050" end="00:41:03.460" style="s2">being our existential mode into pace</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.380" end="00:41:05.560" style="s2">with the event horizon of the ideal it</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.460" end="00:41:07.480" style="s2">will have more and more of a pull more</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.560" end="00:41:10.410" style="s2">and more of a feel and actually there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.480" end="00:41:12.460" style="s2">a great Buddhist symbol which is used</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.410" end="00:41:14.410" style="s2">it&#39;s showing up in tattoos a lot because</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.460" end="00:41:16.240" style="s2">it&#39;s been used a lot in these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.410" end="00:41:20.440" style="s2">sacred tattoo tradition which is famous</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.240" end="00:41:23.080" style="s2">for from Thailand but the symbol is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.440" end="00:41:26.110" style="s2">like a swirl which starts out with like</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.080" end="00:41:27.880" style="s2">a lot of layers and then eventually it</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.110" end="00:41:29.620" style="s2">breaks out of the swirl becomes a zag a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.880" end="00:41:31.750" style="s2">zigzag line and then a straight line</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.620" end="00:41:33.220" style="s2">upwards and that&#39;s supposed to describe</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.750" end="00:41:34.060" style="s2">the process of enlightenment which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.220" end="00:41:35.800" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.060" end="00:41:36.850" style="s2">I think constant but this idea we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.800" end="00:41:38.260" style="s2">getting out yes it&#39;s really complicated</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.850" end="00:41:39.490" style="s2">you&#39;re running in circles a lot but once</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.260" end="00:41:41.170" style="s2">you get it it becomes easier and easier</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.490" end="00:41:43.210" style="s2">to keep pace of it well I like the zig</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.170" end="00:41:44.710" style="s2">zagging too because the zig zagging is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.210" end="00:41:46.090" style="s2">better it sort of picks up from the</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.710" end="00:41:47.560" style="s2">compression particularization</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.090" end="00:41:49.720" style="s2">all right moving between until</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.560" end="00:41:52.840" style="s2">eventually you you you arc into some</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.720" end="00:41:55.690" style="s2">optimal optimal flow state perhaps I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.840" end="00:41:56.530" style="s2">have to include one thing I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.690" end="00:41:59.680" style="s2">do which i think is important to mention</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.530" end="00:42:01.630" style="s2">as well is to add a lot of art into this</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.680" end="00:42:03.970" style="s2">I think that&#39;s extremely relevant and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.630" end="00:42:05.890" style="s2">think that&#39;s I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.970" end="00:42:08.380" style="s2">of a godsend for our partnership because</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.890" end="00:42:11.470" style="s2">you&#39;re bringing that artistic ability in</p>

<p begin="00:42:12.760" end="00:42:17.320" style="s2">discussions I&#39;ve had with people I keep</p>

<p begin="00:42:35.830" end="00:42:41.890" style="s2">credit you can draw a meme 9da problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.880" end="00:42:44.740" style="s2">but yeah so out of more serious notes</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.890" end="00:42:47.080" style="s2">the inclusion of art is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.740" end="00:42:49.390" style="s2">something that I hope elevates people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.080" end="00:42:50.650" style="s2">experience of the book as well so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.390" end="00:42:52.180" style="s2">commissioning a number of artists to</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.650" end="00:42:53.800" style="s2">draw some pieces that are you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.180" end="00:42:55.300" style="s2">relevant to whichever perspectives we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.800" end="00:42:56.470" style="s2">trying to elucidate linguistically</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.300" end="00:42:57.940" style="s2">because if we&#39;re gonna be taking</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.470" end="00:42:59.410" style="s2">seriously the ideas that we&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.940" end="00:43:00.850" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a lot of different ways</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.410" end="00:43:02.120" style="s2">of knowing and the proposition is only</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.850" end="00:43:04.640" style="s2">one of them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.120" end="00:43:06.050" style="s2">everybody can access proposition equally</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.640" end="00:43:07.400" style="s2">it&#39;s in order to make this knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.050" end="00:43:10.910" style="s2">accessible I think it&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.400" end="00:43:13.250" style="s2">to provide also a more perspective</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.910" end="00:43:14.900" style="s2">participatory image oriented</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.250" end="00:43:16.250" style="s2">articulation of the ideas as well</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.900" end="00:43:17.390" style="s2">I agree with that totally and like I</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.250" end="00:43:19.040" style="s2">said I think it&#39;s a godsend that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.390" end="00:43:20.660" style="s2">bringing that to the book thank you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.040" end="00:43:24.290" style="s2">having a lot of fun well that&#39;s good fun</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.660" end="00:43:27.020" style="s2">helps definitely helps the aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.290" end="00:43:30.140" style="s2">aspect so perhaps maybe we should go</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.020" end="00:43:34.220" style="s2">back now and talk a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.140" end="00:43:36.110" style="s2">campaign and what you want to say about</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.220" end="00:43:39.800" style="s2">it what you want to explain about it</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.110" end="00:43:42.770" style="s2">sure so I&#39;m still sort of finalizing</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.800" end="00:43:44.690" style="s2">preparing but the campaign should be</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.770" end="00:43:46.220" style="s2">launching actually by the time this</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.690" end="00:43:47.240" style="s2">video is that will already be larger so</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.220" end="00:43:49.550" style="s2">that&#39;s not really relevant to mention</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.240" end="00:43:50.960" style="s2">what is relevant to mention is that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.550" end="00:43:54.800" style="s2">link will be in the description of this</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.960" end="00:43:57.110" style="s2">video so it&#39;ll be easy to find you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.800" end="00:43:59.930" style="s2">able to find an elaboration of all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.110" end="00:44:02.020" style="s2">the costs that are associated with this</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.930" end="00:44:05.270" style="s2">right we have to pay these artists to</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.020" end="00:44:09.710" style="s2">draw these pieces we also have to pay</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.270" end="00:44:12.740" style="s2">for the cost of actually designing the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.710" end="00:44:15.320" style="s2">layout and the cover and all said I want</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.740" end="00:44:17.630" style="s2">Daniel to have an income he&#39;s putting in</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.320" end="00:44:19.100" style="s2">lots of time and effort on this people</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.630" end="00:44:22.190" style="s2">should know though that I&#39;m not taking</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.100" end="00:44:25.190" style="s2">any income from this campaign I want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.190" end="00:44:27.530" style="s2">I wanted to go part of what you many of</p>
