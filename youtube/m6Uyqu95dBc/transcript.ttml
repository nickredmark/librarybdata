<p begin="00:01:36.479" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">uh the archetype replacing the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.680" end="00:01:43.520" style="s2">the subject</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:45.680" style="s2">in western existential philosophy i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:01:45.680" end="00:01:50.240" style="s2">okay well it it&#39;s more like in my</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.640" end="00:01:51.600" style="s2">current work i&#39;m working with youngster</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.240" end="00:01:54.320" style="s2">the case that actually gonna write</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.600" end="00:01:56.000" style="s2">together in tuscany from tomorrow on</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.320" end="00:01:56.640" style="s2">with face masks as soon as we leave the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.000" end="00:01:59.200" style="s2">house</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.640" end="00:02:00.240" style="s2">but uh what i&#39;m interested in is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.200" end="00:02:02.240" style="s2">fact that</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.240" end="00:02:03.759" style="s2">the sort of the platonist forms i think</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.240" end="00:02:04.880" style="s2">disappeared with kant</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.759" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">and and this is different between</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.880" end="00:02:07.520" style="s2">content hegel they&#39;re not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:09.280" style="s2">with hegel any longer</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.520" end="00:02:10.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s why ironically hegel opens up</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.280" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">for jung</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.640" end="00:02:14.640" style="s2">because what actually comes along after</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">fraud with jung</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.640" end="00:02:17.920" style="s2">is the understanding that the archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:20.160" style="s2">that are shaped</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.920" end="00:02:21.280" style="s2">in a sort in a more darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.160" end="00:02:23.599" style="s2">evolutionary way</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.280" end="00:02:25.599" style="s2">over long periods of time so they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.599" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">perfect forms or anything that we should</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.599" end="00:02:28.720" style="s2">aspire to</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:30.640" style="s2">rather the archetypes are you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.720" end="00:02:32.400" style="s2">survival mechanisms for the tribe as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.640" end="00:02:33.200" style="s2">whole or the society as we call it these</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.400" end="00:02:36.239" style="s2">days</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.200" end="00:02:38.640" style="s2">and uh within the celsius over 60 or 70</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.239" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">000 or even 100 000 years these</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.640" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">archetypes were developed</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:43.120" style="s2">and with the archetypes we get these</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:45.040" style="s2">different models including our</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.120" end="00:02:47.519" style="s2">personality types within the tribe</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.040" end="00:02:48.720" style="s2">that that are optimal for the survival</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.519" end="00:02:50.000" style="s2">of the society</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.720" end="00:02:52.000" style="s2">and i would say that what young</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.000" end="00:02:54.720" style="s2">discovers is that these archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.000" end="00:02:56.239" style="s2">deep inside of ourselves are the things</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.720" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">that we inherit that come</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.239" end="00:02:59.120" style="s2">come with the genetic makeup of what it</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">means to be human the social</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.120" end="00:03:04.239" style="s2">biologically developed</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:05.680" style="s2">and they are actually the forms rather</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.239" end="00:03:08.599" style="s2">than the platoonist forms</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.680" end="00:03:11.040" style="s2">so so when we talk about today we do</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.599" end="00:03:12.159" style="s2">archetypology we try to for example in</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.040" end="00:03:14.879" style="s2">men&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.159" end="00:03:16.159" style="s2">we try to map what kind of men are there</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.879" end="00:03:17.840" style="s2">starting with the priest and the king</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.159" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">being totally different and all that</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.840" end="00:03:21.040" style="s2">what kind of men are there what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.360" end="00:03:23.360" style="s2">archetypes can we live up to</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.040" end="00:03:25.440" style="s2">and aspire to be then this is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.360" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">talking about we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:28.799" style="s2">personality types actually that serve</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:30.560" style="s2">the community as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.799" end="00:03:32.799" style="s2">okay can i frame this a little before</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.560" end="00:03:34.959" style="s2">before we hear from cattle a bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.799" end="00:03:36.239" style="s2">yeah so so you know in some of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.959" end="00:03:37.360" style="s2">discussions we were</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.239" end="00:03:39.599" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the difference</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.360" end="00:03:40.799" style="s2">between freud and jung a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.599" end="00:03:42.239" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s relevant in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.799" end="00:03:43.840" style="s2">discussions and you guys are both sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.239" end="00:03:45.760" style="s2">of major freudians you&#39;ve both read</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.840" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">freud in a lot of depth and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.760" end="00:03:50.080" style="s2">and and i&#39;m i&#39;m perhaps have more</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:51.519" style="s2">experience with young and reading young</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.080" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">and his followers</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.519" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">so i&#39;d like to be educated on freud a</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:55.680" style="s2">little bit here in this conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:03:58.000" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:03:59.040" style="s2">and i&#39;d like a comparison between freud</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.000" end="00:04:00.640" style="s2">and young and i&#39;d also</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.040" end="00:04:02.319" style="s2">i&#39;d also like to know the difference</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.640" end="00:04:05.680" style="s2">between archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.319" end="00:04:08.159" style="s2">and um and platonic forms right</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.680" end="00:04:09.519" style="s2">what is the difference and and and also</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.159" end="00:04:12.480" style="s2">how does this square with this</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.519" end="00:04:13.280" style="s2">jung&#39;s idea of individuation and and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.480" end="00:04:15.599" style="s2">all that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.280" end="00:04:16.479" style="s2">okay is that a good one a lot of issues</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.599" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.479" end="00:04:20.400" style="s2">the conversation here cattle do you want</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:21.919" style="s2">to get in first and then i can pass</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.400" end="00:04:23.600" style="s2">and then i can answer to andre&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.919" end="00:04:26.880" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.600" end="00:04:28.880" style="s2">sure um i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.880" end="00:04:30.639" style="s2">i mean both just to bring it both you</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:32.400" style="s2">and i are social analysts that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.639" end="00:04:34.400" style="s2">describe it we&#39;re doing psych analysis</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.400" end="00:04:37.440" style="s2">but we imply it on society as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.400" end="00:04:39.440" style="s2">would you agree on that um well i feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:42.520" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.440" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">my i feel like the method for</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.520" end="00:04:46.479" style="s2">socio-analysis</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:47.759" style="s2">however we call it or however it um</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.479" end="00:04:52.000" style="s2">emerges</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.759" end="00:04:55.280" style="s2">um is emerging um i don&#39;t think we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.000" end="00:04:57.440" style="s2">the the freud of of socio-analysis i</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.280" end="00:04:58.479" style="s2">think it&#39;s precisely on the level of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.440" end="00:05:02.000" style="s2">method</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.479" end="00:05:03.759" style="s2">where that will occur like i always say</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.000" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">you know when it comes to people like</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.759" end="00:05:09.600" style="s2">hegel and freud for myself</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:10.880" style="s2">the reason why i rely on these figures</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.600" end="00:05:13.759" style="s2">is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.880" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">necessarily because of what they say but</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.759" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">more so</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.560" end="00:05:19.360" style="s2">because of the method they develop hegel</p>

<p begin="00:05:19.360" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">and freud develops free association as</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.080" end="00:05:27.120" style="s2">method</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">now because of that that is a useful</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.120" end="00:05:31.840" style="s2">analytic tool these are useful tools</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:33.919" style="s2">once you understand the tool of</p>

<p begin="00:05:33.919" end="00:05:38.160" style="s2">of free association</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:40.160" style="s2">you are then free to basically</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.160" end="00:05:41.919" style="s2">you could in principle forget about</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.160" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">hegel and freud and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.919" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">just use the method it&#39;s very useful um</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:50.479" style="s2">and in that sense i think that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:51.440" style="s2">method of socioanalysis is yet to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.479" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">discovered</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.440" end="00:05:56.160" style="s2">but um it&#39;s an extremely exciting</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.320" end="00:05:57.680" style="s2">possibility and something that i think a</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.160" end="00:06:00.240" style="s2">lot about</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.680" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">i agree completely and i think this</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.240" end="00:06:04.720" style="s2">opens the key to anthropology and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.240" end="00:06:06.960" style="s2">anthropology is so big these days uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.720" end="00:06:08.800" style="s2">because anthropology had a golden age</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.960" end="00:06:09.440" style="s2">secretly so in the 20th century was</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.800" end="00:06:11.840" style="s2">developed</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.440" end="00:06:12.639" style="s2">in parallel with the world of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.840" end="00:06:14.639" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.639" end="00:06:16.080" style="s2">anthropology came out of the union</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.639" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">revolution so out of the junior</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.080" end="00:06:18.800" style="s2">revolution we get the archetypes we get</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:20.800" style="s2">anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.800" end="00:06:22.400" style="s2">and we get to understand the major</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.800" end="00:06:23.919" style="s2">narratives of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.400" end="00:06:25.440" style="s2">of course i work with these narratives</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.919" end="00:06:26.960" style="s2">all the time i try to find the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:29.199" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing timeless to anything i</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.960" end="00:06:30.240" style="s2">do but the sort of long-lasting</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.199" end="00:06:32.080" style="s2">narratives that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.240" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">constantly return are the ones that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.080" end="00:06:35.919" style="s2">got used and we were known mitological</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:37.759" style="s2">and we lived in this ocean for 60 or 70</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.919" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">000 years our genes were shaped and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.759" end="00:06:40.639" style="s2">we have some other narratives that</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:41.759" style="s2">actually are very short-lived you only</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.639" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">had very recently</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.759" end="00:06:45.440" style="s2">and they&#39;re probably basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:47.440" style="s2">paradigmatic they&#39;re not here to stay</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.440" end="00:06:49.599" style="s2">for very long and that&#39;s exactly why the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.440" end="00:06:51.120" style="s2">anthropological revolution also</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.599" end="00:06:52.319" style="s2">we should emphasize that it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.120" end="00:06:54.000" style="s2">about hegel or freud but actually the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.319" end="00:06:55.759" style="s2">anthropological religion to me also</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.000" end="00:06:57.199" style="s2">points toward a golden age</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.759" end="00:06:58.960" style="s2">and this golden age we could call that</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.199" end="00:06:59.599" style="s2">social analysis i i would agree with</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.960" end="00:07:01.599" style="s2">that completely</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.599" end="00:07:03.759" style="s2">it isn&#39;t done yet i think shishik for</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.599" end="00:07:05.280" style="s2">example has started that process and i</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.759" end="00:07:06.880" style="s2">think we&#39;re sons of shishek</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.280" end="00:07:08.319" style="s2">in that sense what&#39;s the difference</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.880" end="00:07:10.720" style="s2">between socio-analysis</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.319" end="00:07:11.440" style="s2">and what you call tribal mapping you</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.720" end="00:07:13.840" style="s2">know because</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.440" end="00:07:16.400" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve talked with alexander for</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.840" end="00:07:18.400" style="s2">we have about 60 hours of podcasts and</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.400" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">i&#39;m familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.400" end="00:07:21.919" style="s2">your vocabulary alexander okay okay the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.919" end="00:07:26.560" style="s2">psychology and sociology is the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:28.240" style="s2">here so psychology attempts to be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.560" end="00:07:30.479" style="s2">science if you could ever do</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.240" end="00:07:32.319" style="s2">human sciences at all i&#39;m skeptical but</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.479" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">it&#39;s psychology greg henrique is not the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.319" end="00:07:34.960" style="s2">guys trying to do that</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.440" end="00:07:36.479" style="s2">you&#39;ve got social psychology between</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.960" end="00:07:37.680" style="s2">then you get sociology they attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.479" end="00:07:39.520" style="s2">be human sciences</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.680" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">the great thing with psych analysis is</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.520" end="00:07:43.199" style="s2">that it honestly never tries to become a</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:44.639" style="s2">science even if freud says that but</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.199" end="00:07:45.280" style="s2">that&#39;s actually what freud fails in that</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.639" end="00:07:47.120" style="s2">department</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.280" end="00:07:48.879" style="s2">or it wasn&#39;t what he intended i would</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.120" end="00:07:51.280" style="s2">say today that after la con we all know</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.879" end="00:07:53.599" style="s2">that psych analysis is an art form</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.280" end="00:07:55.759" style="s2">it&#39;s an art form of the human condition</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.599" end="00:07:57.759" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly why the attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.759" end="00:07:59.360" style="s2">not become a sociologist but rather look</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.759" end="00:08:02.120" style="s2">at yourself as a social analyst</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.360" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">is that you take the art form which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.120" end="00:08:05.520" style="s2">philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">and as soon as you move from psych</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.520" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">analysis to philosophy like</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:10.560" style="s2">lavish does for example then you</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:13.039" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.560" end="00:08:15.520" style="s2">turn psychonauts into an art form social</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.039" end="00:08:17.120" style="s2">analysis is just a needed name</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.520" end="00:08:19.039" style="s2">for something that doesn&#39;t try to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.120" end="00:08:20.720" style="s2">human science like sociology you can do</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.039" end="00:08:22.000" style="s2">sociological arguments to strengthen the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.720" end="00:08:23.919" style="s2">argument but at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.000" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">social analysis is an art form</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.919" end="00:08:27.280" style="s2">to try to understand society as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.720" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.280" end="00:08:30.639" style="s2">cattle can you um give a bit your your</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:33.599" style="s2">socio</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.639" end="00:08:34.880" style="s2">analysis you know how how your v you you</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.599" end="00:08:37.519" style="s2">view socio analysis and</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.880" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">is that in resonance with what alexander</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.519" end="00:08:41.519" style="s2">is saying in terms of it being an art</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">form and not a science</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.519" end="00:08:48.800" style="s2">well i um actually wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:52.959" style="s2">precisely affirm what alexander says</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.800" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">about this attempt of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.959" end="00:09:00.000" style="s2">and social sociological sciences um</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.399" end="00:09:01.920" style="s2">attempting to uh reduce the subject to a</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.000" end="00:09:05.519" style="s2">science i think that this</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.920" end="00:09:09.040" style="s2">is a absolute um</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.519" end="00:09:12.640" style="s2">uh humiliation um and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.040" end="00:09:14.959" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very infuriating</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:15.760" style="s2">the the reason why it&#39;s so infuriating</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.959" end="00:09:17.839" style="s2">is be is</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.760" end="00:09:20.800" style="s2">is basically because of the subjective</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.839" end="00:09:23.360" style="s2">disposition and style of scientists</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.800" end="00:09:24.399" style="s2">it&#39;s the level of arrogance it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.360" end="00:09:27.760" style="s2">level of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.399" end="00:09:29.040" style="s2">um not being able to basically know</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.760" end="00:09:32.959" style="s2">their place</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.040" end="00:09:34.959" style="s2">um and know their limits precisely</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.959" end="00:09:36.399" style="s2">is that where freud went wrong i&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.959" end="00:09:37.680" style="s2">to interrupt like is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.399" end="00:09:38.880" style="s2">alexander kind of mentioned it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.680" end="00:09:40.480" style="s2">that&#39;s what i always kind of thought i</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.880" end="00:09:42.240" style="s2">always thought well that&#39;s where a jung</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.480" end="00:09:43.040" style="s2">pic picked up from freud in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.240" end="00:09:46.560" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.040" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">because uh jung was not so um insistent</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.560" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">on on the rational and the scientific or</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.200" end="00:10:00.080" style="s2">look there are a lot here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.240" end="00:10:08.480" style="s2">freud was an absolute genius</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:10.959" style="s2">and there are many way there are many</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.480" end="00:10:13.040" style="s2">places where freud is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.959" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">but and this is so crucial and this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:18.160" style="s2">what all of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:21.519" style="s2">straw men of freud don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.160" end="00:10:24.480" style="s2">is that where freud was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.519" end="00:10:25.360" style="s2">he was always wrong in an extremely</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.360" end="00:10:31.120" style="s2">and an extremely productive way gotcha</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:32.240" style="s2">he was never he was not he was never</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.120" end="00:10:35.360" style="s2">wrong in a way</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.240" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">that misled and this is why lacan put so</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.360" end="00:10:37.600" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:39.839" style="s2">emphasis on a return to freud and a</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.600" end="00:10:41.120" style="s2">faithfulness to the concepts and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.839" end="00:10:44.240" style="s2">method of freud</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">because freud is not a place where we go</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.240" end="00:10:48.240" style="s2">and strictly identify like i said we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:49.279" style="s2">forget about freud once we understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.240" end="00:10:52.800" style="s2">the method</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.279" end="00:10:55.519" style="s2">in in that ideological sense but</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.800" end="00:10:57.279" style="s2">when it comes to making productive</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.519" end="00:10:59.600" style="s2">theoretical interventions</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.279" end="00:11:01.279" style="s2">there are many places where freud was</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.600" end="00:11:03.360" style="s2">just a little bit off</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.279" end="00:11:05.600" style="s2">where we can make huge breakthroughs</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.360" end="00:11:06.079" style="s2">yeah um and i can go into great detail</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.600" end="00:11:07.839" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.079" end="00:11:09.279" style="s2">well i know gerard also said the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.839" end="00:11:12.160" style="s2">thing about about freud</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.279" end="00:11:13.519" style="s2">he appreciated freud and appreciated his</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.160" end="00:11:14.959" style="s2">mistakes as well</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.519" end="00:11:17.360" style="s2">because he i guess freud is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.959" end="00:11:19.440" style="s2">speculative you know uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.360" end="00:11:21.279" style="s2">essayist rather than than a pure</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.440" end="00:11:23.279" style="s2">scientist in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.279" end="00:11:24.399" style="s2">the great thing about freud is that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.279" end="00:11:27.680" style="s2">an explorer</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.399" end="00:11:28.079" style="s2">and he&#39;s an explorer um that never</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.680" end="00:11:30.480" style="s2">leaves</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.079" end="00:11:32.000" style="s2">libidinal territory until he reaches the</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.480" end="00:11:34.000" style="s2">death drive and then there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.000" end="00:11:35.920" style="s2">bifurcation within psychoanalysis which</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.000" end="00:11:38.640" style="s2">is very important to understand and</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.920" end="00:11:39.519" style="s2">in the affirmation of the death drive he</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.640" end="00:11:41.760" style="s2">makes</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.519" end="00:11:43.920" style="s2">a little mistake but again a mistake in</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.760" end="00:11:44.720" style="s2">a very helpful way in a very productive</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.920" end="00:11:46.640" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.720" end="00:11:47.920" style="s2">um again we can go into all of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.640" end="00:11:50.480" style="s2">distinctions but</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.920" end="00:11:51.920" style="s2">i want to revisit your original question</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.480" end="00:11:57.120" style="s2">which was about this</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.920" end="00:12:00.399" style="s2">this um position on socioanalysis</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.120" end="00:12:04.399" style="s2">for me i&#39;m i&#39;m in a place where i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.399" end="00:12:06.320" style="s2">very open to the concepts we develop and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.399" end="00:12:07.600" style="s2">i&#39;m very open to the theory we develop</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.320" end="00:12:10.720" style="s2">because i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.600" end="00:12:12.720" style="s2">so deeply in its infancy that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.720" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">want to be premature with anything</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.720" end="00:12:16.880" style="s2">so i don&#39;t strictly identify with any of</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.880" end="00:12:18.240" style="s2">these concepts like socio-analysis</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.880" end="00:12:20.880" style="s2">necessarily i think they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.240" end="00:12:23.279" style="s2">interesting and i want to explore them</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.880" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">so it&#39;s a playful territory yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.279" end="00:12:25.440" style="s2">should add that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:27.120" style="s2">freud actually gave up on the whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.440" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">scientific thing because it eventually</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.120" end="00:12:30.240" style="s2">became psychiatry</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:32.639" style="s2">and and if you&#39;re going to talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.240" end="00:12:33.920" style="s2">science of the psyche must be psychiatry</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.639" end="00:12:35.200" style="s2">so because it tries to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.920" end="00:12:36.160" style="s2">hormones and the chemicals you got in</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.200" end="00:12:38.959" style="s2">your brain and</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.160" end="00:12:41.440" style="s2">he hardly tries to do anything else but</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.959" end="00:12:42.880" style="s2">that&#39;s why psychoanalysis i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.440" end="00:12:45.040" style="s2">jumping up from that point i think psych</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.880" end="00:12:46.959" style="s2">analysis was also freud understood</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.040" end="00:12:48.880" style="s2">as an art for more more the older he got</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.959" end="00:12:50.639" style="s2">he when he came to america in the 1930s</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.880" end="00:12:52.079" style="s2">he got sick of all the ego psychology</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.639" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">the americans were doing he felt</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.079" end="00:12:55.600" style="s2">completely misunderstood and he</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.839" end="00:12:57.839" style="s2">basically wrote books like moses and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.600" end="00:13:00.000" style="s2">monophysim in the 1930s instead he went</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.839" end="00:13:01.760" style="s2">into deep history which again he&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.000" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">explorer and it&#39;s an explorer of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.760" end="00:13:04.639" style="s2">mind he&#39;s explorer of history and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">why we love freud</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.639" end="00:13:07.600" style="s2">there&#39;s one thing can i just one</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">interjection i remember when freud and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.600" end="00:13:11.279" style="s2">young were coming over in their boat</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:12.959" style="s2">and they both said this amazing thing or</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.279" end="00:13:16.000" style="s2">freud said this amazing thing he said</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.959" end="00:13:16.720" style="s2">we&#39;re here to bring the plague so so uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.000" end="00:13:18.480" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.720" end="00:13:20.320" style="s2">i love that phrase because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.480" end="00:13:21.839" style="s2">it&#39;s like the freudian jungian</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.320" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">revolution is is so</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.839" end="00:13:26.160" style="s2">um yeah but they were all so frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:27.760" style="s2">like philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.160" end="00:13:30.639" style="s2">are they&#39;re frustrated because they knew</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.760" end="00:13:32.639" style="s2">they would be misunderstood massively</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.639" end="00:13:33.680" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem when you go from sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.639" end="00:13:37.120" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.680" end="00:13:40.240" style="s2">elite expertise which to work very</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.120" end="00:13:44.000" style="s2">hard box like i do</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.240" end="00:13:44.000" style="s2">explore these ideas and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.120" end="00:13:48.880" style="s2">just the genius of these guys hegel</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:51.199" style="s2">massively misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.880" end="00:13:52.480" style="s2">nietzsche massively misunderstood even</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.199" end="00:13:53.920" style="s2">marx i mean these guys are massively</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.480" end="00:13:54.399" style="s2">misunderstood again and again and again</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.920" end="00:13:56.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.399" end="00:13:57.199" style="s2">probably they knew that as they got</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.000" end="00:13:57.920" style="s2">older and that&#39;s what he meant when he</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.199" end="00:13:59.680" style="s2">said the plague</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.920" end="00:14:01.600" style="s2">but we can we can leave florida i agree</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.680" end="00:14:03.040" style="s2">with cattle that the interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.600" end="00:14:04.399" style="s2">is the method rather than the character</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.040" end="00:14:04.959" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna we&#39;re not gonna lick</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.399" end="00:14:06.320" style="s2">freud&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.959" end="00:14:08.000" style="s2">ass or suck a stick or anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.320" end="00:14:08.639" style="s2">just boring i mean we&#39;re not idolizing</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.000" end="00:14:09.839" style="s2">the guy</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.639" end="00:14:11.680" style="s2">we just know that there are great</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.839" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">methods coming out of these guys and</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.680" end="00:14:16.560" style="s2">if anthropology was the 20th century i</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:17.839" style="s2">coined the term social analysis to say</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:19.360" style="s2">that that could possibly be the big</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.839" end="00:14:21.120" style="s2">thing in the 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.360" end="00:14:22.560" style="s2">because we&#39;re now entering an era where</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.120" end="00:14:25.199" style="s2">man versus technology</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.560" end="00:14:26.639" style="s2">is the most interesting topic of all and</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.199" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">we cannot even</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.639" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">imagine human versus human any longer</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:33.040" style="s2">without involving technology into that</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.480" end="00:14:33.040" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.360" end="00:14:37.440" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s key i think i mean i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.079" end="00:14:39.279" style="s2">preparing</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.440" end="00:14:41.440" style="s2">the question being asked by the machine</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.279" end="00:14:42.399" style="s2">to us in 20 or 30 years time that who</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.440" end="00:14:43.839" style="s2">are you</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.399" end="00:14:45.839" style="s2">from a machete point of view what would</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.839" end="00:14:48.880" style="s2">that be in what way are we different and</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.839" end="00:14:50.560" style="s2">the answer to that short is pathos which</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.880" end="00:14:52.480" style="s2">machines do not have they cannot crack</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.560" end="00:14:55.760" style="s2">jokes and they don&#39;t jerk off</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.480" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">so they&#39;re obviously not human um and</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.760" end="00:14:58.880" style="s2">uh i think that&#39;s a good starting point</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:00.959" style="s2">but uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.880" end="00:15:02.800" style="s2">i&#39;m currently i&#39;m working with rousseau</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.000" end="00:15:07.440" style="s2">and and i&#39;ve discovered that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.760" end="00:15:10.839" style="s2">actually who</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.440" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">who we go ruth knows already russell is</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.839" end="00:15:14.240" style="s2">already i know i know but it&#39;s useful</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:16.079" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.240" end="00:15:18.240" style="s2">because because i&#39;m gonna kill the</p>

<p begin="00:15:22.800" end="00:15:26.480" style="s2">and and to do that rosso is the best</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.880" end="00:15:28.320" style="s2">personification of that in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.480" end="00:15:31.759" style="s2">enlightenment because of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.320" end="00:15:33.680" style="s2">uh amorphous and and the mu</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.759" end="00:15:36.160" style="s2">he cannot even understand gender he</p>

<p begin="00:15:40.720" end="00:15:44.320" style="s2">he ends up at being this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.320" end="00:15:45.680" style="s2">solipsistic narcissist</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.320" end="00:15:47.279" style="s2">now we&#39;ve written a lot about that</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.680" end="00:15:48.959" style="s2">certificate in the past obviously did</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.279" end="00:15:50.560" style="s2">the libidos full of this because</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.959" end="00:15:52.639" style="s2">the the problem with contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.560" end="00:15:54.480" style="s2">society is that it&#39;s basically ruled by</p>

<p begin="00:15:58.480" end="00:16:02.399" style="s2">and and look at all of narrative history</p>

<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:58.800" style="s2">this this here&#39;s the thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.720" end="00:17:01.199" style="s2">in science they call it the mind-body</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.800" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">problem since the origin of science but</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.199" end="00:17:07.360" style="s2">what it forgets is that it&#39;s body other</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:08.640" style="s2">and other is always our knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.360" end="00:17:11.360" style="s2">intersubjective</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.640" end="00:17:13.679" style="s2">and science has a huge trouble with</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.360" end="00:17:15.839" style="s2">knowledge which is intersubjective</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.679" end="00:17:17.600" style="s2">science has a huge problem with the fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.839" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">that our knowledge is constitutively</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.600" end="00:17:19.919" style="s2">grounded</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:21.520" style="s2">in inter-subjective relations and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.919" end="00:17:23.360" style="s2">trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:24.720" style="s2">uh what we are and we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.360" end="00:17:27.919" style="s2">figure out our desire</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.720" end="00:17:30.960" style="s2">through the other um and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.919" end="00:17:32.000" style="s2">in that sense to me when bard says you</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.960" end="00:17:34.160" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.000" end="00:17:35.520" style="s2">the machine isn&#39;t human because they</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.160" end="00:17:36.320" style="s2">don&#39;t jerk off and they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.520" end="00:17:39.280" style="s2">pathos</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.320" end="00:17:41.200" style="s2">what i would say is that the location of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.280" end="00:17:42.480" style="s2">pathos and the location of our most</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.200" end="00:17:44.000" style="s2">intimate fantasies</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.480" end="00:17:46.080" style="s2">is actually where we connect to</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.000" end="00:17:48.080" style="s2">something alien something that</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.080" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">is transforming us into something</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.080" end="00:17:51.120" style="s2">totally other</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:52.559" style="s2">and i think the deeper you go into your</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:54.480" style="s2">pathos the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.559" end="00:17:55.840" style="s2">the deeper you go into a dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.480" end="00:17:59.360" style="s2">yourself which</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.840" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">is so horrific to normative morality and</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.360" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">which is so</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:03.360" style="s2">horrific to the normal things that</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:06.799" style="s2">people accept</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.360" end="00:18:09.679" style="s2">among others that you transform the very</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:11.760" style="s2">nature of your style and your persona</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.679" end="00:18:13.200" style="s2">and the reason why science has such a</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.760" end="00:18:16.160" style="s2">huge trouble</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.200" end="00:18:16.880" style="s2">understanding this dimension is because</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.160" end="00:18:18.320" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.880" end="00:18:19.919" style="s2">is because it doesn&#39;t understand the</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.320" end="00:18:22.080" style="s2">dimension of others is</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.919" end="00:18:24.000" style="s2">extremely biased towards what i would</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.080" end="00:18:26.720" style="s2">call autistic subjects</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.000" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2">and autistic subjects are much different</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.720" end="00:18:30.240" style="s2">than the type of subject</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:32.559" style="s2">which psychoanalysis is concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.240" end="00:18:34.559" style="s2">which is neurotic subjects hysterical</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.559" end="00:18:35.280" style="s2">subjects perverted subjects psychotic</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.559" end="00:18:37.360" style="s2">subjects</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.280" end="00:18:39.280" style="s2">now psychoanalysis i think and a new</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.360" end="00:18:42.080" style="s2">book just came out talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.280" end="00:18:43.440" style="s2">should start to approach the reality of</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.080" end="00:18:45.760" style="s2">autistic subjects</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.440" end="00:18:47.280" style="s2">psychoanalysis should have a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.760" end="00:18:49.520" style="s2">autistic subjects</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.280" end="00:18:51.360" style="s2">if only so that we can deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.520" end="00:18:54.559" style="s2">problem of scientific knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.360" end="00:18:55.360" style="s2">being fundamentally autistic okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.559" end="00:18:57.280" style="s2">awesome yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.360" end="00:18:59.039" style="s2">and i think autism is is really related</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.280" end="00:19:00.160" style="s2">to neurosis more than hysteria because</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.039" end="00:19:02.720" style="s2">hysteria is more</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.160" end="00:19:04.000" style="s2">to do with emotions right and autism is</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.720" end="00:19:06.880" style="s2">a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.000" end="00:19:08.160" style="s2">um well we kind of sort of a hyper</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.880" end="00:19:09.679" style="s2">mental state where you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.160" end="00:19:11.280" style="s2">disconnected from from</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.679" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">all these things that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.280" end="00:19:14.880" style="s2">about yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:16.240" style="s2">i mean they&#39;re they&#39;re i think there is</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.880" end="00:19:17.919" style="s2">a meaningful distinction to be made</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.240" end="00:19:19.200" style="s2">between autism and neurosis i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.919" end="00:19:20.559" style="s2">necessarily think</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.200" end="00:19:22.320" style="s2">that the same thing but i think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.559" end="00:19:24.799" style="s2">they can definitely overlap</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:25.760" style="s2">um but the important thing i want to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.799" end="00:19:28.720" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.760" end="00:19:29.440" style="s2">um when it comes to the concern the deep</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.720" end="00:19:32.640" style="s2">concern</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.440" end="00:19:35.280" style="s2">of neurotics and uh hysterics</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.640" end="00:19:35.679" style="s2">it has to do with the domain of others</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.280" end="00:19:38.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.679" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">and this is why there&#39;s a type of off</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.400" end="00:19:42.480" style="s2">it&#39;s this is why</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.840" end="00:19:43.520" style="s2">psychoanalysis disrupts and upsets the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.480" end="00:19:46.799" style="s2">scientific</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.520" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2">universe and why science has trouble</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.799" end="00:19:51.039" style="s2">sublating psychoanalysis it basically</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.280" end="00:19:53.440" style="s2">cannot sublate psychoanalysis</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.039" end="00:19:54.559" style="s2">so it says that it&#39;s irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.440" end="00:19:57.039" style="s2">pseudoscience</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.559" end="00:19:58.799" style="s2">lacan actually has a good formula for</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.039" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2">what psychoanalysis is</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.799" end="00:20:04.240" style="s2">which is that psychoanalysis is a form</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:06.640" style="s2">of knowledge which is still emergent</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.240" end="00:20:08.240" style="s2">and which is concerned with the status</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.640" end="00:20:11.120" style="s2">of the subject in itself</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.240" end="00:20:12.080" style="s2">and which required a scientific universe</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.120" end="00:20:13.520" style="s2">to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.080" end="00:20:15.520" style="s2">so in other words science is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.520" end="00:20:16.559" style="s2">precondition for psychoanalysis but is</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.520" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">not reducing</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.559" end="00:20:21.520" style="s2">psychoanalysis that&#39;s good i agree here</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:22.960" style="s2">and this is why we do the studies on</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.520" end="00:20:24.480" style="s2">roseau here because</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.960" end="00:20:26.320" style="s2">starting with russo if you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.480" end="00:20:29.440" style="s2">sort of mass culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.320" end="00:20:31.200" style="s2">early 21st century and the the rampant</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:32.559" style="s2">hyper narcissism we have today because</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.200" end="00:20:35.039" style="s2">of the internet</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.559" end="00:20:36.400" style="s2">this goes back to the sauna you cannot</p>

<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:48.720" style="s2">would say that you can&#39;t even speak</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.600" end="00:20:49.919" style="s2">about self-love i just have loving</p>

<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:20:57.120" style="s2">and i think the key here is that he</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.400" end="00:20:58.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.120" end="00:21:00.720" style="s2">make a difference between the</p>

<p begin="00:21:00.720" end="00:21:02.559" style="s2">involved</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.440" end="00:21:04.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking a lot about this</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.559" end="00:21:06.000" style="s2">before in previous podcasts so so</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.240" end="00:21:07.039" style="s2">normatology is basically the eternal</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.000" end="00:21:08.880" style="s2">return of the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.039" end="00:21:10.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s also the unconditional love</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.880" end="00:21:13.120" style="s2">that we associate with the female body</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.880" end="00:21:14.880" style="s2">and with the material love the match our</p>

<p begin="00:21:15.679" end="00:21:18.720" style="s2">the other one is the phallic case this</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.520" end="00:21:19.200" style="s2">is supposed to be the gates of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.720" end="00:21:21.440" style="s2">father</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.200" end="00:21:23.280" style="s2">the figure or the priest or or the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.440" end="00:21:25.679" style="s2">chieftain or king if you like</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.280" end="00:21:27.600" style="s2">who would see you one day and and then</p>

<p begin="00:21:27.600" end="00:21:31.280" style="s2">towards your archetype</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.039" end="00:21:32.240" style="s2">now what&#39;s what&#39;s so misunderstood that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.280" end="00:21:35.840" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.240" end="00:21:37.039" style="s2">the phallic case it&#39;s what so i get go</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.840" end="00:21:39.039" style="s2">deeper deeper into it but</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.039" end="00:21:40.480" style="s2">the valid case is both nomadological</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.039" end="00:21:42.000" style="s2">it&#39;s both unconditional</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.480" end="00:21:43.600" style="s2">but it&#39;s also conditional this sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.000" end="00:21:44.640" style="s2">that it looks a reality first before it</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.600" end="00:21:46.799" style="s2">looks at you</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.640" end="00:21:47.919" style="s2">and this is key to psych analysis this</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.799" end="00:21:49.919" style="s2">is the really</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.919" end="00:21:50.960" style="s2">great psych analyst he has to follow the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.919" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">case in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.960" end="00:21:53.360" style="s2">he can look at you but he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:55.039" style="s2">actually have any feelings towards you</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.360" end="00:21:58.400" style="s2">he forced you to look at yourself</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.039" end="00:22:00.080" style="s2">but he will give you your proper reality</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.400" end="00:22:01.919" style="s2">check on every level you go through</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.080" end="00:22:03.280" style="s2">during psych analysis and to do social</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.919" end="00:22:04.799" style="s2">analysis to do the same thing with</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.280" end="00:22:07.919" style="s2">society as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.799" end="00:22:09.679" style="s2">so the phallic case if you get access to</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.919" end="00:22:11.200" style="s2">it has an unconditional loving quality</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.679" end="00:22:13.120" style="s2">to it if it&#39;s fatherly</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.200" end="00:22:14.480" style="s2">a mentor or a father who wants to guide</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.120" end="00:22:16.480" style="s2">you through life yes</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.480" end="00:22:18.320" style="s2">but it first looks a reality before it</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.480" end="00:22:19.919" style="s2">gives you the tough news and where you</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.320" end="00:22:23.200" style="s2">need to go to succeed</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.919" end="00:22:25.520" style="s2">so it&#39;s grown up and it&#39;s adult and this</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.200" end="00:22:26.240" style="s2">is what is so desperately lacking in our</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.520" end="00:22:27.919" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:30.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not only phallus it&#39;s the phallic</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.919" end="00:22:32.080" style="s2">gaze itself and that starts with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.080" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">result because it&#39;s i&#39;m a pope it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.080" end="00:22:34.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.559" end="00:22:36.080" style="s2">trying to get recognition from others</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.640" end="00:22:37.600" style="s2">and i think this trying to recognition</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.080" end="00:22:39.120" style="s2">from others is a mistake because it</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.600" end="00:22:40.799" style="s2">really should be they try to get the</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:42.880" style="s2">recognition of the elders</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.799" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">or of the fatherly figures or the people</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.880" end="00:22:46.880" style="s2">who will guide you through your life</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:47.840" style="s2">so that you can then go back and explore</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.880" end="00:22:49.919" style="s2">self-love</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.840" end="00:22:51.039" style="s2">this is completely lacking your also</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.919" end="00:22:52.480" style="s2">that&#39;s why rosso</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.039" end="00:22:54.480" style="s2">is the starting point of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.480" end="00:22:55.440" style="s2">contemporary mass problem with hyper</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.480" end="00:22:57.440" style="s2">narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.440" end="00:22:58.720" style="s2">so you go online today and everybody has</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.440" end="00:23:00.320" style="s2">been promised they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.720" end="00:23:01.360" style="s2">discovered they&#39;re going to be seen by</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.320" end="00:23:03.120" style="s2">the valid case</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.360" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">there are satellites in the sky that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.120" end="00:23:05.760" style="s2">looking down on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:07.840" style="s2">and you&#39;re going to get thousands of</p>

<p begin="00:23:07.840" end="00:23:09.919" style="s2">discover</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.400" end="00:23:11.360" style="s2">20 years into the internet revolution</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.919" end="00:23:12.799" style="s2">that nobody likes anything you do</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.360" end="00:23:14.480" style="s2">because you&#39;re just you&#39;re you&#39;re just a</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.799" end="00:23:16.320" style="s2">mediocre regular human being</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.480" end="00:23:18.320" style="s2">and people are devastated by it this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.320" end="00:23:21.360" style="s2">why beyonce speaks about</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.320" end="00:23:23.280" style="s2">depression as the response to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.360" end="00:23:25.200" style="s2">previous deformation</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.280" end="00:23:26.960" style="s2">and be before that that was the</p>

<p begin="00:23:31.440" end="00:23:36.000" style="s2">and now in the network society we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.280" end="00:23:37.760" style="s2">moving towards depression itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.000" end="00:23:39.200" style="s2">and and i think all these things</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.760" end="00:23:41.200" style="s2">together when you mix them together you</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.200" end="00:23:43.600" style="s2">can do proper social analysis with it</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.200" end="00:23:45.600" style="s2">can you make a link to we had this</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.600" end="00:23:46.159" style="s2">discussion about cold the cold gaze and</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.240" end="00:24:01.600" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:03.600" style="s2">important to be hegelian because people</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.600" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">constantly put these things as opposites</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:05.440" style="s2">against</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:06.960" style="s2">one another they say the mother should</p>

<p begin="00:24:11.200" end="00:24:15.520" style="s2">teaches us is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.640" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">very often one thing is one thing to say</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.520" end="00:24:17.440" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:20.000" style="s2">associate the female body with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.440" end="00:24:21.600" style="s2">nominology and nomadology dominated our</p>

<p begin="00:24:25.919" end="00:24:31.840" style="s2">that an event can happen is only</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.960" end="00:24:33.279" style="s2">a four thousand year old idea and if the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.840" end="00:24:35.679" style="s2">event happens</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.279" end="00:24:37.520" style="s2">things can be changed forever so a new</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.679" end="00:24:38.799" style="s2">technology can come along or a savior</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.520" end="00:24:39.840" style="s2">can enter the scene and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.799" end="00:24:41.679" style="s2">everything changes</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.840" end="00:24:44.159" style="s2">and then history has changed ever</p>

<p begin="00:24:44.159" end="00:24:48.080" style="s2">now if the event the evantology comes</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.640" end="00:24:50.400" style="s2">with us only four thousand years old</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.080" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not the opposite of nominology</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.400" end="00:24:54.480" style="s2">numerology is still there the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.720" end="00:24:57.200" style="s2">undeniably circulates</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.480" end="00:24:58.240" style="s2">it adds to it so the phallic case must</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.200" end="00:25:00.960" style="s2">be understood</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.240" end="00:25:01.919" style="s2">as a case that is both normal logical</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.960" end="00:25:04.960" style="s2">which is warm</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.919" end="00:25:06.640" style="s2">and eventual which is cold yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.960" end="00:25:08.240" style="s2">well i was thinking a hard trick i was</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.640" end="00:25:09.760" style="s2">thinking is so important</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.240" end="00:25:11.360" style="s2">i was thinking in alchemical terms</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.760" end="00:25:14.400" style="s2">because the the you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.360" end="00:25:15.039" style="s2">uh the sulfur is the heat that rises and</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.400" end="00:25:17.360" style="s2">mercury</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.039" end="00:25:18.159" style="s2">is the coolness that that comes down but</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.360" end="00:25:19.360" style="s2">actually they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.159" end="00:25:21.440" style="s2">they&#39;re one thing they&#39;re not they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.360" end="00:25:23.520" style="s2">not separate so</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.440" end="00:25:24.559" style="s2">yeah but this is a dynamic relationship</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.520" end="00:25:27.440" style="s2">between them and</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.559" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">and um well the hegelian i would say</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.440" end="00:25:30.080" style="s2">very often</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:31.679" style="s2">says that one thing is one thing only</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.080" end="00:25:33.039" style="s2">and the other thing you start talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.679" end="00:25:35.200" style="s2">about eventually</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.039" end="00:25:37.279" style="s2">is that thing plus something else and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.200" end="00:25:39.200" style="s2">it&#39;s the plus you add to it that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:25:39.200" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">work and would love to get into tonight</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.880" end="00:25:44.240" style="s2">though is the fact that cattle is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:45.360" style="s2">much obsessed with negative dialectics</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.240" end="00:25:48.559" style="s2">and negations</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.360" end="00:25:51.600" style="s2">and they also play into this so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.559" end="00:25:53.840" style="s2">uh hey it&#39;s wonderful to be diagnosed</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.600" end="00:25:55.679" style="s2">with your go go for it uh okay what</p>

<p begin="00:25:55.679" end="00:25:59.679" style="s2">thing is one thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.799" end="00:26:00.640" style="s2">it&#39;s crucial that it&#39;s one thing plus</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.679" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">lack</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.640" end="00:26:04.960" style="s2">you know so usually what the opposing</p>

<p begin="00:26:04.960" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">is the so-called opposing poll is</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.679" end="00:26:11.760" style="s2">usually</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:14.640" style="s2">empty and lacking and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.760" end="00:26:16.240" style="s2">of of responsibility actually on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.640" end="00:26:17.600" style="s2">higher poll or the one thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.240" end="00:26:20.880" style="s2">actually one thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.600" end="00:26:22.799" style="s2">to go into what its own lack is</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.880" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">because when it goes into what its own</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.799" end="00:26:26.159" style="s2">lack is it actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:27.840" style="s2">gains that third weird power of</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.159" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">transforming itself into something</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.840" end="00:26:31.520" style="s2">really different</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:33.440" style="s2">so in that sense i mean it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.520" end="00:26:34.640" style="s2">really use again it&#39;s a really useful</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.440" end="00:26:36.559" style="s2">tool to analyze</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.640" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">oppositional determination because</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.559" end="00:26:41.440" style="s2">usually when you have opposites</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:41.840" style="s2">usually it&#39;s one thing like for example</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.440" end="00:26:44.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.840" end="00:26:45.440" style="s2">uh marx would say for example the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.000" end="00:26:48.960" style="s2">two-party state</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.440" end="00:26:50.880" style="s2">is actually just an effect of capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.960" end="00:26:51.440" style="s2">reproduction and it&#39;s just reproducing</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.880" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">capital</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.440" end="00:26:54.799" style="s2">and then the two-party system is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:56.159" style="s2">a lack it&#39;s empty</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.799" end="00:26:57.279" style="s2">and we all know it&#39;s empty and now we</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.159" end="00:26:59.120" style="s2">see it&#39;s empty because it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.279" end="00:27:01.840" style="s2">reality tv show</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.120" end="00:27:03.279" style="s2">yeah um yeah so you could you could</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.840" end="00:27:04.799" style="s2">certainly apply that on demandology</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.279" end="00:27:06.320" style="s2">normatology normatology of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.799" end="00:27:07.919" style="s2">relationship too and the great thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.320" end="00:27:09.679" style="s2">with hegel is you shouldn&#39;t think too</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.919" end="00:27:12.000" style="s2">chronologically about him</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.679" end="00:27:13.919" style="s2">the thing is that if you study something</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.000" end="00:27:14.480" style="s2">you&#39;re free actually to change the order</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.919" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">of things</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.480" end="00:27:18.559" style="s2">when you study it because here for</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.480" end="00:27:20.399" style="s2">example evan if evantology is both</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.559" end="00:27:21.760" style="s2">hepatology genomicology at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.399" end="00:27:23.840" style="s2">nomidology is the one that has the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.760" end="00:27:26.720" style="s2">negation it lacks scientology</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.840" end="00:27:28.720" style="s2">so fair like the thing is what bard&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.720" end="00:27:32.000" style="s2">saying here is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.720" end="00:27:33.120" style="s2">if if you are like</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.000" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">a pure you know if you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.120" end="00:27:38.080" style="s2">singularity of the of the subject</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:38.399" style="s2">you can actually rewrite history like</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.080" end="00:27:40.320" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.399" end="00:27:41.520" style="s2">i mean even bard does that as an active</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.320" end="00:27:44.240" style="s2">performance like</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.520" end="00:27:46.159" style="s2">you know emphasizing certain uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.240" end="00:27:47.679" style="s2">chronological dates which he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.159" end="00:27:48.880" style="s2">organizing that past</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.679" end="00:27:51.120" style="s2">you know that&#39;s as something that</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.880" end="00:27:52.240" style="s2">emerges with bard as a figure and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.120" end="00:27:54.720" style="s2">what a great thinker</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.240" end="00:27:56.559" style="s2">in some sense does is creates his own</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.720" end="00:27:59.039" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.559" end="00:28:02.159" style="s2">yeah the future is contingent but the</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.039" end="00:28:02.159" style="s2">past is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.440" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">the thing that got me excited about</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.279" end="00:28:10.000" style="s2">hegel a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:12.159" style="s2">um was was was when i connected it to</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.000" end="00:28:13.600" style="s2">this idea of buddhist emptiness um</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.159" end="00:28:15.039" style="s2">and then and then and then cattle was</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.600" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">saying oh you can&#39;t reduce it to</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.039" end="00:28:18.480" style="s2">buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">um but i think there&#39;s something radical</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.480" end="00:28:21.919" style="s2">in in that and</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:23.360" style="s2">buddhist emptiness that that that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.919" end="00:28:25.039" style="s2">there&#39;s an actual practice</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.360" end="00:28:26.799" style="s2">you know thing that you embody and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.039" end="00:28:28.399" style="s2">whereas if i just read hegel it would be</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.799" end="00:28:29.760" style="s2">just propositional to me and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.399" end="00:28:31.440" style="s2">you know interesting to apply in an</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.760" end="00:28:32.320" style="s2">intellectual way but how do you apply</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.440" end="00:28:35.120" style="s2">that like like</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.320" end="00:28:37.600" style="s2">in terms of you know a practice that</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.120" end="00:28:39.520" style="s2">would transform you and change you and</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.600" end="00:28:41.279" style="s2">and yeah well that&#39;s what i&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.520" end="00:28:42.559" style="s2">in so let me give the distinction i give</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.279" end="00:28:44.880" style="s2">and i&#39;m not saying that i</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.559" end="00:28:46.480" style="s2">i mean i have actually you know explored</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.880" end="00:28:47.919" style="s2">buddhism i&#39;ve gone to buddhist temples</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.480" end="00:28:48.480" style="s2">and talked to buddhist monks and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.919" end="00:28:50.559" style="s2">forth</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.480" end="00:28:51.520" style="s2">i&#39;m not i do not call myself an expert</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.559" end="00:28:54.640" style="s2">on buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.520" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">but um when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.640" end="00:28:58.559" style="s2">the difference between um what i would</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:01.600" style="s2">call</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.559" end="00:29:04.080" style="s2">um popular western buddhism and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.600" end="00:29:05.039" style="s2">this is i&#39;m not saying this is like if i</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.080" end="00:29:06.960" style="s2">talk to the most</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.039" end="00:29:09.440" style="s2">rigorous deepest buddhist monk i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.960" end="00:29:12.399" style="s2">to get this but when i see the popular</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.440" end="00:29:15.279" style="s2">western buddhist philosophy um</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.399" end="00:29:15.919" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s an it&#39;s a and what i see</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.279" end="00:29:19.279" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.919" end="00:29:21.360" style="s2">basically an a historical emptiness and</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.279" end="00:29:22.960" style="s2">now the emphasis now that now here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.360" end="00:29:25.039" style="s2">here&#39;s my my</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.960" end="00:29:27.120" style="s2">distinction i&#39;d want to make is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.039" end="00:29:29.919" style="s2">buddhism emphasizes</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.120" end="00:29:30.399" style="s2">the inner void you know even if you go</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.919" end="00:29:34.240" style="s2">to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.399" end="00:29:37.440" style="s2">the buddhist sutras they emphasize the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.240" end="00:29:40.640" style="s2">the heart and they emphasize the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.440" end="00:29:41.120" style="s2">empty fullness of the heart um and they</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.640" end="00:29:44.240" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.120" end="00:29:45.480" style="s2">that as a sort of uh uh an</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.240" end="00:29:47.520" style="s2">anti you could say an</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.480" end="00:29:50.159" style="s2">anti-transcendental principle</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.520" end="00:29:51.440" style="s2">in some sense um and i think and i think</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.159" end="00:29:54.320" style="s2">so you get to the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.440" end="00:29:54.640" style="s2">the vagina which which it is it changes</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.320" end="00:29:56.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.640" end="00:29:58.000" style="s2">that and i think you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.320" end="00:29:59.279" style="s2">mahayana right now yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.000" end="00:30:01.279" style="s2">incredible and this is and this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.279" end="00:30:02.480" style="s2">this is not nonsense this is incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.279" end="00:30:05.120" style="s2">deep stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.480" end="00:30:06.320" style="s2">what i&#39;m what i&#39;m what i&#39;m trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.120" end="00:30:08.480" style="s2">emerges in</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.320" end="00:30:10.000" style="s2">hegel and also i think emerges in</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.480" end="00:30:12.480" style="s2">figures like heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.000" end="00:30:13.120" style="s2">is a type of historicity of nothingness</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.480" end="00:30:16.240" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.120" end="00:30:19.200" style="s2">the focus is not so much on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.240" end="00:30:20.799" style="s2">empty void of the subject but more so</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.200" end="00:30:23.120" style="s2">the way in which subjects</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.799" end="00:30:24.000" style="s2">organize around the void and i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.120" end="00:30:27.039" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.000" end="00:30:28.880" style="s2">so the emphasis would be for example on</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.039" end="00:30:31.120" style="s2">the way buddhist communities</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.880" end="00:30:32.159" style="s2">organize their practices their rituals</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.120" end="00:30:34.559" style="s2">around the void</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.159" end="00:30:35.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s so interesting to think</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.559" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">because to me</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.600" end="00:30:39.279" style="s2">it gets me into thinking metaphors of</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:41.120" style="s2">black hole it gets me into thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.279" end="00:30:44.240" style="s2">metaphors of</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.120" end="00:30:48.159" style="s2">subjectivity as the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.240" end="00:30:50.000" style="s2">s or language as the material signifiers</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.159" end="00:30:52.480" style="s2">which are organizing around</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:54.080" style="s2">a void or organizing around a black hole</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.480" end="00:30:55.840" style="s2">and i think we get</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.080" end="00:30:57.200" style="s2">the potential to develop a deep</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.840" end="00:30:59.600" style="s2">historical theory</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.200" end="00:31:00.720" style="s2">of what the becoming of this void</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.600" end="00:31:03.360" style="s2">entails</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.720" end="00:31:04.399" style="s2">um and i think that in that sense what</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.360" end="00:31:07.919" style="s2">i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.399" end="00:31:09.600" style="s2">i&#39;m less interested on the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.919" end="00:31:12.480" style="s2">ontological validity of</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.600" end="00:31:13.600" style="s2">what buddhism identifies but more so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.480" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.600" end="00:31:18.399" style="s2">the collective socio-cultural practices</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:20.080" style="s2">which are developed</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.399" end="00:31:21.840" style="s2">around cultivating knowledge of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.080" end="00:31:24.159" style="s2">void</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.840" end="00:31:25.600" style="s2">i i would add that i think that we i</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.159" end="00:31:27.519" style="s2">think i would just say i think that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.600" end="00:31:27.919" style="s2">get that capacity and hegel let me just</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.519" end="00:31:29.919" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.919" end="00:31:31.840" style="s2">that because for hegel the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.919" end="00:31:35.200" style="s2">negativity and the ultimate void</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.840" end="00:31:37.200" style="s2">is confrontation with death itself</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.200" end="00:31:38.480" style="s2">and the ultimate fear in the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.200" end="00:31:41.360" style="s2">the subject</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.480" end="00:31:43.120" style="s2">that basically hegel says you are</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.360" end="00:31:47.279" style="s2">brought to your truth and you discover</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.120" end="00:31:49.919" style="s2">your truth in the face of death itself</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.279" end="00:31:50.880" style="s2">the night of the world a subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.919" end="00:31:53.200" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.880" end="00:31:54.559" style="s2">yeah i agree when it come to buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.200" end="00:31:54.799" style="s2">though there&#39;s a difference in mahayana</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.559" end="00:31:56.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.799" end="00:31:59.120" style="s2">variana and to me mahayana perfects</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.880" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">numerology takes nominology to logical</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.120" end="00:32:02.159" style="s2">conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:04.159" style="s2">which is that the only way for something</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.159" end="00:32:05.279" style="s2">that endlessly repeats itself is to try</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.159" end="00:32:07.519" style="s2">to get out of the loop</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.279" end="00:32:09.279" style="s2">okay and then of course that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.519" end="00:32:11.760" style="s2">mahayana buddhism tries to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.279" end="00:32:13.600" style="s2">but the varying response is it&#39;s mixed</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.760" end="00:32:15.120" style="s2">with zoroastrianism especially it comes</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.600" end="00:32:17.120" style="s2">out of tibet and central asia</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.120" end="00:32:18.399" style="s2">it adds the eventological element so it</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.120" end="00:32:20.799" style="s2">puts buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.399" end="00:32:23.200" style="s2">into a much more social category and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.799" end="00:32:25.200" style="s2">social category can be other things too</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.200" end="00:32:26.880" style="s2">now the interesting thing though is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.200" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">none of these traditions talks about</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.880" end="00:32:29.679" style="s2">individual subjectivities</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">anything else but a void to be filled</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.679" end="00:32:32.080" style="s2">because it&#39;s essentially along the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:34.000" style="s2">timeline</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.080" end="00:32:35.600" style="s2">you&#39;re a child hey you&#39;re nobody you</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.000" end="00:32:37.679" style="s2">haven&#39;t lived a life at all</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.600" end="00:32:40.000" style="s2">so in zoroastrianism for example the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.679" end="00:32:41.840" style="s2">goal in life is to live a full rich life</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.000" end="00:32:45.120" style="s2">called horvathot</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.840" end="00:32:46.320" style="s2">then also to die one day with harvard</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.120" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">thought if you&#39;re lucky</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.320" end="00:32:50.480" style="s2">to pass on transcendence to the next</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.480" end="00:32:51.919" style="s2">generation which is called the meditate</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.480" end="00:32:53.279" style="s2">this is exactly why the person&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.919" end="00:32:54.159" style="s2">built pyramids for example this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.279" end="00:32:55.679" style="s2">exactly why they</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.159" end="00:32:57.279" style="s2">just threw the corpses out of the desert</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.679" end="00:32:58.720" style="s2">where people died because you already</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.279" end="00:33:00.159" style="s2">had achieved what you set out to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.720" end="00:33:01.039" style="s2">which was to live a full life however</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.159" end="00:33:02.960" style="s2">thought to then pass</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.039" end="00:33:05.200" style="s2">all the heritage to the next generation</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.960" end="00:33:06.559" style="s2">so to be full as a subject is to have</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.200" end="00:33:08.399" style="s2">lived a full life</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.559" end="00:33:09.679" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea there that&#39;s not too</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.399" end="00:33:11.519" style="s2">different from the gaelian concept</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.679" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">because the subject is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.519" end="00:33:16.720" style="s2">trying to fill itself with content and</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:18.640" style="s2">obviously in lacont it goes all the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.720" end="00:33:19.600" style="s2">and la convey success it&#39;s impossible it</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.640" end="00:33:21.120" style="s2">will never happen</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.600" end="00:33:22.720" style="s2">we desire to fill ourselves with some</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.120" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">kind of content and it&#39;s still the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.720" end="00:33:26.799" style="s2">gaping hole that it always</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">was and yeah because if it wasn&#39;t we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.799" end="00:33:30.159" style="s2">go and kill ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:31.279" style="s2">so rasters would agree but the serastius</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.159" end="00:33:33.760" style="s2">would then put that</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.279" end="00:33:35.919" style="s2">into the perspective you&#39;re a child here</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.760" end="00:33:36.960" style="s2">you can an adolescent here that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.919" end="00:33:38.559" style="s2">an adult here</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.960" end="00:33:40.159" style="s2">you can then become an elder you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.559" end="00:33:41.679" style="s2">become a foreign father even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.159" end="00:33:42.640" style="s2">really successful at things and you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.679" end="00:33:44.480" style="s2">be a role model</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:46.159" style="s2">you can become an icon after you die</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.480" end="00:33:47.840" style="s2">even you can become a smaller god</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.159" end="00:33:49.440" style="s2">all of these things are possible within</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.840" end="00:33:50.159" style="s2">that time span because they look at it</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.440" end="00:33:51.519" style="s2">tribally</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.159" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">and they look at it over the entire</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.519" end="00:33:56.080" style="s2">lifespan i think that&#39;s a valeriana</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:57.840" style="s2">buddhism catches on that&#39;s what it does</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.080" end="00:33:59.279" style="s2">well the thing that i would i&#39;ve i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.840" end="00:34:02.559" style="s2">sort of obsessed with and</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.279" end="00:34:05.440" style="s2">it&#39;s very fluid it&#39;s not you know so</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.559" end="00:34:06.080" style="s2">just forgive me here uh is is i there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.440" end="00:34:08.639" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.080" end="00:34:10.639" style="s2">bard&#39;s eventology which you know which i</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.639" end="00:34:12.079" style="s2">guess begins in zoroastrian and moves on</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.639" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">with judaism and</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.079" end="00:34:15.599" style="s2">and so i want to combine i want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:17.359" style="s2">combine vagina with</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.599" end="00:34:19.679" style="s2">with uh with the hebrew tradition which</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.359" end="00:34:22.480" style="s2">has a story to it it has a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.679" end="00:34:24.480" style="s2">it has this narrative structure as well</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.480" end="00:34:27.359" style="s2">so i want to combine the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.480" end="00:34:29.200" style="s2">with the deep non-dual um with the deep</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.359" end="00:34:31.679" style="s2">non-dual traditions on some</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.200" end="00:34:33.599" style="s2">level uh i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.679" end="00:34:36.879" style="s2">but those are two my two obsessions</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.599" end="00:34:38.800" style="s2">uh yeah i i can speak to that so</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.879" end="00:34:40.800" style="s2">there&#39;s an important i mean i would</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.800" end="00:34:44.639" style="s2">recommend first to</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.800" end="00:34:46.480" style="s2">read the um the intro chapter to less</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.639" end="00:34:49.040" style="s2">than nothing epper c muave</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.480" end="00:34:51.040" style="s2">um where i think he gives the a clear</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.040" end="00:34:53.040" style="s2">precise formula of the hegelian</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.040" end="00:34:56.399" style="s2">dialectic as basically</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.040" end="00:34:58.320" style="s2">the becoming of narrativization itself</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.399" end="00:35:00.079" style="s2">so the becoming of narrativization</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.320" end="00:35:02.000" style="s2">itself is the story</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.079" end="00:35:04.079" style="s2">self-consciousness or subjectivity is</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.000" end="00:35:04.640" style="s2">telling itself about being itself and</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.079" end="00:35:07.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.640" end="00:35:08.480" style="s2">is the becoming of the subject so it it</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.520" end="00:35:11.520" style="s2">it basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.480" end="00:35:14.560" style="s2">it basically mobilizes it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.520" end="00:35:16.400" style="s2">the ultimate mobilization of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.560" end="00:35:18.000" style="s2">the ultimate movement of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.400" end="00:35:21.200" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re studying and</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.000" end="00:35:22.960" style="s2">that is a story which is emerging</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.200" end="00:35:24.720" style="s2">it&#39;s emerging in our collective story</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.960" end="00:35:26.720" style="s2">it&#39;s what we&#39;re doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.720" end="00:35:28.000" style="s2">like the emergence of all these podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.720" end="00:35:29.119" style="s2">the emergence of all these</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.000" end="00:35:31.440" style="s2">you know talking about deep</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.119" end="00:35:33.040" style="s2">philosophical concepts this would be</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.440" end="00:35:36.400" style="s2">something that hegel would have</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.040" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">anticipated as kind of the the um the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.400" end="00:35:39.119" style="s2">emergence of a more distributed</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.000" end="00:35:43.359" style="s2">philosophy which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.119" end="00:35:45.440" style="s2">again working out the concept itself</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.359" end="00:35:47.119" style="s2">i agree strongly i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.440" end="00:35:51.119" style="s2">why i&#39;m talking about process and event</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.119" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">so uh at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.119" end="00:35:54.640" style="s2">process was the original philosophy we</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.000" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">we we</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.640" end="00:35:58.000" style="s2">mistakenly think that things started</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.160" end="00:35:59.680" style="s2">with plato or something and in the west</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.000" end="00:36:01.599" style="s2">and then people came along and did</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.680" end="00:36:03.040" style="s2">process later no heraclitus was long</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.599" end="00:36:04.160" style="s2">before played on before half of this we</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.040" end="00:36:06.560" style="s2">had the saurons</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.160" end="00:36:08.560" style="s2">and actually if you read beyonce</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.560" end="00:36:09.599" style="s2">rewriting of east asian history which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.560" end="00:36:11.839" style="s2">fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.599" end="00:36:13.440" style="s2">you discover that all east asian</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.839" end="00:36:15.119" style="s2">cultures have always emphasized the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.440" end="00:36:16.480" style="s2">symmetries and constant process and</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.119" end="00:36:18.079" style="s2">movement and this idea that there are</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.480" end="00:36:19.680" style="s2">fixed forms or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.079" end="00:36:21.200" style="s2">that just comes way way later with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.680" end="00:36:22.960" style="s2">greeks especially with plato and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.200" end="00:36:24.640" style="s2">actually quite isolated to the west it</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.960" end="00:36:24.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make much sense to the nation at</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.640" end="00:36:27.760" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.880" end="00:36:29.359" style="s2">the indians never subscribe because we</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.760" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">started off talking about archetypes oh</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.359" end="00:36:31.359" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:32.640" style="s2">the archetypes universal you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.359" end="00:36:34.320" style="s2">them everywhere don&#39;t worry about that</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.640" end="00:36:35.680" style="s2">archetypality will be very universal</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.320" end="00:36:36.960" style="s2">because anything that was developed over</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.680" end="00:36:38.800" style="s2">hundreds of thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.960" end="00:36:40.720" style="s2">was probably developed both with inuits</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.800" end="00:36:42.160" style="s2">in canada and with people in new guinea</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.720" end="00:36:44.000" style="s2">and in brazil in the jungle</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.160" end="00:36:46.240" style="s2">you will find it because people were</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.000" end="00:36:48.000" style="s2">nomads and people people were nomadic</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.240" end="00:36:50.240" style="s2">that&#39;s why we call it no mythology</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.000" end="00:36:51.920" style="s2">nomidology is both it&#39;s the less it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.240" end="00:36:53.440" style="s2">adolescent term nominologies both that</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.920" end="00:36:54.000" style="s2">were on the move all the time so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.440" end="00:36:55.359" style="s2">story is about</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:36:57.040" style="s2">how we have to be on the move all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.359" end="00:36:58.880" style="s2">time where otherwise we die but you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.040" end="00:36:59.599" style="s2">methodology is also it&#39;s a storyal</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.880" end="00:37:01.359" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.599" end="00:37:03.760" style="s2">so it becomes quite natural no modality</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:05.359" style="s2">becomes the eternal return of the same</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.760" end="00:37:07.280" style="s2">every season you come back to the same</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.359" end="00:37:08.880" style="s2">point every year is a new year but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:09.920" style="s2">still the same year as the last year and</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.880" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">with the permanent cell we discovered</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.920" end="00:37:12.720" style="s2">that if we store information the way we</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">store grain</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.720" end="00:37:19.359" style="s2">then we the way we in you know we build</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:21.119" style="s2">huge constructions we irrigate water</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.359" end="00:37:22.560" style="s2">all these things we do create abundance</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.119" end="00:37:24.079" style="s2">on a level we&#39;ve never seen before</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.560" end="00:37:25.760" style="s2">and that creates the possibility of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.079" end="00:37:27.839" style="s2">different world the previous one</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.760" end="00:37:29.119" style="s2">for better or worse yeah but eventology</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.839" end="00:37:30.320" style="s2">means that i hope this could be a better</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.119" end="00:37:32.079" style="s2">world than the previous one</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.320" end="00:37:34.240" style="s2">that idea is then brand new it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.079" end="00:37:35.200" style="s2">opposed to nominology it can be added to</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.240" end="00:37:36.640" style="s2">nominology</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.200" end="00:37:38.800" style="s2">this is what the chinese and the indians</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.640" end="00:37:40.720" style="s2">try to do as well of course and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.800" end="00:37:41.520" style="s2">problem was with the abrahamic religions</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.720" end="00:37:43.119" style="s2">in the west</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.520" end="00:37:44.800" style="s2">especially islamic christianity is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.119" end="00:37:47.280" style="s2">they threw out</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.800" end="00:37:49.599" style="s2">the nominology stay with evantology and</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.280" end="00:37:51.440" style="s2">the massive focus on what muhammad or</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.599" end="00:37:53.200" style="s2">christ did in certain dates and</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.440" end="00:37:54.640" style="s2">what they sacrificed and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.200" end="00:37:56.560" style="s2">battles they want or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.640" end="00:37:58.320" style="s2">this is obsession with these guys which</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.560" end="00:37:59.760" style="s2">eventually leads to the separation of</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.320" end="00:38:01.520" style="s2">church and state of the west becomes</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.760" end="00:38:04.480" style="s2">becomes unattainable to keep</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.520" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">evantology outside of numerology and</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.480" end="00:38:08.880" style="s2">then no modality becomes capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:10.160" style="s2">it came back to hardest it was obvious</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.880" end="00:38:12.480" style="s2">that capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.160" end="00:38:14.400" style="s2">as the great ghost of our culture is no</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:15.599" style="s2">matter logical it&#39;s just the repetition</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.400" end="00:38:16.560" style="s2">of the same all the time that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.599" end="00:38:17.680" style="s2">capital is</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.560" end="00:38:20.079" style="s2">and we&#39;re not fighting with that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.680" end="00:38:22.560" style="s2">called market forces and we</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.079" end="00:38:23.680" style="s2">we see the emptiness in an enemy logical</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.560" end="00:38:25.440" style="s2">sense in that</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.680" end="00:38:27.200" style="s2">we should just accept that it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:27.599" style="s2">but the eventology has to come back in</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.200" end="00:38:29.680" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.599" end="00:38:31.599" style="s2">its name is phallus we threw it out with</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.680" end="00:38:33.200" style="s2">the bath water after 1945</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.599" end="00:38:35.040" style="s2">and we&#39;re lost because of it</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.200" end="00:38:36.720" style="s2">post-modernism if you&#39;re criticizing is</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.040" end="00:38:38.000" style="s2">nothing but nomidology again without</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.720" end="00:38:40.960" style="s2">eventology</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.000" end="00:38:41.599" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem so i want to know</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.960" end="00:38:43.599" style="s2">what the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.599" end="00:38:45.599" style="s2">the masculine and the feminine principle</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.599" end="00:38:46.480" style="s2">have to do with like the phallus and and</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.599" end="00:38:48.800" style="s2">are you know are we</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.480" end="00:38:50.079" style="s2">are we is that the same thing or no no</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.800" end="00:38:54.000" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.079" end="00:38:54.400" style="s2">maybe you wanted to uh precursors are</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.000" end="00:38:56.320" style="s2">always</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.400" end="00:38:58.800" style="s2">important that&#39;s number one thing with</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.320" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">hegel right the precursor to the event</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.800" end="00:39:01.680" style="s2">before the event is even possible is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.560" end="00:39:04.320" style="s2">fact that men learn</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.680" end="00:39:06.079" style="s2">from the context where they are at so to</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.320" end="00:39:06.720" style="s2">go out hunting or to win a war you learn</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.079" end="00:39:08.240" style="s2">from the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.720" end="00:39:09.760" style="s2">circumstances where you&#39;re at but you</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.240" end="00:39:11.359" style="s2">also forget that information the next</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.760" end="00:39:12.800" style="s2">thing you do because you can&#39;t keep it</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.359" end="00:39:14.480" style="s2">so the next war is going to be like the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.800" end="00:39:16.160" style="s2">previous war anyway there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.480" end="00:39:17.520" style="s2">technological development or anything</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.160" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">like that at all because you don&#39;t store</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.520" end="00:39:20.400" style="s2">information anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:22.400" style="s2">when somebody dies the information dies</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.400" end="00:39:22.800" style="s2">with them everything is memorized beside</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.400" end="00:39:24.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.800" end="00:39:26.000" style="s2">the max amount of information is</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.480" end="00:39:26.480" style="s2">constant for hundreds of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.000" end="00:39:28.160" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.480" end="00:39:29.680" style="s2">before written language arrives and</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.160" end="00:39:30.640" style="s2">changes the rules of the games</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.680" end="00:39:32.480" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.640" end="00:39:34.960" style="s2">now with the now that this this is why</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.480" end="00:39:36.720" style="s2">event becomes a new idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.960" end="00:39:38.560" style="s2">but it should always be combined with</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.720" end="00:39:40.400" style="s2">nominology we should always have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.560" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">society that respects and understands</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.400" end="00:39:42.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:44.480" style="s2">human life is both circular and linear</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.960" end="00:39:45.920" style="s2">at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.480" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">that is what i require this is called</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.920" end="00:39:49.920" style="s2">process event then i would add to that</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:50.320" style="s2">where catalyst work is so damn important</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.920" end="00:39:51.920" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.320" end="00:39:53.440" style="s2">is i think cattle gets hegel better than</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.920" end="00:39:55.680" style="s2">any of his contemporaries</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.440" end="00:39:57.280" style="s2">and i think negation the way hegel</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.680" end="00:39:59.839" style="s2">percent is probably the third</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.280" end="00:40:01.359" style="s2">idea that philosophy ever came up with i</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.839" end="00:40:02.480" style="s2">think anything else that philosophy came</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.359" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">up with is</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.480" end="00:40:06.480" style="s2">minor compared to process event and</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:09.119" style="s2">negation</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.480" end="00:40:10.319" style="s2">that&#39;s how important hegel is can can i</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.119" end="00:40:12.880" style="s2">can i go into</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.319" end="00:40:15.119" style="s2">well thank you bart for the compliment</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.880" end="00:40:15.760" style="s2">um can i can i go into a little bit of</p>

<p begin="00:40:15.760" end="00:40:20.160" style="s2">uh your question there um andrew about</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.720" end="00:40:21.280" style="s2">the masculine and the feminine the</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.160" end="00:40:23.200" style="s2">difference between this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.280" end="00:40:24.720" style="s2">i want to go there for sure but what the</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.200" end="00:40:26.000" style="s2">hell we&#39;re talking about when we say</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.720" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">masculine and feminine</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.000" end="00:40:30.079" style="s2">you know it&#39;s no it&#39;s no everyone knows</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:30.560" style="s2">you know the famous statement by freud</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.079" end="00:40:32.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.560" end="00:40:33.680" style="s2">you know the concepts masculine and</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.000" end="00:40:34.720" style="s2">feminine are the most confused concepts</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.680" end="00:40:36.800" style="s2">in science and</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.720" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">you know the way we use those concepts</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.800" end="00:40:41.920" style="s2">are extremely confusing</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.839" end="00:40:44.240" style="s2">there are some lacanians who actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.920" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">prefer to use the concepts left and</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.240" end="00:40:47.280" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.599" end="00:40:49.359" style="s2">geometrical concepts instead of</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.280" end="00:40:51.440" style="s2">masculine and feminine they claim that</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.359" end="00:40:53.440" style="s2">we move too quickly when we label</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.440" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">something masculine and feminine that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.440" end="00:40:57.680" style="s2">were usually you know stumbling around</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:41:00.079" style="s2">in the dark with these concepts well</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.680" end="00:41:00.480" style="s2">alexander uses phallus and matrix as the</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.079" end="00:41:03.040" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.480" end="00:41:03.839" style="s2">sort of right so i mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.040" end="00:41:05.040" style="s2">interesting i mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.839" end="00:41:07.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t i mean we could have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.040" end="00:41:09.599" style="s2">conversation about that so yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.040" end="00:41:11.359" style="s2">the the thing is is that when we when</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.599" end="00:41:12.000" style="s2">when freud was going about defining</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.359" end="00:41:14.960" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.000" end="00:41:16.800" style="s2">basically what he means when he says</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.960" end="00:41:17.599" style="s2">libido is masculine is that what he</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.800" end="00:41:20.880" style="s2">means is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.599" end="00:41:23.599" style="s2">libido is action and libido is one</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.880" end="00:41:24.400" style="s2">so libido is action and libido is one is</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.599" end="00:41:26.560" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.400" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">more accurate than saying libido is</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.560" end="00:41:30.560" style="s2">masculine to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:32.400" style="s2">so saying libido is action is a good</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.560" end="00:41:35.119" style="s2">starting principle and then you can say</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.400" end="00:41:35.920" style="s2">that the opposite of libido is kind it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.119" end="00:41:38.720" style="s2">again like this</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.920" end="00:41:39.599" style="s2">this hegelian principle of there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.720" end="00:41:42.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.599" end="00:41:45.280" style="s2">a lack and basically the lac</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.960" end="00:41:46.960" style="s2">is what we call femininity yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.280" end="00:41:50.400" style="s2">femininity becomes what we</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.960" end="00:41:53.119" style="s2">we label it as passive so the classical</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.400" end="00:41:54.319" style="s2">uh uh metaphysical distinctions are</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.119" end="00:41:57.280" style="s2">active passive and</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.319" end="00:41:57.920" style="s2">maybe that doesn&#39;t matter precisely but</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.280" end="00:42:00.560" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.920" end="00:42:02.240" style="s2">a way in which what we call masculine</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.560" end="00:42:05.280" style="s2">and feminine is kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.240" end="00:42:08.560" style="s2">active pointing going</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.280" end="00:42:12.160" style="s2">and wants to wants to go in and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.560" end="00:42:15.359" style="s2">the passive is receiving</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.160" end="00:42:18.400" style="s2">being in sure so</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.359" end="00:42:21.520" style="s2">this basic distinction about going</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.400" end="00:42:24.000" style="s2">in and being in is</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.520" end="00:42:24.720" style="s2">what we mean when we say masculine and</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.000" end="00:42:27.280" style="s2">feminine</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.720" end="00:42:29.040" style="s2">and so you can even say for example</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.280" end="00:42:31.520" style="s2">science is masculine</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.040" end="00:42:33.440" style="s2">because it&#39;s constantly pointing and</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.520" end="00:42:35.200" style="s2">trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.440" end="00:42:37.599" style="s2">the outside world trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.200" end="00:42:40.960" style="s2">somewhere where it could finally</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.599" end="00:42:42.720" style="s2">find its place where it could be in yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.960" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">and you could say psychoanalysis is</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.720" end="00:42:48.000" style="s2">somehow feminine</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:50.560" style="s2">because the analyst is a pure receiver</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.000" end="00:42:51.200" style="s2">pure pure receiver of the subject&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.560" end="00:42:53.040" style="s2">speech</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.200" end="00:42:54.800" style="s2">you can just say anything and this the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.040" end="00:42:58.160" style="s2">analyst will just be there</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.800" end="00:43:01.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s just receiving you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.160" end="00:43:03.200" style="s2">come in sure</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.520" end="00:43:05.200" style="s2">yeah i call these things phallic and</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.200" end="00:43:06.720" style="s2">magical and i&#39;m very adamant about it so</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.200" end="00:43:08.319" style="s2">libidos on the phallic side</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.720" end="00:43:10.000" style="s2">what we mean with that is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.319" end="00:43:11.520" style="s2">absolutely yeah what i mean with that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.000" end="00:43:13.119" style="s2">that nomidology is fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.520" end="00:43:14.720" style="s2">nomidology wins at the end</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.119" end="00:43:16.160" style="s2">uh the universe started with a big</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.720" end="00:43:18.000" style="s2">bounce anyway so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.160" end="00:43:20.079" style="s2">it&#39;s just in and out in and out okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.000" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">pumps right anything that pumps and as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.079" end="00:43:23.680" style="s2">pulse is normal</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:25.200" style="s2">so of course men come to women because</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.680" end="00:43:26.640" style="s2">women represent reproduction they are</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.200" end="00:43:28.880" style="s2">the ones we produce they give birth to</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.640" end="00:43:30.640" style="s2">children hey that&#39;s half the job done</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.880" end="00:43:32.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the non-methodological part</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.640" end="00:43:33.920" style="s2">eventology then when it arrives four</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.800" end="00:43:35.359" style="s2">thousand years ago because of</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.920" end="00:43:37.760" style="s2">information accumulation</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.359" end="00:43:40.000" style="s2">is that men can start to make themselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.760" end="00:43:42.480" style="s2">redundant outside of the reproductive</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.000" end="00:43:44.640" style="s2">process and that redundancy can be</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.480" end="00:43:47.119" style="s2">turned into an abundance of resources</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.640" end="00:43:47.760" style="s2">and we call that civilization that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.119" end="00:43:49.520" style="s2">men</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.760" end="00:43:51.680" style="s2">are usually the ones not women who are</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.520" end="00:43:52.319" style="s2">on fire about changing the world for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.680" end="00:43:53.599" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.319" end="00:43:55.359" style="s2">and what they mean with that is that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.599" end="00:43:57.280" style="s2">could build things we never built before</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.359" end="00:43:57.839" style="s2">we could try to do things we never tried</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.280" end="00:43:59.920" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.839" end="00:44:01.839" style="s2">we have the resources now and we could</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.920" end="00:44:03.760" style="s2">do that and to give that some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.839" end="00:44:05.359" style="s2">direction is the job of religion so the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.760" end="00:44:07.200" style="s2">job religion is basically</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.359" end="00:44:08.880" style="s2">religion is fundamentally a masculine</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.200" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">enterprise not a feminine one</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.880" end="00:44:12.400" style="s2">if the guys get the religion right</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.640" end="00:44:14.079" style="s2">usually the women benefit from it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.400" end="00:44:15.200" style="s2">very selection take on religion but</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.079" end="00:44:17.359" style="s2">actually agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.200" end="00:44:18.880" style="s2">i think religion is not a women and</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.359" end="00:44:20.880" style="s2">children thing i think religion should</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:21.359" style="s2">definitely be a men&#39;s thing to begin</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.880" end="00:44:22.960" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.359" end="00:44:24.560" style="s2">it should be the separation of priest</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.960" end="00:44:25.280" style="s2">and king to begin with to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.560" end="00:44:27.440" style="s2">two different</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.280" end="00:44:28.480" style="s2">archetypes and then you can organize the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.440" end="00:44:30.400" style="s2">world accordingly</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.480" end="00:44:32.079" style="s2">and this is where the engineer or the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.400" end="00:44:33.599" style="s2">architect comes into the picture why i</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.079" end="00:44:34.880" style="s2">celebrate these things in my work with</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.599" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">john certainly is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.880" end="00:44:37.680" style="s2">these ideas of the engineering the</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:39.200" style="s2">architect is what we need today you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.680" end="00:44:41.119" style="s2">going to save the planet we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.200" end="00:44:42.400" style="s2">make people get along through crypto so</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.119" end="00:44:43.760" style="s2">they don&#39;t kill each other and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.400" end="00:44:44.960" style="s2">going to make strangers love each other</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.760" end="00:44:46.720" style="s2">through new technologies</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.960" end="00:44:49.599" style="s2">all the things that we need to do right</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.720" end="00:44:51.760" style="s2">now urgently the next 50 to 100 years</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.599" end="00:44:53.599" style="s2">point towards a new eventology a new</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.760" end="00:44:55.280" style="s2">massive phallic mission this phallic</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.599" end="00:44:55.839" style="s2">mission is basically save the planet for</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.280" end="00:44:57.680" style="s2">the huma</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.839" end="00:44:59.359" style="s2">for humans to begin with and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.680" end="00:45:01.040" style="s2">prepare humans for meeting the machine</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.359" end="00:45:03.839" style="s2">eventually along the way</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.040" end="00:45:05.599" style="s2">now these are huge technological</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.839" end="00:45:07.359" style="s2">challenges and technological challenges</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.599" end="00:45:09.200" style="s2">are perfect for evantology</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.359" end="00:45:10.960" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what eventology tried to</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.200" end="00:45:13.760" style="s2">do when it built civilization</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.960" end="00:45:15.440" style="s2">over the past 5 000 years and this is in</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.760" end="00:45:16.800" style="s2">the masculine in the sense that it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.440" end="00:45:19.440" style="s2">the phallic mode</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.800" end="00:45:21.440" style="s2">because the the the magical mode is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.440" end="00:45:23.760" style="s2">reproduction and keeping everything</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.440" end="00:45:25.359" style="s2">going so a new generation can be born</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.760" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">without that we&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.359" end="00:45:29.839" style="s2">the phallic can then add value so that</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.920" end="00:45:31.440" style="s2">the next generation could possibly have</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.839" end="00:45:33.280" style="s2">a better life than the previous one or</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.440" end="00:45:34.720" style="s2">at least dream about it</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.280" end="00:45:36.319" style="s2">that&#39;s where the phallic dreams come</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.720" end="00:45:38.800" style="s2">into the picture look</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.319" end="00:45:39.359" style="s2">religion religion is going on what bard</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.800" end="00:45:42.480" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.359" end="00:45:46.000" style="s2">religion is what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.480" end="00:45:50.160" style="s2">men of a particular historical time</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.000" end="00:45:52.720" style="s2">figure out how to do what&#39;s best</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.160" end="00:45:54.560" style="s2">and what&#39;s in the best interests of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.720" end="00:45:58.000" style="s2">women and the children</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.560" end="00:45:59.680" style="s2">in a way in which it creates</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.000" end="00:46:01.520" style="s2">positive some synergies among the</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.680" end="00:46:02.480" style="s2">community and that&#39;s what we call</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.520" end="00:46:05.040" style="s2">religion and</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.480" end="00:46:06.400" style="s2">the reason why religion has declined is</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.040" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">because the religions</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.400" end="00:46:10.000" style="s2">of the modern period and the pre-modern</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:12.400" style="s2">period no longer</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.000" end="00:46:13.119" style="s2">match the historical reality of the 21st</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.400" end="00:46:16.240" style="s2">century</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.119" end="00:46:18.000" style="s2">and so that requires new phallus</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.240" end="00:46:19.760" style="s2">it requires new thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.000" end="00:46:22.240" style="s2">masculinity in order</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.760" end="00:46:23.599" style="s2">basically what what you end up trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.240" end="00:46:26.319" style="s2">think is</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.599" end="00:46:26.880" style="s2">a new religion and and and that&#39;s why i</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.319" end="00:46:29.920" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.880" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">religion is not something</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.920" end="00:46:34.000" style="s2">which is subject once we understand that</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:35.920" style="s2">religion evolves</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.000" end="00:46:37.680" style="s2">once we understand that not only does</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.920" end="00:46:39.839" style="s2">religion evolve but religion</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.680" end="00:46:42.160" style="s2">leads to a type of bootstrapping process</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.839" end="00:46:45.440" style="s2">where it causes its own it&#39;s its own</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.160" end="00:46:48.640" style="s2">cause that that</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.440" end="00:46:50.480" style="s2">in that sense when we when we try to</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.640" end="00:46:51.200" style="s2">think about what the the future religion</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.480" end="00:46:53.839" style="s2">will be it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.200" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">almost be like uh the metaphor of jesus</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.839" end="00:46:58.400" style="s2">where you die and you rise from the dead</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">religion died yeah and now i agree with</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.400" end="00:47:01.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:02.560" style="s2">arise from the dead i think religion is</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.200" end="00:47:04.319" style="s2">rising from the dead and i think all the</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.560" end="00:47:05.599" style="s2">traditional religions are going to arise</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.319" end="00:47:07.839" style="s2">as well but they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.599" end="00:47:09.440" style="s2">transform they&#39;ll arise in it they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.839" end="00:47:11.280" style="s2">they&#39;ll arrive at the time</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.440" end="00:47:13.200" style="s2">yeah they&#39;ll they&#39;ll emerge in a totally</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.280" end="00:47:15.280" style="s2">new form yeah i agree</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.200" end="00:47:17.520" style="s2">yeah and and this sort of activism and</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.280" end="00:47:19.359" style="s2">individualism that the carton content</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.520" end="00:47:21.440" style="s2">was so practiced didn&#39;t really work that</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.359" end="00:47:22.319" style="s2">well do they so we&#39;re throwing some old</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.440" end="00:47:24.079" style="s2">religions out</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.319" end="00:47:25.520" style="s2">with the bath water anyway that we have</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.079" end="00:47:26.400" style="s2">developed the last 300 years didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.520" end="00:47:28.319" style="s2">really work</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.400" end="00:47:29.599" style="s2">didn&#39;t didn&#39;t have universal appeal for</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.319" end="00:47:30.880" style="s2">very good reasons so</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.599" end="00:47:33.440" style="s2">so we can at least admit that those are</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.880" end="00:47:37.359" style="s2">religions too the bad religions</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.440" end="00:47:40.720" style="s2">basically newton descartes</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.359" end="00:47:44.640" style="s2">leibniz i would say spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.720" end="00:47:47.440" style="s2">hume kant all of these guys are geniuses</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.640" end="00:47:48.079" style="s2">but they fall short in such an important</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.440" end="00:47:51.119" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.079" end="00:47:52.000" style="s2">that ultimately changing the axioms of</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.119" end="00:47:55.520" style="s2">their philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.000" end="00:47:57.920" style="s2">leads to their destruction i agree</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.520" end="00:47:59.520" style="s2">strongly yeah so it&#39;s a theological</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.920" end="00:48:02.000" style="s2">question to be honest about it i</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.520" end="00:48:02.880" style="s2">agree on that completely so yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:04.559" style="s2">what we&#39;re heading that&#39;s where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.880" end="00:48:04.800" style="s2">heading next we need to build that and</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.559" end="00:48:06.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.800" end="00:48:08.720" style="s2">i would say in my work then this is why</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.960" end="00:48:09.760" style="s2">i&#39;m critical of taoism although i love</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.720" end="00:48:11.440" style="s2">the daoist tradition</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.760" end="00:48:13.280" style="s2">i almost converted to taoism in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.440" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">1980s but i refused it yet</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.280" end="00:48:16.400" style="s2">the problem with daoism is that it stays</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:18.000" style="s2">within the end of the youngs it stays</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.400" end="00:48:19.359" style="s2">within this idea of masculine feminists</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.000" end="00:48:21.440" style="s2">two major forces</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.359" end="00:48:23.440" style="s2">of reality and this exactly why chinese</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.440" end="00:48:24.480" style="s2">culture has to introduce confucianism as</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.440" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">a third force</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.480" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">and that when china tends to go</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:30.079" style="s2">tyrannical i would say that the first</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:32.400" style="s2">division you need to make is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.079" end="00:48:33.680" style="s2">division between different men within</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.400" end="00:48:35.200" style="s2">masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.680" end="00:48:36.559" style="s2">this is different between the for</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.200" end="00:48:38.400" style="s2">zoroastrians the difference between the</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.559" end="00:48:40.400" style="s2">king and the priest are fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">that&#39;s the first division you make and</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.400" end="00:48:44.000" style="s2">after you made that division which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:45.599" style="s2">the division between mind and body</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.000" end="00:48:47.359" style="s2">are both separate entities and also</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.599" end="00:48:48.880" style="s2">collaborative entities so you understand</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.359" end="00:48:50.400" style="s2">how you function as a human being</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.880" end="00:48:52.400" style="s2">after you&#39;ve done that you could start</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.400" end="00:48:53.599" style="s2">saying oh okay by the way men and women</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.400" end="00:48:55.440" style="s2">can also be separated</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.599" end="00:48:56.960" style="s2">and by the women and men have different</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.440" end="00:48:58.400" style="s2">stories or different narratives about</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.960" end="00:49:01.440" style="s2">reality and how things work</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.400" end="00:49:03.359" style="s2">because the women&#39;s the female narrative</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.440" end="00:49:04.960" style="s2">or the magical narrative will always be</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.359" end="00:49:05.839" style="s2">the story about everything returns to</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.960" end="00:49:07.599" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.839" end="00:49:09.440" style="s2">it could go that&#39;s any fair tell you</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.599" end="00:49:11.200" style="s2">tell children will be accepted that way</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.440" end="00:49:12.640" style="s2">it&#39;s also about the nomadic tribe</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.200" end="00:49:14.240" style="s2">getting up in the morning and moving on</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.640" end="00:49:14.880" style="s2">to the next stop because otherwise they</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.240" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">die</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.880" end="00:49:18.480" style="s2">these are normal logical stories and</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:19.119" style="s2">they&#39;re fantastic they&#39;re the basic of</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.480" end="00:49:20.559" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.119" end="00:49:22.079" style="s2">but on top of that you can have the</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.559" end="00:49:22.960" style="s2">mythological narratives that are</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.079" end="00:49:24.800" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.960" end="00:49:26.160" style="s2">after since the last four thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.800" end="00:49:28.319" style="s2">which are called civilization</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.160" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">which we need more than ever to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.319" end="00:49:31.520" style="s2">top on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:32.880" style="s2">logical narratives these these this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.520" end="00:49:33.760" style="s2">the return of the phallus that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.880" end="00:49:35.520" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.760" end="00:49:37.200" style="s2">and the phallus must be split the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.520" end="00:49:38.160" style="s2">problem with daoism is when i work with</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.200" end="00:49:39.920" style="s2">this is like</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.160" end="00:49:41.680" style="s2">oh yeah you got the yin yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.920" end="00:49:43.040" style="s2">numerology and you got the yang and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.680" end="00:49:44.800" style="s2">think that should be eventology but the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.040" end="00:49:46.319" style="s2">yang is just one thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.800" end="00:49:48.559" style="s2">what zoras just realized that was you</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.319" end="00:49:50.240" style="s2">had to split that so ahura and master</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.559" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">are two different entities within the</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.240" end="00:49:53.680" style="s2">masculine</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:54.400" style="s2">the ora which is ancient persian for</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.680" end="00:49:56.400" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.400" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">and musta which is ancient persian for</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.400" end="00:49:59.280" style="s2">sense or mind</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:01.119" style="s2">are two different entities the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.280" end="00:50:03.359" style="s2">collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.119" end="00:50:05.119" style="s2">means it&#39;s both being and its mind at</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.359" end="00:50:07.599" style="s2">the same time which is way more hegelian</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.119" end="00:50:09.119" style="s2">as you can just find out</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.599" end="00:50:12.240" style="s2">yeah that means there&#39;s always three</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.119" end="00:50:14.880" style="s2">here and this is what judaism inherits</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.240" end="00:50:16.640" style="s2">because when judaism rewrites the exodus</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.880" end="00:50:18.240" style="s2">out of egypt after the encounter with</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.640" end="00:50:20.319" style="s2">the zoroastrians in babylon</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.240" end="00:50:22.319" style="s2">and and the the hebrews come back as</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.319" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">deuce to to the promised land and build</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.319" end="00:50:25.680" style="s2">the second temple</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:26.559" style="s2">sponsored by the persians they rewrite</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.680" end="00:50:28.079" style="s2">the exodus</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.559" end="00:50:30.480" style="s2">it&#39;s no longer just moses leading his</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.079" end="00:50:33.680" style="s2">people it&#39;s moses and his two siblings</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.480" end="00:50:35.680" style="s2">moses aaron and miriam and with moses</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.680" end="00:50:37.440" style="s2">being the priest and aaron being the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.680" end="00:50:39.680" style="s2">king with the chieftain and with miriam</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.440" end="00:50:41.359" style="s2">being the metroid you get the triadic</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.680" end="00:50:42.000" style="s2">structure that&#39;s the most stable</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.359" end="00:50:44.240" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.000" end="00:50:46.160" style="s2">over time and i would say it&#39;s the both</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.240" end="00:50:47.520" style="s2">imperial and the national structure of</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.160" end="00:50:49.280" style="s2">any system</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.520" end="00:50:50.880" style="s2">larger than tribe we ever invented has</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.280" end="00:50:51.119" style="s2">to have this sort of tragic structure to</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.880" end="00:50:52.880" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.119" end="00:50:54.720" style="s2">the u.s constitution is a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.880" end="00:50:56.480" style="s2">example of that okay but is it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.720" end="00:50:57.760" style="s2">dynamic structure right the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.480" end="00:51:00.800" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.760" end="00:51:03.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a dynamic structure whereas whereas</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.800" end="00:51:05.680" style="s2">a solid structure like exactly in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.920" end="00:51:07.200" style="s2">ind the indians have it in religion at</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.680" end="00:51:08.880" style="s2">least they got it with the shiva and</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.200" end="00:51:10.720" style="s2">and kali but the problem with chinese</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.880" end="00:51:11.760" style="s2">culture chinese culture does not have</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.720" end="00:51:14.800" style="s2">the triad</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.760" end="00:51:16.559" style="s2">it has either the yin or yang or it has</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.800" end="00:51:17.440" style="s2">the confusion dictatorship or tyranny</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.559" end="00:51:18.640" style="s2">more or less</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.440" end="00:51:20.720" style="s2">and that the only reason why</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.640" end="00:51:21.200" style="s2">confucianism became such a big idea in</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.720" end="00:51:23.200" style="s2">china</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.200" end="00:51:24.319" style="s2">two thousand five hundred years ago was</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.200" end="00:51:27.520" style="s2">because it left</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.319" end="00:51:29.599" style="s2">out the three and stayed with the two</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.520" end="00:51:31.040" style="s2">so there was no dialectical turn yin and</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.599" end="00:51:32.400" style="s2">yang are not the dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.040" end="00:51:34.559" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.400" end="00:51:36.640" style="s2">you say try towards a balancing act that</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.559" end="00:51:38.240" style="s2">sort of harmony a harmonious act</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.640" end="00:51:39.839" style="s2">and that is very similar to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.240" end="00:51:41.520" style="s2">separation of church and state which is</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.839" end="00:51:42.960" style="s2">of course than the problem with the west</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.520" end="00:51:44.240" style="s2">these are the two major problems we deal</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.960" end="00:51:45.760" style="s2">with not philosophically is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.240" end="00:51:46.400" style="s2">separation of church of state fifth</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.760" end="00:51:48.640" style="s2">century</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.400" end="00:51:50.800" style="s2">rome okay major problem for the west and</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.640" end="00:51:52.480" style="s2">we live with the consequences ever since</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.800" end="00:51:54.240" style="s2">and china has always had the problem the</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.480" end="00:51:56.640" style="s2">talisman itself was not</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.240" end="00:51:58.480" style="s2">enough and that&#39;s why dallas split and</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.640" end="00:52:00.079" style="s2">eventually turned into buddhism&#39;s mother</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.480" end="00:52:01.119" style="s2">and child worship in china</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.079" end="00:52:03.119" style="s2">and then the other version was</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.119" end="00:52:04.160" style="s2">confucianism and the problem with china</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.119" end="00:52:06.160" style="s2">still today</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.160" end="00:52:07.280" style="s2">is that china has such a fiendishly hard</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.160" end="00:52:10.400" style="s2">problem dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.280" end="00:52:11.839" style="s2">plurality and plurality is the key to</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.400" end="00:52:13.760" style="s2">freedom and to creativity</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.839" end="00:52:16.400" style="s2">that&#39;s what the chinese are dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.760" end="00:52:16.400" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.480" end="00:52:20.400" style="s2">and i think we we owe them a response to</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.800" end="00:52:21.920" style="s2">that we owe them a philosophy as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.400" end="00:52:23.760" style="s2">response to see you in pink&#39;s current</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.920" end="00:52:26.160" style="s2">tyranny dictatorship in china</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.760" end="00:52:28.559" style="s2">and that has to be uh a son socracy</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.160" end="00:52:30.720" style="s2">which is developing but a plural system</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.559" end="00:52:32.240" style="s2">and this is why these terms antagony</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.720" end="00:52:33.920" style="s2">come back all the g again like</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.240" end="00:52:35.839" style="s2">you&#39;re only becoming intelligent by</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.920" end="00:52:37.119" style="s2">constantly being challenged by opponents</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.839" end="00:52:38.319" style="s2">who disagree with you</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.119" end="00:52:40.079" style="s2">rather than people who just agree with</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.319" end="00:52:42.000" style="s2">you all the time and this is why we</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.079" end="00:52:42.559" style="s2">criticize the dictators of history in</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.000" end="00:52:44.000" style="s2">the new book</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.559" end="00:52:45.920" style="s2">called the boy pharaohs and pillar</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.000" end="00:52:47.920" style="s2">saints because they&#39;re too scared of</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.920" end="00:52:49.040" style="s2">being antagonically challenged in</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.920" end="00:52:52.000" style="s2">anything they do</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.040" end="00:52:53.280" style="s2">because that&#39;s requires a system that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.000" end="00:52:55.760" style="s2">plural</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.280" end="00:52:56.640" style="s2">at its core and china still hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.760" end="00:53:00.000" style="s2">developed that</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.640" end="00:53:01.839" style="s2">yeah and i i think of the the freudian</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.000" end="00:53:03.599" style="s2">repression when you repress that</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.839" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">antigone then you get</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.599" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">um all this chaos that we see today and</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.240" end="00:53:11.520" style="s2">yeah yeah i regret this dynamic you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.040" end="00:53:14.559" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.520" end="00:53:17.920" style="s2">um uh conversation or</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.559" end="00:53:18.960" style="s2">or or process of under you know rubbing</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.920" end="00:53:20.160" style="s2">up against each other which the</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.960" end="00:53:22.640" style="s2">masculine</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.160" end="00:53:23.440" style="s2">really enjoys right but why is there</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.640" end="00:53:26.880" style="s2">then so much</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.440" end="00:53:28.640" style="s2">like um</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.880" end="00:53:30.160" style="s2">why is there so so much loathing of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.640" end="00:53:31.040" style="s2">masculine in the culture at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.160" end="00:53:34.160" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.040" end="00:53:38.400" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s it seems very</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.160" end="00:53:40.720" style="s2">present or it&#39;s it starts after 1945.</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.400" end="00:53:41.839" style="s2">it was hitler and stalin and colonialism</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.720" end="00:53:43.760" style="s2">and we blew up the bomb</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.839" end="00:53:45.680" style="s2">in august 1945 and scared the out</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.760" end="00:53:47.119" style="s2">of ourselves we realized that we can</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.680" end="00:53:48.640" style="s2">kill ourselves easily we can press a</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.119" end="00:53:51.040" style="s2">button and kill ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.640" end="00:53:51.839" style="s2">now after 1945 that all those things are</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.040" end="00:53:52.880" style="s2">phallic i mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.839" end="00:53:55.040" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing more phallic than</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.880" end="00:53:56.720" style="s2">dropping an atomic bomb or something</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.040" end="00:53:58.160" style="s2">so yeah we&#39;re terrified of fellas</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.720" end="00:54:00.319" style="s2">because violence can also kill us</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.160" end="00:54:02.319" style="s2">so if phallus is associated with shadow</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.319" end="00:54:04.480" style="s2">it will kill us</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.319" end="00:54:06.079" style="s2">so so we are dealing with false but the</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.480" end="00:54:07.920" style="s2">way we dealt with fallows in the west</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.079" end="00:54:09.920" style="s2">was that we try to hide it and push it</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.920" end="00:54:10.480" style="s2">down and suppress it and take it away</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.920" end="00:54:13.680" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.480" end="00:54:15.359" style="s2">jung and you know uh schmidt</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.680" end="00:54:17.280" style="s2">all these other guys warned us about</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.359" end="00:54:19.040" style="s2">doing it and strauss wonders about doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.280" end="00:54:20.559" style="s2">it it&#39;s now coming back to haunt us</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.040" end="00:54:23.040" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s exactly what happened</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.559" end="00:54:24.640" style="s2">because once the internet came along</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.040" end="00:54:26.880" style="s2">and and we got into this sort of very</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.640" end="00:54:28.640" style="s2">effeminate victimhood culture</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.880" end="00:54:30.160" style="s2">uh that we&#39;re stuck with now and we</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.640" end="00:54:32.160" style="s2">stuck it for the past 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.160" end="00:54:33.280" style="s2">the only way out of that is some genuine</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.160" end="00:54:35.920" style="s2">phallic projects</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.280" end="00:54:37.359" style="s2">that could move humanity forward and</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.920" end="00:54:38.880" style="s2">that&#39;s why i&#39;m writing about</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.359" end="00:54:40.400" style="s2">engineers and architects and why i love</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.880" end="00:54:41.760" style="s2">them and i want to work with engineers</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.400" end="00:54:42.880" style="s2">and architects and everything i do my</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.760" end="00:54:44.400" style="s2">philosophy because</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.880" end="00:54:46.319" style="s2">i think we need to be whole new</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.400" end="00:54:46.799" style="s2">technologists that challenge our minds</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.319" end="00:54:48.880" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.799" end="00:54:50.960" style="s2">we can create a better world because of</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.880" end="00:54:52.240" style="s2">it we need cosmopolitanism</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.960" end="00:54:54.000" style="s2">we need the love of strangers that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.240" end="00:54:57.599" style="s2">called crypto we need</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.000" end="00:54:59.040" style="s2">uh we need uh to fix ecology we call</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.599" end="00:55:00.559" style="s2">that echotopianism because</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.040" end="00:55:01.760" style="s2">environmentalism is simply not enough</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.559" end="00:55:04.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just dystopian</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.760" end="00:55:06.119" style="s2">and at the end of the day the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.000" end="00:55:08.960" style="s2">goal of all this is to create a</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.119" end="00:55:10.720" style="s2">protopianism not another utopianism not</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.960" end="00:55:11.440" style="s2">another dystopianism we had enough of</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.720" end="00:55:12.880" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.440" end="00:55:14.079" style="s2">so it&#39;s again it&#39;s a dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.880" end="00:55:15.920" style="s2">relationship where we discover that</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.079" end="00:55:17.520" style="s2">protopianism is the way forward</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.920" end="00:55:19.839" style="s2">and protopianism is the original</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.520" end="00:55:22.559" style="s2">sorastian idea of the frasso</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.839" end="00:55:24.400" style="s2">an ever renewed refreshed world with new</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.559" end="00:55:25.520" style="s2">challenges that we take on gladly every</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.400" end="00:55:27.040" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.520" end="00:55:29.280" style="s2">that kind of world is the only way we</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.040" end="00:55:31.440" style="s2">could could consider and think of and</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.280" end="00:55:33.280" style="s2">that&#39;s why the protopians to me</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.440" end="00:55:34.799" style="s2">is the name of the digital priesthood</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.280" end="00:55:37.200" style="s2">we&#39;re building right now</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.799" end="00:55:38.720" style="s2">we are the first protopians right here</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.200" end="00:55:39.839" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to work with artists and</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.720" end="00:55:41.599" style="s2">philosophers and</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.839" end="00:55:42.880" style="s2">and architects and engineers and all</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.599" end="00:55:43.760" style="s2">these people who want to build a new</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.880" end="00:55:45.760" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.760" end="00:55:47.440" style="s2">and if we need to make an exodus to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.760" end="00:55:48.799" style="s2">it we&#39;ll make the exodus otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.440" end="00:55:51.200" style="s2">we&#39;ll do it right here and now where</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.799" end="00:55:52.720" style="s2">we&#39;re located we&#39;re doing digitally</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.200" end="00:55:54.079" style="s2">right now during the corona months we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.720" end="00:55:55.920" style="s2">done it immensely already</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.079" end="00:55:57.599" style="s2">i think augmented reality is the next</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.920" end="00:55:59.760" style="s2">big thing over the next 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.599" end="00:56:01.599" style="s2">then probably we&#39;ll meet aai we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.760" end="00:56:03.839" style="s2">collaborate with ai in a symbiotic</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.599" end="00:56:06.559" style="s2">transcendental relationship with it</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.839" end="00:56:08.319" style="s2">so i&#39;m i&#39;m i think all these things are</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.559" end="00:56:09.040" style="s2">possible it&#39;s my job to write</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.319" end="00:56:11.920" style="s2">about it the way</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.040" end="00:56:13.760" style="s2">marx and nietzsche wrote about promising</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.920" end="00:56:15.359" style="s2">things like the proletariat or the uber</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.760" end="00:56:17.280" style="s2">mansion today that is writing about</p>

<p begin="00:57:36.240" end="00:57:39.680" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and i think that men by</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.799" end="00:57:42.880" style="s2">and large</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.680" end="00:57:44.720" style="s2">you know over the past few years and i</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.880" end="00:57:47.119" style="s2">think increasingly in the future</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.720" end="00:57:47.920" style="s2">are going to rise to this challenge uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.119" end="00:57:50.400" style="s2">yeah i agree</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.920" end="00:57:51.119" style="s2">disconnect from completely and end up</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.400" end="00:57:53.599" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.119" end="00:57:55.040" style="s2">uh you know disconnected right the</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.599" end="00:57:55.680" style="s2">problem though with this test</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.040" end="00:57:57.520" style="s2">that&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.680" end="00:57:59.040" style="s2">young guys i found out it&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.520" end="00:58:00.880" style="s2">test i say yes it is</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.040" end="00:58:03.119" style="s2">the problem though is that if the young</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.880" end="00:58:04.720" style="s2">men jump to conclusions too quickly they</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.119" end="00:58:05.920" style="s2">will go towards tyranny and they will</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.720" end="00:58:07.200" style="s2">love the fake fellas</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.920" end="00:58:09.040" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.200" end="00:58:09.920" style="s2">1930s with stalin and hitler and those</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.040" end="00:58:12.400" style="s2">guys too</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.920" end="00:58:14.720" style="s2">the risk for that is actually immense</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.400" end="00:58:16.960" style="s2">especially the united states</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.720" end="00:58:18.079" style="s2">so uh i think i think that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.960" end="00:58:19.920" style="s2">wrote about the fake fathers and</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.079" end="00:58:21.839" style="s2">authentic fellows in digital libido we</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.920" end="00:58:24.079" style="s2">weren&#39;t about the fake falls</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.839" end="00:58:25.520" style="s2">again there are way more fake phalluses</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.079" end="00:58:27.280" style="s2">around at times like this than their</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.520" end="00:58:29.280" style="s2">authentic phalluses around</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.280" end="00:58:31.040" style="s2">so the question is that who is then the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.280" end="00:58:31.760" style="s2">authentic phallus and could we ever see</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.040" end="00:58:33.200" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.760" end="00:58:34.559" style="s2">and you and i under have explored this</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.200" end="00:58:36.720" style="s2">together with thomas hamrick and our</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.559" end="00:58:38.079" style="s2">webcast together i would say that the</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.720" end="00:58:41.040" style="s2">fake phallus</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.079" end="00:58:42.559" style="s2">comes out of the lynch mob and senses</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.040" end="00:58:44.079" style="s2">that there&#39;s a shared voice within the</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.559" end="00:58:45.200" style="s2">linchpin it&#39;s like a shared agreement</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.079" end="00:58:46.880" style="s2">with a little lynch mod</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.200" end="00:58:48.799" style="s2">and to get the tension out of the lynch</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.880" end="00:58:50.079" style="s2">mob and find an object and attack the</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.799" end="00:58:51.920" style="s2">object the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.079" end="00:58:53.599" style="s2">the scapegoat mechanism somebody</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.920" end="00:58:55.040" style="s2">personifies the energetic all of a</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.599" end="00:58:57.040" style="s2">sudden puts on a uniform and</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.040" end="00:58:58.160" style="s2">becomes hitler and it rises to power</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.040" end="00:58:59.839" style="s2">very very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.160" end="00:59:02.079" style="s2">i think the risk for that is enormous</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.839" end="00:59:04.400" style="s2">it&#39;s happened already in china his name</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.079" end="00:59:05.839" style="s2">is xian ping it says 2014</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.400" end="00:59:08.079" style="s2">is now officially the dictator of</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.839" end="00:59:09.200" style="s2">communism maybe we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.079" end="00:59:10.960" style="s2">yeah we don&#39;t want that to happen in</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.200" end="00:59:12.400" style="s2">other places but but the problem is this</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.960" end="00:59:13.760" style="s2">you got to wait for the authentic</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.400" end="00:59:14.240" style="s2">phallus you&#39;ve got to ask all these</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.760" end="00:59:16.559" style="s2">fellas</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.240" end="00:59:18.640" style="s2">who are you and what were you authentic</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.559" end="00:59:20.559" style="s2">and the only authentic fellows</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.640" end="00:59:22.319" style="s2">is really the guy who stands up to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.559" end="00:59:24.480" style="s2">lynch mob and say we can do</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.319" end="00:59:26.559" style="s2">better than that we can do better than</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.480" end="00:59:28.079" style="s2">being dystopians of vulgar utopians we</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.559" end="00:59:28.640" style="s2">can do better by being protopians</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.079" end="00:59:30.319" style="s2">instead</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.640" end="00:59:31.680" style="s2">and this is what is required for us to</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.319" end="00:59:34.559" style="s2">go protopian so the guy</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.680" end="00:59:36.400" style="s2">stands up and says no to the lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.559" end="00:59:37.680" style="s2">he might be crucified because of it</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.400" end="00:59:40.720" style="s2">that&#39;s happened before</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.680" end="00:59:41.599" style="s2">but he is the high project the precursor</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.720" end="00:59:43.520" style="s2">is the high project</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.599" end="00:59:45.920" style="s2">to what we call the savior in our</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.520" end="00:59:47.119" style="s2">culture that the jews call the messiah</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.920" end="00:59:49.119" style="s2">the messiah of course</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.119" end="00:59:50.880" style="s2">and the persians the persians invented</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.119" end="00:59:53.760" style="s2">the concept called it the cell shown</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.880" end="00:59:55.440" style="s2">and please note the sultan is a function</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.760" end="00:59:57.119" style="s2">it&#39;s a function that steps in with the</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.440" end="01:00:00.160" style="s2">phallus slackening society</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.119" end="01:00:00.720" style="s2">personifies the phallus has the phallic</p>

<p begin="01:00:00.720" end="01:00:05.280" style="s2">and gives you the phallic vision and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.040" end="01:00:08.559" style="s2">phallic strategy and says we&#39;re gonna go</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.280" end="01:00:10.799" style="s2">there and the name for that is exodus</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.559" end="01:00:12.559" style="s2">it&#39;s all about the exodus and and i i</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.799" end="01:00:14.079" style="s2">believe strongly that we as philosophers</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.559" end="01:00:17.440" style="s2">have to formulate</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.079" end="01:00:18.960" style="s2">that exodus into digital and into the</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.440" end="01:00:20.559" style="s2">global and into the world we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.960" end="01:00:22.240" style="s2">into now the paradigm shift that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.559" end="01:00:23.520" style="s2">currently going through</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.240" end="01:00:25.200" style="s2">and the implicated order of that was</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.520" end="01:00:26.559" style="s2">capitalism the explicit order of that is</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.200" end="01:00:28.240" style="s2">potentialism to see if we could go</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.559" end="01:00:30.640" style="s2">towards a communism of some kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.240" end="01:00:32.400" style="s2">but we need to do precisely that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.640" end="01:00:33.839" style="s2">that&#39;s the greatest challenge the next</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.400" end="01:00:35.599" style="s2">50 to 100 years in the world of</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.839" end="01:00:37.920" style="s2">philosophy according to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.599" end="01:00:39.760" style="s2">and that is where i tell the guys to</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.920" end="01:00:41.440" style="s2">watch out and wait for the authentic</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.760" end="01:00:43.359" style="s2">files wait wait wait</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.440" end="01:00:45.440" style="s2">because if they go for fake phalluses</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.359" end="01:00:46.720" style="s2">now they go for all these alt-right guys</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.440" end="01:00:47.359" style="s2">and soon they&#39;re going to be old enough</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.720" end="01:00:50.000" style="s2">guys around</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.359" end="01:00:51.280" style="s2">they try to be the cheap the quick fix</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.000" end="01:00:53.359" style="s2">the short route</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.280" end="01:00:54.400" style="s2">to tyrannical powers you can finally</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.359" end="01:00:56.480" style="s2">submit</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.400" end="01:00:58.400" style="s2">to the to that fake father figures you</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.480" end="01:00:59.520" style="s2">can finally get all that frustration out</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.400" end="01:01:01.040" style="s2">of your system</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.520" end="01:01:03.760" style="s2">can i i want to go back just just a</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.040" end="01:01:07.160" style="s2">little bit because i think maybe cattle</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.760" end="01:01:08.799" style="s2">has some good insight into the the</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.160" end="01:01:11.520" style="s2">psychoanalytical</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.799" end="01:01:13.200" style="s2">basis of why we have this fake phallus</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.520" end="01:01:14.480" style="s2">and why we have the the you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.200" end="01:01:15.359" style="s2">the authentic and what&#39;s the fake</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.480" end="01:01:18.720" style="s2">phallus if</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.359" end="01:01:19.520" style="s2">if you follow bard&#39;s um analysis here</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.720" end="01:01:22.240" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.520" end="01:01:23.280" style="s2">the fake phallus being the sort of</p>

<p begin="01:01:23.280" end="01:01:26.400" style="s2">and i guess the authentic philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.839" end="01:01:28.640" style="s2">being the</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.400" end="01:01:31.040" style="s2">the really courageous you know one who</p>

<p begin="01:06:11.119" end="01:06:15.200" style="s2">like from a freudian sense or oh you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:06:17.119" end="01:06:21.200" style="s2">you&#39;re stuck close to the mamilla this</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.680" end="01:06:22.960" style="s2">is the problem with the welfare state</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.200" end="01:06:24.400" style="s2">systems we developed marx would have</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.960" end="01:06:26.960" style="s2">hated them to be honest about it</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.400" end="01:06:27.599" style="s2">the welfare systems basically tax mostly</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.960" end="01:06:29.760" style="s2">men</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.599" end="01:06:31.680" style="s2">and then redistribute the money and</p>

<p begin="01:06:31.680" end="01:06:35.359" style="s2">and then into the hands of the children</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.440" end="01:06:35.680" style="s2">so they all become like young diabetics</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.359" end="01:06:37.280" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.680" end="01:06:38.960" style="s2">obese and all those kinds of things and</p>

<p begin="01:10:00.239" end="01:10:04.400" style="s2">i think actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.920" end="01:10:05.760" style="s2">the psychedelic revolution might provide</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.400" end="01:10:08.719" style="s2">and ceremony</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.760" end="01:10:09.600" style="s2">actual deep religious ceremony with</p>

<p begin="01:10:17.040" end="01:10:19.920" style="s2">attachment to the mother and who have</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.320" end="01:10:20.800" style="s2">been able to integrate their identity as</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.920" end="01:10:23.120" style="s2">a father</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.800" end="01:10:23.840" style="s2">and as alexander bard says in the notion</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.120" end="01:10:27.040" style="s2">of fatherhood</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.840" end="01:10:29.440" style="s2">in the way bard says in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.040" end="01:10:31.520" style="s2">fatherhood is any activity where older</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.440" end="01:10:32.640" style="s2">men are taking care of younger men and</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.520" end="01:10:35.199" style="s2">trying to point them in the right</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.640" end="01:10:37.520" style="s2">direction this is the act of the father</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.199" end="01:10:38.000" style="s2">i can be a father to a 20 year old guy</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.520" end="01:10:41.040" style="s2">who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.000" end="01:10:44.719" style="s2">coming to me and looking for guidance</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.040" end="01:10:45.840" style="s2">yeah yeah i agree completely yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.719" end="01:10:47.679" style="s2">exactly what&#39;s going on well you almost</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.840" end="01:10:50.320" style="s2">want to say amen because it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.679" end="01:10:51.280" style="s2">it&#39;s so absolutely uh obviously true at</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.320" end="01:10:52.960" style="s2">this point</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.280" end="01:10:54.800" style="s2">um that that&#39;s what we need and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.960" end="01:10:56.800" style="s2">big blind spot of society</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.800" end="01:10:58.719" style="s2">on some level yeah and i think it can</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.800" end="01:11:00.000" style="s2">only happen with some people first that</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.719" end="01:11:01.760" style="s2">go first that&#39;s why i talk about</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.000" end="01:11:02.560" style="s2">excitology so somebody has to lead by</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.760" end="01:11:04.239" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.560" end="01:11:06.239" style="s2">and then other people can mimic that and</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.239" end="01:11:06.880" style="s2">they can say okay that worked okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.239" end="01:11:09.199" style="s2">do it</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.880" end="01:11:11.040" style="s2">let&#39;s see if we can invite more people</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.199" end="01:11:13.120" style="s2">two or more guys in that case</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.040" end="01:11:14.560" style="s2">to go through that same ritual but this</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.120" end="01:11:16.480" style="s2">is what&#39;s important here</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.560" end="01:11:18.719" style="s2">when you do psych analysis it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.480" end="01:11:20.320" style="s2">impossible to do it unless you first</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.719" end="01:11:22.000" style="s2">learn to think critically about the</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.320" end="01:11:24.400" style="s2">world you live in</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.000" end="01:11:25.679" style="s2">you first have to understand that for</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.400" end="01:11:26.000" style="s2">example if you&#39;re going to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.679" end="01:11:27.600" style="s2">peter</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.000" end="01:11:28.800" style="s2">pan syndrome or caligula syndrome you</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.600" end="01:11:30.000" style="s2">better find out which one you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.800" end="01:11:32.080" style="s2">actually going to deal with which is</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.000" end="01:11:34.239" style="s2">your main problem here</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.080" end="01:11:35.760" style="s2">are you refusing to grow up or you</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.239" end="01:11:37.280" style="s2">haven&#39;t been taught how to grow up or</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.760" end="01:11:38.880" style="s2">you don&#39;t have self-confidence enough to</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.280" end="01:11:39.840" style="s2">grow up and you&#39;re stuck at the mammal</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.880" end="01:11:40.960" style="s2">although you should have left it when</p>

<p begin="01:11:56.719" end="01:12:00.080" style="s2">the only alternative forward</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.560" end="01:12:01.760" style="s2">and everything is going to return to the</p>

<p begin="01:12:09.120" end="01:12:13.920" style="s2">now if you realize that that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.679" end="01:12:16.080" style="s2">remember that psychoanalysis starts with</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.920" end="01:12:17.280" style="s2">learning how to think critically about</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.080" end="01:12:18.080" style="s2">yourself and the environment you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.280" end="01:12:20.000" style="s2">stuck in</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.080" end="01:12:21.440" style="s2">that&#39;s why a great psych analyst like a</p>

<p begin="01:12:21.440" end="01:12:25.040" style="s2">will basically throw you back into the</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.440" end="01:12:26.719" style="s2">world where you live so you&#39;re forced to</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.040" end="01:12:27.440" style="s2">make up your mind about the world within</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.719" end="01:12:29.199" style="s2">which you live</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.440" end="01:12:31.120" style="s2">you need to learn you need to get</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.199" end="01:12:33.760" style="s2">knowledge you need to get informed</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.120" end="01:12:35.600" style="s2">once you are in that realm when you when</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.760" end="01:12:37.040" style="s2">you you you realize you you get</p>

<p begin="01:12:37.679" end="01:12:40.880" style="s2">and you&#39;re truly understanding i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.520" end="01:12:42.400" style="s2">mean critical theory in the sense you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.880" end="01:12:43.199" style="s2">teaching academia today because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.400" end="01:12:46.560" style="s2">usually rubbish</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.199" end="01:12:48.400" style="s2">i mean to think critically properly</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.560" end="01:12:50.719" style="s2">yeah this is this is this psychoanalysis</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.400" end="01:12:52.719" style="s2">great lesson once you&#39;ve done that you</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.719" end="01:12:53.120" style="s2">can then start looking at yourself as</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.719" end="01:12:55.360" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.120" end="01:12:57.360" style="s2">empty subject the void that tries to</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.360" end="01:12:58.640" style="s2">fill itself with desires and drives and</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.360" end="01:13:00.480" style="s2">all those kind of things and</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.640" end="01:13:02.159" style="s2">repeats those processes or whatever and</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.480" end="01:13:03.679" style="s2">play around with it but you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.159" end="01:13:05.360" style="s2">that unless you first have defined</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.679" end="01:13:05.920" style="s2">yourself and what kind of society you</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.360" end="01:13:07.520" style="s2">live in</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.920" end="01:13:09.360" style="s2">the name for this in our work is</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.520" end="01:13:11.199" style="s2">paradigmatics</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.360" end="01:13:12.640" style="s2">paradigmatics means you&#39;ve got to find</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.199" end="01:13:13.199" style="s2">out what kind of paradigm you actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.640" end="01:13:14.880" style="s2">live in</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.199" end="01:13:16.239" style="s2">and you will discover very quickly that</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.880" end="01:13:18.000" style="s2">most people will tell you live in a</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.239" end="01:13:20.880" style="s2">previous paradigm that&#39;s already gone</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.000" end="01:13:22.560" style="s2">and dead and over so you&#39;ve got to find</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.880" end="01:13:23.440" style="s2">out exactly what kind of world do you</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.560" end="01:13:25.280" style="s2">live in now</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.440" end="01:13:26.800" style="s2">what kind of environment is this how do</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.280" end="01:13:28.080" style="s2">people relate to all the technologies</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.800" end="01:13:30.560" style="s2">and things they have around them</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.080" end="01:13:31.120" style="s2">and where will people be 30 40 50 years</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.560" end="01:13:33.280" style="s2">from now</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.120" end="01:13:35.600" style="s2">so you can orientate yourself within</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.280" end="01:13:37.199" style="s2">that context i call it the aristotelian</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.600" end="01:13:39.040" style="s2">revival we need right now we need to</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.199" end="01:13:40.719" style="s2">understand the context where we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.040" end="01:13:43.199" style="s2">to understand the different causes of</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.719" end="01:13:44.960" style="s2">our behaviors and to do that i think</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.199" end="01:13:46.880" style="s2">it&#39;s fundamental to first get to a</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.960" end="01:13:48.800" style="s2">proper critical theory</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.880" end="01:13:50.640" style="s2">so that&#39;s the that&#39;s the will to</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.800" end="01:13:52.640" style="s2">intelligence i think you called it right</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.640" end="01:13:54.159" style="s2">no that&#39;s social analysis there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.640" end="01:13:55.679" style="s2">the will to transcendence well i was</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.159" end="01:13:56.239" style="s2">just thinking about the body mind thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.679" end="01:13:59.520" style="s2">and okay</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.239" end="01:13:59.520" style="s2">no no you need to be thick</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.440" end="01:14:12.719" style="s2">the world to intelligence is the</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.280" end="01:14:15.040" style="s2">separation of</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.719" end="01:14:15.840" style="s2">master is a separation of the priest and</p>

<p begin="01:14:15.840" end="01:14:19.199" style="s2">within ourselves and certainly within</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.679" end="01:14:21.120" style="s2">the community as the two dominant</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.199" end="01:14:23.120" style="s2">archetypes to do leaders</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.120" end="01:14:24.159" style="s2">the priest is the will to intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.120" end="01:14:26.400" style="s2">the priest</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.159" end="01:14:28.800" style="s2">has an urge to accumulate all the</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.400" end="01:14:30.560" style="s2">information about history up until now</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.800" end="01:14:32.000" style="s2">and provide us with the ah more faulty</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.560" end="01:14:32.480" style="s2">that nietzsche talks about so we can</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.000" end="01:14:35.360" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.480" end="01:14:37.520" style="s2">fresh then the priest worships and</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.360" end="01:14:38.640" style="s2">admires the king or the chieftain</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.520" end="01:14:40.560" style="s2">because the king the chieftain</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.640" end="01:14:42.159" style="s2">represents the world to transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.560" end="01:14:44.159" style="s2">this is the world to change the world</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.159" end="01:14:46.640" style="s2">for the better and to create a new world</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.159" end="01:14:48.239" style="s2">a new tomorrow and that starts with</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.640" end="01:14:49.360" style="s2">knowing everything about the world you</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.239" end="01:14:51.760" style="s2">already operate within</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.360" end="01:14:53.440" style="s2">any technologist any engineer will tell</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.760" end="01:14:54.320" style="s2">you i need to know everything about</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.440" end="01:14:56.080" style="s2">physics and</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.320" end="01:14:58.400" style="s2">chemistry and usually also these days</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.080" end="01:14:59.920" style="s2">biology to be able to create about the</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.400" end="01:15:02.640" style="s2">technologies we&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.920" end="01:15:04.400" style="s2">yes these knowledges are will to</p>

<p begin="01:15:04.400" end="01:15:06.800" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.040" end="01:15:09.040" style="s2">this is why priests in all culture build</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.800" end="01:15:10.640" style="s2">libraries store information</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.040" end="01:15:12.159" style="s2">save information with the words coming</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.640" end="01:15:14.080" style="s2">along in the library or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.159" end="01:15:15.760" style="s2">so information is stored for the future</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.080" end="01:15:17.520" style="s2">so you have somewhere to go</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.760" end="01:15:19.040" style="s2">to learn that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.520" end="01:15:20.640" style="s2">monasteries used to do that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.040" end="01:15:22.960" style="s2">academia pretends to do although it</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.640" end="01:15:25.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do it much very for much longer</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.960" end="01:15:26.000" style="s2">but that&#39;s exactly what will to</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.040" end="01:15:27.600" style="s2">intelligence means</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.000" end="01:15:29.199" style="s2">so what we do in our work is that we</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.600" end="01:15:31.520" style="s2">split the world to power</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.199" end="01:15:33.199" style="s2">in nietzsche just like we then split the</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.520" end="01:15:34.880" style="s2">young in taoism</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.199" end="01:15:36.719" style="s2">and division between the ora and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.880" end="01:15:38.000" style="s2">master and this is the world</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.719" end="01:15:40.640" style="s2">transcendence and the world to</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.000" end="01:15:42.239" style="s2">intelligence the two different things</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.640" end="01:15:44.480" style="s2">and here&#39;s the take on the machine when</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.239" end="01:15:45.440" style="s2">the machine comes along the machine can</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.480" end="01:15:47.199" style="s2">only at best do</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.440" end="01:15:49.040" style="s2">will to intelligence it can only best</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.199" end="01:15:51.440" style="s2">replace the priest in certain functions</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.040" end="01:15:53.440" style="s2">but he can never become the king it can</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.440" end="01:15:54.719" style="s2">never become the phallus that wants to</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.440" end="01:15:56.480" style="s2">change the world for the better</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.719" end="01:15:58.239" style="s2">and reach higher and more and make a</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.480" end="01:16:00.480" style="s2">more noble world that&#39;s impossible the</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.239" end="01:16:02.800" style="s2">machine cannot even comprehend that</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.480" end="01:16:05.120" style="s2">because that is transcendent that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.800" end="01:16:08.159" style="s2">drive towards transcendence in our work</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.120" end="01:16:08.880" style="s2">the fourth try yeah that makes sense to</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.159" end="01:16:11.280" style="s2">me uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.880" end="01:16:12.640" style="s2">the the thing i was picking up on was</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.280" end="01:16:14.080" style="s2">was um</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.640" end="01:16:16.400" style="s2">you know you talked about critical</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.080" end="01:16:16.960" style="s2">thinking or being being essential and</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.400" end="01:16:18.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.960" end="01:16:20.159" style="s2">we&#39;re agreed about that but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.800" end="01:16:22.000" style="s2">this this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.159" end="01:16:24.159" style="s2">young men who need to go in on rights of</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.000" end="01:16:26.000" style="s2">initiation and and uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.159" end="01:16:27.679" style="s2">in cattle and cattle&#39;s book he talks</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.000" end="01:16:29.679" style="s2">about death you know then</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.679" end="01:16:32.000" style="s2">needing this needing to become aware of</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.679" end="01:16:35.120" style="s2">death or become you know face death</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.000" end="01:16:35.440" style="s2">on some level uh it means i think a</p>

<p begin="01:16:46.320" end="01:16:50.880" style="s2">it&#39;s both i mean the rite of passage</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.000" end="01:16:52.400" style="s2">is let&#39;s do as the fathers did before us</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.880" end="01:16:54.320" style="s2">let&#39;s have a rite of passage that&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.400" end="01:16:55.440" style="s2">to transcendence very priestly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.320" end="01:16:57.440" style="s2">exactly what psychedelics</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.440" end="01:16:58.560" style="s2">it&#39;s a psychedelic journey as well right</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.440" end="01:17:01.120" style="s2">for example yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.560" end="01:17:02.239" style="s2">but then the next thing is here&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.120" end="01:17:04.800" style="s2">mentor</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.239" end="01:17:06.640" style="s2">here&#39;s a guy who we as elders believe is</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.800" end="01:17:08.800" style="s2">the older version of you</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.640" end="01:17:10.320" style="s2">and you can develop your own personality</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.800" end="01:17:12.719" style="s2">in the shadow of this guy</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.320" end="01:17:14.640" style="s2">under his protection and his fatherly</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.719" end="01:17:15.120" style="s2">gaze his phallic gays and his fatherly</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.640" end="01:17:17.679" style="s2">love</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.120" end="01:17:19.199" style="s2">okay if you do that if you stay within</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.679" end="01:17:20.719" style="s2">that realm and you then become the</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.199" end="01:17:22.640" style="s2">archetype you&#39;re supposed to be so you</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.719" end="01:17:25.360" style="s2">can serve the tribe of the community</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.640" end="01:17:26.320" style="s2">that&#39;s contextual then you have to go</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.360" end="01:17:27.840" style="s2">paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.320" end="01:17:30.000" style="s2">you have to understand the society</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.840" end="01:17:32.480" style="s2">living so we can&#39;t just do these sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.000" end="01:17:34.400" style="s2">timeless rituals the way we used to do</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.480" end="01:17:36.320" style="s2">them to do right of passage and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.400" end="01:17:38.080" style="s2">automatically you become a father or you</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.320" end="01:17:39.760" style="s2">become a mentor or a grown up man</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.080" end="01:17:42.239" style="s2">no you also need to understand the</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.760" end="01:17:44.159" style="s2">specific times you live in</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.239" end="01:17:45.760" style="s2">this is where evertology comes in this</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.159" end="01:17:47.760" style="s2">is where will the transcendence concern</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.760" end="01:17:50.000" style="s2">this is where the contextual comes in</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.760" end="01:17:51.440" style="s2">and that that is why i&#39;m adamant that we</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.000" end="01:17:53.280" style="s2">have to develop ceremonies that are</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.440" end="01:17:55.920" style="s2">specific for the times we live in</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.280" end="01:17:57.840" style="s2">so they make sense today this is why for</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.920" end="01:17:59.520" style="s2">example your relationship to the laptop</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.840" end="01:18:00.800" style="s2">and the smartphone into the dating apps</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.520" end="01:18:01.520" style="s2">and all those things and the computer</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.800" end="01:18:03.120" style="s2">games</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.520" end="01:18:04.960" style="s2">has to be part of the right of passage</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.120" end="01:18:06.320" style="s2">where you renounce certain aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.960" end="01:18:07.920" style="s2">what you did in your behavior</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.320" end="01:18:10.000" style="s2">but you enhance others they actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.920" end="01:18:12.719" style="s2">think oh my god when i do these things i</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.000" end="01:18:14.480" style="s2">go constructive i become phallic i</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.719" end="01:18:16.320" style="s2">i believe in the vision of the strategy</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.480" end="01:18:16.719" style="s2">that i subscribe to i want to be part of</p>

<p begin="01:18:16.719" end="01:18:20.960" style="s2">and these tools help me do that but</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.199" end="01:18:23.520" style="s2">those things are just time pass</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.960" end="01:18:24.000" style="s2">waste of time destructive take my time</p>

<p begin="01:18:26.000" end="01:18:28.640" style="s2">throw them away</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.040" end="01:18:32.239" style="s2">i think that&#39;s when the rite of passage</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.640" end="01:18:32.239" style="s2">could become really powerful</p>

<p begin="01:18:34.000" end="01:18:37.199" style="s2">does it make sense to cattle that i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:18:47.600" end="01:18:51.679" style="s2">yeah this is what we added we added this</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.520" end="01:18:53.520" style="s2">to la khan in digital libido we said</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.679" end="01:18:54.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not just enough with pure drive and</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.520" end="01:18:56.800" style="s2">desire all the fantastic but the</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.960" end="01:18:58.320" style="s2">mechanistic drive and the human</p>

<p begin="01:18:58.320" end="01:19:02.159" style="s2">there okay but there&#39;s the animalistic</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.560" end="01:19:03.600" style="s2">instinct which is of course they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.159" end="01:19:04.400" style="s2">lacan too he just doesn&#39;t pay much</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.600" end="01:19:05.920" style="s2">attention to it</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.400" end="01:19:07.360" style="s2">but it helps have instinct in one and</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.920" end="01:19:08.480" style="s2">then transcendence in the other and</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.360" end="01:19:10.800" style="s2">explore</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.480" end="01:19:12.880" style="s2">and understand transcendence as a drive</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.800" end="01:19:14.159" style="s2">specifically a phallic drive</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.880" end="01:19:16.640" style="s2">it&#39;s the drive that is the most</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.159" end="01:19:18.320" style="s2">masculine drive of them all is to try</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.640" end="01:19:20.320" style="s2">to be part of something bigger than</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.320" end="01:19:22.159" style="s2">yourself i just don&#39;t know if that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.320" end="01:19:22.880" style="s2">contradiction with lacan i know that</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.159" end="01:19:26.080" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.880" end="01:19:27.920" style="s2">what um what le khan says about instinct</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.080" end="01:19:30.719" style="s2">is that in the human realm</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.920" end="01:19:32.000" style="s2">instinct is always drive like instinct</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.719" end="01:19:34.320" style="s2">is always in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.000" end="01:19:36.239" style="s2">transcendentalized by the symbolic order</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.320" end="01:19:37.440" style="s2">like so for example the example i always</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.239" end="01:19:40.880" style="s2">give is like</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.440" end="01:19:44.480" style="s2">you know eating um</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.880" end="01:19:47.520" style="s2">eating uh sleeping and</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.480" end="01:19:49.360" style="s2">homemaking you know okay what we did</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.520" end="01:19:51.360" style="s2">exactly what we did was split it we</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.360" end="01:19:53.840" style="s2">split it both drives all of those</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.360" end="01:19:55.600" style="s2">instincts rather are filtered through</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.840" end="01:19:57.040" style="s2">the symbolic order and in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.600" end="01:19:59.840" style="s2">transcendentalized so like</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.040" end="01:20:00.239" style="s2">the french the french don&#39;t just eat</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.840" end="01:20:02.800" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.239" end="01:20:04.320" style="s2">transcendentalize a certain ritual</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.800" end="01:20:06.000" style="s2">practice of eating</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.320" end="01:20:08.000" style="s2">it&#39;s filtered through the symbolic order</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.000" end="01:20:10.000" style="s2">or we can never just</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.000" end="01:20:11.199" style="s2">we always have to transcendentalize the</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.000" end="01:20:14.159" style="s2">drive</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.199" end="01:20:16.080" style="s2">yeah okay we just split the drive in two</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.159" end="01:20:16.400" style="s2">and kept pure drive as a mechanistic</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.080" end="01:20:18.080" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.400" end="01:20:19.920" style="s2">it&#39;s just easy for people to grasp i</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.080" end="01:20:21.520" style="s2">think that got better</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.920" end="01:20:23.280" style="s2">and then we kept instinct separate as</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.520" end="01:20:24.320" style="s2">animalistic so it makes it easier for</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.280" end="01:20:26.239" style="s2">people to grasp the two</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.320" end="01:20:28.880" style="s2">and then we split the desire between</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.239" end="01:20:30.639" style="s2">desire as the desire of desire</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.880" end="01:20:32.560" style="s2">and transcendence that&#39;s the possibility</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.639" end="01:20:33.840" style="s2">of that and the trick we did was kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.560" end="01:20:36.639" style="s2">hegelian we did it</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.840" end="01:20:38.719" style="s2">we just we just we just imagined that</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.639" end="01:20:40.080" style="s2">say you come out of lacan analysis and</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.719" end="01:20:41.600" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually succeeded</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.080" end="01:20:43.600" style="s2">in the sense you understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.600" end="01:20:45.440" style="s2">actually going on you&#39;re trapped in it</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.600" end="01:20:46.639" style="s2">you will be trapped in it you get that</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.440" end="01:20:47.199" style="s2">but you can actually understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.639" end="01:20:48.480" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.199" end="01:20:50.480" style="s2">so you could actually take part in</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.480" end="01:20:52.480" style="s2">something that transcends you meaning</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.480" end="01:20:54.159" style="s2">for example you you you you can</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.480" end="01:20:55.600" style="s2">understand you&#39;re gonna die one day but</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.159" end="01:20:56.719" style="s2">you can actually leave a heritage that</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.600" end="01:20:57.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.719" end="01:20:58.800" style="s2">meaningless it can actually have some</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.840" end="01:21:00.960" style="s2">meaning to it</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.800" end="01:21:02.480" style="s2">and it helps me at least to understand</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.960" end="01:21:04.000" style="s2">that as a drive itself so our drive</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.480" end="01:21:07.280" style="s2">system has four drives</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.000" end="01:21:08.719" style="s2">instinct air and transcendence and of</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.280" end="01:21:10.159" style="s2">course transcendence we usually then</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.719" end="01:21:12.080" style="s2">call the divine</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.159" end="01:21:14.080" style="s2">or you know it aspires towards the</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.080" end="01:21:16.000" style="s2">divine and and you would say that</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.080" end="01:21:17.760" style="s2">desire is strictly human it&#39;s tied to</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.000" end="01:21:19.040" style="s2">language pure drive itself is</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.760" end="01:21:20.480" style="s2">mechanistic it&#39;s almost like you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.040" end="01:21:21.199" style="s2">machine you&#39;re just doing it you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.480" end="01:21:23.280" style="s2">stop doing it</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.199" end="01:21:24.480" style="s2">you&#39;re patiently doing it and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.280" end="01:21:26.400" style="s2">stop doing it it just</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.480" end="01:21:28.159" style="s2">sticks with you whereas the animalistic</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.400" end="01:21:29.120" style="s2">instinct doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.159" end="01:21:31.199" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.120" end="01:21:32.880" style="s2">but we just we just made it slightly</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.199" end="01:21:33.360" style="s2">more complex maybe more so than we had</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.880" end="01:21:35.120" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.360" end="01:21:36.960" style="s2">but i agree la con does not contradict</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.120" end="01:21:42.159" style="s2">that it&#39;s just that we we developed it</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.960" end="01:21:43.920" style="s2">into four drive series</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.159" end="01:21:46.000" style="s2">i wonder like me and alexander talk a</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.920" end="01:21:49.520" style="s2">lot about about tantra or something</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.000" end="01:21:50.159" style="s2">that being an essential um kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.520" end="01:21:52.080" style="s2">for for</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.159" end="01:21:54.000" style="s2">all of this that we&#39;re talking about in</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.080" end="01:21:56.480" style="s2">a sense uh which is</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.000" end="01:21:57.440" style="s2">is a more sophisticated notion of of</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.480" end="01:21:59.360" style="s2">sexuality</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.440" end="01:22:02.159" style="s2">i wonder if you&#39;ve reflected on tantra</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.360" end="01:22:04.800" style="s2">or if you have any thoughts about tantra</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.159" end="01:22:06.000" style="s2">yeah so there&#39;s a distinction but that</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.800" end="01:22:09.040" style="s2">freud makes between</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.000" end="01:22:10.400" style="s2">for pleasure and end pleasure um and of</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.040" end="01:22:13.040" style="s2">course the the</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.400" end="01:22:15.600" style="s2">the for pleasure is type of like the</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.040" end="01:22:15.600" style="s2">enjoyment</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.600" end="01:22:21.280" style="s2">i i can&#39;t hear you cattle oh we lost</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.679" end="01:22:22.480" style="s2">your microphone we lost your microphone</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.280" end="01:22:24.719" style="s2">for a second</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.480" end="01:22:25.760" style="s2">sorry am i can you hear me yeah yes i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.719" end="01:22:27.840" style="s2">kidding yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.760" end="01:22:29.520" style="s2">so freud makes a distinction between for</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.840" end="01:22:30.719" style="s2">pleasure and end pleasure with four</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.520" end="01:22:32.719" style="s2">pleasure being of course</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.719" end="01:22:34.400" style="s2">things like foreplay and the end</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.719" end="01:22:35.920" style="s2">pleasure being kind of like the build-up</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.400" end="01:22:39.360" style="s2">to the orgasm</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.920" end="01:22:44.400" style="s2">um and i do think that men today are</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.360" end="01:22:47.360" style="s2">um too sloppy with end pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.400" end="01:22:48.320" style="s2">let&#39;s say something like that um and</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.360" end="01:22:51.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.320" end="01:22:55.199" style="s2">uh if tantra is</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.600" end="01:22:58.480" style="s2">the sort of an attempt to educate</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.199" end="01:22:58.719" style="s2">our sexual drive and to you know prolong</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.480" end="01:23:00.960" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.719" end="01:23:02.239" style="s2">and play with it and dramatize it and</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.960" end="01:23:05.360" style="s2">and and and</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.239" end="01:23:08.960" style="s2">you know play with the for pleasure um</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.360" end="01:23:12.000" style="s2">i think that this is an example of a</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.960" end="01:23:13.920" style="s2">you know a maturing man okay well i</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.000" end="01:23:17.679" style="s2">agree with that but</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.920" end="01:23:19.920" style="s2">my my definition of tantra is something</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.679" end="01:23:21.120" style="s2">it begins with the sexual metaphor but</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.920" end="01:23:22.639" style="s2">it expands into</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.120" end="01:23:24.239" style="s2">pretty much everything like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.639" end="01:23:26.480" style="s2">just about sex that would be</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.239" end="01:23:29.280" style="s2">but that would be but that would be</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.480" end="01:23:31.760" style="s2">endlessly delaying the end pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.280" end="01:23:33.760" style="s2">and expanding the for pleasure so much</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.760" end="01:23:35.360" style="s2">that the libidinal energy infuses into</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.760" end="01:23:36.480" style="s2">everything and everything in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.360" end="01:23:40.480" style="s2">can become</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.480" end="01:23:40.480" style="s2">sexual yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.639" end="01:23:45.360" style="s2">or derive in a type of enjoyment which</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.520" end="01:23:46.800" style="s2">well bliss everything becomes bliss in</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.360" end="01:23:48.880" style="s2">tantra it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.800" end="01:23:50.480" style="s2">bliss basically it becomes sort of bliss</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.880" end="01:23:52.400" style="s2">pain too it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.480" end="01:23:54.400" style="s2">sort of a you know a happy birthday yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.400" end="01:23:56.080" style="s2">it&#39;s exploring a sort of optimization of</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.400" end="01:23:57.760" style="s2">living over long periods of time which</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.080" end="01:23:59.520" style="s2">is interesting because it&#39;s the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.760" end="01:24:02.639" style="s2">of mortito and why not</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.520" end="01:24:04.320" style="s2">uh i use tantra in our work because we</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.639" end="01:24:06.080" style="s2">introduced the bard absolute and the</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.320" end="01:24:07.600" style="s2">bard absolute we think is what&#39;s missing</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.080" end="01:24:10.000" style="s2">in christianity in islam</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.600" end="01:24:10.800" style="s2">and and as certain is missing in western</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.000" end="01:24:13.760" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.800" end="01:24:15.520" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s totally alien to an</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.760" end="01:24:16.480" style="s2">indian or a chinese person or say</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.520" end="01:24:18.639" style="s2">zoroastrian from</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.480" end="01:24:19.760" style="s2">persia not everybody absolutely religion</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.639" end="01:24:21.280" style="s2">so it is a judaism</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.760" end="01:24:23.040" style="s2">the broad absolute essentially that we</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.280" end="01:24:24.960" style="s2">don&#39;t talk to god directly</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.040" end="01:24:26.480" style="s2">talk to the lesser gods even in</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.960" end="01:24:28.400" style="s2">catholicism you go and pray to sin</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.480" end="01:24:30.000" style="s2">because you can&#39;t talk to god himself</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.400" end="01:24:31.440" style="s2">and then the saint will talk to god on</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.000" end="01:24:33.120" style="s2">your behalf now</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.440" end="01:24:35.679" style="s2">that&#39;s just this very simple version of</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.120" end="01:24:39.040" style="s2">that and so if you think of the temple</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.679" end="01:24:41.679" style="s2">of the religion when you&#39;re gonna preach</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.040" end="01:24:42.480" style="s2">and teach people in the community how</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.679" end="01:24:44.800" style="s2">they best</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.480" end="01:24:46.239" style="s2">maintain the community number logically</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.800" end="01:24:47.760" style="s2">and maybe even aspire to something</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.239" end="01:24:49.600" style="s2">better eventologically</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.760" end="01:24:50.800" style="s2">you do that you say you&#39;re on the stairs</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.600" end="01:24:51.920" style="s2">and you&#39;re a preacher you preach the</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.800" end="01:24:53.280" style="s2">community and that&#39;s essentially what</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.920" end="01:24:54.719" style="s2">sutra is</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.280" end="01:24:56.480" style="s2">surgical knowledge is that this is how</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.719" end="01:24:58.159" style="s2">the world operates and if you keep with</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.480" end="01:24:59.280" style="s2">the sutra</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.159" end="01:25:01.840" style="s2">you can keep with the community and</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.280" end="01:25:03.600" style="s2">community keeps going but the time trick</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.840" end="01:25:04.880" style="s2">realm is basically to realize that wait</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.600" end="01:25:06.639" style="s2">a second though</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.880" end="01:25:08.000" style="s2">there is knowledge beyond that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.639" end="01:25:09.760" style="s2">not for everyone</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.000" end="01:25:11.679" style="s2">and because not for everyone you got to</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.760" end="01:25:13.040" style="s2">be a person either as the talent to be</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.679" end="01:25:13.600" style="s2">able to absorb that knowledge or you</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.040" end="01:25:14.800" style="s2">come to</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.600" end="01:25:16.480" style="s2">gotta come to a certain point in your</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.800" end="01:25:18.080" style="s2">life when you&#39;ve done all the other</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.480" end="01:25:19.040" style="s2">things you know you ticked all the boxes</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.080" end="01:25:20.480" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to do</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.040" end="01:25:22.719" style="s2">and we can now crown you one of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.480" end="01:25:24.320" style="s2">elders or one of the shamanoids</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.719" end="01:25:26.560" style="s2">and you can then go into the tender</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.320" end="01:25:28.400" style="s2">ground that&#39;s exactly why</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.560" end="01:25:31.600" style="s2">we mimic all the way while we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.400" end="01:25:33.520" style="s2">sutra but when the mimicking has to stop</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.600" end="01:25:35.760" style="s2">yeah you need a crazy wisdom teacher</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.520" end="01:25:37.679" style="s2">you&#39;re grown up enough</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.760" end="01:25:39.520" style="s2">or you&#39;re talented enough or you can</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.679" end="01:25:41.360" style="s2">handle these situations enough so you</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.520" end="01:25:43.040" style="s2">can handle something way beyond that so</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.360" end="01:25:45.679" style="s2">you can meet no longer</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.040" end="01:25:46.320" style="s2">we can meet god directly in a sense you</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.679" end="01:25:48.639" style="s2">know no</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.320" end="01:25:49.760" style="s2">it looks like that to the outside world</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.639" end="01:25:51.679" style="s2">because yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.760" end="01:25:53.840" style="s2">that&#39;s how we associate the tantric with</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.679" end="01:25:55.760" style="s2">divine realms but actually you become</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.840" end="01:25:57.199" style="s2">one of the lesser gods in a way to other</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.760" end="01:25:59.840" style="s2">people in the sense that you</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.199" end="01:26:01.280" style="s2">are inside a barred absolute and once</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.840" end="01:26:02.480" style="s2">you&#39;re inside that board up so which is</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.280" end="01:26:04.000" style="s2">the opposite of the barred subject and</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.480" end="01:26:04.400" style="s2">psychic analysis the bard abs which is</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.000" end="01:26:06.080" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.400" end="01:26:08.239" style="s2">basically the bard object in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.080" end="01:26:10.320" style="s2">that you should not go beyond that point</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.239" end="01:26:11.840" style="s2">unless you&#39;re prepared for it and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.320" end="01:26:13.199" style="s2">prepared for it it&#39;s not that you choose</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.840" end="01:26:15.120" style="s2">to go beyond that point</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.199" end="01:26:17.040" style="s2">but but actually somebody says you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.120" end="01:26:18.719" style="s2">ready for it and you believe them and</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.040" end="01:26:20.400" style="s2">they guide you beyond that point well</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.719" end="01:26:22.800" style="s2">there&#39;s always a part absolute</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.400" end="01:26:23.520" style="s2">no matter where yeah and beyond the bard</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.800" end="01:26:25.520" style="s2">absolute</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.520" end="01:26:27.679" style="s2">uh you find out that the teachers are</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.520" end="01:26:29.280" style="s2">crazy western they go absolutely nuts</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.679" end="01:26:31.280" style="s2">and behave in the most erratic</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.280" end="01:26:33.040" style="s2">erratic ways and you&#39;re very ambivalent</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.280" end="01:26:34.400" style="s2">about them you know they your wife</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.040" end="01:26:36.320" style="s2">and they get drunk and take</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.400" end="01:26:37.920" style="s2">tons of drugs away it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.320" end="01:26:39.920" style="s2">they behave like slightly</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.920" end="01:26:41.600" style="s2">why because it makes it impossible for</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.920" end="01:26:42.159" style="s2">you to mimic them because everything</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.600" end="01:26:44.239" style="s2">you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.159" end="01:26:46.239" style="s2">up until that point has been mimicking</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.239" end="01:26:48.639" style="s2">and the idea with tantra is to</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.239" end="01:26:50.400" style="s2">have even if you&#39;re still avoid is to</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.639" end="01:26:52.080" style="s2">have a sense of self that goes beyond</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.400" end="01:26:53.120" style="s2">the strictly mimicking you&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.080" end="01:26:55.760" style="s2">a robot</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.120" end="01:26:57.199" style="s2">you become deeply human and that is of</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.760" end="01:26:59.679" style="s2">course what shamanoid people</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.199" end="01:27:01.280" style="s2">desire because the shamanists are then</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.679" end="01:27:04.400" style="s2">hired by everybody else</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.280" end="01:27:06.480" style="s2">to talk to the gods on their behalf why</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.400" end="01:27:09.040" style="s2">because the shamanoids handle all</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.480" end="01:27:10.480" style="s2">communication with external world</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.040" end="01:27:11.760" style="s2">the shamanoids are the only people who</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.480" end="01:27:13.360" style="s2">can peacefully walk into the next</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.760" end="01:27:14.800" style="s2">village without getting killed</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.360" end="01:27:15.679" style="s2">the shamanites are the only people who</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.800" end="01:27:16.400" style="s2">can walk straight through the</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.679" end="01:27:18.480" style="s2">battlefield</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.400" end="01:27:19.760" style="s2">with their shamanic dresses on and we</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.480" end="01:27:21.600" style="s2">don&#39;t kill them because we need them as</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.760" end="01:27:23.440" style="s2">go-betweens in case we can finally</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.600" end="01:27:24.800" style="s2">arrive at some kind of peace negotiation</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.440" end="01:27:26.560" style="s2">in the middle of the war this is what</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.800" end="01:27:28.320" style="s2">shamanic people do but because they</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.560" end="01:27:29.520" style="s2">handle all external relations between</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.320" end="01:27:31.040" style="s2">tribes</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.520" end="01:27:32.719" style="s2">they of course also handle the vertical</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.040" end="01:27:33.920" style="s2">external relations which are talking to</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.719" end="01:27:35.679" style="s2">the gods</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.920" end="01:27:37.360" style="s2">this is the origin of the saints the</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.679" end="01:27:38.880" style="s2">martyrs and those things in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.360" end="01:27:40.239" style="s2">history of religion</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.880" end="01:27:43.199" style="s2">is that these are all shall annoyed</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.239" end="01:27:44.560" style="s2">characters but the shamanoid personality</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.199" end="01:27:46.719" style="s2">is not for everyone</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.560" end="01:27:48.560" style="s2">very few people can handle being</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.719" end="01:27:49.040" style="s2">shamanoids staying within a shaman or</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.560" end="01:27:50.880" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.040" end="01:27:52.719" style="s2">that is why tantra is not for everyone</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.880" end="01:27:54.880" style="s2">in eastern culture that&#39;s why we should</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.719" end="01:27:56.400" style="s2">not just throw our psychedelics around</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.880" end="01:27:58.480" style="s2">into the mouths of anybody opens their</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.400" end="01:27:59.520" style="s2">mouth because that will just people</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.480" end="01:28:01.280" style="s2">up immensely</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.520" end="01:28:02.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to do this carefully we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.280" end="01:28:03.840" style="s2">to know what we&#39;re doing it&#39;s sacred</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.880" end="01:28:06.480" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.840" end="01:28:07.679" style="s2">it&#39;s done in sacred spaces we have to</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.480" end="01:28:10.320" style="s2">behave well chris</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.679" end="01:28:11.679" style="s2">is a western way when we do it yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.320" end="01:28:14.080" style="s2">that we cannot be mimicked</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.679" end="01:28:15.440" style="s2">so so we&#39;ve tried sort of mass tantra</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.080" end="01:28:17.280" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.440" end="01:28:20.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s ended up uh you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.280" end="01:28:22.159" style="s2">1960s by dosing everybody or or</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.000" end="01:28:24.159" style="s2">well thankfully oh show cult and things</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.159" end="01:28:24.800" style="s2">like that where people just go mad right</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.159" end="01:28:28.080" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.800" end="01:28:30.880" style="s2">no but it wasn&#39;t even tantra so i&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.080" end="01:28:32.480" style="s2">to say to note that when tantra is being</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.880" end="01:28:34.320" style="s2">explored as a commercial product the</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.480" end="01:28:37.040" style="s2">capitalist society it&#39;s it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.320" end="01:28:38.320" style="s2">flat and so boring and so bland and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.040" end="01:28:39.840" style="s2">basically just there to sleep with</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.320" end="01:28:41.360" style="s2">somebody else but your wife for a while</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.840" end="01:28:43.360" style="s2">you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.360" end="01:28:45.520" style="s2">it&#39;s just hippie nonsense it&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.360" end="01:28:47.040" style="s2">to do with tantra in any tibetan or</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.520" end="01:28:47.679" style="s2">chinese or indian tradition that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.040" end="01:28:50.639" style="s2">ever</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.679" end="01:28:51.440" style="s2">known no but that&#39;s the name of it and i</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.639" end="01:28:53.440" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.440" end="01:28:55.199" style="s2">a western name in the sense of west of</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.440" end="01:28:56.800" style="s2">the gobi desert uh</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.199" end="01:28:58.480" style="s2">you know looking through islam and</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.800" end="01:29:00.400" style="s2">christianity and discovering that</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.480" end="01:29:01.520" style="s2">basically mormonism and scientology long</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.400" end="01:29:04.480" style="s2">before they existed</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.520" end="01:29:05.760" style="s2">um to me that is a strong case for going</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.480" end="01:29:06.960" style="s2">into these sort of much more mature</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.760" end="01:29:08.159" style="s2">religions that have been around for</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.960" end="01:29:09.600" style="s2">thousands of years that have all these</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.159" end="01:29:11.199" style="s2">long spiritual traditions</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.600" end="01:29:13.760" style="s2">and the deal would follow the matrix</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.199" end="01:29:17.040" style="s2">properly and not just throw it away</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.760" end="01:29:18.320" style="s2">ready to be commercialized and uh that</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.040" end="01:29:19.679" style="s2">is that is the strength of judaism</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.320" end="01:29:21.360" style="s2">zoroasterism to me</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.679" end="01:29:23.199" style="s2">they&#39;re responding to that and vary on a</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.360" end="01:29:25.520" style="s2">buddhism certainly is that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.199" end="01:29:26.560" style="s2">in these rich traditions the separation</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.520" end="01:29:29.840" style="s2">of tantra sutra</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.560" end="01:29:31.360" style="s2">which again is that it&#39;s just a where</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.840" end="01:29:32.960" style="s2">you stand on the stairs</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.360" end="01:29:34.719" style="s2">are you in front of the temple or are</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.960" end="01:29:36.239" style="s2">you inside and if you&#39;re inside the</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.719" end="01:29:38.080" style="s2">temple or in the sacred room</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.239" end="01:29:39.600" style="s2">and who&#39;s allowed to enter the room only</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.080" end="01:29:40.719" style="s2">the people who prepared for it nobody</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.600" end="01:29:43.199" style="s2">else should be there</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.719" end="01:29:45.440" style="s2">but in that room is where protopianism</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.199" end="01:29:47.199" style="s2">will be practiced in the new digital age</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.440" end="01:29:49.280" style="s2">that means in that room we isolate</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.199" end="01:29:50.960" style="s2">yourself you can practice creativity</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.280" end="01:29:52.960" style="s2">on a level we&#39;ve probably never seen</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.960" end="01:29:55.120" style="s2">before in human history that&#39;s my great</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.960" end="01:29:57.280" style="s2">hope for the man technology interface</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.120" end="01:30:00.080" style="s2">that&#39;s my singularity and i&#39;ll call it</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.280" end="01:30:00.080" style="s2">protopianism</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.679" end="01:30:08.159" style="s2">the bard absolute that&#39;s what we call it</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.159" end="01:30:09.920" style="s2">i think it needs to be reinstated and i</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.159" end="01:30:11.040" style="s2">think that&#39;s part of the maturing of</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.920" end="01:30:13.280" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.040" end="01:30:15.360" style="s2">or what i call the adultification of</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.280" end="01:30:16.800" style="s2">western society</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.360" end="01:30:19.040" style="s2">we finally come to the point where</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.800" end="01:30:20.639" style="s2">civilization itself needs to go through</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.040" end="01:30:22.080" style="s2">a rite of passage</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.639" end="01:30:23.520" style="s2">and we&#39;re not prepared for it all we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.080" end="01:30:25.360" style="s2">probably more infantile than ever but</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.520" end="01:30:26.880" style="s2">it&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.360" end="01:30:28.400" style="s2">we can&#39;t solve the current problems we</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.880" end="01:30:30.000" style="s2">have ahead of us unless we go through</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.400" end="01:30:35.840" style="s2">the adultification process</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.000" end="01:30:38.159" style="s2">as a society as a whole</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.840" end="01:30:40.320" style="s2">okay so you know we&#39;ve covered sex</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.159" end="01:30:43.440" style="s2">masculinity in god</p>

<p begin="01:30:43.840" end="01:30:47.040" style="s2">fantastic book we&#39;ve talked about all</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.679" end="01:30:48.480" style="s2">these subjects like these are the</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.040" end="01:30:49.440" style="s2">subjects that have been spontaneously</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.480" end="01:30:52.560" style="s2">coming up and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.440" end="01:30:54.960" style="s2">all related to sex masculinity in god so</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.560" end="01:30:56.080" style="s2">not only is it great it&#39;s a great title</p>

<p begin="01:30:58.080" end="01:31:00.320" style="s2">know we&#39;re struggling against in the</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.600" end="01:31:02.320" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.320" end="01:31:04.239" style="s2">um to talk and difficulty we have a</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.320" end="01:31:06.159" style="s2">difficult of talking about</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.239" end="01:31:07.360" style="s2">these these things i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.159" end="01:31:10.320" style="s2">wonderful book and</p>

<p begin="01:31:45.840" end="01:31:50.880" style="s2">working with and or two guys uh let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.920" end="01:31:54.560" style="s2">say kevin and daniel</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.880" end="01:31:56.840" style="s2">kettle well well we we specific i mean</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.560" end="01:31:58.000" style="s2">we specifically designed it to to be a</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.840" end="01:32:01.600" style="s2">trilog</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.000" end="01:32:05.760" style="s2">um and i put a lot of work into</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.600" end="01:32:08.880" style="s2">the you know yes uh we live recorded but</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.760" end="01:32:11.920" style="s2">um i tried to um</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.880" end="01:32:13.360" style="s2">come up with basically uh a structure</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.920" end="01:32:17.040" style="s2">for the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.360" end="01:32:19.920" style="s2">and a specific quote for each chapter</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.040" end="01:32:21.840" style="s2">which would sort of lead us into a type</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.920" end="01:32:25.040" style="s2">of interesting territory that</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.840" end="01:32:27.600" style="s2">where you know it wasn&#39;t just um</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.040" end="01:32:29.120" style="s2">chaotic but we would actually be able to</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.600" end="01:32:31.840" style="s2">work towards</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.120" end="01:32:33.360" style="s2">some sort of you know new idea or new</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.840" end="01:32:35.679" style="s2">perspective on whatever the</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.360" end="01:32:36.639" style="s2">the topic of a given chapter was so like</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.679" end="01:32:39.760" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.639" end="01:32:40.560" style="s2">sexual difference or um love and death</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.760" end="01:32:44.239" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.560" end="01:32:47.280" style="s2">ethics and morality we really wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.239" end="01:32:49.280" style="s2">go into these uh topics in a in an open</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.280" end="01:32:52.960" style="s2">way but a structured way and</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.280" end="01:32:55.199" style="s2">we wanted to basically um</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.960" end="01:32:56.560" style="s2">you know try to make sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.199" end="01:32:58.159" style="s2">present moment of</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.560" end="01:32:59.679" style="s2">love and death the present moment of</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.159" end="01:33:01.120" style="s2">ethics and morality the present moment</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.679" end="01:33:04.480" style="s2">of sexual difference and</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.120" end="01:33:06.560" style="s2">and try to you know give some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.480" end="01:33:08.000" style="s2">you know direction both in method as</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.560" end="01:33:10.000" style="s2">bard said other guys can</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.000" end="01:33:11.280" style="s2">easily do this and i would encourage</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.000" end="01:33:13.440" style="s2">other guys to do this</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.280" end="01:33:15.679" style="s2">because it really helps you to sharpen</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.440" end="01:33:18.960" style="s2">your own understanding of yourself</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.679" end="01:33:22.159" style="s2">um but also to you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.960" end="01:33:25.440" style="s2">really develop a method like</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.159" end="01:33:26.320" style="s2">with the trialog where um people can</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.440" end="01:33:28.719" style="s2">collectively</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.320" end="01:33:29.360" style="s2">come to new ideas on a higher order</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.719" end="01:33:31.440" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.360" end="01:33:32.560" style="s2">um i think it&#39;s one of the i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.440" end="01:33:35.520" style="s2">one of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.560" end="01:33:37.760" style="s2">the great missing pieces of the the</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.520" end="01:33:38.560" style="s2">scientific enterprise where you again i</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.760" end="01:33:40.400" style="s2">always say</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.560" end="01:33:42.719" style="s2">you&#39;ll have a textbook on collective</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.400" end="01:33:44.880" style="s2">intelligence written by one guy</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.719" end="01:33:46.400" style="s2">you know so how well does he know</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.880" end="01:33:48.480" style="s2">collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.400" end="01:33:49.760" style="s2">i can doesn&#39;t sound like he&#39;s embodying</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.480" end="01:33:51.199" style="s2">it so</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.760" end="01:33:53.040" style="s2">i mean this type of thing happens all</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.199" end="01:33:54.480" style="s2">the time in science where they&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.040" end="01:33:55.760" style="s2">about distributed intelligence they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.480" end="01:33:57.199" style="s2">talk about collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.760" end="01:33:59.199" style="s2">they&#39;ll talk about self-reflectivity</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.199" end="01:34:00.719" style="s2">they&#39;ll talk about embodied cognition</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.199" end="01:34:02.320" style="s2">but they don&#39;t do any of these things</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.719" end="01:34:04.400" style="s2">they don&#39;t live any of these things</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.320" end="01:34:05.679" style="s2">and so we really wanted to live this out</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.400" end="01:34:08.639" style="s2">and we wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.679" end="01:34:10.960" style="s2">show that it&#39;s possible for three men of</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.639" end="01:34:14.080" style="s2">a similar status and a similar age</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.960" end="01:34:16.719" style="s2">to come together power share um</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.080" end="01:34:19.679" style="s2">disagree but disagree respectfully in a</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.719" end="01:34:21.760" style="s2">way that the conflict produces new ideas</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.679" end="01:34:23.600" style="s2">yeah i agree completely so it&#39;s path as</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.760" end="01:34:25.280" style="s2">a world to transcendence so the way i</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.600" end="01:34:27.280" style="s2">look at it is this if you just got to</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.280" end="01:34:28.480" style="s2">summarize it pedagogically to 23 year</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.280" end="01:34:29.679" style="s2">old who might want to read sex and</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.480" end="01:34:32.080" style="s2">masculinity god</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.679" end="01:34:34.000" style="s2">i would say this instead of looking for</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.080" end="01:34:35.600" style="s2">recognition from women</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.000" end="01:34:38.080" style="s2">you should find recognition from other</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.600" end="01:34:39.920" style="s2">men this is how three guys sat down</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.080" end="01:34:41.360" style="s2">wrote a trial and got the recognition</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.920" end="01:34:43.360" style="s2">they needed from other men</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.360" end="01:34:45.360" style="s2">that&#39;s what recognition is for a man</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.360" end="01:34:47.360" style="s2">because a woman is somebody you deliver</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.360" end="01:34:47.840" style="s2">to is that somebody you seek recognition</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.360" end="01:34:50.480" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.840" end="01:34:51.840" style="s2">and that colors the entire book so i</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.480" end="01:34:52.480" style="s2">would say i would say that&#39;s a strong</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.840" end="01:34:54.320" style="s2">advice for the</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.480" end="01:34:56.000" style="s2">book and get inspired to do similar</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.320" end="01:34:58.639" style="s2">things if you&#39;re 23 years old</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.000" end="01:35:00.000" style="s2">and by the way for next year 2021</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.639" end="01:35:02.560" style="s2">hopefully the coronal be over by</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.000" end="01:35:03.119" style="s2">then i would love to do men&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.560" end="01:35:04.719" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.119" end="01:35:06.719" style="s2">with the two of you i mean uh the</p>

<p begin="01:35:48.159" end="01:35:51.600" style="s2">when they&#39;re together with other men and</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.679" end="01:35:52.239" style="s2">ask themselves the serious sincere</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.600" end="01:35:54.560" style="s2">question</p>
