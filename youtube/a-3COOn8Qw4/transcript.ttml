<p begin="00:00:20.340" end="00:00:27.060" style="s2">first because I can&#39;t think of what I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:00:31.289" end="00:00:35.760" style="s2">experience Brett just drives my</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.450" end="00:00:37.110" style="s2">experience so far in game B I was so</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.760" end="00:00:40.379" style="s2">happy to have found the game beat</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.110" end="00:00:43.820" style="s2">community having other people who also</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.379" end="00:00:46.559" style="s2">care about the planet but like in this I</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.820" end="00:00:49.590" style="s2">don&#39;t know like like big stuff has to</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.559" end="00:00:51.000" style="s2">shift for first stuff to happen my</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.590" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">language skills are a little off at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.000" end="00:00:56.610" style="s2">moment um was a huge breakthrough for me</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:00:58.649" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve been working in this space</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.610" end="00:01:00.480" style="s2">without the language for years but</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.649" end="00:01:02.609" style="s2">feeling very isolated and very alone in</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.480" end="00:01:04.559" style="s2">it because you can&#39;t explain your idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.609" end="00:01:06.900" style="s2">and you&#39;re not surrounded by people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.559" end="00:01:09.540" style="s2">even want to understand the idea it is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.900" end="00:01:11.520" style="s2">very isolating place to be in and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.540" end="00:01:14.700" style="s2">encountering game B for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.520" end="00:01:16.770" style="s2">in September of 2019 it felt like I had</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.700" end="00:01:19.530" style="s2">come home like I&#39;d found the people the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.770" end="00:01:23.729" style="s2">community that was doing this work and</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.530" end="00:01:26.640" style="s2">wanting to do this work I also have</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.729" end="00:01:29.640" style="s2">found that the conversations I have had</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.640" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">both individually one-on-one and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.640" end="00:01:36.540" style="s2">group conversations have been huge like</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:39.329" style="s2">I feel like the pieces are falling into</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.540" end="00:01:41.159" style="s2">place the vision I had seen before ever</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.329" end="00:01:43.350" style="s2">encountering game B and now it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.159" end="00:01:45.540" style="s2">like unfolding in this way that only I</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.350" end="00:01:49.380" style="s2">can see it but I think other people feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.540" end="00:01:50.579" style="s2">it in their own way in their own that</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.380" end="00:01:51.720" style="s2">like the right people are coming on</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.579" end="00:01:54.299" style="s2">board at the right time with the right</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.720" end="00:01:57.420" style="s2">tools and the right ideas for together</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.299" end="00:01:59.759" style="s2">tech to happen and every time it feels</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.420" end="00:02:01.200" style="s2">like it&#39;s gonna like fall apart it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.759" end="00:02:03.030" style="s2">actually the thing that helps it stick</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.200" end="00:02:05.280" style="s2">together more and helps it yes like</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.030" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">learn at a deeper level at least for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:10.860" style="s2">individually I&#39;m learning that but</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:14.280" style="s2">there&#39;s also it&#39;s the place where I now</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.860" end="00:02:16.380" style="s2">can encounter tension that is like the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.280" end="00:02:18.150" style="s2">perfect amount of tension for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.380" end="00:02:20.400" style="s2">like alright when when somebody does</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.150" end="00:02:22.110" style="s2">something in this space that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.400" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">like I know it&#39;s for me to learn from</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.110" end="00:02:30.900" style="s2">and so learning it has been what happens</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:33.270" style="s2">like I I kind of knew how to create game</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.900" end="00:02:34.709" style="s2">B before her encountering game B but not</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.270" end="00:02:36.270" style="s2">really because I wasn&#39;t playing it with</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.709" end="00:02:37.860" style="s2">other people it was just in my head it</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.270" end="00:02:39.720" style="s2">was like one person&#39;s idea of how the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.860" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">world can can be a better place and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.720" end="00:02:44.819" style="s2">encountering other people has helped me</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:46.200" style="s2">figure out the road towards playing it</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.819" end="00:02:48.450" style="s2">with other people how do we create an</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.200" end="00:02:52.560" style="s2">omni wind society society and anti-bible</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.450" end="00:02:56.820" style="s2">in a society and I am having a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.560" end="00:02:58.920" style="s2">fun but I think that that in and of</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.820" end="00:03:00.690" style="s2">itself can be triggering for people like</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.920" end="00:03:02.850" style="s2">I just had a conversation with someone</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.690" end="00:03:04.230" style="s2">yesterday who&#39;s clearly not happy with</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.850" end="00:03:06.810" style="s2">the fact that I&#39;m not willing to learn</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.230" end="00:03:08.790" style="s2">discord or I&#39;m not willing to to read an</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.810" end="00:03:10.860" style="s2">article or I&#39;m like I&#39;m only gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.790" end="00:03:12.600" style="s2">what is fun and easy for me that is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.860" end="00:03:15.209" style="s2">only thing I&#39;m doing because that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.600" end="00:03:17.670" style="s2">what keeps me have sustained energy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.209" end="00:03:20.010" style="s2">quite frankly I&#39;m doing a lot like</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.670" end="00:03:21.390" style="s2">especially in the game B&#39;s phase I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.010" end="00:03:23.250" style="s2">like here&#39;s the list of everything I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.390" end="00:03:25.799" style="s2">doing and I&#39;m not doing a single thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.250" end="00:03:27.360" style="s2">that I don&#39;t find fun and engaging and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.799" end="00:03:29.280" style="s2">think that actually that is how we</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.360" end="00:03:31.079" style="s2">sustain ourselves on the course to gain</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.280" end="00:03:32.760" style="s2">B and I&#39;m just gonna ramble on for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.079" end="00:03:36.019" style="s2">next minute if I keep going so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.760" end="00:03:36.019" style="s2">end it there we would like to go next</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.640" end="00:03:45.190" style="s2">I can go next</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.120" end="00:03:49.560" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s two parts of this question</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.190" end="00:03:52.209" style="s2">isn&#39;t there there&#39;s there&#39;s game be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.560" end="00:03:54.730" style="s2">brand if you like so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.209" end="00:03:57.340" style="s2">Facebook group and all of that stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.730" end="00:03:59.980" style="s2">then there&#39;s game be the actual meta</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.340" end="00:04:02.920" style="s2">game you know the actual idea space</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.980" end="00:04:05.140" style="s2">exploring stuff so yeah there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.920" end="00:04:07.030" style="s2">parts to it so I guess I&#39;m going to get</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.140" end="00:04:09.370" style="s2">on your song to give two answers and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.030" end="00:04:13.739" style="s2">the second bit first of all though that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.370" end="00:04:16.739" style="s2">the game be the framing and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.739" end="00:04:20.019" style="s2">involving of complexity theory alongside</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.739" end="00:04:21.489" style="s2">history alongside behavior economic</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.019" end="00:04:23.950" style="s2">Jeremy like they&#39;re trying to bring all</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.489" end="00:04:25.240" style="s2">of these different disciplines into it I</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.950" end="00:04:27.310" style="s2">think there&#39;s a lot of parallels with</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.240" end="00:04:29.290" style="s2">meta modernism as well even though they</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.310" end="00:04:34.110" style="s2">they seem to try and want to stay in</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.290" end="00:04:34.110" style="s2">different cameras but whatever I did the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.069" end="00:04:40.509" style="s2">capacity of the frames was I guess what</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.500" end="00:04:45.460" style="s2">attracted me to Gambia I mean I came to</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.509" end="00:04:47.110" style="s2">this arena via the zeitgeist movies and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.460" end="00:04:51.620" style="s2">The Venus Project and quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.110" end="00:04:55.310" style="s2">conspiracy sort of stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.620" end="00:04:57.530" style="s2">I mean though that&#39;s still very much a</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.310" end="00:04:59.240" style="s2">part of my personal threat but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.530" end="00:05:01.270" style="s2">not helpful right and it puts a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.240" end="00:05:03.290" style="s2">people off whereas the game be</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.270" end="00:05:04.370" style="s2">structures frameworks narratives</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.290" end="00:05:06.050" style="s2">whatever you want to call them are</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.370" end="00:05:08.150" style="s2">extremely neutral right they&#39;re entirely</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.050" end="00:05:10.190" style="s2">apolitical they&#39;re entirely a religious</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.150" end="00:05:13.100" style="s2">they are but they&#39;re you know they they</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.190" end="00:05:14.810" style="s2">they sort of sit outside of all of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.100" end="00:05:18.490" style="s2">which I which was what was has got</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.810" end="00:05:22.060" style="s2">appeal to me in terms of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.490" end="00:05:23.590" style="s2">game B thing itself right now the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.060" end="00:05:25.419" style="s2">mimetic tribe is a different is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.590" end="00:05:28.090" style="s2">different issue right the Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.419" end="00:05:29.560" style="s2">and the t-shirts and made me laugh that</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.090" end="00:05:32.110" style="s2">thing of the t-shirt sale that was very</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.560" end="00:05:33.220" style="s2">funny you know all of that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.110" end="00:05:35.319" style="s2">that&#39;s a different story but</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.220" end="00:05:37.330" style="s2">nevertheless I must say I&#39;ve got a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.319" end="00:05:39.210" style="s2">out of it personally I mean as jublee is</p>

<p begin="00:05:39.210" end="00:05:44.289" style="s2">conversations that I&#39;ve been fortunate</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.520" end="00:05:46.150" style="s2">enough to be involved in as a direct</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.289" end="00:05:50.770" style="s2">consequence of the mimetic tribe that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.150" end="00:05:53.020" style="s2">game be a hugely important part of my</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.770" end="00:05:56.650" style="s2">life I mean a I learn a lot from B they</p>

<p begin="00:09:30.079" end="00:09:34.310" style="s2">key and Jordan halls second conversation</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.329" end="00:09:35.750" style="s2">some I think it was back in February and</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.310" end="00:09:39.889" style="s2">I&#39;ll probably bring that up more</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.750" end="00:09:45.100" style="s2">later in the conversation but it&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.889" end="00:09:51.319" style="s2">you know how the the group evolves and</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.100" end="00:09:53.180" style="s2">you know participating in it and and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.319" end="00:09:54.680" style="s2">don&#39;t experience the same frustration</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.180" end="00:09:57.970" style="s2">that I&#39;ve heard other people experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.680" end="00:10:02.360" style="s2">of like they&#39;re not being action because</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.970" end="00:10:06.129" style="s2">what I see is a lot of distilling of</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.360" end="00:10:08.660" style="s2">ideas getting to them to a place where</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.129" end="00:10:10.550" style="s2">we can take them out and talk to people</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.660" end="00:10:14.000" style="s2">who are not familiar with the subject</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.550" end="00:10:16.939" style="s2">and because it&#39;s like each time I have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.000" end="00:10:19.339" style="s2">conversation I wrap my mouth and my head</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.939" end="00:10:25.040" style="s2">around how to talk about these subjects</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.339" end="00:10:27.439" style="s2">more and distill them into easier things</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.040" end="00:10:29.540" style="s2">to talk about and so that that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.439" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">particular need that&#39;s one of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.540" end="00:10:33.290" style="s2">needs that&#39;s getting met by these groups</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.040" end="00:10:37.490" style="s2">is it&#39;s like I have a lot of these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.290" end="00:10:39.050" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know how to you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.490" end="00:10:41.389" style="s2">know how to take John for Vicki&#39;s 50</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.050" end="00:10:44.480" style="s2">hour series and explain it to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.389" end="00:10:50.720" style="s2">fairly quickly and so it&#39;s in these</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.480" end="00:10:54.100" style="s2">conversations that I&#39;m able to to learn</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.720" end="00:10:56.360" style="s2">how to distill them and and to really</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.100" end="00:10:59.509" style="s2">understand and embody what the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.360" end="00:11:04.189" style="s2">mean versus just that being an idea in</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.509" end="00:11:05.990" style="s2">my head and yeah that&#39;s what I got so</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.189" end="00:11:08.990" style="s2">far I&#39;m sure more will come up as the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.990" end="00:11:22.490" style="s2">conversation progresses thanks Kyra you</p>

<p begin="00:11:45.270" end="00:11:52.980" style="s2">parts of it are similar to my own</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.420" end="00:11:56.460" style="s2">as you know I&#39;m in exile of gave me so I</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.980" end="00:11:59.280" style="s2">have mixed mixed feelings my experiences</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.460" end="00:12:01.740" style="s2">have been good and bad it&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.280" end="00:12:06.660" style="s2">I expected from the beginning because I</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.740" end="00:12:08.640" style="s2">knew what it was I liked Jubilees story</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.660" end="00:12:11.700" style="s2">because it&#39;s so recent you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.640" end="00:12:13.320" style="s2">like four months ago still and it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.700" end="00:12:15.840" style="s2">it&#39;s fresh and it&#39;s new and there is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.320" end="00:12:17.970" style="s2">lot of exciting content you know through</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.840" end="00:12:22.100" style="s2">game be and peep and good people to talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.970" end="00:12:23.850" style="s2">to so it makes sense for it to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.100" end="00:12:27.660" style="s2">exciting and something you want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.850" end="00:12:32.220" style="s2">commit to right of course my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.660" end="00:12:36.720" style="s2">is not really discovering game B in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.220" end="00:12:38.700" style="s2">same way it&#39;s sort of studying these</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.720" end="00:12:42.420" style="s2">types of things for almost a deck or</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.700" end="00:12:45.240" style="s2">over a decade and and uh sort of working</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.420" end="00:12:50.370" style="s2">on meta modernism as an emerging</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.240" end="00:12:52.500" style="s2">discourse and then at certain points</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.370" end="00:12:54.300" style="s2">they it kind of intersects and clashes</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.500" end="00:13:00.330" style="s2">with game B right so that&#39;s that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.300" end="00:13:03.000" style="s2">of my path here hmm yeah I guess I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.330" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">still a little bit bitter about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.000" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">situation because like it creates this</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.670" end="00:13:14.640" style="s2">kind of kind of schism where I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.050" end="00:13:16.370" style="s2">in I&#39;m still in this group and other</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.640" end="00:13:22.460" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.370" end="00:13:22.460" style="s2">but not in the Facebook page right so</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.610" end="00:13:27.900" style="s2">the this is like you know not to get</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.370" end="00:13:29.990" style="s2">into my personal case but this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.900" end="00:13:33.390" style="s2">indicative of some of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.990" end="00:13:35.340" style="s2">inconsistencies and pathologies of how</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.390" end="00:13:39.600" style="s2">the discourse works how people</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.340" end="00:13:44.520" style="s2">communicate how they how they moderate</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.600" end="00:13:46.530" style="s2">what what beliefs and preferences they</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.520" end="00:13:48.720" style="s2">have that affect their worldview and how</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.530" end="00:13:51.020" style="s2">they compartmentalize and package those</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.720" end="00:13:56.480" style="s2">things I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.020" end="00:13:59.840" style="s2">lots to be teased out here um today</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.480" end="00:14:02.240" style="s2">today is relevant you know to to this</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.840" end="00:14:06.050" style="s2">issue to because Jim Rudd is voting for</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.240" end="00:14:09.200" style="s2">Biden today and you know he seems pretty</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.050" end="00:14:15.710" style="s2">excited and and secure about that choice</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.200" end="00:14:18.920" style="s2">um basically because he&#39;s afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.710" end="00:14:23.510" style="s2">Bernie what what Bernie represents</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.920" end="00:14:26.510" style="s2">potentially and you know there&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:14:26.510" end="00:14:41.600" style="s2">the end of the day what else what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.180" end="00:14:42.980" style="s2">question if you don&#39;t mind because it</p>

<p begin="00:14:45.950" end="00:14:53.120" style="s2">poor way in which conflict disputes</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.140" end="00:14:56.090" style="s2">would ever have have been handled as</p>

<p begin="00:14:56.090" end="00:14:59.750" style="s2">think it&#39;s really really really</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.070" end="00:15:02.450" style="s2">important I mean I do it all the time</p>

<p begin="00:15:06.110" end="00:15:09.650" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really important to remember</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.790" end="00:15:12.050" style="s2">that these are distinct things and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.650" end="00:15:15.020" style="s2">whatever if whatever the pros and cons</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.050" end="00:15:16.880" style="s2">of the Facebook group are not</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.020" end="00:15:19.010" style="s2">necessarily strengths and weaknesses of</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.880" end="00:15:23.980" style="s2">the game be seen itself right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.010" end="00:15:28.040" style="s2">that is very much bigger and you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.980" end="00:15:35.270" style="s2">was exiled from Facebook group yeah not</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.040" end="00:15:37.070" style="s2">game be that would be an impossible game</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.270" end="00:15:40.580" style="s2">be itself would be impossible sorry ray</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.070" end="00:15:42.470" style="s2">it&#39;s all right it&#39;s the time like yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.580" end="00:15:45.170" style="s2">want I want to agree with that a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.470" end="00:15:46.700" style="s2">percent like I agree part way but it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.170" end="00:15:49.910" style="s2">a question at the end of the day of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.700" end="00:15:52.400" style="s2">people who actually coined the term the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.910" end="00:15:54.350" style="s2">metaphor and who are more or less you</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.400" end="00:15:57.110" style="s2">know curating and and and leading that</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.350" end="00:15:59.630" style="s2">charge so I have more of an issue with</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.110" end="00:16:04.030" style="s2">that than I do with the game be idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.630" end="00:16:05.980" style="s2">itself and the community itself hmm</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.030" end="00:16:07.780" style="s2">well but to bring up the point of</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.980" end="00:16:09.220" style="s2">several of the people who participated</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.780" end="00:16:11.050" style="s2">from what kind of the very beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.220" end="00:16:16.090" style="s2">game B have left the game be Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.050" end="00:16:17.650" style="s2">group okay so like Jordan Hall and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.090" end="00:16:19.630" style="s2">Bonita Roy aren&#39;t in the Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.650" end="00:16:23.170" style="s2">anymore okay name is well haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.630" end="00:16:25.060" style="s2">Daniel ages yeah I mean it was ever in</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.170" end="00:16:29.260" style="s2">there I see yeah you wants for talks</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.060" end="00:16:31.060" style="s2">time yeah yeah yeah so these things are</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.260" end="00:16:34.690" style="s2">these things are in flux you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.060" end="00:16:36.640" style="s2">kind of experimental um I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.690" end="00:16:39.390" style="s2">then just leaving the Facebook group you</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.640" end="00:16:42.550" style="s2">know addresses the the issue I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.390" end="00:16:45.730" style="s2">mmm-hmm I&#39;ve no doubt that like like</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.550" end="00:16:47.680" style="s2">they themselves are still struggling</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.730" end="00:16:50.260" style="s2">with this in different ways on their end</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.680" end="00:16:52.570" style="s2">you know and I think I think that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.260" end="00:16:56.410" style="s2">I&#39;m not happy about that</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.570" end="00:16:57.730" style="s2">so yeah things ones sorry but it also</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.410" end="00:16:59.680" style="s2">underlines the fact that the game be</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.730" end="00:17:00.940" style="s2">Facebook is not game be right these</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.680" end="00:17:03.370" style="s2">people have not abandoned game be</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.940" end="00:17:06.760" style="s2">they&#39;ve banded the Facebook group yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.370" end="00:17:10.990" style="s2">and and I would I would carry my</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.760" end="00:17:12.160" style="s2">arguments over to say like I think I</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.990" end="00:17:13.839" style="s2">think that&#39;s a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.160" end="00:17:15.790" style="s2">I think that&#39;s part of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.839" end="00:17:18.790" style="s2">because whatever whatever Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.790" end="00:17:21.699" style="s2">and Bonita I are doing now they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.790" end="00:17:23.740" style="s2">being themselves and they&#39;re still doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.699" end="00:17:25.060" style="s2">good stuff and doing what I think are</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.740" end="00:17:30.820" style="s2">bad stuff they&#39;re just avoiding the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.060" end="00:17:31.650" style="s2">problem what is the problem what in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.820" end="00:17:35.760" style="s2">sentence</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.650" end="00:17:37.810" style="s2">I mean they&#39;re yeah there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.760" end="00:17:41.430" style="s2">dimensions to it like one is that they</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.810" end="00:17:45.220" style="s2">just quit when things got difficult uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.430" end="00:17:47.980" style="s2">another is sort of the the the premises</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.220" end="00:17:50.910" style="s2">that led up to that right so if if</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.980" end="00:17:59.140" style="s2">they&#39;re entrenching their positions</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.910" end="00:18:01.900" style="s2">whether it&#39;s about politics or race and</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.140" end="00:18:05.620" style="s2">the solution for them personally was</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.900" end="00:18:09.310" style="s2">just to kind of retreat nobody really</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.620" end="00:18:10.870" style="s2">gets any clear answers and like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.310" end="00:18:12.760" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re abandoning the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.870" end="00:18:15.550" style="s2">roles but that they built up for</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.760" end="00:18:17.240" style="s2">themselves and and I wouldn&#39;t do that if</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.550" end="00:18:21.760" style="s2">it was me</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.240" end="00:18:24.880" style="s2">and given my given myself in my position</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.760" end="00:18:28.070" style="s2">I&#39;m still showing up to to challenge</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:32.210" style="s2">wherever I think of people are going</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.070" end="00:18:35.240" style="s2">wrong I think it goes back to you one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.210" end="00:18:40.190" style="s2">the points that Jubilee made of you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.240" end="00:18:43.970" style="s2">part of what makes or part of what</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.190" end="00:18:46.399" style="s2">allows me to put the energy into game be</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.970" end="00:18:48.140" style="s2">that I put into it is by by sticking</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.399" end="00:18:52.279" style="s2">with the things that I can that I can</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.140" end="00:18:53.419" style="s2">actually put energy into and so and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.279" end="00:18:56.600" style="s2">interesting because I was listening to</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.419" end="00:18:58.370" style="s2">you bring back that interview that I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.600" end="00:19:01.690" style="s2">listening to you this morning Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.370" end="00:19:03.649" style="s2">Hall was talking about the we the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.690" end="00:19:05.870" style="s2">founders dilemma are the innovators</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.649" end="00:19:08.240" style="s2">dilemma or something like that of you</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.870" end="00:19:10.610" style="s2">know it&#39;s like the person who comes in</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.240" end="00:19:15.500" style="s2">and does all of the innovation doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.610" end="00:19:16.909" style="s2">necessarily you come in and you have all</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.500" end="00:19:19.159" style="s2">of this innovation and you want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.909" end="00:19:21.500" style="s2">that innovation as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.159" end="00:19:24.169" style="s2">organization that gets built but that</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.500" end="00:19:26.990" style="s2">work but inherently the organization is</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.169" end="00:19:30.649" style="s2">sort of a limitation to the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.990" end="00:19:31.789" style="s2">innovate and so it might be that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.649" end="00:19:33.649" style="s2">know people are coming in and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.789" end="00:19:36.820" style="s2">like okay this is this is as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.649" end="00:19:39.679" style="s2">can go with this group and and still</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.820" end="00:19:43.690" style="s2">care and want to participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.679" end="00:19:46.100" style="s2">overall movement and so you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.690" end="00:19:48.260" style="s2">not funny that I don&#39;t you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.100" end="00:19:51.919" style="s2">part of me that agrees but then also</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.260" end="00:19:54.890" style="s2">that part of me is I would say a</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.919" end="00:19:55.880" style="s2">holdover of gaming a mentality of once</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.890" end="00:19:57.649" style="s2">you&#39;ve committed to something you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.880" end="00:20:01.730" style="s2">to stick it through no matter what and</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.649" end="00:20:05.480" style="s2">if you don&#39;t then there&#39;s some of you</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.730" end="00:20:08.120" style="s2">have some character flaw and I think one</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.480" end="00:20:10.039" style="s2">of the things about game B is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.120" end="00:20:12.860" style="s2">gonna bounce around you&#39;re gonna go okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.039" end="00:20:14.750" style="s2">this I&#39;m gonna stay in this this thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.860" end="00:20:16.100" style="s2">and well I have reached my you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.750" end="00:20:17.270" style="s2">until I have learned what I need to</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.100" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">learn here and then I&#39;m going to move</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.270" end="00:20:23.059" style="s2">over here and being able to move between</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:27.350" style="s2">areas it&#39;s one of the things I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.059" end="00:20:31.350" style="s2">that appeals to me about the game B</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.350" end="00:20:33.900" style="s2">ethos is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.350" end="00:20:35.370" style="s2">they fronted a values of once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.900" end="00:20:38.670" style="s2">committed to something that&#39;s your role</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.370" end="00:20:40.860" style="s2">and you stick it out and granted I still</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.670" end="00:20:42.540" style="s2">had strong emotions when I read with</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.860" end="00:20:48.630" style="s2">bonitas post that she was leaving of</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.540" end="00:20:50.520" style="s2">like for being abandoned yeah but kind</p>

<p begin="00:21:20.880" end="00:21:25.110" style="s2">right the game becomes after game a is</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.890" end="00:21:27.390" style="s2">so easy that like right you can tone</p>

<p begin="00:21:37.500" end="00:21:40.980" style="s2">actually like it&#39;s what happened when it</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.970" end="00:21:42.900" style="s2">was in sport mode and it went off and he</p>

<p begin="00:23:38.060" end="00:23:51.290" style="s2">modern kind of zeitgeist it&#39;s such a big</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.030" end="00:23:55.660" style="s2">topic just like game B is I think I</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.290" end="00:24:00.320" style="s2">think it has to be handled carefully um</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.660" end="00:24:02.450" style="s2">but I encourage people you know to</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.320" end="00:24:05.510" style="s2">pursue it with the same enthusiasm at</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.450" end="00:24:10.150" style="s2">least because it&#39;s so related you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.510" end="00:24:13.370" style="s2">like like I I write about systems change</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.150" end="00:24:15.770" style="s2">which is supposed to be the major kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.370" end="00:24:17.570" style="s2">of premise of getting from game a to</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.770" end="00:24:22.010" style="s2">game be like how does that happen</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.570" end="00:24:24.620" style="s2">what does it look like and these are</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.010" end="00:24:29.480" style="s2">huge discourses right it goes way beyond</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.620" end="00:24:31.430" style="s2">game I want to support the what I see is</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.480" end="00:24:34.540" style="s2">the good aspects of game be but also be</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.430" end="00:24:38.410" style="s2">critical of what I see is the obvious</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.540" end="00:24:44.950" style="s2">limitations and flaws right it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.410" end="00:24:50.150" style="s2">silicon valley-based a kind of worldview</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.950" end="00:24:51.380" style="s2">right and and you know it&#39;s it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.150" end="00:24:52.910" style="s2">different alignments than the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.380" end="00:24:53.690" style="s2">progressive movement at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.910" end="00:24:57.620" style="s2">day and</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.690" end="00:25:02.299" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a mistake I think that</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.620" end="00:25:04.549" style="s2">that mistake happens because of devoted</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.299" end="00:25:09.549" style="s2">interests into some of these discourses</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.549" end="00:25:13.279" style="s2">and end the commercial aspect of it that</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.549" end="00:25:15.820" style="s2">it&#39;s a you know sort of locks us back in</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.279" end="00:25:18.500" style="s2">the game a and when I talk to Jim right</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.820" end="00:25:20.779" style="s2">like this came this came up because we</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.500" end="00:25:24.129" style="s2">talked about funding about the Santa Fe</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.779" end="00:25:26.929" style="s2">Institute and you know he was saying how</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.129" end="00:25:28.730" style="s2">like like for anybody it&#39;s difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.929" end="00:25:30.769" style="s2">get funding there&#39;s certain hoops that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.730" end="00:25:33.529" style="s2">have to jump through there&#39;s certain</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.769" end="00:25:36.529" style="s2">path dependencies and you know my major</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.529" end="00:25:39.370" style="s2">injunction there - Jim was like uh you</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.529" end="00:25:41.990" style="s2">know as someone who has researched it</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.370" end="00:25:42.679" style="s2">Marxism is actually a complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.990" end="00:25:45.799" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.679" end="00:25:47.509" style="s2">and then he said that one of one of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.799" end="00:25:50.000" style="s2">head guys at Santa Fe you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.509" end="00:25:54.320" style="s2">identifies as a Marxist so so Jim likes</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.000" end="00:25:55.789" style="s2">to you know entertain that diversity to</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.320" end="00:25:57.379" style="s2">a certain extent so that&#39;s that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.789" end="00:25:59.629" style="s2">thing but but the point was more about</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.379" end="00:26:03.830" style="s2">funding because I was kind of pressing</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.629" end="00:26:06.200" style="s2">him on you know like how how research</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.830" end="00:26:08.450" style="s2">gets funded and how that relates to his</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.200" end="00:26:10.610" style="s2">blind spot right because he acknowledges</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.450" end="00:26:13.179" style="s2">he has a blind spot in sociology and</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.610" end="00:26:15.529" style="s2">that&#39;s mainly what I&#39;ve studied like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.179" end="00:26:18.350" style="s2">have a very interdisciplinary background</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.529" end="00:26:21.320" style="s2">but I I try to anchor it in sociology</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.350" end="00:26:23.389" style="s2">because it&#39;s such an important discourse</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.320" end="00:26:25.940" style="s2">and it&#39;s so underrated right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.389" end="00:26:28.820" style="s2">kind of pressing them like on the fact</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.940" end="00:26:31.070" style="s2">that you know most of the time the think</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.820" end="00:26:32.779" style="s2">tanks aren&#39;t funding the best research</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.070" end="00:26:35.120" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s not exclusive to Santa</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.779" end="00:26:37.940" style="s2">Fe Institute it&#39;s this is a problem of</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:42.379" style="s2">all research of universities of think</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.940" end="00:26:44.240" style="s2">tanks you know a lot of things that are</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.379" end="00:26:45.980" style="s2">cutting edge get done for free and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.240" end="00:26:51.470" style="s2">think that&#39;s something the game be</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.980" end="00:26:53.210" style="s2">community can understand quite well but</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.470" end="00:26:55.580" style="s2">it still becomes a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.210" end="00:26:59.269" style="s2">self-fulfilling prophecy on their own on</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.580" end="00:27:00.980" style="s2">their own terms right because the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.269" end="00:27:03.919" style="s2">complexity Institute the Santa Fe</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.980" end="00:27:05.910" style="s2">Institute which is a complexity Research</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.919" end="00:27:13.380" style="s2">Center</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.910" end="00:27:15.760" style="s2">Hasnat but via via gym rat I would say</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.380" end="00:27:18.100" style="s2">because because there&#39;s other people</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:19.419" style="s2">involved like Michael Garfield uh who</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.100" end="00:27:22.380" style="s2">are great and they&#39;re much more open</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.419" end="00:27:25.150" style="s2">they&#39;re much much more progressive uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.380" end="00:27:27.940" style="s2">and there&#39;s there&#39;s a kind of higher</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.150" end="00:27:30.700" style="s2">synthesis of all the complexity we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.940" end="00:27:34.870" style="s2">talking about here so mm-hm so my</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.700" end="00:27:36.340" style="s2">criticism is just that um you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.870" end="00:27:38.980" style="s2">whether it&#39;s whether it&#39;s due to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.340" end="00:27:40.929" style="s2">funding pressures or something else the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.980" end="00:27:43.870" style="s2">the blind spots are not being funded so</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.929" end="00:27:46.929" style="s2">the answers that they get are of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.870" end="00:27:51.160" style="s2">certain nature and and contribute to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.929" end="00:27:52.660" style="s2">certain logic right so it just keeps us</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.160" end="00:27:57.160" style="s2">stuck in the kind of pattern that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.660" end="00:27:58.540" style="s2">trying to escape depending on Santa Fe</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.160" end="00:28:03.429" style="s2">Institute I don&#39;t even know who they</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.540" end="00:28:05.919" style="s2">were so it&#39;s one piece of the puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.429" end="00:28:09.660" style="s2">though it&#39;s important like like Jim was</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.919" end="00:28:13.809" style="s2">the the chair for a number of years so</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.660" end="00:28:17.380" style="s2">so he had a lot of influence can I just</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.809" end="00:28:21.130" style="s2">push back on the assertion that game be</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.380" end="00:28:23.620" style="s2">is a Silicon Valley kind of perspective</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.130" end="00:28:25.630" style="s2">because I just I&#39;ve heard this criticism</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.620" end="00:28:28.840" style="s2">before or not and I disagree with it I</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.630" end="00:28:30.840" style="s2">think that is in the eye of behad in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.840" end="00:28:34.990" style="s2">eye of the beholder that criticism</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.840" end="00:28:38.530" style="s2">because game be at least my take on game</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.990" end="00:28:41.470" style="s2">B is that it&#39;s grounded in all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.530" end="00:28:44.679" style="s2">stuff right I mean including John Vevey</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.470" end="00:28:46.690" style="s2">Keyes retrospective on you know wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.679" end="00:28:48.429" style="s2">cultivation going back thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.690" end="00:28:50.530" style="s2">years yeah it&#39;s grounding all of that as</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.429" end="00:28:52.169" style="s2">well it&#39;s grounded in Jung is is</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.530" end="00:28:54.549" style="s2">grounding it&#39;s grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.169" end="00:28:56.860" style="s2">what&#39;s-his-name prj you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.549" end="00:28:58.360" style="s2">grounded in mathematics it&#39;s grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.860" end="00:28:59.919" style="s2">complexity theory it&#39;s grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.360" end="00:29:01.450" style="s2">evolutionary biology you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.919" end="00:29:05.020" style="s2">mean it&#39;s grounded in all of these</p>

<p begin="00:29:50.679" end="00:29:53.980" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just Jordan Hall and</p>

<p begin="00:29:53.980" end="00:29:57.700" style="s2">Jamba vague you know it&#39;s loads and</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.230" end="00:29:59.169" style="s2">loads and loads of other people have</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.700" end="00:30:01.330" style="s2">contributed to conversation well and</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.169" end="00:30:03.730" style="s2">that constantly broadens the grounding</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.330" end="00:30:06.429" style="s2">from which it comes and so it&#39;s a you</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.730" end="00:30:08.860" style="s2">know it&#39;s an ever-evolving thing so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.429" end="00:30:10.539" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a really limiting critic</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.860" end="00:30:12.120" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a false criticism and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.539" end="00:30:14.140" style="s2">think it&#39;s one which profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.120" end="00:30:15.340" style="s2">misunderstands what the thing is or was</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.140" end="00:30:19.720" style="s2">is actually all about</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.340" end="00:30:21.700" style="s2">yeah just quick very quickly like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.720" end="00:30:24.789" style="s2">try to meet halfway on that because I</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.700" end="00:30:26.590" style="s2">think those are valid counter points and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.789" end="00:30:29.110" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly more than a Silicon</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.590" end="00:30:31.929" style="s2">Valley thing but but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.110" end="00:30:33.640" style="s2">inescapable the connection like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.929" end="00:30:36.940" style="s2">definitely people involved that are not</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.640" end="00:30:39.190" style="s2">anywhere near Silicon Valley mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.940" end="00:30:40.750" style="s2">but and there and there&#39;s critiques of</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.190" end="00:30:43.600" style="s2">Silicon Valley a culture and techno</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.750" end="00:30:46.659" style="s2">optimism separate from game B E which</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.600" end="00:30:49.150" style="s2">are much more relevant and salient but</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.659" end="00:30:51.100" style="s2">but I&#39;m saying we shouldn&#39;t miss the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.150" end="00:30:53.500" style="s2">connection right like like Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.100" end="00:30:55.600" style="s2">was a tech entrepreneur that&#39;s how he</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.500" end="00:30:58.030" style="s2">made his money that&#39;s why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.600" end="00:31:00.490" style="s2">listening to him today you know he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.030" end="00:31:02.250" style="s2">self-taught kind of thought leader in</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.490" end="00:31:06.010" style="s2">these spaces but at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.250" end="00:31:09.340" style="s2">he became financially independent from</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.010" end="00:31:12.669" style="s2">tech entrepreneurship and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.340" end="00:31:14.740" style="s2">where those guys live that it informs a</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.669" end="00:31:16.360" style="s2">lot of the thinking it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.740" end="00:31:19.870" style="s2">little bit inescapable so I&#39;ll try to</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.360" end="00:31:22.059" style="s2">meet halfway I&#39;ll just point out that</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.870" end="00:31:23.919" style="s2">Jordan Hall does not live in Silicon</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.059" end="00:31:25.240" style="s2">Valley but he still lives in California</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.919" end="00:31:30.370" style="s2">but not in Silicon Valley don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.240" end="00:31:31.750" style="s2">live close though like Diego okay no no</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.370" end="00:31:34.520" style="s2">a bunch of them live all live down in</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.750" end="00:31:37.220" style="s2">San Diego as far as I know</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.520" end="00:31:38.270" style="s2">but one of the conversations one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.220" end="00:31:39.680" style="s2">things that was on the interview that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.270" end="00:31:43.640" style="s2">was talking that I was listening to this</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.680" end="00:31:47.150" style="s2">morning was that one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.640" end="00:31:52.730" style="s2">is true is Silicon Valley being what it</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.150" end="00:31:54.950" style="s2">is it in many senses at the heart of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.730" end="00:31:58.250" style="s2">meaning crisis because there are a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.950" end="00:32:02.210" style="s2">of people who are you know taking game a</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.250" end="00:32:04.430" style="s2">to its limit and then realizing oh shit</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.210" end="00:32:07.550" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t give me the meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.430" end="00:32:12.080" style="s2">that I thought it was and so then it</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.550" end="00:32:14.480" style="s2">would make sense that some of the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.080" end="00:32:17.360" style="s2">would be emerging out of sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.480" end="00:32:21.230" style="s2">Titans of game a kind of coming in and</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.360" end="00:32:24.320" style="s2">going oh wait a minute like I played</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.230" end="00:32:27.770" style="s2">that game the absolute best you can play</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.320" end="00:32:29.660" style="s2">it and my life wasn&#39;t any better I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.770" end="00:32:33.830" style="s2">have any more meaning in my life so what</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.660" end="00:32:36.080" style="s2">do we do now so like it makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.830" end="00:32:39.050" style="s2">meaning that Silicon Valley would be</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.080" end="00:32:42.710" style="s2">sort of one of one of the epicenters of</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.050" end="00:32:48.620" style="s2">this because there is so much excess so</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.710" end="00:32:51.580" style="s2">much you know being able to play game a</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.620" end="00:32:54.500" style="s2">to its limit lots of small driven people</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.580" end="00:32:56.450" style="s2">yeah yes and so when you have driven</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.500" end="00:33:00.530" style="s2">people who go wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.450" end="00:33:02.350" style="s2">I can&#39;t you know this the promise that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.530" end="00:33:04.190" style="s2">was you know the thing I was promised</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.350" end="00:33:06.890" style="s2">didn&#39;t come to fruition</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.190" end="00:33:08.420" style="s2">of course and if we&#39;re gonna look at you</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.890" end="00:33:10.520" style="s2">know where things are coming from and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.420" end="00:33:12.680" style="s2">I&#39;m still reminded of a meme that I saw</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.520" end="00:33:14.570" style="s2">in the game group that said if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.680" end="00:33:17.510" style="s2">participating in Game a and you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.570" end="00:33:19.070" style="s2">experienced a nexus if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.510" end="00:33:20.840" style="s2">participating in game B and you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.070" end="00:33:25.130" style="s2">experienced an existential crisis yet</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.840" end="00:33:26.870" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it wrong yeah and you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.130" end="00:33:29.300" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s been my experience was</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.870" end="00:33:34.490" style="s2">that I was fully on the game a track and</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.300" end="00:33:35.360" style="s2">then like life happened and it was like</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.490" end="00:33:37.340" style="s2">wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.360" end="00:33:39.380" style="s2">there&#39;s no meaning any of this and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.340" end="00:33:42.230" style="s2">experienced that full-on existential</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.380" end="00:33:44.660" style="s2">crisis and then had to you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.230" end="00:33:47.539" style="s2">crawl my way out of it and you know game</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.660" end="00:33:49.460" style="s2">B is one of the places that I found like</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.539" end="00:33:51.529" style="s2">people who are kind of going who are</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.460" end="00:33:53.869" style="s2">thinking the same thing like looking</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.529" end="00:33:56.869" style="s2">around and going everything I ever</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.869" end="00:33:59.619" style="s2">learned about life and about meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.869" end="00:33:59.619" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.850" end="00:34:06.139" style="s2">and can I talk to you about this because</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.950" end="00:34:07.789" style="s2">otherwise I just feel like I&#39;m crazy</p>

<p begin="00:35:27.260" end="00:35:32.660" style="s2">I where do I belong what am I here to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.680" end="00:35:34.579" style="s2">and like how can I get it what do I need</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.660" end="00:35:36.230" style="s2">is maybe less of an extra central crisis</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.579" end="00:35:38.540" style="s2">like you need that to be able to do the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.230" end="00:35:41.900" style="s2">other three but some of them are happy</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.540" end="00:35:43.670" style="s2">but not most of them my I would say my</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.900" end="00:35:45.440" style="s2">husband is one of those that&#39;s been one</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.670" end="00:35:48.460" style="s2">of my problems is like I look at him and</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.440" end="00:35:52.069" style="s2">he&#39;s just he finds out it he absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.460" end="00:35:53.839" style="s2">loves what he does and he is one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.069" end="00:35:56.540" style="s2">those people who is so confident in</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.839" end="00:35:59.750" style="s2">himself that he can walk into you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.540" end="00:36:01.310" style="s2">anywhere and be him and for the most</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.750" end="00:36:04.400" style="s2">part be himself</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.310" end="00:36:08.090" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t you know doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.400" end="00:36:09.860" style="s2">pretend and so you know I do know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.090" end="00:36:14.570" style="s2">possible for some people but I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.860" end="00:36:17.960" style="s2">most are trying to figure you know are</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.570" end="00:36:21.440" style="s2">more in you know the situation I was in</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.960" end="00:36:24.430" style="s2">then you know then what I mean there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.440" end="00:36:30.170" style="s2">reason that that drug abuse and</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.430" end="00:36:32.000" style="s2">everything else a rampant here it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.170" end="00:36:34.220" style="s2">everyone there&#39;s a tiny group of people</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.000" end="00:36:36.440" style="s2">who are happy who are in that space and</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.220" end="00:36:37.940" style="s2">happy but the vast majority in that</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.440" end="00:36:39.440" style="s2">space aren&#39;t happy and the rest of us</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.940" end="00:36:41.120" style="s2">are trying to get to that space because</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.440" end="00:36:42.470" style="s2">we think it&#39;s gonna bring happiness and</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.120" end="00:36:44.000" style="s2">then we get there and we have the</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.470" end="00:36:46.490" style="s2">existential crisis we&#39;re probably not</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.000" end="00:36:47.900" style="s2">one of the tiny few like I&#39;ve come to</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.490" end="00:36:49.850" style="s2">happiness from the completely other way</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.900" end="00:36:51.910" style="s2">like through existential crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.850" end="00:36:54.770" style="s2">thinking that was maybe somewhat of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.910" end="00:36:58.040" style="s2">solution but also seen that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.770" end="00:37:00.530" style="s2">and got to like I am happy I am deeply</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.040" end="00:37:02.480" style="s2">happy I love Who I am I don&#39;t put on a</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.530" end="00:37:05.060" style="s2">mask for most of my life I don&#39;t show up</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.480" end="00:37:06.890" style="s2">like other people because of that like I</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.060" end="00:37:08.480" style="s2">I look like I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.890" end="00:37:09.530" style="s2">talking about I talk around things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.480" end="00:37:11.630" style="s2">like right because that&#39;s what my brain</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.530" end="00:37:12.200" style="s2">does like this is me I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.630" end="00:37:15.050" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.200" end="00:37:18.140" style="s2">but showing up as that and then finding</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.050" end="00:37:20.600" style="s2">community is so much better than</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.140" end="00:37:22.190" style="s2">pretending and finding fake community</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.600" end="00:37:24.170" style="s2">because then you&#39;re just lose-lose like</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.190" end="00:37:25.940" style="s2">even if you find the perfect people who</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.170" end="00:37:29.090" style="s2">love you it&#39;s not you who are they</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.940" end="00:37:30.800" style="s2">loving it&#39;s not I think that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.090" end="00:37:33.050" style="s2">the things that I&#39;ve gotten so much out</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.800" end="00:37:34.880" style="s2">of game a is that like I come here and</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.050" end="00:37:36.200" style="s2">you guys don&#39;t you know don&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.880" end="00:37:38.510" style="s2">bat an eye when I babble on about</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.200" end="00:37:41.630" style="s2">something and then somebody takes off on</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.510" end="00:37:46.220" style="s2">a different tangent and like I get to</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.630" end="00:37:47.720" style="s2">show up exactly as I am here whereas you</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.220" end="00:37:50.300" style="s2">know there are other places in my life</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.720" end="00:37:55.930" style="s2">where I I still try and put on a mask</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.300" end="00:37:57.740" style="s2">and you know and the more that I get to</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.930" end="00:37:59.330" style="s2">and then and this is something I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.740" end="00:38:02.720" style="s2">talked about in a couple of different</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.330" end="00:38:06.260" style="s2">groups is the more I get to show up as</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.720" end="00:38:09.760" style="s2">myself in one area it allows me to show</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.260" end="00:38:13.250" style="s2">up as myself in other areas and that</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.760" end="00:38:14.440" style="s2">because it&#39;s like okay if I go out there</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.250" end="00:38:16.210" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.440" end="00:38:18.010" style="s2">I show up as myself and somebody says</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.210" end="00:38:21.280" style="s2">something I know I have this group right</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.010" end="00:38:23.410" style="s2">and come back and go okay this is here</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.280" end="00:38:25.119" style="s2">Here I am here&#39;s the craziness here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.410" end="00:38:29.410" style="s2">all of the babbling here&#39;s all of my</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.119" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">weird ideas and you know and I know that</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.410" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">I will be you know not not rejected so</p>

<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:51.520" style="s2">guys all the crazy yet but every crazy</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.880" end="00:38:53.230" style="s2">to my husband has a thing he says</p>

<p begin="00:38:53.230" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">you&#39;re the good crazy I&#39;m like okay good</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.460" end="00:39:03.220" style="s2">you&#39;re the only person in the world then</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:05.859" style="s2">you know you are both sane and crazy by</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.220" end="00:39:11.020" style="s2">definition right this is it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.859" end="00:39:13.030" style="s2">a comparative thing and I hope it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.020" end="00:39:16.150" style="s2">I participated in a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.030" end="00:39:18.460" style="s2">Nick from the game be conversations</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.150" end="00:39:21.400" style="s2">group last week and we we migrated to</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.460" end="00:39:24.190" style="s2">standing and like the process of that it</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.400" end="00:39:26.950" style="s2">was like starting to kind of feel into</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.190" end="00:39:29.829" style="s2">some stuff of like oh okay I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.950" end="00:39:32.170" style="s2">to like sit in one place and be static</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.829" end="00:39:34.089" style="s2">the whole conversation and so hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.170" end="00:39:36.060" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not bothering anybody to</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.089" end="00:39:38.859" style="s2">beat for me to kind of be moving around</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.060" end="00:39:41.079" style="s2">are you standing right now yeah I am</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.859" end="00:39:43.720" style="s2">okay cool I&#39;ve got a standing desk it</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.079" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">goes up and down with with motors is</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.720" end="00:39:50.050" style="s2">awesome yeah I had one of those at my</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.960" end="00:39:56.170" style="s2">job but now I&#39;m my laptop is sitting on</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.050" end="00:39:58.270" style="s2">a plastic drawer lift it up high enough</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.170" end="00:40:00.609" style="s2">funny I need to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.270" end="00:40:02.859" style="s2">because I record videos with my youtube</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.609" end="00:40:04.569" style="s2">yes less so during these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.859" end="00:40:06.460" style="s2">but when I&#39;m talking into a camera I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.569" end="00:40:08.589" style="s2">always feel so like somewhat unnatural</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.460" end="00:40:10.270" style="s2">that when I&#39;m walking around my house</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.589" end="00:40:12.400" style="s2">myself I come up with all these great</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.270" end="00:40:13.390" style="s2">ideas and even a great way of expressing</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.400" end="00:40:15.310" style="s2">them and then when I turn on the camera</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.390" end="00:40:17.290" style="s2">it goes off but I&#39;m also sitting down</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.310" end="00:40:19.089" style="s2">when I turn on the camera and like I</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.290" end="00:40:21.310" style="s2">don&#39;t actually know anywhere where I can</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.089" end="00:40:25.690" style="s2">record in my house where I&#39;m standing up</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.310" end="00:40:27.339" style="s2">walking around and it not like it kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.690" end="00:40:28.000" style="s2">of has to follow me then because if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.339" end="00:40:31.470" style="s2">walking</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.000" end="00:40:33.730" style="s2">and moving and doing anyway yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.470" end="00:40:36.850" style="s2">important I think technology is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.730" end="00:40:38.680" style="s2">get us there pretty quickly like like it</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.850" end="00:40:41.140" style="s2">already is because we can all be on our</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.680" end="00:40:42.970" style="s2">phones right now walking around having</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.140" end="00:40:44.830" style="s2">the same conversation so it&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.970" end="00:40:47.470" style="s2">choice but I wanted to say actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.830" end="00:40:51.130" style="s2">because this is kind of a potentially</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.470" end="00:40:53.770" style="s2">very interesting topic there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.130" end="00:40:56.680" style="s2">research on standing desks and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.770" end="00:40:59.470" style="s2">actually a nonprofit called just an org</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.680" end="00:41:01.680" style="s2">and if you go to their website I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.470" end="00:41:03.880" style="s2">been to it in in several years now but</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.680" end="00:41:08.140" style="s2">when I went to their website they had</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.880" end="00:41:10.930" style="s2">tons of research like catalog and</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.140" end="00:41:13.180" style="s2">itemized about standing desks and I was</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.930" end="00:41:15.430" style="s2">like holy shit like look at how much</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.180" end="00:41:18.340" style="s2">research there is on standing desks how</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.430" end="00:41:19.930" style="s2">effective they are and whatnot the take</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.340" end="00:41:23.350" style="s2">away if there&#39;s a lot of information but</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.930" end="00:41:25.570" style="s2">the takeaway is that using standing</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.350" end="00:41:28.510" style="s2">desks basically adds five years to your</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.570" end="00:41:30.760" style="s2">life right that&#39;s that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.510" end="00:41:32.740" style="s2">oversimplification but this is the kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.760" end="00:41:35.280" style="s2">of language that they use when they draw</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.740" end="00:41:37.780" style="s2">conclusions from their studies right and</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.280" end="00:41:39.670" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s important in its</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.780" end="00:41:43.270" style="s2">salient because most like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.670" end="00:41:45.970" style="s2">people work behind a desk we have a very</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.270" end="00:41:47.550" style="s2">sedentary II kind of office culture</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.970" end="00:41:49.510" style="s2">right and especially these economies</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.550" end="00:41:53.410" style="s2">industrialized they become more like</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.510" end="00:41:55.240" style="s2">that there&#39;s more knowledge workers and</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.410" end="00:41:59.190" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting okay I bring this up</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.240" end="00:42:01.870" style="s2">because it&#39;s like scientific proof of</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.190" end="00:42:05.620" style="s2">kind of a policy decision that should be</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.870" end="00:42:08.170" style="s2">made you know and we can talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.620" end="00:42:10.360" style="s2">practicality of it after but but we</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.170" end="00:42:13.420" style="s2">should be able to agree on what the</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.360" end="00:42:15.160" style="s2">science says about lifespan and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.420" end="00:42:17.200" style="s2">health and things like this because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.160" end="00:42:20.340" style="s2">such it&#39;s a difficult switch to make</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.200" end="00:42:23.830" style="s2">like I&#39;m sitting right now I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.340" end="00:42:26.890" style="s2">like have a certain discipline with my</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.830" end="00:42:30.810" style="s2">standing desk but I do use it from time</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.890" end="00:42:33.760" style="s2">to time and always remind myself like</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.810" end="00:42:35.860" style="s2">about this truth about this reality that</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.760" end="00:42:38.410" style="s2">the evidence is the scientific studies</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.860" end="00:42:39.530" style="s2">on it show a very concrete thing right</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.410" end="00:42:41.480" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.530" end="00:42:45.830" style="s2">the broader point is how these things</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.480" end="00:42:47.540" style="s2">get politicized or just ignored right so</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.830" end="00:42:51.050" style="s2">a few years ago I was so excited about</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.540" end="00:42:54.830" style="s2">this and I brought it to the ergonomics</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.050" end="00:42:56.990" style="s2">advisor at UBC and I&#39;ve made a little</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.830" end="00:43:00.830" style="s2">kind of presentation and showed some of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.990" end="00:43:02.690" style="s2">the research and and and is this her job</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.830" end="00:43:04.610" style="s2">keep in mind is to be the ergonomics</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.690" end="00:43:08.420" style="s2">advisor to go around at people&#39;s offices</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.610" end="00:43:11.270" style="s2">and measure desk desk space and still he</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.420" end="00:43:13.040" style="s2">shit like this and you know I was just</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.270" end="00:43:15.230" style="s2">sure I was kinda I was trying to help</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.040" end="00:43:18.410" style="s2">you know I had no personal incentive I</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.230" end="00:43:20.120" style="s2">was trying to like uh help UBC adopt a</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.410" end="00:43:23.300" style="s2">policy that was actually like</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.120" end="00:43:25.400" style="s2">universally positive even if they just</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.300" end="00:43:28.190" style="s2">accepted it in kind of PR terms and</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.400" end="00:43:30.890" style="s2">didn&#39;t spend a dollar they could say</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.190" end="00:43:32.750" style="s2">that hey we advocate standing desks this</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.890" end="00:43:34.400" style="s2">is kind of a revolution I think most</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.750" end="00:43:38.960" style="s2">employees freak out if you took their</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.400" end="00:43:41.360" style="s2">chairs away yeah I mean you&#39;re a perv</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.960" end="00:43:42.920" style="s2">you zombie threat for it yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.360" end="00:43:44.030" style="s2">acknowledge the benefits of it and yet</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.920" end="00:43:45.860" style="s2">you spend the majority of your time</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.030" end="00:43:58.790" style="s2">sitting at your standing desk and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.860" end="00:44:00.830" style="s2">would have a standing desk the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.790" end="00:44:03.200" style="s2">is there when like that&#39;s not how</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.830" end="00:44:05.180" style="s2">science works it&#39;s not like one you just</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.200" end="00:44:06.800" style="s2">went off on the Santa Fe Institute and</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.180" end="00:44:09.050" style="s2">how they&#39;re funded by that I&#39;m sorry but</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.800" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">maybe just an org isn&#39;t the best place</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.050" end="00:44:12.890" style="s2">to go for all of the scientific evidence</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.640" end="00:44:15.500" style="s2">as to whether sitting or standing to me</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.890" end="00:44:17.300" style="s2">it&#39;s a very personal choice no I want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.500" end="00:44:19.760" style="s2">be sitting or standing having a standing</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.300" end="00:44:22.880" style="s2">desk being able to stand and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.760" end="00:44:24.920" style="s2">choosing when I sit having my UBC my</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.880" end="00:44:26.240" style="s2">government anyone my boss be like you</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.920" end="00:44:27.440" style="s2">have to stand because it&#39;s better for</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.240" end="00:44:32.210" style="s2">your body we&#39;re gonna get more work out</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.440" end="00:44:34.250" style="s2">of you is an invitation to be like hey</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.210" end="00:44:36.230" style="s2">everyone could have a standing desk</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.250" end="00:44:38.780" style="s2">which is also way more expensive sign</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.230" end="00:44:41.630" style="s2">desks are not the same price it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.780" end="00:44:43.460" style="s2">and so having the ability to like</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.630" end="00:44:45.260" style="s2">instead of top-down this is what the</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.460" end="00:44:46.370" style="s2">science says is what everyone should do</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.260" end="00:44:47.990" style="s2">everyone should be doing what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.370" end="00:44:51.820" style="s2">because I came to it through science and</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.990" end="00:44:54.550" style="s2">logic is rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.820" end="00:44:56.470" style="s2">is the like brokenness of like I came to</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.550" end="00:44:58.540" style="s2">this so everyone should do it instead of</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.470" end="00:44:59.950" style="s2">like listen I have this I have this</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.540" end="00:45:01.510" style="s2">piece like even when you&#39;re like I went</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.950" end="00:45:04.180" style="s2">to UBC and I had nothing in it for me</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.510" end="00:45:06.220" style="s2">yeah you had been right in it for you</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.180" end="00:45:08.110" style="s2">you had being the person to give that to</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.220" end="00:45:09.700" style="s2">them right like of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.110" end="00:45:12.490" style="s2">something in it for you but like finding</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.700" end="00:45:29.560" style="s2">the truth for you and then living it and</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.490" end="00:45:34.990" style="s2">then no I&#39;m actually just stretching you</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.560" end="00:45:36.340" style="s2">can do that it&#39;s all good it was just</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.990" end="00:45:41.620" style="s2">funny because it was like well it was</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.340" end="00:45:44.520" style="s2">like I&#39;m not I&#39;m not proposing this in</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.620" end="00:45:47.080" style="s2">an authoritarian way though like I&#39;m go</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.520" end="00:45:48.760" style="s2">back and watch this video and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.080" end="00:45:50.590" style="s2">saying you were like everyone should but</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.760" end="00:45:52.780" style="s2">the were like no the evidence is there</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.590" end="00:45:54.660" style="s2">this is should be policy this should be</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.780" end="00:45:57.310" style="s2">what people do instead of an invitation</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.660" end="00:45:59.080" style="s2">replicate in it yeah let&#39;s let&#39;s wallow</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.310" end="00:46:03.130" style="s2">through on that point just because all I</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.080" end="00:46:04.660" style="s2">was saying was like not trying to you</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.130" end="00:46:06.280" style="s2">know draw the conclusion that that we</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.660" end="00:46:09.610" style="s2">should have an authoritarian policy but</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.280" end="00:46:11.800" style="s2">to set up the and we can unpack this but</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.610" end="00:46:13.420" style="s2">just to set up the premise that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.800" end="00:46:14.650" style="s2">research is there and if we were all to</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.420" end="00:46:18.370" style="s2">look we would all agree and it would be</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.650" end="00:46:20.470" style="s2">pretty non-controversial is no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.370" end="00:46:22.650" style="s2">literally nothing on this planet that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.470" end="00:46:24.640" style="s2">cyant maybe gravity that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.650" end="00:46:25.930" style="s2">non-controversial science comes out even</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.640" end="00:46:27.850" style="s2">gravity is the biggest mystery on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.930" end="00:46:30.190" style="s2">planet like what</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.850" end="00:46:31.510" style="s2">there is no you you have to like come to</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.190" end="00:46:34.300" style="s2">that evidence to say oh you first all</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.510" end="00:46:36.040" style="s2">you have to not have a position come hey</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.300" end="00:46:38.290" style="s2">let&#39;s look at all the evidence and see</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.040" end="00:46:40.300" style="s2">is standing or sitting better for the</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.290" end="00:46:43.000" style="s2">majority and then who is sitting better</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.300" end="00:46:44.680" style="s2">for who is standing better for and what</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.000" end="00:46:46.120" style="s2">do you feel like when you&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.680" end="00:46:47.800" style="s2">right and then have that invitation</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.120" end="00:46:49.780" style="s2">there&#39;s literally nothing in science</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.800" end="00:46:51.430" style="s2">that&#39;s like cut and dry this is all the</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.780" end="00:46:54.190" style="s2">evidence points that this is better or</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.430" end="00:46:55.750" style="s2">we would always Commons knew what their</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.190" end="00:46:59.860" style="s2">research says you know go to office</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.750" end="00:47:01.210" style="s2">chairs calm and have a nice ride there</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.860" end="00:47:04.720" style="s2">was two things that came up as you guys</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.210" end="00:47:06.250" style="s2">are talking one is I don&#39;t remember what</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.720" end="00:47:10.869" style="s2">I heard it but there was something that</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.250" end="00:47:13.630" style="s2">like 50% of scientific journals journal</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.869" end="00:47:15.940" style="s2">articles are are within 5 years proved</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.630" end="00:47:17.950" style="s2">false you know so we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.940" end="00:47:21.880" style="s2">scientific you know an agreement on</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.950" end="00:47:25.420" style="s2">scientific journals and then also for me</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.880" end="00:47:26.590" style="s2">yeah when I heard the word policy you</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.420" end="00:47:30.070" style="s2">know Brett when I heard you say the word</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.590" end="00:47:34.210" style="s2">policy what came up in me was this like</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.070" end="00:47:36.810" style="s2">I think you guys are completely missing</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.210" end="00:47:39.970" style="s2">the point I&#39;m talking about an</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.810" end="00:47:41.380" style="s2">intervention recommendation to decrease</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.970" end="00:47:45.210" style="s2">the things that are the number one</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.380" end="00:47:45.210" style="s2">killers like heart disease and obesity</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.500" end="00:47:51.940" style="s2">but but yeah but to make it an option it</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.780" end="00:47:53.830" style="s2">has to be policy first for it to be an</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.940" end="00:47:56.400" style="s2">option right and then we can get to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.830" end="00:47:58.750" style="s2">question of costs okay so the policy</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.400" end="00:48:00.640" style="s2">okay so there would be a policy that</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.750" end="00:48:02.230" style="s2">standing desks are an option for</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.640" end="00:48:03.670" style="s2">employees yeah that&#39;s what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.230" end="00:48:07.420" style="s2">it&#39;s not like standing desks are the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.670" end="00:48:09.490" style="s2">policy yeah this is also the option of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.420" end="00:48:11.290" style="s2">standing desk and we recommend them for</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.490" end="00:48:13.410" style="s2">these and these and these reasons but</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.290" end="00:48:16.330" style="s2">hey if you want to sit you can sit yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.410" end="00:48:20.500" style="s2">right I think that but both Jubilee and</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.330" end="00:48:23.830" style="s2">I are trying to articulate is not not</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.500" end="00:48:26.619" style="s2">saying that you&#39;re wrong or but to say</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.830" end="00:48:29.920" style="s2">this is our reaction to the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.619" end="00:48:32.109" style="s2">communicated it not that it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.920" end="00:48:34.240" style="s2">something that was something you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.109" end="00:48:37.119" style="s2">that you had done you know like not that</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.240" end="00:48:38.890" style="s2">we disagree with you necessarily but the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.119" end="00:48:40.690" style="s2">emotion I don&#39;t know I I don&#39;t wanna</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.890" end="00:48:44.320" style="s2">speak for you to believe but that for me</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.690" end="00:48:46.900" style="s2">I was trying to express that I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.320" end="00:48:49.089" style="s2">trying to communicate the reaction I had</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.900" end="00:48:53.020" style="s2">to the way that you communicated it and</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.089" end="00:48:54.790" style="s2">so not you know not arguing you with you</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.020" end="00:48:57.339" style="s2">on that you know one way or the other</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.790" end="00:48:59.530" style="s2">but it&#39;s like that is those are the</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.339" end="00:49:02.380" style="s2">things that those are the things that</p>

<p begin="00:49:28.240" end="00:49:32.110" style="s2">think Bernie&#39;s a much better candidate</p>

<p begin="00:52:40.509" end="00:52:44.410" style="s2">it and six weeks later we have it and</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.670" end="00:52:45.940" style="s2">the Prime Minister can call it whenever</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.410" end="00:52:46.990" style="s2">they kind of want to within a certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.940" end="00:52:48.490" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a point where you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.990" end="00:52:49.839" style="s2">to call them I think it&#39;s the fifth year</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.490" end="00:52:51.670" style="s2">at the end of the fifth year if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.839" end="00:52:54.789" style="s2">haven&#39;t called 18 emergency you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.670" end="00:52:57.490" style="s2">trouble but like six weeks but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.789" end="00:52:59.019" style="s2">enough for not three years of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.490" end="00:53:01.329" style="s2">everyone running and everyone gets up</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.019" end="00:53:02.829" style="s2">and then it&#39;s not even like the people</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.329" end="00:53:05.650" style="s2">get to decide what the questions are in</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.829" end="00:53:08.289" style="s2">the debates there&#39;s endless debates it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.650" end="00:53:11.549" style="s2">just so horrific its designs apparently</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.289" end="00:53:15.759" style="s2">and this debates about things that are</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.549" end="00:53:17.980" style="s2">better than people are based on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.759" end="00:53:20.769" style="s2">political talking points versus what</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.980" end="00:53:24.579" style="s2">people actually care about or want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.769" end="00:53:26.349" style="s2">hear about so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.579" end="00:53:28.420" style="s2">disaster I I will agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.349" end="00:53:30.759" style="s2">they&#39;ve got a really good policy in</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.420" end="00:53:33.250" style="s2">Spain where it&#39;s a law in fact in Spain</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.759" end="00:53:34.900" style="s2">where in the run-up to elections you are</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.250" end="00:53:37.569" style="s2">allowed to campaign for one month and</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.900" end="00:53:42.009" style="s2">one month only that&#39;s it one month of</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.569" end="00:53:45.070" style="s2">campaigning up the elections done mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.009" end="00:53:48.810" style="s2">i I would add to like I I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.070" end="00:53:51.390" style="s2">a lot of limitations in in some of his</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.810" end="00:53:54.900" style="s2">solutions to these systemic things like</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.390" end="00:53:57.160" style="s2">like like it&#39;s a bit of a paradox that</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.900" end="00:53:58.630" style="s2">he&#39;s running on all these small dollar</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.160" end="00:54:01.990" style="s2">donations because that&#39;s unsustainable</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.630" end="00:54:04.360" style="s2">too and it&#39;s actually ironic that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.990" end="00:54:07.090" style="s2">doing so well when people are so</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.360" end="00:54:09.100" style="s2">impoverished like that that&#39;s crazy that</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.090" end="00:54:11.620" style="s2">he&#39;s raising the most money from the</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.100" end="00:54:13.390" style="s2">poorest people right like dude do people</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.620" end="00:54:15.550" style="s2">stop and think about that because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.390" end="00:54:17.710" style="s2">crazy and this is why it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.550" end="00:54:20.260" style="s2">that that he has to win because people</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.710" end="00:54:22.330" style="s2">can&#39;t afford to keep sustaining</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.260" end="00:54:25.570" style="s2">progressive politics this way so my hope</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.330" end="00:54:28.270" style="s2">for after when however long this takes</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.570" end="00:54:30.190" style="s2">to make happen for the US political</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.270" end="00:54:32.440" style="s2">system and every political system</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.190" end="00:54:35.130" style="s2">elections should be just like you guys</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.440" end="00:54:37.180" style="s2">are saying like short and structured and</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.130" end="00:54:39.280" style="s2">you know when we talk about getting</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.180" end="00:54:42.610" style="s2">money out of politics that what it</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.280" end="00:54:44.980" style="s2">should mean is every candidate is has</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.610" end="00:54:47.590" style="s2">equal funding and that funding comes</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.980" end="00:54:49.350" style="s2">from the state so ultimately from</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.590" end="00:54:53.050" style="s2">taxpayers but in a more indirect way</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.350" end="00:54:54.580" style="s2">that way like it&#39;s not biased at every</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.050" end="00:54:57.310" style="s2">step of the way because the media debate</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.580" end="00:55:00.310" style="s2">the the mainstream media debates whether</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.310" end="00:55:02.290" style="s2">it&#39;s CNN or NBC doing them like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.310" end="00:55:07.570" style="s2">skewed they&#39;re biased they&#39;re horribly</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.290" end="00:55:08.590" style="s2">structured they produce circuses I mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.570" end="00:55:09.880" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it should be like</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.590" end="00:55:11.620" style="s2">Bloomberg and I don&#39;t think it should be</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.880" end="00:55:13.300" style="s2">all small-dollar donors funding how I</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.620" end="00:55:17.200" style="s2">think it should be is a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.300" end="00:55:20.200" style="s2">candidates have like exact media like</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.200" end="00:55:22.330" style="s2">exact equal media exposure you know if</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.200" end="00:55:22.990" style="s2">we could agree on that as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.330" end="00:55:26.230" style="s2">baseline</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.990" end="00:55:28.900" style="s2">I think the discourse would be so much</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.230" end="00:55:37.930" style="s2">better and candidates though and how do</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.900" end="00:55:40.810" style="s2">you feel people that do get the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.930" end="00:55:44.020" style="s2">is that I mean if we talk about the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.810" end="00:55:45.670" style="s2">idea of stuff as being emergent that</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.020" end="00:55:48.160" style="s2">what has emerged you know is</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.670" end="00:55:52.300" style="s2">dysfunctional and so learning we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.160" end="00:55:54.010" style="s2">going to you know Brett I hear what</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.300" end="00:55:56.380" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that&#39;s not going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.010" end="00:55:58.619" style="s2">and the question you know and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.380" end="00:56:02.130" style="s2">question is is like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.619" end="00:56:03.630" style="s2">how do you know what it&#39;s clear to most</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.130" end="00:56:07.079" style="s2">people that what&#39;s happening now is</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.630" end="00:56:09.059" style="s2">dysfunctional but the question is is</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.079" end="00:56:11.069" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna emerge next and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.059" end="00:56:12.180" style="s2">influence that we&#39;re not going we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.069" end="00:56:14.249" style="s2">going to get to a place where everybody</p>

<p begin="00:56:14.249" end="00:56:20.130" style="s2">about the emergent quality and so what</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.529" end="00:56:21.420" style="s2">is going to emerge from this I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.130" end="00:56:23.339" style="s2">interesting to hear your guys&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.420" end="00:56:26.160" style="s2">perspective because from being somebody</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.339" end="00:56:27.630" style="s2">who&#39;s here in the States the likelihood</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.160" end="00:56:31.009" style="s2">of Bernie getting elected is almost</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.630" end="00:56:35.489" style="s2">non-existent no that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.009" end="00:56:37.890" style="s2">like from from the like internal from</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.489" end="00:56:42.539" style="s2">you know at least one section of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.890" end="00:56:47.099" style="s2">population is not because of who he is</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.539" end="00:56:49.589" style="s2">but because of the DNC not my issue is</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.099" end="00:56:51.299" style="s2">not because of who he is it&#39;s that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.589" end="00:56:54.450" style="s2">not likely to get the nod because of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.299" end="00:56:57.989" style="s2">DNC and then as a result Trump&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.450" end="00:56:59.519" style="s2">win like that&#39;s you know there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.989" end="00:57:02.099" style="s2">of people who agree that that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.519" end="00:57:04.049" style="s2">going to happen yeah that&#39;s what Jim Ron</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.099" end="00:57:08.789" style="s2">is voting for and I mean I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.049" end="00:57:11.400" style="s2">your logic to an extent but I also</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.789" end="00:57:13.859" style="s2">believe that this time around this time</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.400" end="00:57:16.109" style="s2">Bernie can beat the DNC like the</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.859" end="00:57:19.289" style="s2">movement I mean we&#39;re having a replay of</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.109" end="00:57:21.660" style="s2">2016 like there&#39;s so many parallels it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.289" end="00:57:24.380" style="s2">a kind of you know we&#39;re out another</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.660" end="00:57:27.299" style="s2">kind of bifurcation of the timeline and</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.380" end="00:57:30.479" style="s2">last election you know we went down the</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.299" end="00:57:33.180" style="s2">darkest timeline and there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.479" end="00:57:33.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a very good chance Bernie can</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.180" end="00:57:36.119" style="s2">win it all</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.930" end="00:57:38.910" style="s2">because we have to kind of believe that</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.119" end="00:57:40.799" style="s2">the DNC is going to lose this time</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.910" end="00:57:42.630" style="s2">around but they are doing everything in</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.799" end="00:57:44.759" style="s2">their in their power to stop it here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.630" end="00:57:46.170" style="s2">the sacred camp Democratic candidate is</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.759" end="00:57:49.469" style="s2">that bud and is either sort of sacred</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.170" end="00:57:52.380" style="s2">cows I find the sacred cows like this</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.469" end="00:57:54.630" style="s2">like if Bernie gets the number of</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.380" end="00:57:56.489" style="s2">Delegates if he actually wins through</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.630" end="00:58:07.410" style="s2">this whatever frickin hell of a</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.489" end="00:58:09.150" style="s2">freakshow long time then he has to win</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.410" end="00:58:10.979" style="s2">like 80 percent or something of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.150" end="00:58:11.960" style="s2">delegates to overcome there this is what</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.979" end="00:58:14.070" style="s2">happened with</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.960" end="00:58:17.000" style="s2">the issue is with the super-delegates</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.070" end="00:58:19.770" style="s2">it&#39;s there this is very dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.000" end="00:58:22.260" style="s2">thing of there&#39;s a whole bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.770" end="00:58:24.570" style="s2">who are not beholden to who vote who was</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.260" end="00:58:28.230" style="s2">voted for they get to choose who they</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.570" end="00:58:30.230" style="s2">want and so that&#39;s where the super</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.230" end="00:58:32.730" style="s2">delegate I mean how does that happen</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.230" end="00:58:33.990" style="s2">actually I just recently learned it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.730" end="00:58:38.820" style="s2">actually something that you were but</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.990" end="00:58:41.490" style="s2">that you are voted into but I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.820" end="00:58:45.330" style="s2">I don&#39;t fully understand like I know I</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.490" end="00:58:47.070" style="s2">don&#39;t fully understand how I think I</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.330" end="00:58:48.990" style="s2">think through movements by members of</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.070" end="00:58:50.490" style="s2">the of the genetic Democratic Party</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.990" end="00:58:54.300" style="s2">obviously if you can&#39;t be a Republican</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.490" end="00:58:57.030" style="s2">you know well who the super-delegates</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.300" end="00:58:58.980" style="s2">are going to be yeah yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.030" end="00:59:02.390" style="s2">complicated yeah there&#39;s many ways</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.980" end="00:59:04.320" style="s2">there&#39;s many types of super-delegates</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.390" end="00:59:05.790" style="s2">although we&#39;re almost out of time</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.320" end="00:59:08.369" style="s2">like yeah that is what we should be</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.790" end="00:59:09.570" style="s2">focusing on instead of like yes we</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.369" end="00:59:11.790" style="s2">probably all could agree to get money</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.570" end="00:59:13.710" style="s2">out of politics but well money&#39;s in</p>

<p begin="01:02:47.030" end="01:02:51.150" style="s2">there will be an interesting twist to</p>

<p begin="01:02:53.160" end="01:02:59.520" style="s2">rather than vote for someone you can</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.630" end="01:03:01.320" style="s2">cast your vote against someone you can</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.520" end="01:03:03.570" style="s2">cast it for someone or against someone</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.320" end="01:03:06.360" style="s2">I&#39;ve well that&#39;s rather than that you</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.570" end="01:03:09.720" style="s2">can have ranked choice - right and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.360" end="01:03:11.250" style="s2">yeah yeah there might be some</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.720" end="01:03:13.950" style="s2">complications with that but at least</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.250" end="01:03:16.890" style="s2">like in in like if it was me and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.950" end="01:03:20.070" style="s2">current lineup of candidates I would</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.890" end="01:03:22.140" style="s2">pick like Bernie and then and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.070" end="01:03:24.720" style="s2">Warren right that&#39;s a huge difference</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.140" end="01:03:26.370" style="s2">from Bernie and Biden and so if a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.720" end="01:03:28.350" style="s2">people vote this way and the data it</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.370" end="01:03:31.130" style="s2">does show that most of these other</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.350" end="01:03:34.230" style="s2">voters Bernie is their second choice</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.130" end="01:03:35.580" style="s2">like like Bernie was Budaj edge but or</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.230" end="01:03:38.760" style="s2">their second choice but because we do</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.580" end="01:03:40.890" style="s2">judge and endorse Biden you know that</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.760" end="01:03:44.130" style="s2">that skews things somewhat who knows how</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.890" end="01:03:46.020" style="s2">much but I mean maybe it&#39;ll backfire but</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.130" end="01:03:49.200" style="s2">but I think rank choice could address</p>
