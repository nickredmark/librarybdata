<p begin="00:00:05.509" end="00:00:09.900" style="s2">we&#39;re putting out a whole series of</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.440" end="00:00:11.610" style="s2">films around psychedelics and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.900" end="00:00:14.160" style="s2">written quite a lot of addict ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.610" end="00:00:17.340" style="s2">experience just be good to just get a</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.160" end="00:00:22.380" style="s2">sort of potted history of your writing</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.340" end="00:00:25.140" style="s2">and interests sure so the first book I</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.380" end="00:00:27.779" style="s2">wrote was called philosophy for life and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.140" end="00:00:30.179" style="s2">other dangerous situations that was</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.779" end="00:00:32.369" style="s2">about how people use ancient Greek</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.179" end="00:00:34.710" style="s2">philosophy today after writing that book</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.369" end="00:00:38.910" style="s2">and after it came out in 2012 I started</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.710" end="00:00:42.059" style="s2">to look at ecstatic experiences which I</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.910" end="00:00:43.980" style="s2">define I define ecstasy as moments where</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.059" end="00:00:45.960" style="s2">you go beyond your ordinary sense of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.980" end="00:00:48.360" style="s2">self and ordinary sense of reality and</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.960" end="00:00:51.420" style="s2">feel connected to something greater than</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.360" end="00:00:53.969" style="s2">you which can be wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.420" end="00:00:59.579" style="s2">euphoric and healing but it can also be</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.969" end="00:01:01.350" style="s2">terrifying and sometimes damaging and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.579" end="00:01:06.420" style="s2">wanted to look at how people find those</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.350" end="00:01:08.130" style="s2">experiences today in Western culture how</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.420" end="00:01:10.260" style="s2">can we find in ways that are good for us</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.130" end="00:01:12.900" style="s2">as opposed to bad for us</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.260" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">so I found I think Aldous Huxley&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.900" end="00:01:16.549" style="s2">greatest writer on this topic and he</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:18.840" style="s2">talks about upwards and downwards</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.549" end="00:01:20.460" style="s2">transcendence downwards transcendence is</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.840" end="00:01:22.680" style="s2">when you basically just you want to get</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.460" end="00:01:25.860" style="s2">out of your normal yo but you do it in</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.680" end="00:01:31.500" style="s2">an unhealthy instructive way you get</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.860" end="00:01:33.630" style="s2">annihilated on vodka for example every</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.500" end="00:01:35.850" style="s2">kind of Avenue to transcendence can</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.630" end="00:01:37.890" style="s2">potentially be unhealthy toxic and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.850" end="00:01:41.460" style="s2">downward so I wanted to try and help</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.890" end="00:01:43.740" style="s2">myself and others find ecstasy in a way</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.460" end="00:01:46.770" style="s2">that&#39;s good for them and healthy for</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.740" end="00:01:49.720" style="s2">their society so I spent five years</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.770" end="00:01:52.870" style="s2">researching that and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.720" end="00:01:54.909" style="s2">you know try to put together my thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.870" end="00:01:56.620" style="s2">in my in my book the art of losing</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.909" end="00:01:57.729" style="s2">control which came out last year I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.620" end="00:01:59.650" style="s2">interested in the history of ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.729" end="00:02:02.940" style="s2">experiences and I feel like Western</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.650" end="00:02:06.400" style="s2">culture rather marginalized and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.940" end="00:02:08.110" style="s2">pathologized ecstasy starting from</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.400" end="00:02:10.899" style="s2">around the Reformation as in by</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.110" end="00:02:15.670" style="s2">pathologized I mean it got redefined as</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.899" end="00:02:18.940" style="s2">a mental illness so in the 17th and 18th</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.670" end="00:02:20.950" style="s2">centuries rationalist materialist</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.940" end="00:02:25.540" style="s2">thinkers like Thomas Hobbes would say</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.950" end="00:02:26.800" style="s2">ecstasy is enthusiasm as delusion you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.540" end="00:02:30.940" style="s2">just letting yourself be carried away</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.800" end="00:02:33.250" style="s2">with your imagination in the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.940" end="00:02:37.030" style="s2">century psychiatrists like jean-martin</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.250" end="00:02:39.489" style="s2">charcot said ecstasy is just hysteria a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.030" end="00:02:41.980" style="s2">symptom of a brain disorder all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.489" end="00:02:44.170" style="s2">ecstatics of yesteryear he said from</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.980" end="00:02:47.070" style="s2">Joan of Arc to Socrates to Mohammed are</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.170" end="00:02:49.600" style="s2">actually suffering from brain disorders</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.070" end="00:02:53.560" style="s2">20th century psychiatry said something</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.600" end="00:02:55.299" style="s2">similar you know if you say I&#39;m spirits</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.560" end="00:02:59.160" style="s2">are talking to me I&#39;m connected to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.299" end="00:03:02.170" style="s2">universe that&#39;s actually just psychosis</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.160" end="00:03:03.750" style="s2">so that&#39;s the main story I think and as</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.170" end="00:03:05.920" style="s2">a result of that there&#39;s a taboo around</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.750" end="00:03:08.709" style="s2">ecstasy this is something that Stan Grof</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.920" end="00:03:11.320" style="s2">talks really well about yeah Stan Stan</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.709" end="00:03:14.459" style="s2">Grof is very important in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.320" end="00:03:17.620" style="s2">thing so psychiatry pathologized</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.459" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">ecstasy so we still have these</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.620" end="00:03:22.150" style="s2">experiences because they&#39;re naturally</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.840" end="00:03:23.709" style="s2">occurring but we don&#39;t talk about them</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.150" end="00:03:25.660" style="s2">because we don&#39;t look ridiculous or</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.709" end="00:03:28.390" style="s2">stupid or mad or the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.660" end="00:03:30.730" style="s2">synchronicities or yeah something that a</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.390" end="00:03:32.200" style="s2">lot of people when you kind of when they</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.730" end="00:03:34.239" style="s2">feel safe enough to talk about will say</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.200" end="00:03:35.739" style="s2">yes I&#39;ve had that experience where it</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.239" end="00:03:38.829" style="s2">just felt like there was something more</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.739" end="00:03:42.160" style="s2">- there was some pattern sudden senses</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.829" end="00:03:44.260" style="s2">of deep connection to other people say</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.160" end="00:03:48.370" style="s2">or to everything or to nature very</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.260" end="00:03:49.959" style="s2">common happen to agnostics atheists</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.370" end="00:03:51.130" style="s2">believers they interpret them in</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.959" end="00:03:52.630" style="s2">different ways they&#39;re very common</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.130" end="00:03:55.510" style="s2">Bertrand Russell&#39;s walking down the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.630" end="00:03:57.400" style="s2">street suddenly feels completely filled</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.510" end="00:03:59.549" style="s2">with love for the strangers around him</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.400" end="00:04:01.349" style="s2">for five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.549" end="00:04:02.519" style="s2">and it changes him for it you know he</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.349" end="00:04:04.319" style="s2">goes it doesn&#39;t be doesn&#39;t if I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.519" end="00:04:07.709" style="s2">Christian but it becomes a pacifist for</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.319" end="00:04:09.540" style="s2">his whole life so the main story is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.709" end="00:04:11.879" style="s2">pathologize ation and marginalization of</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.540" end="00:04:14.040" style="s2">Ecstasy but there of course being</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.879" end="00:04:16.199" style="s2">counter currents ever since the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.040" end="00:04:18.989" style="s2">Enlightenment bits of Western culture</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.199" end="00:04:21.419" style="s2">that say no we ecstasy is important this</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.989" end="00:04:23.759" style="s2">is a this is a valuable good experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.419" end="00:04:25.380" style="s2">a good aspect of human nature we need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.759" end="00:04:27.900" style="s2">keep it alive but these have been</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.380" end="00:04:30.560" style="s2">subcultures kind of going against the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.900" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">grain from the romantics romantics</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.560" end="00:04:39.240" style="s2">absolutely Methodist Church 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:41.160" style="s2">kind of spiritualism and occultism and</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.240" end="00:04:43.590" style="s2">then there&#39;s a mass explosion of it in</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.160" end="00:04:47.910" style="s2">the 60s with things like Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.590" end="00:04:51.900" style="s2">religions things like meditation Hari</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.910" end="00:04:54.240" style="s2">Krishna or show Tantra psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.900" end="00:04:58.919" style="s2">whether that&#39;s from indigenous cultures</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.240" end="00:05:01.560" style="s2">or or LSD rock roll experimental movie</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.919" end="00:05:05.370" style="s2">suddenly what had previously been quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.560" end="00:05:07.289" style="s2">minority in bohemian suddenly becomes in</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.370" end="00:05:10.800" style="s2">a mainstream there&#39;s that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.289" end="00:05:12.599" style="s2">explosion of inter mass culture of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.800" end="00:05:15.090" style="s2">of different ecstatic extract their</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.599" end="00:05:18.539" style="s2">practices and of a hunger for intense</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.090" end="00:05:21.570" style="s2">experiences including psychedelics one</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.539" end="00:05:23.250" style="s2">of the big problems as well as either we</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.570" end="00:05:25.650" style="s2">have this mainstream culture which still</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.250" end="00:05:27.479" style="s2">to some extent is frightened of ecstasy</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.650" end="00:05:29.280" style="s2">because we&#39;re frightened of losing</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.479" end="00:05:33.630" style="s2">control because our whole culture is</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.280" end="00:05:35.130" style="s2">about being this well controlled ego so</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.630" end="00:05:37.020" style="s2">the idea of really letting go of control</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.130" end="00:05:40.860" style="s2">is frightening to us because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.020" end="00:05:43.469" style="s2">want to kind of end up in section then</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.860" end="00:05:46.650" style="s2">we have these subcultures which you and</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.469" end="00:05:49.320" style="s2">I have walked in and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.650" end="00:05:52.979" style="s2">working to some extent where ecstasy is</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.320" end="00:05:55.320" style="s2">more accepted New Age culture personal</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.979" end="00:05:58.110" style="s2">development culture psychedelic culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.320" end="00:06:00.349" style="s2">and so on and we were queer subcultures</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.110" end="00:06:02.550" style="s2">I would say we&#39;re not mainstream culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.349" end="00:06:05.370" style="s2">we couldn&#39;t talk about some of this</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.550" end="00:06:07.220" style="s2">stuff on the BBC for example it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.370" end="00:06:10.889" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s still a bit to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.220" end="00:06:14.070" style="s2">probably getting less so yeah before I</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.889" end="00:06:16.110" style="s2">hope say slowly I work in academia it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.070" end="00:06:18.090" style="s2">still a bit to be maybe getting less say</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.110" end="00:06:19.410" style="s2">the problem in this whole culture is</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.090" end="00:06:22.710" style="s2">slightly different it&#39;s not one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.410" end="00:06:24.570" style="s2">pathologize ation fetishization exactly</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.710" end="00:06:28.830" style="s2">it&#39;s the opposite if the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.570" end="00:06:31.229" style="s2">culture is aversion and fear you get the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.830" end="00:06:35.030" style="s2">opposite in in a subculture of over</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.229" end="00:06:41.820" style="s2">attachment the desire for a spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.030" end="00:06:43.889" style="s2">entirely made up of highs yeah seeking</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.820" end="00:06:45.240" style="s2">it too much and then you say I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.889" end="00:06:48.720" style="s2">know about you but I noticed it in my</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.240" end="00:06:51.690" style="s2">spiritual life sometimes I&#39;ll go to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.720" end="00:06:55.800" style="s2">retreat or a workshop or a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.690" end="00:06:59.010" style="s2">ceremony and I&#39;ll feel really high and</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.800" end="00:07:00.840" style="s2">flooded with meaning for about a month</p>

<p begin="00:07:00.840" end="00:07:05.240" style="s2">feel a bit bored and depressed and empty</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.639" end="00:07:08.010" style="s2">and they&#39;ll go what&#39;s the next adventure</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.240" end="00:07:09.510" style="s2">and it&#39;s like it&#39;s like a kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.010" end="00:07:12.660" style="s2">know it&#39;s like a kind of slightly full</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.550" end="00:07:21.780" style="s2">really ecstasy addiction I think I first</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.770" end="00:07:23.220" style="s2">became aware of your writing on</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.780" end="00:07:25.710" style="s2">psychedelics and an article you wrote</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.220" end="00:07:28.139" style="s2">for the idler and what I was struck by</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.710" end="00:07:32.550" style="s2">was that you were not afraid to go into</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.139" end="00:07:34.169" style="s2">the more metaphysical spiritual depths</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.550" end="00:07:35.160" style="s2">of what the experience meant and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.169" end="00:07:38.280" style="s2">a lot of people writing about</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.160" end="00:07:40.590" style="s2">psychedelics but very few people with</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.280" end="00:07:42.570" style="s2">your background in academia talking</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.590" end="00:07:44.280" style="s2">about well what is the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.570" end="00:07:47.700" style="s2">entities that we might meet when we go</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.280" end="00:07:49.700" style="s2">into these experiences and this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.700" end="00:07:52.260" style="s2">something that I&#39;m also concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.700" end="00:07:54.389" style="s2">with with some of the studies that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.260" end="00:07:56.880" style="s2">being done at the moment like how how</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.389" end="00:07:58.740" style="s2">difficult to fit is this experience for</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.880" end="00:08:02.070" style="s2">the medical model this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.740" end="00:08:04.770" style="s2">a lot of people in the psychedelic world</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.070" end="00:08:06.660" style="s2">I think a very have a very concerned</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.770" end="00:08:08.490" style="s2">about there&#39;s a kind of push-pull</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.660" end="00:08:11.120" style="s2">because for the first time they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.490" end="00:08:14.580" style="s2">getting the mainstream acceptance of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:18.150" style="s2">scientific studies and medical usage but</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.580" end="00:08:18.600" style="s2">also this brings in a very different</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.150" end="00:08:20.280" style="s2">conception</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.600" end="00:08:22.770" style="s2">framework it brings in a materialist</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.280" end="00:08:24.450" style="s2">framework it brings in the world of like</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.770" end="00:08:28.170" style="s2">double-blind trials it brings in</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.450" end="00:08:29.160" style="s2">corporate influence there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.170" end="00:08:30.750" style="s2">and I have this sort of sense that</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.160" end="00:08:33.660" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.750" end="00:08:39.530" style="s2">experience that is a very difficult fit</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.660" end="00:08:42.900" style="s2">for for this paradigm right we want</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.530" end="00:08:45.720" style="s2">reinterment but we want it in a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.900" end="00:08:47.430" style="s2">rational predictable and measured way</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.720" end="00:08:49.800" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s what people are</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.430" end="00:08:52.800" style="s2">trying to do with psychedelic science</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.800" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">and with contemplative science look</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.800" end="00:08:55.590" style="s2">we&#39;re getting transcendence look we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:57.450" style="s2">losing control but we know exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.590" end="00:09:02.010" style="s2">we&#39;re doing and here&#39;s a brain scan and</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.450" end="00:09:03.060" style="s2">so on and that can work two ways you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.010" end="00:09:04.220" style="s2">either end up with a form of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.060" end="00:09:06.540" style="s2">spirituality which is actually totally</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.220" end="00:09:08.790" style="s2">disenchanted because it&#39;s been it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.540" end="00:09:11.370" style="s2">become so rational and instrumentalized</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.790" end="00:09:13.920" style="s2">and actually you&#39;re not get you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.370" end="00:09:17.370" style="s2">going anywhere you know you&#39;re just in</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.920" end="00:09:21.180" style="s2">the same control freak capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.370" end="00:09:24.120" style="s2">culture the other way is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.180" end="00:09:26.790" style="s2">the science gets spooky actually the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.120" end="00:09:28.230" style="s2">real challenge and the you know you end</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.790" end="00:09:32.070" style="s2">up Michael Pollan talks about you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.230" end="00:09:35.970" style="s2">shaman&#39;s in white coats the scientists</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.070" end="00:09:37.890" style="s2">become kind of guru figures all just</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.970" end="00:09:40.680" style="s2">weird stuff kind of comes through and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.890" end="00:09:42.840" style="s2">and and and and challenges the model</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.680" end="00:09:44.850" style="s2">that you&#39;re bringing well this is like</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.840" end="00:09:48.360" style="s2">entities this happened with the guy who</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.850" end="00:09:50.010" style="s2">did the DMT research Strassmann yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.360" end="00:09:51.720" style="s2">Stratton basically gave it up because he</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.010" end="00:09:54.420" style="s2">went into the DMT research as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.720" end="00:09:56.970" style="s2">materialist scientist and was so freaked</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.420" end="00:09:58.620" style="s2">out by not just the things that people</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.970" end="00:10:00.570" style="s2">were saying but the commonalities</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.620" end="00:10:03.060" style="s2">between what people were saying that it</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.570" end="00:10:04.650" style="s2">really challenged it really disturbed it</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.060" end="00:10:06.270" style="s2">really challenged his worldview and he</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.650" end="00:10:07.470" style="s2">also felt I&#39;m not sure that I should be</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.270" end="00:10:10.830" style="s2">doing this right</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.470" end="00:10:14.070" style="s2">so I mean Strassmann he he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.830" end="00:10:15.540" style="s2">exactly materialist he was a Buddhist he</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.070" end="00:10:17.490" style="s2">thought when people will take</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.540" end="00:10:20.660" style="s2">psychedelics they will have an</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.490" end="00:10:23.700" style="s2">experience of pure light consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.660" end="00:10:26.790" style="s2">and that&#39;s the kind of idea that goes</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.700" end="00:10:29.730" style="s2">all the way back to Aldous Huxley who</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.790" end="00:10:31.559" style="s2">came to psychedelics having very much in</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.730" end="00:10:37.049" style="s2">a research mist</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.559" end="00:10:40.709" style="s2">I was very into zen and vedanta and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.049" end="00:10:44.069" style="s2">on and he thought the highest truth was</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.709" end="00:10:47.189" style="s2">kind of pure light consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.069" end="00:10:51.299" style="s2">that psychedelics would bring us to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.189" end="00:10:53.309" style="s2">highest trees but what Strassmann found</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.299" end="00:10:54.569" style="s2">instead was people didn&#39;t have this kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.309" end="00:11:00.149" style="s2">of clear light experience they had</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.569" end="00:11:01.769" style="s2">entity encounters lizards elfs all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.149" end="00:11:05.549" style="s2">of things but you know some of you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.769" end="00:11:07.619" style="s2">aliens and some of whom weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.549" end="00:11:09.720" style="s2">necessarily benevolent I think there was</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.619" end="00:11:12.149" style="s2">one one person in one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.720" end="00:11:14.339" style="s2">participants you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.149" end="00:11:16.079" style="s2">meets this alien and their participants</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.339" end="00:11:18.600" style="s2">really scared each case all his love all</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.079" end="00:11:20.939" style="s2">his love and the entity says something</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.600" end="00:11:22.919" style="s2">like even here or so till I heard of IDO</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.939" end="00:11:26.220" style="s2">is quite quite no quite they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.919" end="00:11:27.809" style="s2">necessarily loving often they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.220" end="00:11:32.879" style="s2">kind of detached and like want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.809" end="00:11:35.699" style="s2">operate on you whatever so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.879" end="00:11:40.129" style="s2">interesting when when psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.699" end="00:11:42.809" style="s2">researchers think about these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.129" end="00:11:46.769" style="s2">things that you might meet on a trip</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.809" end="00:11:49.529" style="s2">they will often try to bring a Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.769" end="00:11:52.829" style="s2">perspective like Aldous Huxley these are</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.529" end="00:11:53.970" style="s2">just emanations of your mind so like</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.829" end="00:11:56.339" style="s2">just as the Tibetan Book of the Dead</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.970" end="00:11:59.819" style="s2">Book of the Dead says after you die you</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.339" end="00:12:01.499" style="s2">might meet scary monsters recognize them</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.819" end="00:12:02.970" style="s2">as just emanations of the own of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.499" end="00:12:06.720" style="s2">clear light of your consciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.970" end="00:12:09.329" style="s2">will transform it so likewise at the</p>

<p begin="00:12:15.480" end="00:12:20.009" style="s2">say anything scary that you meet these</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.569" end="00:12:22.319" style="s2">are just emanations of your own</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.009" end="00:12:24.600" style="s2">consciousness recognize it go towards it</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.319" end="00:12:29.999" style="s2">accept it and surrender to it and become</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.600" end="00:12:32.129" style="s2">one with it but what if what if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.999" end="00:12:33.689" style="s2">not the case that&#39;s just one theological</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.129" end="00:12:35.580" style="s2">perspective another theological</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.689" end="00:12:37.230" style="s2">perspective like say a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.580" end="00:12:39.269" style="s2">you know shamanic perspective or</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.230" end="00:12:40.680" style="s2">traditional Christian perspective might</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.269" end="00:12:42.000" style="s2">be that these these aren&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.680" end="00:12:45.920" style="s2">emanations your consciousness these are</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.000" end="00:12:50.279" style="s2">actual separate independent entities</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.920" end="00:12:51.990" style="s2">which could be malevolent it could be</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.279" end="00:12:53.579" style="s2">harmful to you and so you shouldn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.990" end="00:12:55.589" style="s2">towards them accept them and surrender</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.579" end="00:13:00.000" style="s2">them when it&#39;s the job of the Shaymin to</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.589" end="00:13:02.100" style="s2">defend you from them so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.000" end="00:13:03.990" style="s2">these are interesting I guess the point</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.100" end="00:13:05.399" style="s2">of this is is that you can&#39;t just you</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.990" end="00:13:09.540" style="s2">know this isn&#39;t just science this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.399" end="00:13:11.339" style="s2">also theology and metaphysics and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.540" end="00:13:15.420" style="s2">also just totally beyond our pay grade</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.339" end="00:13:16.980" style="s2">who the hell knows right I didn&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.550" end="00:14:05.250" style="s2">it&#39;s 20% that&#39;s a huge amount so you</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.550" end="00:14:06.899" style="s2">look at indigenous cultures and the you</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.250" end="00:14:12.000" style="s2">know the emphasis they put on the need</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.899" end="00:14:14.550" style="s2">for protection the need for spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.000" end="00:14:18.839" style="s2">prophylactics when you&#39;re when you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.550" end="00:14:20.130" style="s2">in you know opening yourself up I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.839" end="00:14:22.500" style="s2">know should we know about that should we</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.130" end="00:14:24.290" style="s2">think about that and I said this to</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.500" end="00:14:27.560" style="s2">Roland Griffiths you know the Leeds</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.290" end="00:14:31.350" style="s2">scientist I said what&#39;s your position on</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.560" end="00:14:34.260" style="s2">on entities do you believe in bad</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.350" end="00:14:36.750" style="s2">spirits do you think we need protection</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.260" end="00:14:39.899" style="s2">from bad spirits and he was like well I</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.750" end="00:14:42.240" style="s2">would just probably see them as I would</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.899" end="00:14:43.550" style="s2">not see that as a belief I would not</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.240" end="00:14:47.450" style="s2">encourage that belief</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.550" end="00:14:50.060" style="s2">you said but it&#39;s interesting weather I</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.450" end="00:14:52.070" style="s2">suppose let&#39;s say in the future we all</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.060" end="00:14:54.680" style="s2">have lots of different psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.070" end="00:14:56.959" style="s2">centers that we can go to that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.680" end="00:15:00.800" style="s2">happening right and each of those</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.959" end="00:15:03.079" style="s2">psychedelic centers will basically have</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.800" end="00:15:04.459" style="s2">a different model of the universe so</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.079" end="00:15:06.170" style="s2">you&#39;re not just gonna pick your drug</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.459" end="00:15:07.010" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna just gonna pick your</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.170" end="00:15:09.649" style="s2">Center you&#39;re going to pick your</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.010" end="00:15:12.560" style="s2">universe do you go to a universe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.649" end="00:15:14.000" style="s2">totally atheist where everything is just</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.560" end="00:15:15.709" style="s2">aspects of your imagination</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.000" end="00:15:17.480" style="s2">do you go to universe where there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.709" end="00:15:18.920" style="s2">good and bad spirits and that Center</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.480" end="00:15:20.839" style="s2">will help kind of protect you from the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.920" end="00:15:22.579" style="s2">bad spirits do you go to a universe</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.839" end="00:15:25.010" style="s2">which is Buddhist where all things are</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.579" end="00:15:26.899" style="s2">just emanations of pure consciousness so</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.010" end="00:15:29.779" style="s2">you know the old days we just had to</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.899" end="00:15:31.100" style="s2">pick our therapist but you know in 20</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.779" end="00:15:34.269" style="s2">years we&#39;ll be picking our universe</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.100" end="00:15:37.820" style="s2">picking our metaphysics yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.269" end="00:15:40.970" style="s2">so this is and that&#39;s interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.820" end="00:15:43.100" style="s2">it&#39;s I think it I suspect it&#39;ll go the</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.970" end="00:15:46.070" style="s2">way of you know the William James</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.100" end="00:15:49.339" style="s2">thought you know he was a pluralist that</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.070" end="00:15:50.510" style="s2">perhaps reality isn&#39;t one in he came up</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.339" end="00:15:53.060" style="s2">with the word multiverse</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.510" end="00:15:55.160" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna you know we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.060" end="00:15:57.740" style="s2">these multiple universes that we can we</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.160" end="00:15:59.990" style="s2">can visit in through different</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.740" end="00:16:02.600" style="s2">substances and through different rituals</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.990" end="00:16:04.399" style="s2">you know the cultural containers which</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.600" end="00:16:06.020" style="s2">send us off to these different places I</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.399" end="00:16:07.339" style="s2">have sort of similar experiences the</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.020" end="00:16:10.130" style="s2">psychedelics that started a bit later</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.339" end="00:16:11.480" style="s2">than you yeah but I also found some of</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.130" end="00:16:14.209" style="s2">those experiences quite difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.480" end="00:16:15.350" style="s2">integrate and I think one of the will</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.209" end="00:16:19.190" style="s2">probably come back to this but one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.350" end="00:16:22.010" style="s2">the dangers is the sort of limited</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.190" end="00:16:24.170" style="s2">personality the ego attaching to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.010" end="00:16:27.500" style="s2">spiritual experience and making it all</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.170" end="00:16:29.750" style="s2">about me that that that was a real one</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.500" end="00:16:30.920" style="s2">danger but the other thing that that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.750" end="00:16:32.990" style="s2">really noticed especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.920" end="00:16:35.089" style="s2">psychedelic community was it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.990" end="00:16:40.490" style="s2">community of people that are connected</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.089" end="00:16:41.990" style="s2">around the experience and my my personal</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.490" end="00:16:44.240" style="s2">view is that we have to learn to</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.990" end="00:16:46.730" style="s2">integrate the insights in a much more</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.240" end="00:16:49.339" style="s2">meaningful way and what often I found</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.730" end="00:16:52.579" style="s2">people doing was fetishizing the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.339" end="00:16:54.140" style="s2">experience fetishizing the state but not</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.579" end="00:16:54.889" style="s2">really doing any of the work to bring</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.140" end="00:16:56.869" style="s2">that into their</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.889" end="00:16:59.239" style="s2">lives and that&#39;s one of the risks of</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.869" end="00:17:02.089" style="s2">doing this outside of established</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.239" end="00:17:04.519" style="s2">spiritual traditions because when they</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.089" end="00:17:07.760" style="s2">work those traditions they provide lots</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.519" end="00:17:09.829" style="s2">of warning signs and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.760" end="00:17:12.409" style="s2">cultural container and an ethical</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.829" end="00:17:14.120" style="s2">container for these experiences and one</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.409" end="00:17:19.339" style="s2">of the things they warn about over and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.120" end="00:17:21.500" style="s2">over is the risk of pride and self</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.339" end="00:17:26.500" style="s2">cherishing when you have an ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.500" end="00:17:29.450" style="s2">experience because you know some Paul</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.500" end="00:17:31.039" style="s2">writes the letters to this community do</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.450" end="00:17:33.580" style="s2">you remember which book the call</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.039" end="00:17:35.990" style="s2">knowledge isn&#39;t great but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.580" end="00:17:40.549" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s a famous passage as always</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.990" end="00:17:41.960" style="s2">gets read out in weddings it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.549" end="00:17:44.149" style="s2">like if I speak with the tongues of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.960" end="00:17:46.970" style="s2">angels but I have not loved then I am</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.149" end="00:17:50.090" style="s2">about become a clashing cymbal or a</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.970" end="00:17:51.529" style="s2">clanging gong or something like that but</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.090" end="00:17:53.269" style="s2">basically it&#39;s writing to this community</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.529" end="00:17:56.450" style="s2">which is getting really into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.269" end="00:17:58.100" style="s2">ecstatic gifts they&#39;re speaking in</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.450" end="00:18:01.610" style="s2">tongues prophesying you know all these</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.100" end="00:18:03.169" style="s2">powers and these anything that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.610" end="00:18:05.539" style="s2">not the point if you&#39;re not doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.169" end="00:18:08.840" style="s2">anything to help people and serve people</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.539" end="00:18:11.870" style="s2">then you&#39;re just making a racket so that</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.840" end="00:18:13.549" style="s2">it sits and it&#39;s very easy if you you</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.870" end="00:18:15.679" style="s2">know have some slightly special</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.549" end="00:18:17.630" style="s2">experience to think I&#39;m special and</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.679" end="00:18:22.070" style="s2">therefore to get attached to it at every</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.630" end="00:18:26.240" style="s2">time or you can get held onto it and as</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.070" end="00:18:29.779" style="s2">soon as we do feel special often I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.240" end="00:18:32.269" style="s2">fear and anxiety can come in as well you</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.779" end="00:18:34.669" style="s2">know because the ego gets inflated</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.269" end="00:18:36.470" style="s2">massively identifies and holds onto the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.669" end="00:18:38.960" style="s2">experience so you have this experience</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.470" end="00:18:41.179" style="s2">of the divine you think I am divine I</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.960" end="00:18:43.940" style="s2">you know I&#39;m special I&#39;m really special</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.179" end="00:18:45.950" style="s2">and that can immediately I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.940" end="00:18:48.889" style="s2">you notice kind of flip into kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.950" end="00:18:50.059" style="s2">opposite of that which is paranoia and</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.889" end="00:18:54.169" style="s2">just fear</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.059" end="00:18:57.230" style="s2">so on this ayahuasca retreat I went on</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.169" end="00:19:00.230" style="s2">last year I had this moment where I</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.230" end="00:19:02.779" style="s2">suddenly thought I&#39;m psychic</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.230" end="00:19:04.399" style="s2">I I have I&#39;m special I&#39;ve got special</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.779" end="00:19:06.320" style="s2">psychic gifts this was in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.399" end="00:19:08.210" style="s2">a ceremony and almost immediately that</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.320" end="00:19:10.670" style="s2">flipped in that feeling of I&#39;m space</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.210" end="00:19:14.540" style="s2">so flipped into fear I thought what if I</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.670" end="00:19:16.190" style="s2">go crazy what if I can&#39;t handle that so</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.540" end="00:19:19.400" style="s2">I thought and I came across this phrase</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.190" end="00:19:22.280" style="s2">the trap of specialness so when we think</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.400" end="00:19:23.450" style="s2">I I&#39;m uniquely special in this gift that</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.280" end="00:19:25.190" style="s2">is a kind of trap</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.450" end="00:19:29.570" style="s2">which can very quickly lead to feelings</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.190" end="00:19:33.200" style="s2">of fear and ungrounded miss so the an</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.570" end="00:19:36.020" style="s2">state that is humility like laughing</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.200" end="00:19:38.540" style="s2">yourself I&#39;m not psychic I mean if I am</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.020" end="00:19:41.480" style="s2">I&#39;m so minor you&#39;re gonna say I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.540" end="00:19:43.130" style="s2">my Lily psychic I mean like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.480" end="00:19:45.440" style="s2">everyone&#39;s got you know some good but</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.130" end="00:19:46.640" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m you know it&#39;s just like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.440" end="00:19:48.860" style="s2">antidote for that is I&#39;m not that</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.640" end="00:19:52.070" style="s2">special just laugh at yourself love your</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.860" end="00:19:54.200" style="s2">egos kind of games and humility you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.070" end="00:19:57.170" style="s2">comes from the word whom us for that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.200" end="00:19:59.420" style="s2">grounding like yes you&#39;re the divine</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.170" end="00:20:01.430" style="s2">someone&#39;s that says everyone else you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.420" end="00:20:02.840" style="s2">not you know more divine than anyone</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.430" end="00:20:05.690" style="s2">else which is something to be said for</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.840" end="00:20:07.550" style="s2">Christianity you know Christianity at</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.690" end="00:20:10.310" style="s2">the heart of Christianity that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.550" end="00:20:12.560" style="s2">even the symbolism of Jesus is don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.310" end="00:20:14.770" style="s2">to above yourself yeah and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.560" end="00:20:17.000" style="s2">there&#39;s also something that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.770" end="00:20:19.840" style="s2">increasingly come to appreciate about</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.000" end="00:20:22.520" style="s2">the sense of dying to oneself</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.840" end="00:20:24.560" style="s2">sacrificing who one is and in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.520" end="00:20:26.780" style="s2">sacrificing the ego to become who one</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.560" end="00:20:29.480" style="s2">really is I think is part of the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.780" end="00:20:32.300" style="s2">symbolism of Christianity yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.480" end="00:20:34.610" style="s2">like the idea of the more you can get</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.300" end="00:20:36.620" style="s2">yourself out the way the moon the more</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.610" end="00:20:38.390" style="s2">amazing things you can do or your ego</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.620" end="00:20:43.760" style="s2">out of the way if you know that we have</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.390" end="00:20:45.410" style="s2">the Tao or the divine in us and that can</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.760" end="00:20:48.680" style="s2">do incredible things more than we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.410" end="00:20:52.460" style="s2">imagine if we can get our shadow out of</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.680" end="00:20:55.490" style="s2">the way our smaller self it&#39;s it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.460" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">of it&#39;s actually limiting us in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.490" end="00:21:00.890" style="s2">what we can do our desire to get the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:03.740" style="s2">credit for it and the glory for it what</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.890" end="00:21:08.810" style="s2">do you make of Stan Grof because he he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.740" end="00:21:11.270" style="s2">been one of the big forces of this he</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.810" end="00:21:13.490" style="s2">talked back in the the 60s about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.270" end="00:21:16.520" style="s2">need for a psychology of the future that</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.490" end="00:21:18.200" style="s2">incorporated ecstatic experience and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.520" end="00:21:18.930" style="s2">net and the possibility of healing</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.200" end="00:21:22.050" style="s2">through ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.930" end="00:21:24.600" style="s2">experience and I guess his framing of</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.050" end="00:21:28.560" style="s2">exotic experience is that it&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.600" end="00:21:31.470" style="s2">these experiences can help us heal or</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.560" end="00:21:33.540" style="s2">can bring us to more complete what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.470" end="00:21:37.140" style="s2">takes a more complete wholeness I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.540" end="00:21:40.020" style="s2">he&#39;s a he&#39;s a master</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.140" end="00:21:42.780" style="s2">I wish transpersonal psychology he must</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.020" end="00:21:44.820" style="s2">be probably one of the top three top</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.780" end="00:21:47.090" style="s2">five thinkers in transpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.820" end="00:21:50.190" style="s2">psychology and I think that field</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.090" end="00:21:51.990" style="s2">deserves to be far more mainstream and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.190" end="00:21:57.330" style="s2">think it is becoming more mainstream at</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.990" end="00:21:59.160" style="s2">the moment I I mean I think his ideas</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.330" end="00:22:04.970" style="s2">his and his wife&#39;s ideas about spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.160" end="00:22:07.110" style="s2">emergencies key and I think his 1980</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.970" end="00:22:09.960" style="s2">anthology that he edited with his wife</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.110" end="00:22:12.960" style="s2">called spiritual emergency is a classic</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.960" end="00:22:17.370" style="s2">work I&#39;ve never tried holotropic</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.960" end="00:22:19.350" style="s2">breathwork but I want to I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.370" end="00:22:21.300" style="s2">fascinating that you can get into kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.350" end="00:22:26.610" style="s2">of psychedelic states through through</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.300" end="00:22:28.380" style="s2">breathing techniques and I&#39;m I&#39;m told it</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.610" end="00:22:30.420" style="s2">can be a way to access like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.380" end="00:22:35.820" style="s2">experience but it&#39;s a bit less risky</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.420" end="00:22:36.990" style="s2">than drinking a lot of ayahuasca so much</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.820" end="00:22:39.120" style="s2">I know you can come down when you stop</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.990" end="00:22:41.670" style="s2">basically because that&#39;s right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:45.660" style="s2">yeah my therapist after this Rakhi</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.670" end="00:22:49.200" style="s2">ayahuasca experience I had last year she</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.660" end="00:22:50.190" style="s2">kind of said to me next you&#39;re next it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.200" end="00:22:52.620" style="s2">like no experience should be through</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.190" end="00:22:59.280" style="s2">holotropic breathwork just so you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.620" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">ease into it so you know i i&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.280" end="00:23:03.120" style="s2">some of the interviews he&#39;s given I</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:04.380" style="s2">heard his interview he did with I saw</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.120" end="00:23:05.580" style="s2">your excellent interview with him and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.380" end="00:23:10.530" style="s2">saw I heard his interview with Tim</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.580" end="00:23:13.020" style="s2">Ferriss and the one thing that struck me</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.530" end="00:23:14.850" style="s2">is when I listened to him and like when</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.020" end="00:23:17.100" style="s2">I listen to Rick Doblin of maps and</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.850" end="00:23:17.850" style="s2">various other people in the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.100" end="00:23:23.970" style="s2">Renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.850" end="00:23:25.170" style="s2">I think they they&#39;re real optimists in</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.970" end="00:23:27.670" style="s2">kind of utopians</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.170" end="00:23:30.310" style="s2">about how</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.670" end="00:23:32.680" style="s2">if we have a society where you know the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.310" end="00:23:37.750" style="s2">psychedelic non-dual experience is at</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.680" end="00:23:41.110" style="s2">the center we will then overcome all</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.750" end="00:23:46.150" style="s2">kinds of problems like the demonization</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.110" end="00:23:49.600" style="s2">of the other polarization fundamentalism</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.150" end="00:23:51.130" style="s2">and so on that it&#39;ll be a magic</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.600" end="00:23:52.540" style="s2">transformation because we will all have</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.130" end="00:23:54.070" style="s2">these non jet experiences therefore</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.540" end="00:24:00.040" style="s2">there will no longer be me and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.070" end="00:24:01.540" style="s2">they&#39;ll no longer be us and them and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.040" end="00:24:05.140" style="s2">know so that&#39;s really there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.540" end="00:24:07.840" style="s2">political aspiration a whole political</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.140" end="00:24:09.580" style="s2">plan with with with them and in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.840" end="00:24:14.590" style="s2">people in this like the Renaissance and</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.580" end="00:24:20.290" style="s2">my I just don&#39;t think as clear-cut as</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.590" end="00:24:21.670" style="s2">that my one-word response to that or one</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.290" end="00:24:26.230" style="s2">sentence response would be like what</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.670" end="00:24:27.760" style="s2">about the Aztecs that that is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.230" end="00:24:29.620" style="s2">culture we know because we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.760" end="00:24:31.540" style="s2">many precedents of cultures where there</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.620" end="00:24:31.870" style="s2">was a psychedelic ritual at the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.540" end="00:24:35.950" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.870" end="00:24:38.740" style="s2">so the Aztecs had a psychedelic ritual</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.950" end="00:24:41.410" style="s2">you know they they we know they all did</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.740" end="00:24:46.720" style="s2">magic mushrooms and yeah this these were</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.410" end="00:24:50.620" style="s2">not wonderful tolerant liberals they</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.720" end="00:24:52.630" style="s2">were completely warlike tribe they the</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.620" end="00:24:54.610" style="s2">reason the Spanish conquered them so</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.630" end="00:24:56.260" style="s2">easily with just a thousand soldiers is</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.610" end="00:24:59.740" style="s2">because all their neighbors hated them</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.260" end="00:25:01.270" style="s2">because they would constantly raid their</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.740" end="00:25:03.190" style="s2">neighbors who they thought were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.270" end="00:25:05.890" style="s2">socially and ethnically inferior to them</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.190" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">grab them take them up to their tower</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.890" end="00:25:13.060" style="s2">and and pull out their hearts and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:15.640" style="s2">you know take off their skins and wear</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.060" end="00:25:19.510" style="s2">their skins so the hippies would look</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.640" end="00:25:21.130" style="s2">kind of tolerant liberals so I just you</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.510" end="00:25:22.570" style="s2">know what sort of Charles Manson and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.130" end="00:25:25.870" style="s2">John Lennon let&#39;s put it that way yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.570" end="00:25:28.180" style="s2">yeah so the idea that you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.870" end="00:25:30.190" style="s2">magic pill that&#39;s going to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.180" end="00:25:34.000" style="s2">that&#39;s going to completely cleanse the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.190" end="00:25:36.610" style="s2">human heart of all its problems</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.000" end="00:25:38.799" style="s2">and well this is just this is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.610" end="00:25:40.419" style="s2">president we have so you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.799" end="00:25:42.970" style="s2">very small database of psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.419" end="00:25:45.279" style="s2">societies one of them was this was this</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.970" end="00:25:49.840" style="s2">awful I mean I&#39;m not to say was all</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.279" end="00:25:54.490" style="s2">awful but it certainly wasn&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.840" end="00:25:56.230" style="s2">completely pacifist so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.490" end="00:25:59.289" style="s2">that&#39;s one issue I have with with</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.230" end="00:26:01.390" style="s2">snapple that&#39;s also the lesson I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.289" end="00:26:02.580" style="s2">both of us where it&#39;s certainly in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.390" end="00:26:04.690" style="s2">middle of a psychedelic Renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.580" end="00:26:08.380" style="s2">Michael Pollan&#39;s book was a real</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.690" end="00:26:10.120" style="s2">game-changer and there&#39;s a restarting of</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.380" end="00:26:12.159" style="s2">psychedelic research it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.120" end="00:26:14.649" style="s2">underway and I think both of us have</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.159" end="00:26:16.090" style="s2">this sense of let&#39;s look at what went</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.649" end="00:26:17.620" style="s2">wrong in the 60s let&#39;s look at what</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.090" end="00:26:20.890" style="s2">happened when he had this huge</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.620" end="00:26:22.360" style="s2">exuberance that ignored the shadow yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.890" end="00:26:24.070" style="s2">and I think this is this is something</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.360" end="00:26:27.070" style="s2">that we really struggle with as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.070" end="00:26:28.990" style="s2">culture to hold the complexity of yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.070" end="00:26:30.549" style="s2">this is a really can be a really</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.990" end="00:26:32.529" style="s2">positive thing but there&#39;s also a dark</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.549" end="00:26:33.700" style="s2">side to it yeah so the the dual nature</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.529" end="00:26:36.250" style="s2">of the experience</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.700" end="00:26:38.020" style="s2">yeah because it seems I mean I may be</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.250" end="00:26:39.360" style="s2">said it&#39;s likely flippantly but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.020" end="00:26:42.190" style="s2">why Charles Manson was such a</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.360" end="00:26:44.440" style="s2">significant moment in the 60s was this</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.190" end="00:26:45.760" style="s2">was basically an LSD cult that then</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.440" end="00:26:48.039" style="s2">decided that the thing that they needed</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.760" end="00:26:50.830" style="s2">to do to cleanse the world of of evil</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.039" end="00:26:54.159" style="s2">was to launch a war starting with</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.830" end="00:26:55.899" style="s2">Hollywood stars and this this happens</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.159" end="00:26:58.630" style="s2">time and time again when the ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.899" end="00:27:01.210" style="s2">experience is made the centerpiece of of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.630" end="00:27:03.820" style="s2">any culture yeah and I&#39;m sure you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.210" end="00:27:08.070" style="s2">many more examples of that as well</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.820" end="00:27:10.480" style="s2">yeah I think it is possible to have an a</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.070" end="00:27:13.750" style="s2">cultural container for psychedelics that</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.480" end="00:27:17.820" style="s2">doesn&#39;t involve human sacrifice we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.750" end="00:27:20.350" style="s2">got a hope it is and and growth and</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.820" end="00:27:23.440" style="s2">Hoffman and others got very into the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.350" end="00:27:26.020" style="s2">Eleusinian mysteries and they called for</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.440" end="00:27:29.100" style="s2">a new alesis the Eleusinian mysteries</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.020" end="00:27:33.899" style="s2">were this ancient Greek ritual which</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.100" end="00:27:36.820" style="s2">existed for thousands of years I believe</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.899" end="00:27:39.159" style="s2">yeah I mean I think it was a real center</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.820" end="00:27:40.590" style="s2">point of Greece that along with in</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.159" end="00:27:42.419" style="s2">Christianity&#39;s last</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.590" end="00:27:46.919" style="s2">I think it lasted for like over two</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.419" end="00:27:48.660" style="s2">millennia and people would go there from</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.919" end="00:27:51.720" style="s2">all over Greece and they would drink a</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.660" end="00:27:54.809" style="s2">potion and then have this experience of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.720" end="00:27:58.230" style="s2">death and rebirth and if you compare the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.809" end="00:27:59.700" style="s2">accounts of participants in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.230" end="00:28:00.960" style="s2">Eleusinian mysteries like they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.700" end="00:28:03.030" style="s2">talk about it much because it was secret</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.960" end="00:28:05.549" style="s2">but Plutarch who was a priest there</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.030" end="00:28:07.169" style="s2">wrote about it bit and it&#39;s very similar</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.549" end="00:28:10.049" style="s2">to accounts of people on psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.169" end="00:28:12.150" style="s2">they talk about this first stage of</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.049" end="00:28:14.220" style="s2">shivering and shaking and disorientation</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.150" end="00:28:19.080" style="s2">and fear and darkness and then an</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.220" end="00:28:22.500" style="s2">emergence into light and euphoria and it</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.080" end="00:28:24.000" style="s2">was very central to their politics and</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.500" end="00:28:25.830" style="s2">it helped to give them a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.000" end="00:28:27.480" style="s2">togetherness all these different Greek</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.830" end="00:28:29.610" style="s2">tribes who might be at war with each</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.480" end="00:28:31.470" style="s2">other but for that period they would</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.610" end="00:28:33.450" style="s2">they would kind of declare peace and go</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.470" end="00:28:33.900" style="s2">and celebrate their togetherness</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.450" end="00:28:38.280" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.900" end="00:28:41.640" style="s2">I think psychedelics do have a role to</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.280" end="00:28:46.890" style="s2">play at the moment in helping us I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.640" end="00:28:49.289" style="s2">it probably will be a bit messy but the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.890" end="00:28:54.659" style="s2">issue is that we&#39;ve become so conscious</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.289" end="00:28:59.460" style="s2">so self conscious so conceptual so kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.659" end="00:29:04.200" style="s2">of closed to what&#39;s below the surface in</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.460" end="00:29:09.600" style="s2">us that we kind of need dynamite as</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.200" end="00:29:15.120" style="s2">Westerners to to get beyond that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.600" end="00:29:18.600" style="s2">kind of you know that modern ego and to</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.120" end="00:29:20.640" style="s2">get beyond our materialism we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.600" end="00:29:22.409" style="s2">very stuck in this in this materialist</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.640" end="00:29:26.100" style="s2">worldview of the sense of the stolidity</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.409" end="00:29:28.380" style="s2">of ourselves and of everything around us</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.100" end="00:29:29.940" style="s2">and this is me and I&#39;m this you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.380" end="00:29:32.549" style="s2">this is the table and it&#39;s all very kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.940" end="00:29:35.010" style="s2">of separate that&#39;s so very reminiscent</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.549" end="00:29:36.840" style="s2">to the McGilchrist talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.010" end="00:29:38.700" style="s2">left brain and the right brain yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.840" end="00:29:42.539" style="s2">left brain is sort of this atomistic</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.700" end="00:29:44.850" style="s2">reductionistic tool and the right brain</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.539" end="00:29:46.799" style="s2">is is what we&#39;ve steadily kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.850" end="00:29:48.179" style="s2">shunted out of Western culture that has</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.799" end="00:29:50.580" style="s2">an appreciation of the holistic</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.179" end="00:29:53.249" style="s2">can the inter-relational and yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.580" end="00:29:55.440" style="s2">the mystery now I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.249" end="00:29:59.009" style="s2">right that this is you know connected to</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.440" end="00:30:01.919" style="s2">physical changes in our brain I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.009" end="00:30:03.899" style="s2">know I totally agree with him on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.919" end="00:30:05.580" style="s2">experience level and I just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.899" end="00:30:10.619" style="s2">if I if he&#39;s right or not on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.580" end="00:30:12.869" style="s2">physical level but so and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.619" end="00:30:17.070" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re disconnected from my own</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.869" end="00:30:21.600" style="s2">emotions as well from our own are from</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.070" end="00:30:23.789" style="s2">our feelings will become hyper</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.600" end="00:30:25.139" style="s2">conceptual I think McGilchrist says this</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.789" end="00:30:28.369" style="s2">kind of thing I see it particularly in</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.139" end="00:30:28.369" style="s2">academia as well</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.639" end="00:30:34.590" style="s2">therefore we you know we do need</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.590" end="00:30:38.129" style="s2">sometimes this radical surgery just to</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.590" end="00:30:39.659" style="s2">get us out of our heads but I know for</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.129" end="00:30:41.610" style="s2">personal experience that you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.659" end="00:30:44.009" style="s2">psychedelics really is radical surgery I</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.610" end="00:30:50.629" style="s2">mean it can be messy as well it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.009" end="00:30:53.369" style="s2">it&#39;s a blast but I think it&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.629" end="00:30:56.429" style="s2">because because I think otherwise we are</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.369" end="00:30:58.919" style="s2">quite stuck in our egos and in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.429" end="00:31:00.550" style="s2">sense of the solidity of everyday</p>
