<p begin="00:00:55.719" end="00:01:02.350" style="s2">like to invite Chris back and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.690" end="00:01:04.210" style="s2">going to talk more about the symptom</p>

<p begin="00:01:09.610" end="00:01:13.930" style="s2">part of the book that we&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.840" end="00:01:15.660" style="s2">working on unsheltered which is the book</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.930" end="00:01:18.220" style="s2">that is going to be the follow-up to</p>

<p begin="00:01:19.720" end="00:01:26.920" style="s2">it&#39;s good to have you here again and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.619" end="00:01:29.229" style="s2">what I&#39;d like to do is write typically</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.920" end="00:01:31.780" style="s2">what&#39;s often happened is I&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.229" end="00:01:33.880" style="s2">various you know things that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.780" end="00:01:35.920" style="s2">symptomatic of the meaning crisis and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.880" end="00:01:37.150" style="s2">tend to do this in something I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.920" end="00:01:38.380" style="s2">like doing in general because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.150" end="00:01:40.450" style="s2">argued against it I&#39;m just sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.380" end="00:01:43.600" style="s2">featureless I do I do this I do this in</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.450" end="00:01:46.270" style="s2">interviews right and and what I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.600" end="00:01:49.450" style="s2">to do now is is try and create a more</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.270" end="00:01:51.460" style="s2">schematic organization and try and give</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.450" end="00:01:54.299" style="s2">them a much more coherent and convergent</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.460" end="00:01:58.450" style="s2">argument that also I think is</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.299" end="00:02:01.840" style="s2">explanatory of the symptom ology of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.450" end="00:02:04.780" style="s2">meaning crisis and so I think what we</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.840" end="00:02:09.190" style="s2">might want to do is begin with like</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.780" end="00:02:11.049" style="s2">laying out sort of the the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.190" end="00:02:12.910" style="s2">principles were using that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.049" end="00:02:16.390" style="s2">to be making the organizing principles</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.910" end="00:02:19.180" style="s2">by which we&#39;re going to try and lay out</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.390" end="00:02:23.319" style="s2">and schematize the symptom ology of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.180" end="00:02:24.610" style="s2">meaning crisis so yeah okay so I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.319" end="00:02:27.130" style="s2">we should probably begin by saying that</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.610" end="00:02:29.200" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve this</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.130" end="00:02:32.290" style="s2">- metallic the symptomology rap is so</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.200" end="00:02:34.060" style="s2">complex and so very yeah that can</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.290" end="00:02:36.370" style="s2">centering it into any kind of proper</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.060" end="00:02:40.090" style="s2">structures it&#39;s taxed very very it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.370" end="00:02:41.200" style="s2">task right and and so there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.090" end="00:02:42.610" style="s2">ways that perhaps we could have got</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.200" end="00:02:43.930" style="s2">about organizing it but I think the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.610" end="00:02:46.450" style="s2">we opted for which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.930" end="00:02:49.210" style="s2">intuitively right for both of us is to</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.450" end="00:02:51.760" style="s2">understand the symptoms on a continual</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.210" end="00:02:53.350" style="s2">reaction and response and we&#39;re also not</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.760" end="00:02:55.270" style="s2">going to be right where we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.350" end="00:02:57.250" style="s2">gathering the symptoms into clusters</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.270" end="00:02:58.450" style="s2">that&#39;s right yeah yeah so this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.250" end="00:03:00.670" style="s2">gonna be a feature list it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.450" end="00:03:02.260" style="s2">symptom types right right and symptom</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.670" end="00:03:04.900" style="s2">types that are or ease of symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.260" end="00:03:06.910" style="s2">organized substantially similar right</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.900" end="00:03:09.010" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s right so I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.910" end="00:03:12.610" style="s2">that there the premise of our thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.010" end="00:03:15.250" style="s2">is that some categories of symptoms are</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.610" end="00:03:18.070" style="s2">best understood as instinctive and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.250" end="00:03:20.470" style="s2">largely unreflective reactions right to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.070" end="00:03:23.710" style="s2">the crisis right so stated visceral</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.470" end="00:03:30.790" style="s2">reactions to the crisis okay so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.710" end="00:03:31.720" style="s2">gonna begin all the way okay so this so</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.790" end="00:03:34.420" style="s2">you know what we should do we should</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.720" end="00:03:37.690" style="s2">just draw one big line okay draw one big</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.420" end="00:03:40.600" style="s2">one one big line right across here okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.690" end="00:03:42.940" style="s2">okay so the idea about this line is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.600" end="00:03:45.580" style="s2">reflect a continuum continuum continuum</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.940" end="00:03:48.250" style="s2">flows in this case from from left to</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.580" end="00:03:52.230" style="s2">right okay okay so on one side of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.250" end="00:03:55.210" style="s2">continuum we have one we&#39;re calling the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.230" end="00:03:57.640" style="s2">reaction right which is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.210" end="00:04:00.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve just described right an instinctive</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.640" end="00:04:04.030" style="s2">largely visceral often impulsive often</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.940" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">impulsive was about see responses are</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.030" end="00:04:11.170" style="s2">response a kind of an almost em like</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:13.090" style="s2">almost reflexive yeah exactly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.170" end="00:04:14.860" style="s2">what I think I was cast not reflective</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.090" end="00:04:16.600" style="s2">but reflects reflexive that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.860" end="00:04:19.209" style="s2">that&#39;s right and that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.600" end="00:04:21.640" style="s2">trying to capture by that kind of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.209" end="00:04:23.170" style="s2">kind of unreflective sometimes conscious</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.640" end="00:04:28.750" style="s2">sometimes unconscious but unaware</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.170" end="00:04:30.220" style="s2">responds and then we have response</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.750" end="00:04:33.850" style="s2">proper and I think what we mean by</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.220" end="00:04:35.530" style="s2">response proper is there some agency in</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.850" end="00:04:39.150" style="s2">this there&#39;s some directedness to it</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.530" end="00:04:40.930" style="s2">that&#39;s right and even if even if the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.150" end="00:04:43.150" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.930" end="00:04:46.360" style="s2">perhaps internalizing the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.150" end="00:04:51.040" style="s2">hasn&#39;t fully framed or construed it</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.360" end="00:04:54.820" style="s2">right hasn&#39;t conceptualized it the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.040" end="00:04:59.110" style="s2">effect is quite conscious and quite but</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.820" end="00:05:03.430" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s pronounced enough to</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.110" end="00:05:05.500" style="s2">elicit a conscious sort of directed</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.430" end="00:05:07.720" style="s2">attention there&#39;s some aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.500" end="00:05:10.150" style="s2">deliberation to this yes okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.720" end="00:05:14.770" style="s2">right another on the far end we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.150" end="00:05:22.420" style="s2">what we&#39;re calling a reflective response</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.770" end="00:05:24.370" style="s2">right and this means that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.420" end="00:05:26.290" style="s2">understanding the affliction of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.370" end="00:05:28.870" style="s2">meaning crisis obviously in terms of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.290" end="00:05:30.970" style="s2">certain amount of suffering and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.870" end="00:05:33.120" style="s2">reflective response is one in which the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.970" end="00:05:34.890" style="s2">individual there&#39;s an attempt to find</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.120" end="00:05:37.840" style="s2">identifying with their own suffering</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.890" end="00:05:39.640" style="s2">also identifies it with some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.840" end="00:05:42.130" style="s2">communal subject so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.640" end="00:05:45.640" style="s2">isn&#39;t just happening to me this is this</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.130" end="00:05:47.560" style="s2">is a condition that is felt also in and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.640" end="00:05:50.380" style="s2">around so to two aspects here it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.560" end="00:05:52.660" style="s2">just the ego centrism of pain there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.380" end="00:05:55.300" style="s2">attempt to connect out and there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.660" end="00:05:58.420" style="s2">an attempt to ameliorate to address</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.300" end="00:06:00.010" style="s2">right right and some fashion right so in</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.420" end="00:06:01.840" style="s2">an organized fashion which I like is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.010" end="00:06:06.430" style="s2">difference right this kind of response</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.840" end="00:06:08.740" style="s2">is often unorganized right or if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.430" end="00:06:12.570" style="s2">organized it can sort of accidentally</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.740" end="00:06:14.740" style="s2">organized it&#39;s often spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.570" end="00:06:16.840" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna be talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.740" end="00:06:18.940" style="s2">this I think is this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.840" end="00:06:20.020" style="s2">unorganized spontaneous is a better way</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.940" end="00:06:22.240" style="s2">of thinking about it because it could be</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.020" end="00:06:23.710" style="s2">very organized spontaneous is a good way</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.240" end="00:06:25.420" style="s2">of thinking about response right this</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.710" end="00:06:27.790" style="s2">could be spontaneous too but insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.420" end="00:06:30.840" style="s2">this has a certain amount of this can be</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.790" end="00:06:35.950" style="s2">this can be concerted but it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.840" end="00:06:37.960" style="s2">concerted with a with a finally</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.950" end="00:06:40.750" style="s2">diagnosed understanding of the patient</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.960" end="00:06:42.460" style="s2">right so it&#39;s more that category so in</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.750" end="00:06:44.290" style="s2">earlier versions of this argument I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.460" end="00:06:46.300" style="s2">often talking about negative and</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.290" end="00:06:48.430" style="s2">positive responses to the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.300" end="00:06:50.170" style="s2">I think what we&#39;re doing here is is is</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.430" end="00:06:52.510" style="s2">much better and like I said because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.170" end="00:06:54.340" style="s2">gonna schema ties as opposed to just</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.510" end="00:06:54.820" style="s2">simply contrast whereas the negative</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.340" end="00:06:57.820" style="s2">worse</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.820" end="00:06:59.050" style="s2">to be you know things like suicide and</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.820" end="00:07:00.610" style="s2">mental health and the positive where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.050" end="00:07:01.780" style="s2">going to be things like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.610" end="00:07:04.150" style="s2">mindfulness revolution of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.780" end="00:07:05.680" style="s2">psychedelic revolution and but now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.150" end="00:07:06.730" style="s2">gonna take that we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:07.870" style="s2">improving on that we&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.730" end="00:07:09.400" style="s2">something better something you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.870" end="00:07:11.140" style="s2">developed right because that&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.400" end="00:07:13.540" style="s2">right because some especially this</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.140" end="00:07:15.250" style="s2">middle category as we&#39;ll find you know a</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.540" end="00:07:18.280" style="s2">lot of responses that are spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.250" end="00:07:19.690" style="s2">they might not be as reflective as you</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.280" end="00:07:22.810" style="s2">know something like the mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.690" end="00:07:24.460" style="s2">revolution right but even though they</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.810" end="00:07:27.220" style="s2">might be insufficient they might have</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.460" end="00:07:28.660" style="s2">some productive value right so yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.220" end="00:07:31.060" style="s2">negative positive economy doesn&#39;t play</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.660" end="00:07:32.980" style="s2">it&#39;s too simplistic I get that I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.060" end="00:07:35.950" style="s2">that&#39;s an important criticism right okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.980" end="00:07:41.410" style="s2">so so we want to start at the far end</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.950" end="00:07:44.770" style="s2">here and I think that the and the first</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.410" end="00:07:48.250" style="s2">one and certainly most and this goes</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.770" end="00:07:51.010" style="s2">back like sub one is suicide right right</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.250" end="00:07:53.410" style="s2">so we actually have this divided into</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.010" end="00:07:58.420" style="s2">two I&#39;ll talk a little bit about them in</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.410" end="00:08:06.000" style="s2">terms of nodal we&#39;re calling the pure</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.420" end="00:08:06.000" style="s2">suicide no moral evaluation there right</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.310" end="00:08:15.790" style="s2">and then the the one that&#39;s mediated</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.020" end="00:08:19.780" style="s2">through depression yeah okay so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.790" end="00:08:21.700" style="s2">talk a little bit about this two central</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.780" end="00:08:24.940" style="s2">ideas here this goes to some important</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.700" end="00:08:26.740" style="s2">recent work by psychologist who&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.940" end="00:08:29.140" style="s2">some of the best psychological work on</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.740" end="00:08:33.580" style="s2">issues of meeting crisis this is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.140" end="00:08:36.990" style="s2">work of touching yes now and and she has</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.580" end="00:08:39.400" style="s2">the shown recent research showing that</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.990" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">contrary to what you might think right</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.400" end="00:08:46.390" style="s2">that what happens in suicide is that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:48.340" style="s2">know it&#39;s because people are suffering</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.390" end="00:08:50.800" style="s2">clinical depression that they find</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.340" end="00:08:52.540" style="s2">things meaningless and therefore that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.800" end="00:08:55.420" style="s2">why they commit suicide now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.540" end="00:08:57.250" style="s2">important to understand how much meaning</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.420" end="00:08:59.560" style="s2">in life is a protective against suicide</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.250" end="00:09:01.720" style="s2">and the fact that right although</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.560" end="00:09:03.550" style="s2">globally suicide is going down it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.720" end="00:09:07.870" style="s2">going up in North America it&#39;s going up</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.550" end="00:09:08.560" style="s2">for young people worldwide child suicide</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.870" end="00:09:10.420" style="s2">in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.560" end="00:09:12.130" style="s2">just recently doubled in something in</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.420" end="00:09:14.200" style="s2">like in the last five years all this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.130" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">very telling but what&#39;s important is</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.200" end="00:09:21.370" style="s2">that&#39;s actually mixing two things up she</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.160" end="00:09:24.160" style="s2">has evidence that the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.370" end="00:09:26.410" style="s2">meaningless in and of itself without it</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.160" end="00:09:28.870" style="s2">overlapping or causing what we now</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.410" end="00:09:30.850" style="s2">identify as clinical depression right</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.870" end="00:09:33.339" style="s2">the experience of meaninglessness in and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.850" end="00:09:38.310" style="s2">of itself can be a cause of suicide</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.339" end="00:09:41.620" style="s2">now of course depression yeah yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.310" end="00:09:43.029" style="s2">trying to pick up on that now depression</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.620" end="00:09:44.740" style="s2">carries within it a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.029" end="00:09:46.600" style="s2">meaninglessness but what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.740" end="00:09:48.580" style="s2">is and of course there&#39;s other things</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.600" end="00:09:50.980" style="s2">that probably contribute towards the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.580" end="00:09:52.180" style="s2">suicide from depression and I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.980" end="00:09:54.130" style="s2">to claim that it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.180" end="00:09:57.339" style="s2">meaninglessness but what there is is</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.130" end="00:10:01.300" style="s2">clear evidence of the meaninglessness</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.339" end="00:10:03.339" style="s2">per se being able to cause suicide and</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.300" end="00:10:06.700" style="s2">therefore that&#39;s an important piece of</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.339" end="00:10:10.779" style="s2">evidence for right the emergence the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.700" end="00:10:14.320" style="s2">increasing presence or lack of presence</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.779" end="00:10:16.210" style="s2">of the meaning crisis yes yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.320" end="00:10:20.620" style="s2">vacuous present yes there&#39;s a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.210" end="00:10:24.250" style="s2">yeah yeah okay so I move to the next one</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.620" end="00:10:27.990" style="s2">yes this sort of feeds laterally right</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.250" end="00:10:31.270" style="s2">into the next category in that and</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.990" end="00:10:34.510" style="s2">that&#39;s just more generally the mental</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.270" end="00:10:38.830" style="s2">health mental crisis it is that more</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.510" end="00:10:40.660" style="s2">specifically mental health crisis and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.830" end="00:10:42.370" style="s2">talked a little bit about this also in</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.660" end="00:10:46.589" style="s2">zombies in Western cultures right and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.370" end="00:10:49.410" style="s2">how what you got are increasing rates of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.589" end="00:10:52.060" style="s2">anxiety disorders depressive disorders</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.410" end="00:10:55.830" style="s2">increasing suicidal ideation amongst</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.060" end="00:10:59.830" style="s2">adolescent people and so this did the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.830" end="00:11:01.810" style="s2">anxiety and the and the depressive</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.830" end="00:11:04.810" style="s2">disorders of course overlaps with some</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.810" end="00:11:07.120" style="s2">of the other aspects of this right so</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.810" end="00:11:13.360" style="s2">this is why we&#39;re trying to get the idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.120" end="00:11:15.820" style="s2">of a continuum right but the point</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.360" end="00:11:18.280" style="s2">nevertheless is that things like</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.820" end="00:11:21.130" style="s2">depression of course clearly point to</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.280" end="00:11:22.300" style="s2">this anxiety also points to important</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.130" end="00:11:23.770" style="s2">ways in which we</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.300" end="00:11:28.480" style="s2">fundamentally disconnected from</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.770" end="00:11:31.840" style="s2">ourselves each other and and reality and</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.480" end="00:11:34.540" style="s2">important ways so I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.840" end="00:11:36.670" style="s2">clear that that&#39;s also it overlaps with</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.540" end="00:11:40.390" style="s2">this it&#39;s a distinct category but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.670" end="00:11:43.270" style="s2">also pointing towards the effects of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.390" end="00:11:47.560" style="s2">meeting crisis on people please continue</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.270" end="00:11:49.690" style="s2">okay and again further along this</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.560" end="00:11:53.980" style="s2">continuum but very much related to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.690" end="00:12:01.090" style="s2">two previous categories raised there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.980" end="00:12:02.610" style="s2">an Ian there&#39;s an e in there right so</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.090" end="00:12:05.020" style="s2">the increase in loneliness</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.610" end="00:12:07.090" style="s2">yeah the increase in the lead which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.020" end="00:12:08.950" style="s2">exacerbate about social media in many it</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.090" end="00:12:10.960" style="s2">is exacerbated not caused I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.950" end="00:12:12.790" style="s2">but definitely exacerbated by social</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.960" end="00:12:16.060" style="s2">media it&#39;s interesting that we talked in</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.790" end="00:12:18.730" style="s2">our previous video or made mention of</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.060" end="00:12:20.350" style="s2">this idea atomization of time all right</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.730" end="00:12:22.930" style="s2">they&#39;re arguably the same phenomenon has</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.350" end="00:12:25.240" style="s2">happened with spatially right the way</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.930" end="00:12:29.070" style="s2">that we live right we actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.240" end="00:12:31.270" style="s2">live as communally as perhaps we used to</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.070" end="00:12:33.610" style="s2">spatially and physically were much more</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.270" end="00:12:35.320" style="s2">distanced from one another and yes the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.610" end="00:12:37.690" style="s2">social media that sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.320" end="00:12:40.510" style="s2">compartmentalization of social life and</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.690" end="00:12:42.580" style="s2">the digitization of social life mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.510" end="00:12:46.120" style="s2">certainly adds to that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.580" end="00:12:47.950" style="s2">isolation right sort of they Co hearing</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.120" end="00:12:49.630" style="s2">effective communities is diminished</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.950" end="00:12:52.920" style="s2">secret right so this is definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.630" end="00:12:55.930" style="s2">loss of communication so yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.920" end="00:12:58.180" style="s2">and this goes towards air starts idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.930" end="00:13:02.290" style="s2">about how the West really lost God so</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.180" end="00:13:06.730" style="s2">her argument is that what has actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.290" end="00:13:08.050" style="s2">led towards atheism nihilism I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.730" end="00:13:09.790" style="s2">it as a comprehensive account I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.050" end="00:13:11.170" style="s2">saying but she&#39;s got a very important</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.790" end="00:13:12.880" style="s2">point that the countries that are the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.170" end="00:13:14.770" style="s2">most secular the countries that are the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:16.960" style="s2">least religious are also the countries</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.770" end="00:13:19.900" style="s2">in which people live atomically in which</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.960" end="00:13:22.300" style="s2">they tend to live the most alone and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.900" end="00:13:23.710" style="s2">she argues that what happened one of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.300" end="00:13:25.540" style="s2">things the Industrial Revolution is done</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.710" end="00:13:28.270" style="s2">and then of course it&#39;s been exhaustive</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.540" end="00:13:30.160" style="s2">aided by social media and the car and</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.270" end="00:13:32.740" style="s2">all kinds of things is this atomization</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.160" end="00:13:35.410" style="s2">that Han talks about is that we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.740" end="00:13:35.860" style="s2">live more and more alone and that is of</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.410" end="00:13:37.810" style="s2">course been</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.860" end="00:13:40.390" style="s2">reinforced by mythology of us being</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.810" end="00:13:42.490" style="s2">rugged individuals and all this I would</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.390" end="00:13:45.640" style="s2">call it in some very important</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.490" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">ways and so and the idea is as we lose</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.640" end="00:13:52.360" style="s2">as we lose this connectivity to other</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.839" end="00:13:55.810" style="s2">people as we lose communitas as you said</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.360" end="00:13:58.060" style="s2">in the last episode what we lose is we</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.810" end="00:14:02.290" style="s2">lose the capacity to internalize other</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.060" end="00:14:03.880" style="s2">people other perspectives right the loss</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.290" end="00:14:07.420" style="s2">of fighty but I&#39;m also arguing it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:20:28.320" end="00:20:31.950" style="s2">the submit is right and the belief of</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.600" end="00:20:34.290" style="s2">that has to do with that proposition</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.950" end="00:20:38.070" style="s2">it&#39;s much much more an expression of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.290" end="00:20:39.840" style="s2">idolatry be exactly the inverse of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.070" end="00:20:43.260" style="s2">single so now we&#39;re moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.840" end="00:20:50.190" style="s2">response yes and we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.260" end="00:20:52.950" style="s2">make some room actually yeah okay so we</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.190" end="00:20:54.240" style="s2">talked about the loss of Pylea and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.950" end="00:20:55.620" style="s2">the perversion of eros we talked a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.240" end="00:20:56.970" style="s2">about that in the previous video so we</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.620" end="00:20:59.370" style="s2">don&#39;t need to go into all of that again</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.970" end="00:21:02.630" style="s2">one thing that all of this obviously</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.370" end="00:21:06.450" style="s2">tends to is the phenomenon of addiction</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.630" end="00:21:09.990" style="s2">okay so do we want to do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.450" end="00:21:11.610" style="s2">right let&#39;s do I&#39;m gonna pass this over</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.990" end="00:21:13.410" style="s2">to you because you&#39;re closer to that one</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.610" end="00:21:14.880" style="s2">right um let&#39;s do this one and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.410" end="00:21:16.800" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have to go back at me so</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.880" end="00:21:20.000" style="s2">I&#39;m what I&#39;m asking is do we want to put</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.800" end="00:21:21.960" style="s2">addiction this far to the right of</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.000" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">response or is it actually sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.960" end="00:21:27.420" style="s2">situation it should be here but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:29.250" style="s2">running out of space so I&#39;ll do this to</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.420" end="00:21:32.010" style="s2">indicate that I think that&#39;s right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.250" end="00:21:34.740" style="s2">not a response right but if there is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.010" end="00:21:38.940" style="s2">beginning of response so the idea here</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.740" end="00:21:42.060" style="s2">is that what&#39;s happening because of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.940" end="00:21:44.930" style="s2">undermining of the agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.060" end="00:21:48.270" style="s2">relationship we can see addiction</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.930" end="00:21:49.620" style="s2">increasing both because it overlaps with</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.270" end="00:21:51.450" style="s2">the attempt to escape which we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.620" end="00:21:54.510" style="s2">about momentarily but what we have here</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.450" end="00:21:57.330" style="s2">and here&#39;s what I&#39;m putting again Marc</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.510" end="00:22:03.480" style="s2">Lewis&#39;s idea of addiction is basically</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.330" end="00:22:05.340" style="s2">anti right and agog a right and this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.480" end="00:22:11.460" style="s2">the idea of addiction as reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.340" end="00:22:14.160" style="s2">narrowing so the older model is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.460" end="00:22:17.220" style="s2">disease model the chemical is inside of</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.160" end="00:22:19.730" style="s2">me it&#39;s like a disease and the chemical</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.220" end="00:22:22.350" style="s2">inside of me is compelling the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.730" end="00:22:26.220" style="s2">now obviously there is a biochemical</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.350" end="00:22:28.110" style="s2">aspect to addiction but that model of</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.220" end="00:22:29.190" style="s2">addiction doesn&#39;t cover most and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.110" end="00:22:30.360" style="s2">talked about this just to remind</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.190" end="00:22:32.250" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.360" end="00:22:34.860" style="s2">the idea of addiction of reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.250" end="00:22:36.779" style="s2">narrowing is that it is this degradation</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.860" end="00:22:38.340" style="s2">and perversion of the agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.779" end="00:22:40.890" style="s2">relationship right</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.340" end="00:22:44.190" style="s2">my agency gets truncated in some fashion</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.890" end="00:22:46.860" style="s2">the kinds of identities i can assume</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.190" end="00:22:49.559" style="s2">right the way i can reconfigure</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.860" end="00:22:52.350" style="s2">restructure myself in order to change is</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.559" end="00:22:55.049" style="s2">being diminished and then that reduces</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.350" end="00:22:58.049" style="s2">options in the world and then as the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.049" end="00:23:00.860" style="s2">world&#39;s options decrease right i lose</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.049" end="00:23:03.899" style="s2">more of my cognitive and my existential</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.860" end="00:23:06.120" style="s2">identity I lose options into who and</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.899" end="00:23:09.510" style="s2">what I can be the world loses options</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.120" end="00:23:12.029" style="s2">and eventually it comes that there is I</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.510" end="00:23:13.710" style="s2">can&#39;t be other than I am and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.029" end="00:23:15.870" style="s2">opportunities for difference to change</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.710" end="00:23:17.750" style="s2">my world becomes locked down I become</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.870" end="00:23:21.360" style="s2">locked down and we get this whole</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.750" end="00:23:24.360" style="s2">addiction spiral which is basically the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.360" end="00:23:27.809" style="s2">opposite of an agog a so as we lose as</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.360" end="00:23:30.539" style="s2">we lose the agent Iranian relationship</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.809" end="00:23:33.000" style="s2">that meta meaning affordance in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.539" end="00:23:35.130" style="s2">meaning crisis we would expect this kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.000" end="00:23:37.590" style="s2">of thing to become more prevalent and of</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.130" end="00:23:39.059" style="s2">course it is going to overlap and right</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.590" end="00:23:40.889" style="s2">let&#39;s be very clear there are also</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.059" end="00:23:43.519" style="s2">clearly political and socio-economic</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.889" end="00:23:45.480" style="s2">drivers to addiction just like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.519" end="00:23:49.289" style="s2">talking about a lot of different things</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.480" end="00:23:52.080" style="s2">here but let&#39;s recite what Durkheim</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.289" end="00:23:54.299" style="s2">showed in his famous book literally what</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.080" end="00:23:56.220" style="s2">is it like around 150 years ago or</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.299" end="00:23:58.889" style="s2">something that write a suicide is in</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.220" end="00:24:00.690" style="s2">addition to and he was never denying his</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.889" end="00:24:02.850" style="s2">book was called suicide because what he</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.690" end="00:24:04.980" style="s2">showed with really conclusive evidence</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.850" end="00:24:08.309" style="s2">and nobody&#39;s really undermined it right</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.980" end="00:24:10.110" style="s2">is that in addition to whatever mental</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.309" end="00:24:12.480" style="s2">health issues people have their own</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.110" end="00:24:15.450" style="s2">particular socio-economic issues there</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.480" end="00:24:19.409" style="s2">is a cause of suicide that has to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.450" end="00:24:21.990" style="s2">just with the undermining of right the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.409" end="00:24:23.669" style="s2">orders the noma logical normative and</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.990" end="00:24:26.309" style="s2">narrative orders he called that a know</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.669" end="00:24:30.740" style="s2">me the law a know me is directly related</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.309" end="00:24:37.620" style="s2">right a know me is directly related</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.740" end="00:24:39.720" style="s2">latin to the the normative especially</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.620" end="00:24:44.060" style="s2">the normal logical order this is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.720" end="00:24:46.520" style="s2">loss of of order totally ordered and</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.060" end="00:24:48.770" style="s2">so all along the way we&#39;re not claiming</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.520" end="00:24:52.160" style="s2">that the meaning crisis in any of these</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.770" end="00:24:54.140" style="s2">is the sole cause what we&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.160" end="00:24:56.360" style="s2">the meaning crisis is going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.140" end="00:24:58.550" style="s2">contribute in important ways all along</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.360" end="00:25:00.530" style="s2">to the increase in all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.550" end="00:25:03.500" style="s2">that we are finding right now and we</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.530" end="00:25:05.720" style="s2">that the so the argument here is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.500" end="00:25:07.640" style="s2">going to see addiction rising things</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.720" end="00:25:10.550" style="s2">like the opioid crisis other forms of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.640" end="00:25:12.710" style="s2">addiction rising precisely because we</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.550" end="00:25:14.900" style="s2">are in a situation of antia and agog a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.710" end="00:25:18.620" style="s2">because worldly attunement is being</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.900" end="00:25:23.450" style="s2">significantly undermined okay so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.620" end="00:25:26.060" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s erase and right and</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.450" end="00:25:27.950" style="s2">we&#39;ll we&#39;ll sort of slide things well</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.060" end="00:25:30.440" style="s2">what we can do is we can write at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.950" end="00:25:33.320" style="s2">center of that continuum yes we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.440" end="00:25:37.850" style="s2">to talk about the virtual Exodus which</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.320" end="00:25:39.950" style="s2">is just to remind everyone we will be</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.850" end="00:25:41.030" style="s2">putting up the completed panel so you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.950" end="00:25:43.010" style="s2">be able to see the whole thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.030" end="00:25:45.680" style="s2">just trying to unfold it so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.010" end="00:25:47.420" style="s2">understand the intelligibility you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.680" end="00:25:49.610" style="s2">understand how we&#39;re trying to schema</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.420" end="00:25:51.140" style="s2">ties and the symptoms of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.610" end="00:25:52.640" style="s2">process it&#39;s a good point you made too</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.140" end="00:25:54.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s worth it&#39;s worth emphasizing</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.640" end="00:25:57.710" style="s2">that we&#39;re not you know we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.920" end="00:26:01.550" style="s2">presuming to give a wholesale account of</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.710" end="00:26:04.460" style="s2">any one of these yep phenomena any one</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.550" end="00:26:05.960" style="s2">of these symptoms and we&#39;re certainly</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.460" end="00:26:08.660" style="s2">not making the claim that the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.960" end="00:26:10.280" style="s2">crisis is the soul is the sole cause or</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.660" end="00:26:11.510" style="s2">the sole way of understanding them</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.280" end="00:26:13.430" style="s2">probably you did you sort of did that</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.510" end="00:26:16.520" style="s2">yeah but it&#39;s worth it&#39;s worth nodding</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.430" end="00:26:20.210" style="s2">to but we&#39;re simply indicating that</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.520" end="00:26:22.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a they are together</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.210" end="00:26:25.520" style="s2">forming a pattern there&#39;s a fairly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.880" end="00:26:27.410" style="s2">a fairly well defined pattern once we</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.520" end="00:26:30.230" style="s2">actually plot it out right and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.410" end="00:26:33.770" style="s2">packets it&#39;s the it&#39;s the pattern third</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.230" end="00:26:37.790" style="s2">the gestalt view of the pattern that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.770" end="00:26:38.990" style="s2">so that is so that&#39;s so defining yes I</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.790" end="00:26:40.670" style="s2">totally agree with that I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.990" end="00:26:43.790" style="s2">well said yeah okay so let&#39;s keep going</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.670" end="00:26:45.050" style="s2">what we can we now put right yeah so now</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.790" end="00:26:46.430" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.050" end="00:26:48.950" style="s2">virtual Exodus we&#39;ve already kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.430" end="00:26:51.980" style="s2">touched on this so so we&#39;re putting that</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.950" end="00:26:55.700" style="s2">where where do you think um maybe just</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.980" end="00:26:57.830" style="s2">to the right of the media right okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.700" end="00:26:59.600" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.830" end="00:27:01.940" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty close it&#39;s pretty close to</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.600" end="00:27:03.620" style="s2">addiction most to addiction the virtual</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.940" end="00:27:05.809" style="s2">Exodus it&#39;s pretty because because</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.620" end="00:27:08.299" style="s2">virtual Exodus espouses itself has it as</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.809" end="00:27:11.120" style="s2">an addiction yes so what we mean by</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.299" end="00:27:13.750" style="s2">virtual Exodus is a retreat into the</p>

<p begin="00:27:13.750" end="00:27:19.580" style="s2">response so you can see this in books</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.840" end="00:27:21.169" style="s2">like the book there&#39;s a book in fact</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.580" end="00:27:23.690" style="s2">entitled the virtual Exodus there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.169" end="00:27:25.460" style="s2">book entitled reality is broken and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.690" end="00:27:28.549" style="s2">trying to document how many people are</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.460" end="00:27:30.649" style="s2">moving are restructuring their lives and</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.549" end="00:27:32.990" style="s2">moving out of interacting with the real</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.649" end="00:27:35.179" style="s2">world and real people and moving into</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.990" end="00:27:37.940" style="s2">virtual worlds either the game world or</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.179" end="00:27:40.429" style="s2">social media world etc that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.940" end="00:27:42.409" style="s2">that&#39;s right so one of the things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.429" end="00:27:43.730" style="s2">talking about video games the moment and</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.409" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">I have to preface by saying that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.730" end="00:27:48.019" style="s2">unlike most people I know actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:50.570" style="s2">didn&#39;t grow up like I watched my son&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.019" end="00:27:52.549" style="s2">lot yeah minimal expertise I have a good</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.570" end="00:27:54.559" style="s2">friend Patrick who would be aghast to</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.549" end="00:27:56.149" style="s2">find me talking with any expertise but</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.559" end="00:28:00.860" style="s2">video games because I consider him to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.149" end="00:28:02.299" style="s2">the expert but um fundamentally is and</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.860" end="00:28:04.039" style="s2">it&#39;s worth saying here before we get</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.299" end="00:28:07.039" style="s2">into it that we&#39;re not saying that these</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.039" end="00:28:08.570" style="s2">these virtual Levites have no value in</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.039" end="00:28:10.610" style="s2">fact they can have quite a bit of value</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.570" end="00:28:12.409" style="s2">trinsic and instrumental down no we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.610" end="00:28:14.090" style="s2">talking about the accidents not just the</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.409" end="00:28:15.769" style="s2">virtuality that&#39;s right that&#39;s right so</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.090" end="00:28:19.220" style="s2">we&#39;re not this is not to say that</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.769" end="00:28:20.809" style="s2">virtual exercises aren&#39;t worth aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.220" end="00:28:22.730" style="s2">worth the time right it&#39;s not to say</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.809" end="00:28:24.980" style="s2">that virtual exercises have no value</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.730" end="00:28:27.529" style="s2">it&#39;s to say that the their use as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.980" end="00:28:29.539" style="s2">compensatory response to the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.529" end="00:28:32.299" style="s2">crisis is the issue it&#39;s not the virtual</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.539" end="00:28:34.309" style="s2">exercise or activity it&#39;s the it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.299" end="00:28:36.799" style="s2">very complete shifting of your engine</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.309" end="00:28:39.470" style="s2">yeah and I and well I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.799" end="00:28:43.850" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it reflects a choice</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.470" end="00:28:46.279" style="s2">right using a using the the virtual game</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.850" end="00:28:48.139" style="s2">as entertainment or education is not the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.279" end="00:28:51.110" style="s2">same thing as the existential choice to</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.139" end="00:28:54.200" style="s2">say reality is broken to use one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.110" end="00:28:55.639" style="s2">the titles of the book I choose I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.200" end="00:28:57.529" style="s2">gonna choose to live here that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.639" end="00:29:00.230" style="s2">that&#39;s right so we&#39;re talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.529" end="00:29:02.120" style="s2">aspect of this phenomena that&#39;s right so</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.230" end="00:29:03.500" style="s2">I was going to say about video games</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.120" end="00:29:04.940" style="s2">because video games are interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.500" end="00:29:06.830" style="s2">because they you&#39;ve talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.940" end="00:29:12.370" style="s2">three orders are radiological the Norman</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.830" end="00:29:15.799" style="s2">area the the the mini physics of video</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.370" end="00:29:17.720" style="s2">recreate those orders so much it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.799" end="00:29:19.789" style="s2">back into the axial world right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.720" end="00:29:22.940" style="s2">governed by a set of very very</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.789" end="00:29:32.389" style="s2">consistent very legible rules that fit</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.940" end="00:29:34.399" style="s2">you or your avatar it levels up with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.389" end="00:29:37.279" style="s2">normative order right right there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.399" end="00:29:39.860" style="s2">ANA GOG it descent that happens at P</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.279" end="00:29:41.899" style="s2">junctures and all of it unfolds approach</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.860" end="00:29:43.490" style="s2">and their flow induction machine and</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.899" end="00:29:45.110" style="s2">their flow induction machine but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.490" end="00:29:47.269" style="s2">flow that of course has nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.110" end="00:29:48.980" style="s2">and you&#39;re constantly improving and</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.269" end="00:29:51.529" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly self-correcting so</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.980" end="00:29:53.659" style="s2">it&#39;s an incredible incredible like font</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.529" end="00:29:57.019" style="s2">for narrative but it&#39;s also a mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.659" end="00:30:01.090" style="s2">for for attunement right but</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.019" end="00:30:03.860" style="s2">unfortunately what you&#39;re tuning with</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.090" end="00:30:06.799" style="s2">fundamentally isn&#39;t correspondent and</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.860" end="00:30:09.860" style="s2">then in the world of the verdict of</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.799" end="00:30:12.440" style="s2">these virtual realities is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.860" end="00:30:14.480" style="s2">right we can&#39;t fit into the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.440" end="00:30:16.730" style="s2">worldview and that&#39;s why those worlds</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.480" end="00:30:19.100" style="s2">often have a fantastical component to</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.730" end="00:30:20.779" style="s2">them right that you know point back to</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.100" end="00:30:22.580" style="s2">well yes and we&#39;re going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.779" end="00:30:25.460" style="s2">the fact that pseudo religious</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.580" end="00:30:27.110" style="s2">mythologies always yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.460" end="00:30:29.210" style="s2">yes that&#39;s what makes them worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.110" end="00:30:30.980" style="s2">substitutes now of course this is close</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.210" end="00:30:33.350" style="s2">to addiction because as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.980" end="00:30:36.440" style="s2">before the the World Health Organization</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.350" end="00:30:39.110" style="s2">is seriously considering making video</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.440" end="00:30:42.190" style="s2">games video game addiction a bona fide</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.110" end="00:30:45.200" style="s2">medical disease that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.190" end="00:30:47.029" style="s2">acknowledged because of the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.200" end="00:30:49.129" style="s2">it can be so disruptive and destructive</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.029" end="00:30:51.620" style="s2">to people&#39;s lives and that of course is</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.129" end="00:30:55.100" style="s2">I think makes sense because of the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.620" end="00:30:58.159" style="s2">as we as we&#39;ve been arguing it gives you</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.100" end="00:31:00.679" style="s2">it satisfies it&#39;s like junk food it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.159" end="00:31:03.019" style="s2">satisfies without there being any any</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.679" end="00:31:05.899" style="s2">actual calories it satisfies the longing</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.019" end="00:31:08.840" style="s2">for the orders it satisfies the longing</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.899" end="00:31:11.240" style="s2">for flow but of course it&#39;s hijacking</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.840" end="00:31:14.059" style="s2">and perverting that and in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.240" end="00:31:20.720" style="s2">sort of definitional of what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.059" end="00:31:22.129" style="s2">fall prey to an addiction so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.720" end="00:31:23.000" style="s2">already talked about social media a</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.129" end="00:31:24.169" style="s2">little bit when we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.000" end="00:31:25.610" style="s2">loneliness</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.169" end="00:31:29.540" style="s2">obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.610" end="00:31:31.309" style="s2">these two these two points on a</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.540" end="00:31:33.020" style="s2">continuum are correspondent to one</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.309" end="00:31:35.179" style="s2">another and so we don&#39;t need to tread</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.020" end="00:31:38.540" style="s2">too heavily on this topic again suffice</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.179" end="00:31:41.240" style="s2">it to say even within this topic there</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.540" end="00:31:43.490" style="s2">is a continuum sir because video like</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.240" end="00:31:45.440" style="s2">gaming in the broad sense of the term</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.490" end="00:31:48.260" style="s2">and especially the narrative component</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.440" end="00:31:52.490" style="s2">of gaming is actually collapsing into</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.260" end="00:31:55.250" style="s2">social media yeah the idea of operating</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.490" end="00:31:57.230" style="s2">within a narrative and with things like</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.250" end="00:31:59.240" style="s2">Instagram sort of bleed between these</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.230" end="00:32:00.830" style="s2">social media and being a video game yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.240" end="00:32:02.660" style="s2">very much so</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.830" end="00:32:05.419" style="s2">it actually deepens the virtuality and</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.660" end="00:32:07.700" style="s2">it deepens its participatory right I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.419" end="00:32:10.370" style="s2">learn right yeah because you get both in</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.700" end="00:32:13.070" style="s2">one now it&#39;s good to be social you get</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.370" end="00:32:14.750" style="s2">to subject your communities but you also</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.070" end="00:32:16.340" style="s2">get your three orders and your flow</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.750" end="00:32:17.900" style="s2">induction rights and so you get them</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.340" end="00:32:20.540" style="s2">both together and that&#39;s why I like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.900" end="00:32:23.270" style="s2">so incredibly powerful right because you</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.540" end="00:32:26.000" style="s2">can you can you have the ingress into</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.270" end="00:32:27.860" style="s2">the axial world and you have all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.000" end="00:32:30.710" style="s2">community asks you of course you don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.860" end="00:32:33.830" style="s2">was going to say you have a will you</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.710" end="00:32:37.730" style="s2">have you have a specter of the community</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.830" end="00:32:41.059" style="s2">I remember I asking my younger son of if</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.730" end="00:32:43.100" style="s2">he actually wanted to meet with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.059" end="00:32:45.470" style="s2">people he was playing with online and</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.100" end="00:32:47.540" style="s2">this struck him as odd yeah yeah a very</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.470" end="00:32:50.720" style="s2">odd thing to do what why would I want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.540" end="00:32:52.250" style="s2">actually interact with these people no</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.720" end="00:32:54.679" style="s2">no it&#39;s like nobody wants to call each</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.250" end="00:32:56.870" style="s2">other yeah yeah a version of the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.679" end="00:32:58.309" style="s2">reason yeah because our entire our are</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.870" end="00:33:00.950" style="s2">as part of the our mode of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.309" end="00:33:04.250" style="s2">atomization is being be figured by this</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.950" end="00:33:07.669" style="s2">it&#39;s being retrained yeah and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.250" end="00:33:10.100" style="s2">I mean I wonder in like 10 20 years just</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.669" end="00:33:13.940" style="s2">how much of that sociability will have</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.100" end="00:33:16.100" style="s2">been rewired even beyond recognizability</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.940" end="00:33:20.740" style="s2">yeah cuz right now we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.100" end="00:33:24.049" style="s2">straddling both but um anyway so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.740" end="00:33:29.059" style="s2">the I think that the intersection of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.049" end="00:33:32.059" style="s2">sociability and the and they order the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.059" end="00:33:35.150" style="s2">ordered metaphysics and the slow-mo yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.059" end="00:33:38.929" style="s2">all collapse and coordinate to create</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.150" end="00:33:39.280" style="s2">something that is what its irresistible</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.929" end="00:33:43.600" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.280" end="00:33:45.520" style="s2">okay let&#39;s keep going okay okay I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.600" end="00:33:46.720" style="s2">here&#39;s our big category and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.520" end="00:33:48.490" style="s2">to need all the space that we can</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.720" end="00:33:50.320" style="s2">possibly get so we&#39;ll just draw a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.490" end="00:33:53.080" style="s2">straw at the center to continue them or</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:54.220" style="s2">in the center section maybe a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.080" end="00:33:55.360" style="s2">more to the right a little bit more to</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.220" end="00:33:58.960" style="s2">the right yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.360" end="00:34:00.730" style="s2">okay please remember this our use of</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.960" end="00:34:03.420" style="s2">left and right has absolutely nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.730" end="00:34:05.800" style="s2">do with the political connotation oh no</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.420" end="00:34:11.919" style="s2">it&#39;s simply that we read from left to</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.800" end="00:34:13.060" style="s2">right yes ah the Neo Gnosticism yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.919" end="00:34:17.889" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about this quite a</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.060" end="00:34:20.560" style="s2">bit not to be confused with this right</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.889" end="00:34:21.909" style="s2">yes we&#39;re using to have very positive so</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.560" end="00:34:23.500" style="s2">there was all episode Kristin which I</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.909" end="00:34:27.250" style="s2">tried to distinguish between gnosis and</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.500" end="00:34:33.490" style="s2">ostracism yeah okay so this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.250" end="00:34:34.919" style="s2">essentially where we&#39;re trying to we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.490" end="00:34:39.070" style="s2">trying to redraw the map of the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.919" end="00:34:42.220" style="s2">fundamentally in a narrative sense we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.070" end="00:34:44.860" style="s2">trying to retry to reintroduce a</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.220" end="00:34:49.720" style="s2">meta-narrative that is as participatory</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.860" end="00:34:51.730" style="s2">as evolving as cohering as the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.720" end="00:34:54.520" style="s2">meta-narrative and world the attunement</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.730" end="00:34:56.169" style="s2">provided by actual religions broadly</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.520" end="00:34:57.760" style="s2">speaking in our case I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.169" end="00:35:01.420" style="s2">speaking very very much within the</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.760" end="00:35:03.520" style="s2">Christian paradigm so and and because</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.420" end="00:35:05.500" style="s2">there&#39;s been the declension of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.520" end="00:35:09.760" style="s2">right because it&#39;s for treating further</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.500" end="00:35:14.100" style="s2">and further and further away from us are</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.760" end="00:35:17.860" style="s2">the sense of being the sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.100" end="00:35:19.780" style="s2">disoriented is our our experiences right</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.860" end="00:35:22.030" style="s2">with disorientation precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.780" end="00:35:24.040" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost that coherent that&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.030" end="00:35:25.570" style="s2">coherent canopy so we&#39;re involving that</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.040" end="00:35:27.400" style="s2">we&#39;re using the term narcissism know to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.570" end="00:35:30.520" style="s2">bring with it the sense the of</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.400" end="00:35:32.680" style="s2">entrapment and the sense that this</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.520" end="00:35:36.070" style="s2">attempt to create the meta-narrative</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.680" end="00:35:38.140" style="s2">is it is that the Vaculik</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.070" end="00:35:41.110" style="s2">that the the vacuum that were suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.140" end="00:35:43.090" style="s2">voiced with right like the canopy above</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.110" end="00:35:46.600" style="s2">us right the coherent set of stars that</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.090" end="00:35:48.190" style="s2">map the world not the cosmos etc they no</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.600" end="00:35:49.840" style="s2">longer bring us the orientation of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.190" end="00:35:51.850" style="s2">meta-narrative right now it&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.840" end="00:35:52.930" style="s2">by analogy it&#39;s akin to looking up and</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.850" end="00:35:55.480" style="s2">seeing a black and sky</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.930" end="00:35:57.220" style="s2">all right and so that&#39;s part of why</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.480" end="00:36:00.250" style="s2">you&#39;re next focused on the shelter yes</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.220" end="00:36:03.370" style="s2">as the sacred canopy now removed leaves</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.250" end="00:36:06.490" style="s2">with it a sense of again the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.370" end="00:36:08.590" style="s2">declension a sense of having having the</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.490" end="00:36:11.100" style="s2">narrative of the cosmos retreat away and</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.590" end="00:36:14.290" style="s2">also falling away ourselves right</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.100" end="00:36:16.570" style="s2">minutes famous quote okay so it&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.290" end="00:36:18.310" style="s2">that relate to Gnosticism but I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.570" end="00:36:20.860" style="s2">that because of that because in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.310" end="00:36:23.260" style="s2">absence now of that meta-narrative I</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.860" end="00:36:30.790" style="s2">think one of the responses to it has</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.260" end="00:36:32.610" style="s2">been the the it&#39;s almost as though we</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.790" end="00:36:35.620" style="s2">want to punch our way through that</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.610" end="00:36:37.750" style="s2">blackened it&#39;s a it&#39;s a barrier belated</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.620" end="00:36:40.180" style="s2">enemy right it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s obscured</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.750" end="00:36:41.800" style="s2">now it&#39;s an anew belated sky and we now</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.180" end="00:36:43.960" style="s2">feel like we have to punch through it</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.800" end="00:36:46.390" style="s2">right so we we max where that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.960" end="00:36:49.240" style="s2">this is not conspiratorial nature it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.390" end="00:36:50.890" style="s2">bad yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a barrier as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.240" end="00:36:52.150" style="s2">to a vacuity right because at least a</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.890" end="00:36:54.310" style="s2">barrier we can try to break through</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.150" end="00:36:55.930" style="s2">that&#39;s right okay so right listen that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.310" end="00:36:57.670" style="s2">right and now what if that is the MIS</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.930" end="00:37:00.220" style="s2">framing - right it&#39;s a Mis framing</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.670" end="00:37:02.650" style="s2">because it&#39;s taking a vacuity framing it</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.220" end="00:37:04.300" style="s2">as a barrier and then it&#39;s like a mirage</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.650" end="00:37:05.980" style="s2">right yeah you&#39;re shooting for it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.300" end="00:37:09.460" style="s2">you end up going right through it um</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.980" end="00:37:11.800" style="s2">well let&#39;s put yeah flat earther</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.460" end="00:37:13.510" style="s2">phenomenon right so a lot of these are</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.800" end="00:37:21.340" style="s2">going to have sort of a conspiratorial</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.510" end="00:37:24.780" style="s2">edge to them as well then right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.340" end="00:37:24.780" style="s2">the substitution of the meta-narrative</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.080" end="00:37:34.180" style="s2">right so jonathan pazzo did an episode</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.970" end="00:37:37.360" style="s2">talking about the flat earth phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.180" end="00:37:38.440" style="s2">and about how people right I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.360" end="00:37:40.210" style="s2">taking a slightly different take on it</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.440" end="00:37:43.300" style="s2">but there is some convergence on areas</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.210" end="00:37:45.340" style="s2">we both see it as a response like we and</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.300" end="00:37:46.890" style="s2">Jonathan both see it as a response to</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.340" end="00:37:51.940" style="s2">the meaning crisis and summarization</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.890" end="00:37:53.950" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s right so like let&#39;s list</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.940" end="00:37:57.820" style="s2">some particular examples of this here</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.950" end="00:38:03.190" style="s2">who do we put in here</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.820" end="00:38:06.820" style="s2">well we have seen we have rink now we</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.190" end="00:38:09.010" style="s2">have bundled into this right the</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.820" end="00:38:17.140" style="s2">phenomena that we&#39;re calling pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.010" end="00:38:22.020" style="s2">religious ideologies ideologies right or</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.140" end="00:38:25.420" style="s2">we could also say mythologies right</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.020" end="00:38:29.130" style="s2">right but the term ideology is often</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.420" end="00:38:32.470" style="s2">used to because they primarily Express</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.130" end="00:38:34.930" style="s2">identity participation narrative in</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.470" end="00:38:40.020" style="s2">political terms and political merit and</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.930" end="00:38:43.870" style="s2">political structures right okay and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.020" end="00:38:45.220" style="s2">getting back into the the the agent</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.870" end="00:38:46.360" style="s2">during the structure of the worldview</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.220" end="00:38:49.270" style="s2">attunement right even talked about</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.360" end="00:38:53.110" style="s2">medical men and meaning system does a</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.270" end="00:38:55.300" style="s2">lot of this has to do with because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.110" end="00:38:58.930" style="s2">lost the overarching meta meaning system</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.300" end="00:39:01.570" style="s2">right the co hearing government right I</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.930" end="00:39:04.570" style="s2">think that there is a visible and</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.570" end="00:39:06.880" style="s2">repeated attempt in various arenas and</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.570" end="00:39:09.160" style="s2">various domains to take meaning systems</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.880" end="00:39:11.140" style="s2">right politics is a good example of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.160" end="00:39:13.660" style="s2">right that political framework is in</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.140" end="00:39:18.160" style="s2">itself a system that governs us to try</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.660" end="00:39:21.070" style="s2">and make an intention omission and what</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.160" end="00:39:23.320" style="s2">you can&#39;t do because it so this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.070" end="00:39:25.810" style="s2">this is a classic category mistake right</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.320" end="00:39:28.120" style="s2">it&#39;s the ideas we&#39;re taking we&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.810" end="00:39:29.860" style="s2">something that depends on a meta meaning</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.120" end="00:39:32.770" style="s2">a particular meaning system and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.860" end="00:39:35.470" style="s2">trying to make it be I&#39;m not a meaning</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.770" end="00:39:36.880" style="s2">system and take the place of the meta</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.470" end="00:39:39.190" style="s2">meaning system and it can&#39;t because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.880" end="00:39:41.080" style="s2">not structured to actually function that</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.190" end="00:39:42.970" style="s2">way that&#39;s right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.080" end="00:39:44.950" style="s2">and you see that I mean you know to</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.970" end="00:39:46.390" style="s2">speak of politics just for a moment and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.950" end="00:39:48.010" style="s2">obviously we&#39;re not going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.390" end="00:39:49.720" style="s2">politics in depth because this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.010" end="00:39:51.370" style="s2">politicized too much already and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.720" end="00:39:54.700" style="s2">mentally it&#39;s not a political problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.370" end="00:39:57.370" style="s2">but it does manifest itself in political</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.700" end="00:40:00.280" style="s2">symptoms right or rather the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.370" end="00:40:03.580" style="s2">politics is a symptom of it and you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.280" end="00:40:05.500" style="s2">we I mean we saw the most canonical</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.580" end="00:40:08.110" style="s2">examples of this available to us writer</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.500" end="00:40:11.500" style="s2">Marxism and Nazism but you know we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.110" end="00:40:16.040" style="s2">political system</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.500" end="00:40:18.980" style="s2">assumes the the what we might call the</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.040" end="00:40:21.850" style="s2">residue of religiosity and the role this</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.980" end="00:40:24.110" style="s2">is the role and responsibility of</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.850" end="00:40:27.530" style="s2">formerly what a religious system</p>

<p begin="00:40:27.530" end="00:40:31.670" style="s2">the it doesn&#39;t have the complexity to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.260" end="00:40:34.130" style="s2">able to accomplish well it doesn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.670" end="00:40:36.890" style="s2">mean as the episode I talked about like</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.130" end="00:40:38.630" style="s2">with the Nazi the Nazism and Marxism is</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.890" end="00:40:40.430" style="s2">although you have a lot of you have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.630" end="00:40:42.890" style="s2">lot of religious symbols and ritual</p>

<p begin="00:40:59.120" end="00:41:03.410" style="s2">propositions that&#39;s right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.130" end="00:41:06.380" style="s2">and a lot of it has to do with the way</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.410" end="00:41:08.720" style="s2">in which we are identifying ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.380" end="00:41:10.970" style="s2">with and through these systems right</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.720" end="00:41:12.800" style="s2">right so another exists so so our gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.970" end="00:41:15.350" style="s2">say about politics is that you know if</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.800" end="00:41:17.060" style="s2">you look at the way that the behavior of</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.350" end="00:41:18.500" style="s2">US politics is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.060" end="00:41:22.430" style="s2">especially to us as Canadians we very</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.500" end="00:41:25.040" style="s2">quite understand it often because we</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.430" end="00:41:29.750" style="s2">it&#39;s difficult to understand I think for</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:31.700" style="s2">us just how religious US politics yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.750" end="00:41:34.340" style="s2">which is not the same thing to say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.700" end="00:41:36.470" style="s2">like the Christian Right it&#39;s the no no</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.340" end="00:41:38.390" style="s2">no no then that&#39;s not what I mean at all</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.470" end="00:41:41.570" style="s2">I&#39;m not referring to any any end of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.390" end="00:41:43.610" style="s2">spectrum one thing that I often think is</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.570" end="00:41:45.290" style="s2">especially observing usually during</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.610" end="00:41:47.690" style="s2">their presidential elections and this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.290" end="00:41:49.550" style="s2">either side either party is that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.690" end="00:41:51.350" style="s2">best way of understanding the role of</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.550" end="00:41:53.330" style="s2">the US president is as the role of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.350" end="00:41:56.270" style="s2">church leader yes the role of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.330" end="00:41:58.580" style="s2">religious head not a governor right not</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.270" end="00:42:00.760" style="s2">someone that governs right or introduces</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.580" end="00:42:03.500" style="s2">policies etc though it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.760" end="00:42:09.110" style="s2">identification with the religious leader</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.500" end="00:42:13.490" style="s2">that I think espouses the deep deep</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.110" end="00:42:15.650" style="s2">pregnancy of how meaningful that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.490" end="00:42:17.810" style="s2">office is as a symbol right but the fact</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.650" end="00:42:19.640" style="s2">that that is now degenerating into</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.810" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">adversarial gridlock Paulette right</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.640" end="00:42:23.900" style="s2">because that system cannot accommodate</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:24.510" style="s2">the religion right again Casa T with</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.900" end="00:42:26.460" style="s2">which it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.510" end="00:42:28.230" style="s2">voice right it can&#39;t be a meta meaning</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.460" end="00:42:30.240" style="s2">system cannot be a meta meaning system</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.230" end="00:42:32.190" style="s2">right - it doesn&#39;t have the same breadth</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.240" end="00:42:34.020" style="s2">of identification it doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.190" end="00:42:36.510" style="s2">same ritual practices it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.020" end="00:42:38.940" style="s2">the same symbolic affordances right it</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.510" end="00:42:41.340" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have all of that machinery that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.940" end="00:42:44.340" style="s2">the religion the actual religions for</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.340" end="00:42:46.830" style="s2">instance had to be able to cohere people</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.340" end="00:42:48.540" style="s2">properly to be produced wisdom to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.830" end="00:42:50.640" style="s2">able to produce discourse doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.540" end="00:42:52.320" style="s2">have us you know coordinated sets of</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.640" end="00:42:55.740" style="s2">psycho technologies for transforming</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.320" end="00:42:59.550" style="s2">consciousness cognition character and it</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.740" end="00:43:02.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it&#39;s but de-facto it because</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.550" end="00:43:05.640" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing else it has the it gets</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.010" end="00:43:09.510" style="s2">inflated as complex as that right and as</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.640" end="00:43:12.300" style="s2">important and as as much scalable impact</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.510" end="00:43:14.940" style="s2">on the world and on people I think it de</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.300" end="00:43:16.980" style="s2">facto has assumed and this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.940" end="00:43:18.840" style="s2">really true I think of the presidential</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.980" end="00:43:21.480" style="s2">office is that it has assumed the</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.840" end="00:43:23.310" style="s2">importance and the valence of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.480" end="00:43:27.150" style="s2">religious system and of a religious</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.310" end="00:43:30.060" style="s2">leader right and that&#39;s why so much so I</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.150" end="00:43:33.330" style="s2">mean a world of importance over every</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.060" end="00:43:35.820" style="s2">four years is is channeled through that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.330" end="00:43:38.280" style="s2">right that system so what are some other</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.820" end="00:43:39.510" style="s2">examples we want to put in here well</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.280" end="00:43:43.440" style="s2">when we&#39;re talking about pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.510" end="00:43:45.240" style="s2">religious mythologies the example of our</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.440" end="00:43:47.430" style="s2">fantasies right now in our modern</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.240" end="00:43:49.410" style="s2">fantasies right our superhero myth the</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.430" end="00:43:51.510" style="s2">superhero mythos the Star Wars mythos</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.410" end="00:43:52.830" style="s2">although so I think you know we might at</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.510" end="00:43:54.300" style="s2">some point do a whole session on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.830" end="00:43:56.010" style="s2">Star Wars mythos yeah it&#39;s leave that</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.300" end="00:43:57.720" style="s2">one in the offing for now but the</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.010" end="00:44:02.190" style="s2">superhero mythos is arguably the most</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.720" end="00:44:04.470" style="s2">then the the the overwhelming successive</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.190" end="00:44:05.790" style="s2">endgame of the anti yeah exactly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.470" end="00:44:09.180" style="s2">but it but see what that what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.790" end="00:44:11.100" style="s2">doing right that project right marvel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.180" end="00:44:13.920" style="s2">project right the cinematic universe</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.100" end="00:44:15.720" style="s2">what it&#39;s doing is it&#39;s casting a</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.920" end="00:44:18.230" style="s2">meta-narrative yes yeah very much that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.720" end="00:44:21.600" style="s2">why the share of the universe yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.230" end="00:44:24.660" style="s2">continuous narrative that binds together</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.600" end="00:44:26.130" style="s2">a universe right right right and think</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.660" end="00:44:28.620" style="s2">of everything that goes in so not only</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.130" end="00:44:31.020" style="s2">does it have not only does it have an</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.620" end="00:44:34.740" style="s2">entire universe in a continuity of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.020" end="00:44:38.130" style="s2">universe and now of course they&#39;ve that</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.740" end="00:44:41.310" style="s2">universe as we now know is is has</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.130" end="00:44:43.200" style="s2">a dimensionality to it that tends to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.310" end="00:44:46.410" style="s2">level of synchronicity tends to this</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.200" end="00:44:47.730" style="s2">people&#39;s mix structure dress up right so</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.410" end="00:44:49.200" style="s2">then it has that right it has the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.730" end="00:44:51.030" style="s2">participatory element all right</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.200" end="00:44:53.310" style="s2">convention play the conventions right</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.030" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">people identifying very deeply and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.310" end="00:44:57.420" style="s2">look at the characters themselves</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:45:00.780" style="s2">they&#39;re an interesting synthesis of</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.420" end="00:45:04.860" style="s2">Bronze Age gods in some cases they argue</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.780" end="00:45:07.410" style="s2">Bronze Age gods axial virtues yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.860" end="00:45:10.500" style="s2">and this is really interesting to me and</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.410" end="00:45:15.000" style="s2">modern second technologies right right</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.500" end="00:45:18.270" style="s2">the title character that begins the</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.000" end="00:45:20.130" style="s2">entire universe and arguably more than</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.270" end="00:45:21.870" style="s2">any other character who frames the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.130" end="00:45:25.500" style="s2">universe right the commands only star</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.870" end="00:45:29.370" style="s2">character is one who&#39;s whose excellence</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.500" end="00:45:32.430" style="s2">and who&#39;s whose destiny and whose wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.370" end="00:45:34.800" style="s2">and whose agency is bound to his use of</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.430" end="00:45:37.350" style="s2">cyber technology yeah the epitomized by</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.800" end="00:45:39.330" style="s2">the suit and all that stuff yes so so</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.350" end="00:45:42.150" style="s2">right he&#39;s like he&#39;s literally sir he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.330" end="00:45:44.610" style="s2">literally encased within identified with</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.150" end="00:45:47.340" style="s2">it he&#39;s cyborg commands right and he and</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.610" end="00:45:50.420" style="s2">his cosmic journey his his sort of is</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.340" end="00:45:54.150" style="s2">his cosmic narrative destiny right the</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.420" end="00:45:56.430" style="s2">his that&#39;s interesting is an agog a so</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.150" end="00:45:59.460" style="s2">you get the Bronze Age the axial age and</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.430" end="00:46:02.490" style="s2">you get to say all about all in case</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.460" end="00:46:04.260" style="s2">literally right within a character who</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.490" end="00:46:08.160" style="s2">we then identify with and who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.260" end="00:46:10.080" style="s2">essentially charts an entire universe</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.160" end="00:46:12.470" style="s2">worth of important we&#39;re running out of</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.080" end="00:46:16.670" style="s2">time so let&#39;s get to our last category</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.470" end="00:46:16.670" style="s2">renewing gnosis right</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.470" end="00:46:29.530" style="s2">so this are people who are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.810" end="00:46:32.310" style="s2">create responses to the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.530" end="00:46:36.160" style="s2">by giving us new ecologies of practices</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.310" end="00:46:39.970" style="s2">new psycho technologies like so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.160" end="00:46:43.150" style="s2">got people like wave Kelly who is doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.970" end="00:46:46.180" style="s2">you know the idea of movement practices</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.150" end="00:46:49.150" style="s2">being a mesh within ritual or I talked</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.180" end="00:46:51.610" style="s2">about you know appeal people like Peter</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.150" end="00:46:53.140" style="s2">Limburg the authentic discourse trying</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.610" end="00:46:55.120" style="s2">to create new ways of talking and</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.140" end="00:46:57.640" style="s2">discussing with each other do the</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.120" end="00:46:58.840" style="s2">secular monastery like one of the great</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.640" end="00:47:01.450" style="s2">gifts of the series in fact is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.840" end="00:47:02.590" style="s2">meeting all these people I&#39;m get to meet</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.450" end="00:47:05.890" style="s2">all these to all these people who are</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.590" end="00:47:09.310" style="s2">trying to create right basically a new</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.890" end="00:47:12.630" style="s2">culture a new set of psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.310" end="00:47:16.360" style="s2">ecologies of practices communities right</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.630" end="00:47:18.970" style="s2">that will allow them to renew the</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.360" end="00:47:21.490" style="s2">machinery a participatory perspective</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.970" end="00:47:23.230" style="s2">annoying bring about gnosis you know try</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.490" end="00:47:25.000" style="s2">and get an agave going again and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.230" end="00:47:27.070" style="s2">seeing more and more of that happening</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.000" end="00:47:28.360" style="s2">right now right right and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.070" end="00:47:30.610" style="s2">interesting is I think a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.360" end="00:47:36.070" style="s2">what a lot of these are trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.610" end="00:47:37.660" style="s2">to is to to rescind a lot of the creedal</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.070" end="00:47:38.650" style="s2">arrogation that&#39;s been characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.660" end="00:47:41.170" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.650" end="00:47:43.360" style="s2">there&#39;s generally a move into the body</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.170" end="00:47:45.910" style="s2">there&#39;s a movement to flowing discourse</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.360" end="00:47:47.670" style="s2">the level of meaning system arbitrarily</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.910" end="00:47:49.900" style="s2">right they&#39;re not basically</p>

<p begin="00:47:51.490" end="00:47:54.790" style="s2">endlessly meaningful or to use your</p>

<p begin="00:47:59.170" end="00:48:03.280" style="s2">that idolatrous instinct right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.360" end="00:48:05.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a deep resistance to</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.280" end="00:48:08.950" style="s2">idolatry in the renewing gnosis projects</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.980" end="00:48:10.990" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s right it&#39;s it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.950" end="00:48:13.840" style="s2">that&#39;s why a lot of those practices and</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.990" end="00:48:15.880" style="s2">practices are and there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.840" end="00:48:17.560" style="s2">another somewhere here which we&#39;ve kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.880" end="00:48:19.900" style="s2">of glanced over for the purposes of time</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.560" end="00:48:21.400" style="s2">is this idea of serious play right right</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.900" end="00:48:24.130" style="s2">the serious play of the space in which</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.400" end="00:48:26.350" style="s2">to reengage a state of play that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.130" end="00:48:27.880" style="s2">characteristic of the phenomenon and</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.350" end="00:48:29.200" style="s2">that&#39;s in a lot of these a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.880" end="00:48:30.340" style="s2">tenets in a lot of these right now</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.200" end="00:48:33.180" style="s2">because one of the ways of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.340" end="00:48:36.599" style="s2">the creole ossification of religious</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.180" end="00:48:38.579" style="s2">praxis is understanding how the Credo</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.599" end="00:48:40.950" style="s2">the set of constraints that were meant</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.579" end="00:48:43.740" style="s2">to condition the state of play right a</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.950" end="00:48:46.230" style="s2">mnemonic device that no Vokes you into a</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.740" end="00:48:48.900" style="s2">state of connectedness end up becoming</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.230" end="00:48:51.450" style="s2">the end to the practice instead of</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.900" end="00:48:53.490" style="s2">conditioning the arena for play they end</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.450" end="00:48:56.760" style="s2">up actually enclosing on it and so what</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.490" end="00:49:00.510" style="s2">I think this is trying to do is open up</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.760" end="00:49:02.819" style="s2">the arena again right bye-bye and open</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.510" end="00:49:04.619" style="s2">up by the agency tune by slapping in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.819" end="00:49:10.710" style="s2">grip that this yet these Creed&#39;s have</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.619" end="00:49:13.020" style="s2">yes but open up both of them right so</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.710" end="00:49:14.849" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a pattern and I think these</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.020" end="00:49:16.710" style="s2">are only accumulating more and more</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.849" end="00:49:19.079" style="s2">these are kinds of reflective responses</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.710" end="00:49:20.819" style="s2">so yeah I think we&#39;ve got serious play</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.079" end="00:49:24.660" style="s2">there and that and that&#39;s overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.819" end="00:49:26.280" style="s2">with renewing nauseous so I also see</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.660" end="00:49:29.790" style="s2">that there are people who are doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.280" end="00:49:32.880" style="s2">serious play and renewing Nasus with you</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.790" end="00:49:34.770" style="s2">know with the framework that&#39;s been sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.880" end="00:49:36.390" style="s2">of tired to endure like Christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.770" end="00:49:37.260" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking of people we mentioned him</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.390" end="00:49:40.410" style="s2">multiple times</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.260" end="00:49:41.819" style="s2">Jonathan party no I think of the really</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.410" end="00:49:44.670" style="s2">interesting work that Paul bender clay</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.819" end="00:49:47.430" style="s2">is doing in which there&#39;s an attempt I</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.670" end="00:49:48.450" style="s2">die I give them a lot more credit than I</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.430" end="00:49:51.240" style="s2">think they do I think they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.450" end="00:49:53.089" style="s2">attempting to bring these elements or a</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.240" end="00:49:56.069" style="s2">claim that these elements can be found</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.089" end="00:49:59.540" style="s2">rehomed within Christianity and revived</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.069" end="00:50:03.900" style="s2">Christianity as an attempt to do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.540" end="00:50:06.290" style="s2">yes and in a very certain take a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.900" end="00:50:08.460" style="s2">again like to use the example of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.290" end="00:50:10.890" style="s2">Christian framework to take a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.460" end="00:50:12.690" style="s2">again you know and this is only one</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.890" end="00:50:14.549" style="s2">dimension of the complexity of that</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.690" end="00:50:17.280" style="s2">symbol but taking a symbol fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.549" end="00:50:19.230" style="s2">that has been constricted someone by the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.280" end="00:50:21.450" style="s2">ossification of the Crete that surrounds</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.230" end="00:50:24.030" style="s2">the praxis that surrounds yes Timothy</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.450" end="00:50:27.809" style="s2">burn conductivity of that symbol that</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.030" end="00:50:30.510" style="s2">has been inhibited by that the V the</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.809" end="00:50:33.210" style="s2">sort of the burgeoning fundamentalism</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.510" end="00:50:35.280" style="s2">and atheism right those twin totally</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.210" end="00:50:38.339" style="s2">confused responses to the diminishment</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.280" end="00:50:40.710" style="s2">of the power of that symbol and to try</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.339" end="00:50:42.569" style="s2">and take that symbol and not to act</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.710" end="00:50:44.579" style="s2">certainly not to extricate it from its</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.569" end="00:50:47.099" style="s2">mythos because it has to be couched to</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.579" end="00:50:49.130" style="s2">some degree in a myth Asin</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.099" end="00:50:51.960" style="s2">order to be viable but it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.130" end="00:50:55.430" style="s2">figuring the mythos in such a way as to</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.960" end="00:51:02.099" style="s2">free it from what have become a</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.430" end="00:51:04.109" style="s2">parasitic sort of creedal impositions so</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.099" end="00:51:06.390" style="s2">we would put things like the mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.109" end="00:51:08.190" style="s2">revolution here for example right</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.390" end="00:51:10.619" style="s2">because it&#39;s an attempt to write</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.190" end="00:51:13.140" style="s2">especially if they&#39;re trying to situate</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.619" end="00:51:14.880" style="s2">themselves within a community a ecology</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.140" end="00:51:16.859" style="s2">of practice not just meditate so they</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.880" end="00:51:19.079" style="s2">write relax or reduce stress but if</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.859" end="00:51:21.089" style="s2">they&#39;re pursuing it as a philosophy as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.079" end="00:51:24.509" style="s2">transformative way of life then we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.089" end="00:51:27.059" style="s2">got that also going in I would think we</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.509" end="00:51:28.859" style="s2">might want the like I said the authentic</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.059" end="00:51:31.440" style="s2">discourse would be like I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.859" end="00:51:33.180" style="s2">Peter Lindbergh&#39;s work right and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.440" end="00:51:34.829" style="s2">got the wisdom and Renaissance there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.180" end="00:51:37.319" style="s2">more and more people talking about</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.829" end="00:51:39.989" style="s2">wisdom ways of life and trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.319" end="00:51:42.690" style="s2">about not only in the popular world</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.989" end="00:51:44.609" style="s2">where like stoicism for example is</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.690" end="00:51:50.430" style="s2">becoming something that is becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.609" end="00:51:52.739" style="s2">and more about rebirth right but</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.430" end="00:51:55.769" style="s2">unfortunately it&#39;s it&#39;s a mistake in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.739" end="00:51:57.509" style="s2">law but it&#39;s having a revival and but I</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.769" end="00:51:58.769" style="s2">was also going to say the and I&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.509" end="00:52:01.259" style="s2">to talk about this later in the series</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.769" end="00:52:03.329" style="s2">the the academic scientific interest in</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.259" end="00:52:05.309" style="s2">wisdom has now come back what about the</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.329" end="00:52:08.489" style="s2">the psychedelic Renaissance I think this</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.309" end="00:52:10.410" style="s2">is also an attempt to renew gnosis it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.489" end="00:52:12.119" style="s2">an attempt to use psychedelics as long</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.410" end="00:52:16.829" style="s2">as they use it it&#39;s interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.119" end="00:52:18.210" style="s2">the use of fair enough so what I would</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.829" end="00:52:21.150" style="s2">argue and what I&#39;ve argued is where</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.210" end="00:52:23.549" style="s2">psychedelics are being set within again</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.150" end="00:52:24.779" style="s2">a set of psycho technologies with for</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.549" end="00:52:26.369" style="s2">the function of bringing about a higher</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.779" end="00:52:28.469" style="s2">state of consciousness and bringing</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.369" end="00:52:30.239" style="s2">about some fundamental Avenue and</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.469" end="00:52:32.130" style="s2">affordance of self-transcendent the</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.239" end="00:52:33.900" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom then we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.130" end="00:52:36.029" style="s2">that kind of thing here right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.900" end="00:52:37.710" style="s2">right okay so yes that says use the</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.029" end="00:52:39.719" style="s2">psychedelics as situated within a</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.710" end="00:52:41.819" style="s2">practice of some kind that trains it and</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.719" end="00:52:44.969" style="s2">in culturing so I think all of this end</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.819" end="00:52:47.190" style="s2">is very I&#39;m for me with its very hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.969" end="00:52:49.019" style="s2">but I I want to make a criticism here</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.190" end="00:52:51.779" style="s2">and it&#39;s meant to be a constructive</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.019" end="00:52:56.789" style="s2">criticism not a negative criticism I see</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.779" end="00:52:58.440" style="s2">a lot of this and again I&#39;m not trying</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.789" end="00:53:01.140" style="s2">to detract from the value but I see a</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.440" end="00:53:03.450" style="s2">lot of this as being very very bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.140" end="00:53:05.490" style="s2">right and that it there&#39;s a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.450" end="00:53:07.560" style="s2">practices emerging but how they should</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.490" end="00:53:11.310" style="s2">be coordinated and how they should be</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.560" end="00:53:14.490" style="s2">integrated related together and how that</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.310" end="00:53:17.100" style="s2">is supposed to ultimately fit back with</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.490" end="00:53:19.890" style="s2">right the the scientific worldview that</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.100" end="00:53:22.440" style="s2">is the dominant worldview of of the West</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.890" end="00:53:24.150" style="s2">so what I mean is there isn&#39;t we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.440" end="00:53:25.920" style="s2">the the bottom-up processing but we</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.150" end="00:53:28.560" style="s2">don&#39;t have the top-down wait we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.920" end="00:53:30.780" style="s2">have anything that is yet analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.560" end="00:53:32.550" style="s2">what the sacred canopy is and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.780" end="00:53:34.740" style="s2">and so what we&#39;re still struggling with</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.550" end="00:53:36.930" style="s2">right and when I talk to people about</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.740" end="00:53:38.490" style="s2">this they write some of these people</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.930" end="00:53:40.710" style="s2">this comes out that which is what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.490" end="00:53:45.030" style="s2">talked about this hard problem right we</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.710" end="00:53:47.760" style="s2">we this is still taking place against</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.030" end="00:53:50.940" style="s2">the backdrop right of the socio-economic</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.760" end="00:53:53.160" style="s2">crisis right the ecological crisis all</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.940" end="00:53:55.530" style="s2">these things that are a very exigent</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.160" end="00:53:57.450" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s having to it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.530" end="00:54:00.180" style="s2">it&#39;s an uphill battle because what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.450" end="00:54:03.620" style="s2">also doing is its having to it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.180" end="00:54:06.660" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s having to somehow</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.620" end="00:54:09.210" style="s2">circumnavigate all of this right because</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.660" end="00:54:12.060" style="s2">especially they mean this species that</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.210" end="00:54:14.970" style="s2">sort of that what we call generally neo</p>

<p begin="00:55:59.760" end="00:56:03.480" style="s2">of his work but what we&#39;re saying is</p>

<p begin="00:56:03.480" end="00:56:08.070" style="s2">nostalgia that is almost imprinted on us</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.150" end="00:56:09.720" style="s2">because of the grammar we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.070" end="00:56:11.280" style="s2">go back to the pseudo religious</p>

<p begin="00:56:29.280" end="00:56:34.290" style="s2">on in order to try and create the</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.530" end="00:56:36.750" style="s2">overarching structure that will organize</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.290" end="00:56:39.000" style="s2">the bottom-up change because arguably at</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.750" end="00:56:40.920" style="s2">the center of that structure the way it</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.000" end="00:56:42.660" style="s2">has been right our legacy from the</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.920" end="00:56:46.500" style="s2">actual religions is that does that that</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.660" end="00:56:48.990" style="s2">structure is anchored bias by some</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.500" end="00:56:51.390" style="s2">fundamental symbol that has enough by</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.990" end="00:56:52.710" style="s2">valence and complexity well at least</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.390" end="00:56:54.570" style="s2">sets of symbols like the two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.710" end="00:56:57.810" style="s2">mythology and all kinds of things but to</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.570" end="00:57:00.030" style="s2">be able to to be able to conduct that</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.810" end="00:57:02.930" style="s2">entire structure so in the absence and I</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.030" end="00:57:06.060" style="s2">think that&#39;s why there&#39;s an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.930" end="00:57:08.370" style="s2">salvage some of those axial symbols if</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.060" end="00:57:11.490" style="s2">not the entire practices not the entire</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.370" end="00:57:13.740" style="s2">mythos so what degree you can separate</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.490" end="00:57:16.050" style="s2">them is a really hard question right can</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.740" end="00:57:17.850" style="s2">you remove some desk from the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.050" end="00:57:20.220" style="s2">that has essentially birthed it and</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.850" end="00:57:21.690" style="s2">nurtured it and have it this is a little</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.220" end="00:57:22.260" style="s2">this is this is running through the</p>

<p begin="00:57:24.450" end="00:57:28.230" style="s2">from them so what degree can we is that</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.580" end="00:57:29.910" style="s2">is the question but there&#39;s an under</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.230" end="00:57:31.560" style="s2">attempt to salvage something because</p>
