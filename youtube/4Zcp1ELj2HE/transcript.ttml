<p begin="00:00:07.890" end="00:00:12.570" style="s2">so please welcome Daniel rotten burger</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.260" end="00:00:34.570" style="s2">hey thank you so Daniel if we just fast</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.680" end="00:00:41.160" style="s2">forward to 2020 2030 2040 2050 which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.570" end="00:00:51.450" style="s2">really going to the future what would an</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.160" end="00:00:54.190" style="s2">ideal hospital look like I think in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.450" end="00:00:56.110" style="s2">open space a lot of ideas were being</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.190" end="00:01:00.040" style="s2">brought up about that yesterday as well</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.110" end="00:01:01.989" style="s2">I think everybody has a clear sense that</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.040" end="00:01:03.880" style="s2">the environmental design and</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.989" end="00:01:06.729" style="s2">environmental psychology of the space is</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.880" end="00:01:11.350" style="s2">a huge part of it the air flow the</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.729" end="00:01:13.240" style="s2">lighting both natural lighting and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.350" end="00:01:15.729" style="s2">right spectrum and the right amount of</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.240" end="00:01:17.770" style="s2">lumens and really paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.729" end="00:01:19.180" style="s2">the way the environment is affecting the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.770" end="00:01:22.140" style="s2">health and the experience of the people</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.180" end="00:01:24.510" style="s2">in the space so the actual design of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.140" end="00:01:29.950" style="s2">infrastructure of the building itself I</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.510" end="00:01:33.220" style="s2">think the nature of the amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.950" end="00:01:34.869" style="s2">and also the amount of time that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.220" end="00:01:36.549" style="s2">providers get to spend with people and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.869" end="00:01:39.250" style="s2">also their training for the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.549" end="00:01:40.360" style="s2">time and how they spend that I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.250" end="00:01:42.570" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things we know about</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.360" end="00:01:45.189" style="s2">the tech that we want to see in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.570" end="00:01:48.549" style="s2">both much higher quality and less</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.189" end="00:01:51.640" style="s2">invasive Diagnostics and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.549" end="00:01:53.110" style="s2">of diagnostic tech that by some of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.640" end="00:01:56.619" style="s2">dates will be online that isn&#39;t now</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.110" end="00:01:58.450" style="s2">that&#39;ll make a huge difference the kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.619" end="00:02:00.340" style="s2">of dream of Thera knows that they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.450" end="00:02:02.020" style="s2">write it didn&#39;t really have the tech for</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.340" end="00:02:03.310" style="s2">their there is tech that will achieve</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.020" end="00:02:05.740" style="s2">things like that there&#39;s a company</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.310" end="00:02:08.709" style="s2">called gene radar coming out of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.740" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">company called now bio sim that I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.709" end="00:02:11.550" style="s2">will probably make huge</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.840" end="00:02:14.790" style="s2">in that time and other tech like it</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.550" end="00:02:17.030" style="s2">where instead of needing reagents to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.790" end="00:02:20.160" style="s2">able to do blood labs we can simply do</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.030" end="00:02:21.810" style="s2">chip based amplification and so a single</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.160" end="00:02:25.739" style="s2">drop of blood can be able to measure</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.810" end="00:02:27.870" style="s2">every biometric and if you imagine not</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.739" end="00:02:29.670" style="s2">having the cost associated then just run</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.870" end="00:02:31.980" style="s2">every biometric every time on every one</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.670" end="00:02:33.540" style="s2">run big data analysis on an individual</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.980" end="00:02:35.580" style="s2">person longitudinally over their life</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.540" end="00:02:36.870" style="s2">plus on lots of people and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.580" end="00:02:39.569" style="s2">just in the hospital that can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.870" end="00:02:41.700" style="s2">decentralized so that we start finding</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.569" end="00:02:44.340" style="s2">early disease indicators and being able</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.700" end="00:02:46.470" style="s2">to prevent most things so I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.340" end="00:02:48.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of examples of better</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.470" end="00:02:51.450" style="s2">diagnostics and machine learning that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.600" end="00:02:53.310" style="s2">can augment the human doctor and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.450" end="00:02:55.620" style="s2">healthcare provider capacity so that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.310" end="00:02:57.450" style="s2">healthcare provider can be much more</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.620" end="00:03:00.090" style="s2">focused on actually connecting to people</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.450" end="00:03:02.190" style="s2">and taking in the kind of diagnostic</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.090" end="00:03:03.720" style="s2">info that humans are uniquely good at</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.190" end="00:03:07.110" style="s2">that machines don&#39;t do as good a job at</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.720" end="00:03:08.970" style="s2">which is less biometric specified and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.110" end="00:03:10.680" style="s2">more being able to get the gestalt of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.970" end="00:03:13.940" style="s2">the person that lets you even know what</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.680" end="00:03:16.109" style="s2">to look for and how to interpret it so</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.940" end="00:03:21.420" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things like this that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.109" end="00:03:24.390" style="s2">we could talk about one of them was</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.420" end="00:03:28.290" style="s2">mentioned yesterday that I just feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.390" end="00:03:30.569" style="s2">like bringing up is the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.290" end="00:03:33.359" style="s2">hospital would feel more like a sacred</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.569" end="00:03:35.790" style="s2">place like a temple of some sort seems</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.359" end="00:03:37.380" style="s2">to be at the heart if if we put that at</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.790" end="00:03:40.319" style="s2">the heart of the consideration a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.380" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">other things make more sense yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.319" end="00:03:45.950" style="s2">when you talk about heart based medicine</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:45.950" style="s2">obviously we want a medicine that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.280" end="00:03:51.630" style="s2">really excellent in terms of operations</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.900" end="00:03:53.549" style="s2">and we want a medicine that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.630" end="00:03:56.670" style="s2">excellent in terms of the actual science</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.549" end="00:03:58.650" style="s2">and the technology of it but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.670" end="00:04:01.250" style="s2">motivating all of it is the sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.650" end="00:04:03.329" style="s2">of human life and human experience and</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.250" end="00:04:04.799" style="s2">wanting to be able to support people to</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.329" end="00:04:06.630" style="s2">have the highest quality experience and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.799" end="00:04:08.519" style="s2">the highest quality capacity to offer</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.630" end="00:04:11.850" style="s2">what if there&#39;s to offer while they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.519" end="00:04:15.150" style="s2">here and so that every one in the health</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.850" end="00:04:17.519" style="s2">care space remembers</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.150" end="00:04:19.470" style="s2">and continuously that that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.519" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">why they&#39;re there and the entire design</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.470" end="00:04:24.419" style="s2">is around supporting that experience you</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:26.850" style="s2">know you were talking about experiences</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.419" end="00:04:28.400" style="s2">where people died in your care and where</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.850" end="00:04:32.250" style="s2">they died in ways that were really</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.400" end="00:04:34.590" style="s2">beautiful versus painful based on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.250" end="00:04:36.690" style="s2">nature of the care so if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.590" end="00:04:39.419" style="s2">a hospital as a place where people will</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.690" end="00:04:41.010" style="s2">be born and people will die and people</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.419" end="00:04:43.710" style="s2">will be brought back from death and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.010" end="00:04:45.479" style="s2">people will have the chance to have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.710" end="00:04:48.930" style="s2">totally different life trajectory based</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.479" end="00:04:51.449" style="s2">on the care they get like the sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.930" end="00:04:56.729" style="s2">of life is more on the altar there than</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.449" end="00:04:59.100" style="s2">may be anywhere else and I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.729" end="00:05:01.620" style="s2">see something where the doctors and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.100" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">nurses go through a ritual before they</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.620" end="00:05:06.990" style="s2">actually enter every time not it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:08.070" style="s2">a dogma because the moment the moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.990" end="00:05:09.870" style="s2">that there is an intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.070" end="00:05:11.970" style="s2">recognized Dharma that becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.870" end="00:05:14.160" style="s2">protocol becomes a dogma then obviously</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.970" end="00:05:15.750" style="s2">just becomes performative lifeless and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.160" end="00:05:19.349" style="s2">you either do the performative thing or</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.750" end="00:05:21.150" style="s2">just reject it but if someone actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.349" end="00:05:22.530" style="s2">kind of reconnected to the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.150" end="00:05:24.050" style="s2">beautiful experience as they had in</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.530" end="00:05:26.190" style="s2">medicine the most heart-wrenching</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.050" end="00:05:28.889" style="s2">experiences why they were there what the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.190" end="00:05:31.440" style="s2">Hippocratic oath was and why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.889" end="00:05:34.289" style="s2">there the way that would affect the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.440" end="00:05:36.930" style="s2">quality of the interactions and not just</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.289" end="00:05:39.240" style="s2">from the point of view that patients</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.930" end="00:05:40.919" style="s2">experience would be better but also the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.240" end="00:05:44.010" style="s2">actual quality of the care would make a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.919" end="00:05:45.300" style="s2">tremendous difference so we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.010" end="00:05:46.979" style="s2">about a lot of things based on</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.300" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">specifically what we have this bait</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.979" end="00:05:50.699" style="s2">might be available in those different</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.240" end="00:05:53.010" style="s2">time lines what things we could do</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.699" end="00:05:54.060" style="s2">retrofitting existing hospitals versus</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.010" end="00:05:56.490" style="s2">where we need to build them from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.060" end="00:05:58.530" style="s2">ground up what things we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.490" end="00:06:00.090" style="s2">thinking of a hospital versus where we</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.530" end="00:06:04.289" style="s2">start to think about decentralizing</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.090" end="00:06:06.660" style="s2">healthcare into all of life so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.289" end="00:06:09.120" style="s2">start hahaha wonderful thank you so many</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.660" end="00:06:12.060" style="s2">open questions let&#39;s sum you were</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.120" end="00:06:15.590" style="s2">putting the temple in the center so</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.060" end="00:06:17.660" style="s2">maybe let&#39;s start with the center</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.590" end="00:06:20.690" style="s2">and I believe it&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.660" end="00:06:24.860" style="s2">describing is that the subjective</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.690" end="00:06:27.979" style="s2">experience of a true dedication of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.860" end="00:06:30.139" style="s2">true interest of the healthcare provider</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.979" end="00:06:32.419" style="s2">so rather than busy being busy with</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.139" end="00:06:35.510" style="s2">themselves but actually truly caring</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.419" end="00:06:40.040" style="s2">about the person they&#39;re under the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.510" end="00:06:43.880" style="s2">indica that subjective experience will</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.040" end="00:06:46.520" style="s2">improve the quality of care not only in</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.880" end="00:06:48.680" style="s2">terms of making less mistakes like this</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.520" end="00:06:51.080" style="s2">is I realized it&#39;s the first time when I</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.680" end="00:06:52.639" style="s2">know where I learned to make all these</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.080" end="00:06:53.750" style="s2">prescriptions and so here you go and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.639" end="00:06:54.889" style="s2">here&#39;s another one and here&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.750" end="00:06:58.220" style="s2">one here&#39;s another one in you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.889" end="00:07:01.310" style="s2">describing and then I realized suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.220" end="00:07:02.750" style="s2">my kids were in hospital and I sit there</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.310" end="00:07:05.210" style="s2">and say like okay all right now my kids</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.750" end="00:07:09.620" style="s2">that hospital next one next and then hmm</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.210" end="00:07:12.050" style="s2">so I really want that such an important</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.620" end="00:07:15.199" style="s2">moment to realize that when I see</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.050" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">children and I prescription based on</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.199" end="00:07:19.940" style="s2">what their disease is or I make a</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.840" end="00:07:22.100" style="s2">prescription for somebody that I have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.940" end="00:07:25.639" style="s2">personal direct relation with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.100" end="00:07:27.560" style="s2">somehow there&#39;s a moment of mmm there so</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.639" end="00:07:29.539" style="s2">the quality I&#39;d completely agree that</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.560" end="00:07:33.229" style="s2">the quality of care when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.539" end="00:07:35.990" style="s2">patient safety a big topic today if we</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.229" end="00:07:38.950" style="s2">talk about patient safety we improve the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.990" end="00:07:42.800" style="s2">way that healthcare providers show up</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.950" end="00:07:44.510" style="s2">this will improve the quality of care</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.800" end="00:07:47.150" style="s2">will improve the safety of the patient</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.510" end="00:07:50.780" style="s2">but it will also improve patient</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.150" end="00:07:54.979" style="s2">satisfaction and so there&#39;s a subjective</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.780" end="00:07:58.940" style="s2">experience on the other side so what</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.979" end="00:08:00.530" style="s2">could you see as steps taken well no</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.940" end="00:08:03.440" style="s2">let&#39;s start with the end in mind what</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.530" end="00:08:06.080" style="s2">would you see in you know 20 30 40 50</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.440" end="00:08:08.539" style="s2">what might be the way that what might</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.080" end="00:08:09.950" style="s2">describe or constitute the relation</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.539" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">between a health care provider and a</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.950" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">patient</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.730" end="00:08:22.700" style="s2">so you mentioned less mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.360" end="00:08:27.290" style="s2">I think getting rid of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.700" end="00:08:29.570" style="s2">avoidable iatrogenic illness is it would</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.290" end="00:08:32.030" style="s2">take a few things increased presence on</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.570" end="00:08:33.650" style="s2">the part of the doctors and pharmacists</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.030" end="00:08:36.470" style="s2">and nurses is going to make a huge</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.650" end="00:08:37.910" style="s2">difference to that it&#39;s not only that</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.470" end="00:08:42.370" style="s2">though it&#39;s also the medical training</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.910" end="00:08:45.770" style="s2">upfront it&#39;s also removing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.370" end="00:08:47.840" style="s2">financialization of Medicine that ends</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.770" end="00:08:49.460" style="s2">up influencing the training and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.840" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">incentive structures of the doctors as</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.460" end="00:08:52.670" style="s2">long as the hospital has to have the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.720" end="00:08:53.870" style="s2">doctors seeing more people per day or in</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.670" end="00:08:55.130" style="s2">private practice you have to see more</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.870" end="00:08:57.530" style="s2">people per day the mistakes are just</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.130" end="00:08:59.240" style="s2">going to go up so some of it can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.530" end="00:09:01.040" style="s2">addressed at the bottom of level of</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.240" end="00:09:02.300" style="s2">things individual doctors can do some of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.040" end="00:09:04.430" style="s2">it really has to be addressed at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.300" end="00:09:06.200" style="s2">top-down level of the of the major</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.430" end="00:09:07.790" style="s2">top-down institutions that are affecting</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.200" end="00:09:10.130" style="s2">medicine and optimizing for something</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.790" end="00:09:11.810" style="s2">other than quality of care and if we</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.130" end="00:09:13.550" style="s2">have trillions of dollars a year</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.810" end="00:09:15.980" style="s2">optimizing for things other than quality</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.550" end="00:09:18.530" style="s2">of care compared to the relatively small</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.980" end="00:09:20.960" style="s2">level of a few doctors that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.530" end="00:09:24.470" style="s2">actually an asymmetric warfare against</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.960" end="00:09:26.720" style="s2">health right as long as at a federal</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.470" end="00:09:28.790" style="s2">level we want to optimize GDP and we met</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.720" end="00:09:30.710" style="s2">we think about GDP as a sign of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.790" end="00:09:32.420" style="s2">success of the country sick people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.710" end="00:09:34.460" style="s2">better for GDP than healthy people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.420" end="00:09:37.220" style="s2">in a narrow point of view in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.460" end="00:09:39.170" style="s2">medicine and obviously this the same for</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.220" end="00:09:42.170" style="s2">a pharmaceutical companies incentive or</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.170" end="00:09:44.450" style="s2">things like that if if we could just</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.170" end="00:09:47.390" style="s2">prevent medicine by making healthy</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.450" end="00:09:49.640" style="s2">people we would obviously have the best</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.390" end="00:09:51.350" style="s2">system of health care and it would</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.640" end="00:09:52.940" style="s2">totally tank GDP from both a</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.350" end="00:09:54.200" style="s2">pharmaceutical and hospital revenue</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.940" end="00:09:57.230" style="s2">point of view as well as from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.200" end="00:09:59.570" style="s2">revenue of food drug etc companies that</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.230" end="00:10:01.580" style="s2">make more money off addiction</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.570" end="00:10:03.260" style="s2">so there&#39;s systemic factors as well as</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.580" end="00:10:05.300" style="s2">kind of individual practitioner factors</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.260" end="00:10:08.630" style="s2">that have to be addressed to remove</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.300" end="00:10:16.220" style="s2">iatrogenic disease and then as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.630" end="00:10:18.470" style="s2">mentioning the the increased presence of</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.220" end="00:10:20.810" style="s2">a practitioner with a person who is in</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.470" end="00:10:22.450" style="s2">one of the most disturbing positions</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.810" end="00:10:24.280" style="s2">people can be in where the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.450" end="00:10:26.770" style="s2">quality of their life or their loved</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.280" end="00:10:28.180" style="s2">ones life is like up in the air and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.770" end="00:10:29.860" style="s2">don&#39;t have the technical expertise to</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.180" end="00:10:31.930" style="s2">know how it&#39;s going to go and so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.860" end="00:10:34.900" style="s2">trusting a stranger with the most</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.930" end="00:10:36.190" style="s2">precious thing to them actually feeling</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.900" end="00:10:37.900" style="s2">the care and the presence and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.190" end="00:10:40.660" style="s2">attention of that stranger is gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.900" end="00:10:45.850" style="s2">a huge difference where even if the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.660" end="00:10:48.280" style="s2">thing is uncurable the actual experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.850" end="00:10:49.720" style="s2">of someone is a terminal value in and of</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.280" end="00:10:53.860" style="s2">itself independent of how that</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.720" end="00:10:55.270" style="s2">translates to objective outcomes and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.860" end="00:10:58.270" style="s2">will translate to objective outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.270" end="00:10:59.800" style="s2">both in terms of increased diagnostic</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.270" end="00:11:05.140" style="s2">insight on the part of the practitioner</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.800" end="00:11:07.690" style="s2">and a psychologically better state and</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.140" end="00:11:10.570" style="s2">less stress on the part of the patient</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.690" end="00:11:13.690" style="s2">is going to help their healing process</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.570" end="00:11:15.960" style="s2">so I mean this is just kind of recapping</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.690" end="00:11:21.610" style="s2">why heart based medicine matters right</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.960" end="00:11:22.480" style="s2">and then I don&#39;t think any of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.610" end="00:11:25.720" style="s2">answered your question</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.480" end="00:11:27.790" style="s2">your question was out we will constitute</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.720" end="00:11:30.430" style="s2">the relation between the health care</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.790" end="00:11:32.770" style="s2">provider and the patient and so you</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.430" end="00:11:36.010" style="s2">mentioned quality of care and we started</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.770" end="00:11:38.500" style="s2">at kind of avoiding mistakes but we made</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.010" end="00:11:41.080" style="s2">just as we look at disease on a systemic</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.500" end="00:11:42.670" style="s2">level we look at mistakes in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.080" end="00:11:45.370" style="s2">heart based medicine we want to look at</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.670" end="00:11:49.630" style="s2">kind of shift the attention a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.370" end="00:11:52.000" style="s2">away from disease towards health so on</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.630" end="00:11:55.360" style="s2">that systemic level we may want to ask</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.000" end="00:11:57.850" style="s2">what is quality of care yeah when we</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.360" end="00:12:00.070" style="s2">when we shift it towards the positive</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.850" end="00:12:01.930" style="s2">outcome towards the potential and how</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.070" end="00:12:05.230" style="s2">might that be a constituent of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.930" end="00:12:07.120" style="s2">relationship between so let me do a</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.230" end="00:12:08.710" style="s2">long-range version of this and not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.120" end="00:12:11.530" style="s2">try and specify the time line it&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.710" end="00:12:13.000" style="s2">do a it will generally be hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.530" end="00:12:17.950" style="s2">trending in this direction if it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.000" end="00:12:20.140" style="s2">the right path so let&#39;s say we look at</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.950" end="00:12:21.940" style="s2">the trend of technological automation to</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.140" end="00:12:23.830" style="s2">automate things that we can procedural</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.940" end="00:12:26.200" style="s2">eyes that&#39;ll affect some things in</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.830" end="00:12:27.310" style="s2">medicine and hopefully it will because</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.200" end="00:12:28.570" style="s2">that would be great there are some</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.310" end="00:12:31.120" style="s2">things that machines can do as well or</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.570" end="00:12:32.410" style="s2">better and it won&#39;t affect other things</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.120" end="00:12:34.819" style="s2">and if it does I&#39;d be a bummer because</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.410" end="00:12:38.660" style="s2">they do it less well</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.819" end="00:12:41.239" style="s2">but outside of medicine most of the jobs</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.660" end="00:12:43.309" style="s2">that people like the least are some of</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.239" end="00:12:45.079" style="s2">the ones that are most available to</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.309" end="00:12:47.209" style="s2">technological automation because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.079" end="00:12:48.709" style="s2">the more procedural something is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.209" end="00:12:50.119" style="s2">easier it is to automate the more</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.709" end="00:12:51.829" style="s2">procedural it is also the less</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.119" end="00:12:53.479" style="s2">creativity and learning is involved it</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.829" end="00:12:55.039" style="s2">means we have the less less intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.479" end="00:12:59.569" style="s2">motive for a human to feel like they can</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.039" end="00:13:01.819" style="s2">self actualize there and so as we</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.569" end="00:13:03.589" style="s2">progress to more technological</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.819" end="00:13:05.389" style="s2">automation and more categories we also</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.589" end="00:13:08.389" style="s2">start to change a lot of the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.389" end="00:13:10.639" style="s2">assumptions within market theory that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.389" end="00:13:12.470" style="s2">need people to do the jobs so we need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:14.779" style="s2">make it to where the people need the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.470" end="00:13:17.269" style="s2">jobs well we don&#39;t need people to do a</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.779" end="00:13:20.059" style="s2">lot of the jobs then we can also start</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.269" end="00:13:22.129" style="s2">to create more of Commonwealth resources</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.059" end="00:13:23.689" style="s2">that take care of people&#39;s needs to have</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.129" end="00:13:25.489" style="s2">a system that is more focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.689" end="00:13:27.470" style="s2">intrinsic incentive of people than the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.489" end="00:13:28.939" style="s2">extrinsic incentives when you want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.470" end="00:13:31.160" style="s2">get people to when you have to get</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.939" end="00:13:33.259" style="s2">people to do shitty labor stuff you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.160" end="00:13:34.759" style="s2">to extrinsic lis and sent them when more</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.259" end="00:13:36.229" style="s2">of that&#39;s automated then we get to</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.759" end="00:13:37.850" style="s2">facilitate what is actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.229" end="00:13:39.049" style="s2">intrinsically interesting and meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.850" end="00:13:40.789" style="s2">for people and it&#39;s not just playing</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.049" end="00:13:42.649" style="s2">video games all the time if they get to</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.789" end="00:13:44.269" style="s2">be facilitated to recognize that their</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.649" end="00:13:46.669" style="s2">short time here can actually mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.269" end="00:13:48.470" style="s2">something and I think the things that</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.669" end="00:13:51.019" style="s2">people will most want to do have to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.470" end="00:13:52.579" style="s2">with connection creativity and healing</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.019" end="00:13:56.269" style="s2">and so I think there will be a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.579" end="00:13:59.569" style="s2">people in the healing professions and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.269" end="00:14:01.699" style="s2">think as we think less and less in terms</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.569" end="00:14:03.919" style="s2">of how do I think of this as a way to</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.699" end="00:14:05.389" style="s2">financially support myself and more in</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.919" end="00:14:07.879" style="s2">terms of if finances were already</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.389" end="00:14:09.499" style="s2">supported what would I want to do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.879" end="00:14:11.269" style="s2">of people want to do things that involve</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.499" end="00:14:13.699" style="s2">connecting with other people in ways</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.269" end="00:14:15.639" style="s2">that contribute to the quality of their</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.699" end="00:14:18.399" style="s2">life and that&#39;s everything from like</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.639" end="00:14:22.459" style="s2">music therapy and art therapy and</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.399" end="00:14:24.409" style="s2">psycho-spiritual practice to training</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.459" end="00:14:26.779" style="s2">people&#39;s physical bodies and like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.409" end="00:14:29.929" style="s2">so I think the role of the doctor will</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.779" end="00:14:31.279" style="s2">become largely decentralized to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.929" end="00:14:33.079" style="s2">other things that are promoting</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.279" end="00:14:35.100" style="s2">well-being more than just dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.079" end="00:14:38.540" style="s2">the after-effects of not promoting well</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.100" end="00:14:41.340" style="s2">and similarly to our when we say</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.540" end="00:14:43.350" style="s2">removing iatrogenic disease requires not</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.340" end="00:14:46.260" style="s2">just change on the doctor part but also</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.350" end="00:14:48.330" style="s2">the structural incentives that lead to</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.260" end="00:14:50.550" style="s2">higher trajectories if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.330" end="00:14:51.960" style="s2">obsolete as much of Medicine as possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.550" end="00:14:54.750" style="s2">we have to look at what the upstream</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.960" end="00:14:57.060" style="s2">causes of the problems are so obviously</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.750" end="00:14:58.590" style="s2">if we if we don&#39;t just look at</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.060" end="00:14:59.880" style="s2">healthcare but we look at the embedding</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.590" end="00:15:00.960" style="s2">environment of things that affect</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.880" end="00:15:03.150" style="s2">people&#39;s health and we&#39;re pumping</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.960" end="00:15:04.710" style="s2">billions of tons of glyphosate and other</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.150" end="00:15:06.510" style="s2">pesticides and herbicides and</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.710" end="00:15:08.670" style="s2">petrochemical toxins into the atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.510" end="00:15:11.400" style="s2">and into people&#39;s food supply and water</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.670" end="00:15:13.170" style="s2">supply continuously and embedding them</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.400" end="00:15:14.820" style="s2">in the manufacturing process in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.170" end="00:15:18.390" style="s2">carpet and the paint and where all of</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.820" end="00:15:19.920" style="s2">our environments are actually toxic to</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.390" end="00:15:21.120" style="s2">the way we genetically evolved we</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.920" end="00:15:23.210" style="s2">genetically evolved to an environment</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.120" end="00:15:26.850" style="s2">that didn&#39;t have organophosphates and</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.210" end="00:15:29.160" style="s2">you know neo- know it&#39;s being able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.850" end="00:15:32.010" style="s2">change those things also obsolete so</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.160" end="00:15:35.520" style="s2">much of the things that are upstream</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.010" end="00:15:37.860" style="s2">contributing to so much of the chronic</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.520" end="00:15:39.570" style="s2">complex illness then you start to think</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.860" end="00:15:42.060" style="s2">about the changes in agriculture to</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.570" end="00:15:43.710" style="s2">actually remineralize top soils and</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.060" end="00:15:46.500" style="s2">affect the microbiome of the top soils</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.710" end="00:15:49.350" style="s2">and the quality of the you know food</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.500" end="00:15:52.530" style="s2">that&#39;s coming out and again we have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.350" end="00:15:54.150" style="s2">ask can we have healthy people and in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.530" end="00:15:56.580" style="s2">society where almost everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.150" end="00:15:58.800" style="s2">stressed out due to macroeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.580" end="00:16:04.800" style="s2">pressures and due to socio political</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.800" end="00:16:06.660" style="s2">instability continuously and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.800" end="00:16:08.700" style="s2">there&#39;s still gonna be situations where</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.660" end="00:16:10.320" style="s2">no matter how well we design it somebody</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.700" end="00:16:11.700" style="s2">falls and hits their head and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.320" end="00:16:13.290" style="s2">deal with that or something that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.700" end="00:16:16.410" style="s2">haven&#39;t been able to tend to comes up</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.290" end="00:16:19.140" style="s2">but with most of the causes of illness</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.410" end="00:16:22.050" style="s2">are actually structurally induced at</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.140" end="00:16:23.340" style="s2">scale in ways that are affecting</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.050" end="00:16:28.170" style="s2">everyone and you actually can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.340" end="00:16:29.580" style="s2">avoid currently so I&#39;m answering the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.170" end="00:16:32.340" style="s2">question about the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.580" end="00:16:34.410" style="s2">the practitioner partly saying</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.340" end="00:16:36.120" style="s2">most of the things practitioners are</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.410" end="00:16:37.620" style="s2">currently looking at I would like to not</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.120" end="00:16:39.660" style="s2">exist at all because we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.620" end="00:16:41.520" style="s2">them upstream both by doing health</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.660" end="00:16:42.400" style="s2">promotion and by stopping the things</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.520" end="00:16:45.520" style="s2">that are doing health degra</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.400" end="00:16:50.890" style="s2">datian so that&#39;s the first part then we</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.520" end="00:16:52.630" style="s2">can get into what the when disease is</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.890" end="00:16:54.100" style="s2">manifesting and we need to deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.630" end="00:16:57.330" style="s2">what that looks like but we would like</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.100" end="00:17:00.160" style="s2">to mostly just shrink that category hmm</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.330" end="00:17:02.140" style="s2">thank you so before we go we will</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.160" end="00:17:06.250" style="s2">definitely need to talk about the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.140" end="00:17:09.970" style="s2">wider picture of healthcare or healthy</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.250" end="00:17:12.310" style="s2">life and the question of how might we</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.970" end="00:17:15.130" style="s2">and if we were to be able to redesign</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.310" end="00:17:16.780" style="s2">the healthcare system and just</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.130" end="00:17:18.490" style="s2">completely kind of clean the table start</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.780" end="00:17:21.070" style="s2">out-of-the-box what would it could it</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.490" end="00:17:23.140" style="s2">look like and those will be questions</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.070" end="00:17:25.270" style="s2">that we would need to answer and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.140" end="00:17:27.220" style="s2">let&#39;s come back to those so if you allow</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.270" end="00:17:31.000" style="s2">let&#39;s stay a little bit longer with with</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.220" end="00:17:32.980" style="s2">the environment that is kind of closer</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.000" end="00:17:37.170" style="s2">to us right now before we redesign</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.980" end="00:17:39.430" style="s2">everything yeah so when I look at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.170" end="00:17:43.810" style="s2">the relation between the health care</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.430" end="00:17:47.170" style="s2">provider and and the patient one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.810" end="00:17:49.030" style="s2">obvious changes right now and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.170" end="00:17:52.030" style="s2">alluded to this is the automation of</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.030" end="00:17:55.380" style="s2">healthcare so more and more processes</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.030" end="00:17:57.970" style="s2">that you know just take knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.380" end="00:18:00.910" style="s2">there&#39;s all the things that I learned in</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.970" end="00:18:05.050" style="s2">medical school in terms of data to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.910" end="00:18:07.180" style="s2">you know memorized all the effort it</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.050" end="00:18:09.040" style="s2">took in in the initial years of my</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.180" end="00:18:11.200" style="s2">existence to go through paper cards and</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.040" end="00:18:12.960" style="s2">finding that paper in Paris and filling</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.200" end="00:18:15.610" style="s2">out a form and ordering it from this</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.960" end="00:18:16.960" style="s2">library in Paris in four weeks later</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.610" end="00:18:19.270" style="s2">that paper would arrive and now</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.960" end="00:18:20.950" style="s2">everything is available online and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.270" end="00:18:22.660" style="s2">have search engines and text mining and</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.950" end="00:18:25.030" style="s2">we can integrate all of this and some</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.660" end="00:18:26.950" style="s2">fantastic new technologies already</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.030" end="00:18:30.010" style="s2">collecting information and processing</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.950" end="00:18:32.890" style="s2">this information for me so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.010" end="00:18:34.900" style="s2">that&#39;s one element so how am I going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.890" end="00:18:37.240" style="s2">deal with data now I sometimes feel like</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.900" end="00:18:38.800" style="s2">I&#39;m in a data crisis actually I yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.240" end="00:18:41.410" style="s2">the beginning it was a problem to find</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.800" end="00:18:44.230" style="s2">information now I feel like I have</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.410" end="00:18:46.030" style="s2">enough I can&#39;t process more so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.230" end="00:18:47.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge development and another</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.030" end="00:18:50.380" style="s2">huge development is that the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.920" end="00:18:52.240" style="s2">technological impact so all the devices</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.380" end="00:18:53.840" style="s2">that we have all the techniques and</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.240" end="00:18:56.269" style="s2">technologies that we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.840" end="00:18:58.849" style="s2">that actually seem like seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.269" end="00:19:01.759" style="s2">more authority than my own clinical</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.849" end="00:19:04.549" style="s2">assessment so I used to you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.759" end="00:19:08.179" style="s2">actually do a crazy thing and examine</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.549" end="00:19:11.029" style="s2">patients you know now when I examine a</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.179" end="00:19:13.309" style="s2">patient and if there&#39;s something I would</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.029" end="00:19:15.859" style="s2">have to validate my finding by some kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.309" end="00:19:18.169" style="s2">of technology so if I feel that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.859" end="00:19:19.759" style="s2">some you know something you know I feel</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.169" end="00:19:21.649" style="s2">the liver is a little bit larger than I</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.759" end="00:19:23.570" style="s2">would expect and the next step would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.649" end="00:19:24.379" style="s2">to get an ultrasound to validate that</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.570" end="00:19:27.019" style="s2">that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.379" end="00:19:29.869" style="s2">and it used to be that that that was the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.019" end="00:19:32.239" style="s2">finding so somehow this the technology</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.869" end="00:19:33.950" style="s2">is becoming is is becoming the reference</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.239" end="00:19:35.719" style="s2">point is the kind of the objective</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.950" end="00:19:39.429" style="s2">measure and whatever we do as human</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.719" end="00:19:44.509" style="s2">beings is measured against technology</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.429" end="00:19:46.669" style="s2">this is worrying to me do you see that</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.509" end="00:19:48.589" style="s2">you know the the profession of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.669" end="00:19:50.149" style="s2">physician will be replaced by technology</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.589" end="00:19:53.389" style="s2">at some point are we going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.149" end="00:19:55.909" style="s2">robot where I just you know like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.389" end="00:19:57.679" style="s2">little photo cameras that you had at</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.909" end="00:20:00.109" style="s2">stations or you sit in you get four</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.679" end="00:20:02.419" style="s2">pictures and so I just walk into some</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.109" end="00:20:03.889" style="s2">station or some office and then I put my</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.419" end="00:20:06.019" style="s2">finger in there take a bit of blood and</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.889" end="00:20:07.909" style="s2">maybe you take a little swallow of my my</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.019" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">epithelium in the mouth and and there</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.909" end="00:20:14.799" style="s2">you go and two minutes later I get some</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:14.799" style="s2">report is this the future of medicine</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.969" end="00:20:25.700" style="s2">hopefully yes and now there are things</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.789" end="00:20:27.769" style="s2">that machine learning can do really</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.700" end="00:20:29.509" style="s2">better than human cognition there are</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.769" end="00:20:32.690" style="s2">things a human cognition do that machine</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.509" end="00:20:36.399" style="s2">learning can do at all whether we get to</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.690" end="00:20:38.629" style="s2">artificial general intelligence or not</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.399" end="00:20:41.149" style="s2">obviously change is that story of it</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.629" end="00:20:42.950" style="s2">because then we&#39;re talking about things</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.149" end="00:20:47.779" style="s2">that are less like machines and more</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.950" end="00:20:50.359" style="s2">like other kinds of beings I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.779" end="00:20:51.739" style="s2">we&#39;re close to that so we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.359" end="00:20:53.419" style="s2">talking about machine learning and</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.739" end="00:20:57.440" style="s2">machine learning mostly that is narrow</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.419" end="00:21:00.660" style="s2">in type and so what I think that means</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.440" end="00:21:03.800" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.660" end="00:21:07.020" style="s2">the machine learning and the Diagnostics</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.800" end="00:21:08.400" style="s2">augment our capacity radically in good</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.020" end="00:21:11.040" style="s2">ways in the way already your stethoscope</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.400" end="00:21:12.540" style="s2">and your microscope and your you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.040" end="00:21:14.280" style="s2">whatever tools your glasses you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.540" end="00:21:17.010" style="s2">wearing right now are augmenting your</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.280" end="00:21:22.770" style="s2">capacity and it&#39;s just continued tools</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.010" end="00:21:24.390" style="s2">that can do that so we learn new metrics</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.770" end="00:21:25.860" style="s2">new biometrics all the time parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.390" end="00:21:27.450" style="s2">body we didn&#39;t even know existed or</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.860" end="00:21:28.620" style="s2">parts of physiology or new types of</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.450" end="00:21:29.820" style="s2">proteins and then they&#39;re like the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.620" end="00:21:32.250" style="s2">center of everything and they&#39;re super</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.820" end="00:21:34.740" style="s2">important we can anticipate that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.250" end="00:21:36.600" style="s2">continues for a long time that 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.740" end="00:21:37.980" style="s2">from now Nobel Prizes will be one about</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.600" end="00:21:39.210" style="s2">like breakthrough stuff that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.980" end="00:21:42.000" style="s2">even know about right now that will be</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.210" end="00:21:43.380" style="s2">the main stuff to look out and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.000" end="00:21:44.550" style="s2">there&#39;s no way we&#39;re testing that right</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.380" end="00:21:45.990" style="s2">now and there&#39;s no way that the machine</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.550" end="00:21:48.090" style="s2">learning is paying attention to that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.990" end="00:21:49.620" style="s2">yet some of it still comes through a</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.090" end="00:21:52.830" style="s2">kind of heuristic or intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.620" end="00:21:55.200" style="s2">sensibility where you&#39;re feeling the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.830" end="00:21:56.880" style="s2">liver and you have some sense even if</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.200" end="00:21:58.710" style="s2">the liver enzymes don&#39;t indicate it or</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.880" end="00:22:04.410" style="s2">whatever some other test that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.710" end="00:22:06.720" style="s2">currently have does so I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.410" end="00:22:09.450" style="s2">human capacity for general intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.720" end="00:22:12.380" style="s2">which includes intuition and things</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.450" end="00:22:16.050" style="s2">beyond what we currently have metrics on</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.380" end="00:22:18.330" style="s2">becomes increasingly important as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.050" end="00:22:21.900" style="s2">able to offload more of the specialized</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.330" end="00:22:23.840" style="s2">narrow intelligence so then the role of</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.900" end="00:22:27.510" style="s2">the doctor the practitioner is largely</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.840" end="00:22:29.070" style="s2">one that intermediates between really</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.510" end="00:22:34.130" style="s2">being able to connect with the patient</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.070" end="00:22:36.330" style="s2">and a holistic generalized intuitive and</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.130" end="00:22:37.920" style="s2">obviously enough cognitive knowledge to</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.330" end="00:22:40.620" style="s2">even know how to use this database way</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.920" end="00:22:43.470" style="s2">but then it doesn&#39;t depend exclusively</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.620" end="00:22:45.060" style="s2">on their own memory we already don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.470" end="00:22:47.040" style="s2">already offload it to books it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.060" end="00:22:51.000" style="s2">much better versions of books and papers</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.040" end="00:22:52.710" style="s2">and you know when we think about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.000" end="00:22:54.570" style="s2">idea of the information singularity</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.710" end="00:22:56.220" style="s2">there can be so much information that no</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.570" end="00:22:57.420" style="s2">one can be a specialist in any topic</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.220" end="00:22:58.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a hundred thousand journal</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.420" end="00:23:01.560" style="s2">articles a year in the topic of my</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.950" end="00:23:05.310" style="s2">specialty so already humans are</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.560" end="00:23:08.070" style="s2">irrelevant in the information ecology we</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.310" end="00:23:10.470" style="s2">don&#39;t really need to like the data isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.070" end="00:23:11.779" style="s2">what informs our choices there the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.470" end="00:23:13.729" style="s2">meaning of being a</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.779" end="00:23:16.190" style="s2">put the data of lots of things together</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.729" end="00:23:18.679" style="s2">does and the and the meaningfulness is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.190" end="00:23:20.529" style="s2">second or third derivative of the data</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.679" end="00:23:23.739" style="s2">if we can have the machines not just</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.529" end="00:23:26.239" style="s2">data mine and find the articles but also</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.739" end="00:23:28.190" style="s2">be able to make sense of what a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.239" end="00:23:30.379" style="s2">those articles together and form as far</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.190" end="00:23:32.029" style="s2">as treatment goes so one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.379" end="00:23:33.739" style="s2">want to see the technology get a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.029" end="00:23:35.929" style="s2">better at doing is being able to do the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.739" end="00:23:37.639" style="s2">kind of processing it can so that what</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.929" end="00:23:39.529" style="s2">you&#39;re studying is a higher-order</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.639" end="00:23:41.869" style="s2">synthesis of the information out there</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.529" end="00:23:43.849" style="s2">that you actually can keep up with so I</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.869" end="00:23:46.759" style="s2">see an information singularity much</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.849" end="00:23:48.169" style="s2">faster than I see a meaningfulness which</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.759" end="00:23:49.729" style="s2">is a derivative of the information</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.169" end="00:23:51.710" style="s2">singularity which then the doctors are</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.729" end="00:23:53.479" style="s2">going to be paying attention to and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.710" end="00:23:55.190" style="s2">researchers are working on helping to</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.479" end="00:23:58.279" style="s2">make sense of factoring general</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.190" end="00:24:00.349" style="s2">intelligence so the fact that we will be</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.279" end="00:24:01.759" style="s2">able to use increasingly good cameras on</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.349" end="00:24:03.889" style="s2">an iPhone to look at a skin condition</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.759" end="00:24:05.570" style="s2">use image recognition to automatically</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.889" end="00:24:09.499" style="s2">diagnose the thing at a distance like</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.570" end="00:24:12.639" style="s2">that&#39;s awesome and there there are both</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.499" end="00:24:16.339" style="s2">things that that won&#39;t do in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.639" end="00:24:19.549" style="s2">physiologic diagnosis and in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.339" end="00:24:21.969" style="s2">the quality of connection and so and</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.549" end="00:24:23.839" style="s2">both of those are very important so I</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.969" end="00:24:26.989" style="s2">think we were talking the other day a</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.839" end="00:24:29.809" style="s2">little bit about how important it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.989" end="00:24:31.940" style="s2">that we don&#39;t automate in ways that lead</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.809" end="00:24:33.739" style="s2">to more isolation especially in the name</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.940" end="00:24:35.599" style="s2">of health care when isolation is one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.739" end="00:24:39.200" style="s2">the number one causes of health care</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.599" end="00:24:41.359" style="s2">issues in the first place thank you so</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.200" end="00:24:43.460" style="s2">when you when you talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.359" end="00:24:45.619" style="s2">availability of technology and how this</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.460" end="00:24:48.619" style="s2">technology may kind of support our</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.619" end="00:24:52.059" style="s2">decision-making and we&#39;ll make it easier</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.619" end="00:24:55.489" style="s2">for us to provide meaningful healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.059" end="00:24:59.509" style="s2">and we talked about the temple as in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.489" end="00:25:03.739" style="s2">center of the hospital if you like is</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.509" end="00:25:06.320" style="s2">there a sacred space for the human being</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.739" end="00:25:09.080" style="s2">as a healer a space that can</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.320" end="00:25:11.830" style="s2">structurally not be taken on by</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.080" end="00:25:11.830" style="s2">automation</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.140" end="00:25:25.440" style="s2">yes I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.070" end="00:25:27.810" style="s2">again we have to question like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.440" end="00:25:29.550" style="s2">separate the topic of artificial general</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.810" end="00:25:31.280" style="s2">intelligence or silica-based life</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.550" end="00:25:34.500" style="s2">because now we&#39;re talking about life and</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.280" end="00:25:36.540" style="s2">whether that is possible ever or not in</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.500" end="00:25:40.050" style="s2">terms of the theoretical possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.540" end="00:25:42.270" style="s2">it and what the negative implications of</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.050" end="00:25:43.620" style="s2">silica-based life trying to share a</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.270" end="00:25:47.100" style="s2">biosphere with a hydrocarbon based life</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.620" end="00:25:49.560" style="s2">might be like that that&#39;s so not near if</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.100" end="00:25:51.810" style="s2">ever we can take that off and so really</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.560" end="00:25:53.070" style="s2">then we&#39;re talking about human</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.810" end="00:25:54.660" style="s2">connection and being able to connect</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.070" end="00:25:57.600" style="s2">with someone who can actually care about</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.660" end="00:26:01.260" style="s2">you and machines that are simply doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.600" end="00:26:04.170" style="s2">input-output processing we obviously</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.260" end="00:26:09.720" style="s2">want to extend our capacity with</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.170" end="00:26:13.970" style="s2">machines and the healthcare the center</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.720" end="00:26:17.580" style="s2">of it is actually care hmm so this care</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.970" end="00:26:21.080" style="s2">so we have the temple or the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.580" end="00:26:24.630" style="s2">space we have care as the primary</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.080" end="00:26:26.780" style="s2">ingredient of the relation between the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.630" end="00:26:29.990" style="s2">health care provider and the patient</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.780" end="00:26:33.240" style="s2">something that remains a human</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.990" end="00:26:38.460" style="s2">environment something that remains a</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.240" end="00:26:40.440" style="s2">human capacity and quality so if this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.460" end="00:26:43.350" style="s2">this is something that can be</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.440" end="00:26:44.730" style="s2">established already in can be promoted</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.350" end="00:26:49.710" style="s2">already in the existing healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.730" end="00:26:53.610" style="s2">system now you were alluding already to</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.710" end="00:26:55.710" style="s2">well yeah but health care is not limited</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.610" end="00:27:00.750" style="s2">or confined to either the consultation</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.710" end="00:27:03.450" style="s2">room or the hospital as really whenever</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.750" end="00:27:05.820" style="s2">a doctor is needed we&#39;re too late when</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.450" end="00:27:09.260" style="s2">we talk about health so we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.820" end="00:27:12.240" style="s2">reached a threshold where several</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.260" end="00:27:13.890" style="s2">nonlinear processes have have scaled up</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.240" end="00:27:17.820" style="s2">and a threshold has been reached and now</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.890" end="00:27:22.680" style="s2">the dis-ease has become symptomatic so</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.820" end="00:27:24.840" style="s2">we&#39;re way too far downstream so what we</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.680" end="00:27:26.370" style="s2">really wish to see is if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.840" end="00:27:28.410" style="s2">promote health is to address these</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.370" end="00:27:32.820" style="s2">health issues more upstream you already</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.410" end="00:27:36.540" style="s2">alluded to agriculture finances social</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.820" end="00:27:38.550" style="s2">interactions so what are these areas so</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.540" end="00:27:41.940" style="s2">if we are if we&#39;re kind of moving from</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.550" end="00:27:46.110" style="s2">what is an ideal Hospital to what is an</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.940" end="00:27:50.820" style="s2">ideal healthcare system how would that</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.110" end="00:27:52.650" style="s2">change our perspective what are these</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.820" end="00:27:55.530" style="s2">elements as we think about moving</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.650" end="00:27:57.960" style="s2">forward we need to think about our</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.530" end="00:28:01.410" style="s2">actual evolutionary environment in terms</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.960" end="00:28:04.770" style="s2">of what our genes were selected to</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.410" end="00:28:06.060" style="s2">actually do well in because our future</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.770" end="00:28:08.010" style="s2">environment will be different than that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.060" end="00:28:09.510" style="s2">but it has to not be misaligned with</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.010" end="00:28:11.130" style="s2">that right we&#39;ve created a world in</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.510" end="00:28:14.670" style="s2">which we&#39;re actually genetically misfit</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.130" end="00:28:17.160" style="s2">in really important ways so so we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.670" end="00:28:18.510" style="s2">to consider this when we think about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.160" end="00:28:21.470" style="s2">evolutionary environment of humans the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.510" end="00:28:24.660" style="s2">first thing is we&#39;re social primates and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.470" end="00:28:27.570" style="s2">we for all of our evolutionary history</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.660" end="00:28:30.360" style="s2">were in bands and tribes with extremely</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.570" end="00:28:34.110" style="s2">close high trust interaction with lots</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.360" end="00:28:37.590" style="s2">of other humans and I mean we can look</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.110" end="00:28:39.780" style="s2">at how that effects via physical touch</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.590" end="00:28:43.710" style="s2">and microbiome sharing and pheromone</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.780" end="00:28:45.540" style="s2">sharing to the actual attachment theory</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.710" end="00:28:48.120" style="s2">of it but and it&#39;s going to go beyond</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.540" end="00:28:49.860" style="s2">any of those specific mechanisms that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.120" end="00:28:52.110" style="s2">foundational to physical and</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.860" end="00:28:53.820" style="s2">psychological health and so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.110" end="00:28:55.650" style="s2">just talking about how the</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.820" end="00:28:57.030" style="s2">infrastructure will work we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.650" end="00:29:01.170" style="s2">talking about how the social structures</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.030" end="00:29:04.500" style="s2">work I think it&#39;s really insightful to</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.170" end="00:29:06.270" style="s2">contemplate how many people you trust as</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.500" end="00:29:10.320" style="s2">much as anyone and a tribe would have</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.270" end="00:29:12.180" style="s2">trusted everyone they knew because most</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.320" end="00:29:14.220" style="s2">people don&#39;t have anyone that they feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.180" end="00:29:16.350" style="s2">like they know as well or knows them as</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.220" end="00:29:17.730" style="s2">well or they can trust as much as humans</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.350" end="00:29:19.710" style="s2">evolved being able to trust all the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.730" end="00:29:21.060" style="s2">people they knew and I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.710" end="00:29:22.110" style="s2">over romanticize it&#39;s not that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.060" end="00:29:24.600" style="s2">weren&#39;t difficulties that were</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.110" end="00:29:27.150" style="s2">associated but the kind of fierce</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.600" end="00:29:28.770" style="s2">egalitarianism tribes had to have to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.150" end="00:29:30.000" style="s2">able to function together well like in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.770" end="00:29:34.140" style="s2">tribe you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.000" end="00:29:37.080" style="s2">of right/left antipathy and stay</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.140" end="00:29:39.090" style="s2">together right you can&#39;t have internal</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.080" end="00:29:40.650" style="s2">defection you actually can&#39;t even get</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.090" end="00:29:42.810" style="s2">away with lying because everyone&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.650" end="00:29:47.240" style="s2">tell there&#39;s a forced transparency at</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.810" end="00:29:50.580" style="s2">that small scale and so we actually need</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.240" end="00:29:52.230" style="s2">extraordinarily high trust environments</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.580" end="00:29:53.760" style="s2">for psychological health and we need</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.230" end="00:29:58.260" style="s2">psychological health for physiological</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.760" end="00:30:00.390" style="s2">health so that&#39;s one example so when we</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.260" end="00:30:02.910" style="s2">just stay with the social interaction</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.390" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">for now and that&#39;s one of your favorite</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.910" end="00:30:06.930" style="s2">topics</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:10.620" style="s2">how do what is the impact of a societal</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.930" end="00:30:13.020" style="s2">development on the on various factors so</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.620" end="00:30:16.590" style="s2">if in this conversation we focus on</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.020" end="00:30:18.270" style="s2">health what would be key societal</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.590" end="00:30:20.190" style="s2">developments that we would like to see</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.270" end="00:30:22.770" style="s2">again kind of time or being forwards</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.190" end="00:30:27.540" style="s2">through 2050 what would we like to see</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.770" end="00:30:33.180" style="s2">in place in in our societies that would</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.540" end="00:30:34.980" style="s2">reduce the health care the attention in</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.180" end="00:30:37.470" style="s2">health care facilities as we have them</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.980" end="00:30:38.940" style="s2">today so could we kind of address some</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.470" end="00:30:42.200" style="s2">of the problems that we see in hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.940" end="00:30:42.200" style="s2">now already upstream</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.710" end="00:30:51.789" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s funny to kind of think about</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.419" end="00:30:58.239" style="s2">what examples to use because it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.789" end="00:31:01.059" style="s2">much everything it&#39;s like every building</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.239" end="00:31:03.970" style="s2">material we use almost every building</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.059" end="00:31:05.799" style="s2">material out gases volatile organic</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.970" end="00:31:07.600" style="s2">compounds from petrol derivatives that</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.799" end="00:31:09.970" style="s2">are either neurotoxins and de Krynn</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.600" end="00:31:12.100" style="s2">disruptors or carcinogens so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.970" end="00:31:14.169" style="s2">restructuring of the entire materials</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.100" end="00:31:15.429" style="s2">economy and material supply chain to not</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.169" end="00:31:19.749" style="s2">be polluting the indoor and outdoor</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.429" end="00:31:22.179" style="s2">environment it&#39;s that the that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.749" end="00:31:23.950" style="s2">actual photic spectrum of the light that</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.179" end="00:31:26.080" style="s2">we&#39;re in is unhealthy for us because we</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.950" end="00:31:30.070" style="s2">don&#39;t just photosynthesize vitamin d</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.080" end="00:31:31.809" style="s2">nitric oxide and cortisol and so many</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.070" end="00:31:33.399" style="s2">other things are regulated by not just</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.809" end="00:31:35.019" style="s2">the total amount of light but specific</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.399" end="00:31:41.559" style="s2">frequencies of light and timing of light</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.019" end="00:31:44.019" style="s2">it&#39;s like the the nuclear family home</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.559" end="00:31:45.999" style="s2">structure the nature of economies of</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.019" end="00:31:47.320" style="s2">scale moving agriculture far away where</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.999" end="00:31:49.269" style="s2">even if it was organic which it</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.320" end="00:31:51.129" style="s2">generally isn&#39;t it&#39;s old it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.269" end="00:31:52.690" style="s2">actually undergoing entropy since being</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.129" end="00:31:56.769" style="s2">picked for a pretty long time which</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.690" end="00:31:58.239" style="s2">means new nutrient decay let alone lack</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.769" end="00:31:59.529" style="s2">of interaction with the soil that not</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.239" end="00:32:02.139" style="s2">only has a kind of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.529" end="00:32:10.659" style="s2">regeneration but microbiotic effects</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.139" end="00:32:12.909" style="s2">like we can see that market forces move</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.659" end="00:32:15.940" style="s2">the world to a place that optimizes for</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.909" end="00:32:18.220" style="s2">market forces and they optimize for</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.940" end="00:32:20.080" style="s2">addiction and comfort rather than health</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.220" end="00:32:23.580" style="s2">or well-being and I think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.080" end="00:32:23.580" style="s2">really important thing is that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.210" end="00:32:31.230" style="s2">comfort and happiness or are not the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.309" end="00:32:34.869" style="s2">same thing but as soon as we one of them</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.230" end="00:32:38.739" style="s2">one of the effects of kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.869" end="00:32:40.149" style="s2">Enlightenment was moving into the domain</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.739" end="00:32:41.710" style="s2">of Objectivism and things we could</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.149" end="00:32:44.440" style="s2">measure well we can actually measure</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.710" end="00:32:46.419" style="s2">metrics of comfort like how bouncy the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.440" end="00:32:47.859" style="s2">shocks in a car are or whatever more</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.419" end="00:32:50.409" style="s2">than we can measure subjectivity which</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.859" end="00:32:52.059" style="s2">we can&#39;t measure at all and it gets into</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.409" end="00:32:54.820" style="s2">existentialism of what is a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.059" end="00:32:56.430" style="s2">human experience and so we start</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.820" end="00:32:58.930" style="s2">optimizing for</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.430" end="00:33:00.390" style="s2">and you actually make shitty people when</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.930" end="00:33:02.770" style="s2">you optimize for comfort because</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.390" end="00:33:04.270" style="s2">psychologically good people are people</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.770" end="00:33:05.980" style="s2">that can actually hold a certain</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.270" end="00:33:07.870" style="s2">resilience in the presence of discomfort</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.980" end="00:33:10.330" style="s2">so you look at the wisdom traditions</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.870" end="00:33:12.550" style="s2">that had sweat lodges and ayahuasca</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.330" end="00:33:14.200" style="s2">ceremonies and combo ceremonies and Sun</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.550" end="00:33:16.240" style="s2">dances and vision quests which were all</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.200" end="00:33:19.240" style="s2">actually induced really intense</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.240" end="00:33:21.130" style="s2">discomfort to be able to find a self</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.240" end="00:33:22.960" style="s2">transcendence in the presence of it in</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.130" end="00:33:25.150" style="s2">the same way that you don&#39;t get strong</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.960" end="00:33:26.560" style="s2">people by not lifting weights right you</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.150" end="00:33:28.630" style="s2">actually have to whore matically stress</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.560" end="00:33:30.700" style="s2">the system to upregulate its regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.630" end="00:33:32.440" style="s2">capacity you have to psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.700" end="00:33:34.720" style="s2">stress the emotional system to learn</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.440" end="00:33:37.390" style="s2">emotional intelligence and so there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.720" end="00:33:39.400" style="s2">much of the in the name of comfort that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.390" end="00:33:43.120" style="s2">is just actually making maximally</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.400" end="00:33:45.520" style="s2">entropic humans and the same was like</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.120" end="00:33:47.830" style="s2">supposedly market theory says people</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.520" end="00:33:49.210" style="s2">will demand real things that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.830" end="00:33:50.890" style="s2">actually going to enrich the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.210" end="00:33:53.170" style="s2">their life like food and whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.890" end="00:33:56.170" style="s2">then that will create a basis for people</p>

<p begin="00:35:09.300" end="00:35:22.290" style="s2">so if I if I just you know put this into</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.290" end="00:35:26.250" style="s2">a pediatrician this kind of way making</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.290" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">it simple then what I understand from</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.250" end="00:35:34.910" style="s2">you is that the entire concept of health</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:36.900" style="s2">care as a service that is being paid for</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.910" end="00:35:39.570" style="s2">including all the products that are</p>

<p begin="00:35:45.000" end="00:35:50.310" style="s2">line with the with with the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.460" end="00:35:53.940" style="s2">health as you&#39;re describing it so all of</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.310" end="00:35:55.650" style="s2">this works as long as we have disease so</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.940" end="00:35:57.450" style="s2">if we have a problem to be solved if we</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.650" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">have a disease and we give it a name and</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.450" end="00:36:02.160" style="s2">we give it a label that allows us then</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:03.930" style="s2">to say if you have that disease then you</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.160" end="00:36:04.829" style="s2">need this kind of Diagnostics and</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.930" end="00:36:06.150" style="s2">therefore you need these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.829" end="00:36:08.339" style="s2">machines and therefore you need these</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.150" end="00:36:10.859" style="s2">sort of treatments congratulations</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.339" end="00:36:17.089" style="s2">you&#39;re sincerely thank you very much so</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.859" end="00:36:20.099" style="s2">that is that is one there&#39;s one aspect</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.089" end="00:36:22.170" style="s2">and the other is when we actually want</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.099" end="00:36:26.579" style="s2">health rather than the absence of</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.170" end="00:36:28.560" style="s2">disease then all of this is is a misfit</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.579" end="00:36:32.099" style="s2">so whatever we have constructed in terms</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.560" end="00:36:36.810" style="s2">of health care system trying to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.099" end="00:36:38.940" style="s2">disease as a system is not useful if if</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.810" end="00:36:42.510" style="s2">we&#39;re actually turning our focus towards</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.940" end="00:36:44.339" style="s2">health stop I mean it&#39;s funny even if we</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.510" end="00:36:48.000" style="s2">just think about disease diagnosis I</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.339" end="00:36:50.130" style="s2">think most of the actual diseases that</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.000" end="00:36:51.329" style="s2">we have Diagnostics for are made up</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.130" end="00:36:54.060" style="s2">there fit their fictions</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.329" end="00:36:56.730" style="s2">so obviously ADHD is a fiction that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.060" end="00:36:58.910" style="s2">just making childhood a disease and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.730" end="00:36:58.910" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.369" end="00:37:07.690" style="s2">take take kids have parents pay no</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.269" end="00:37:09.489" style="s2">attention to them pay if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.690" end="00:37:11.619" style="s2">what the school is the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.489" end="00:37:13.359" style="s2">have it structured it&#39;s these these</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.619" end="00:37:18.670" style="s2">little people don&#39;t make money yet and</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.359" end="00:37:20.079" style="s2">so they are possibly future assets in</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.670" end="00:37:22.450" style="s2">the financial system but right now their</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.079" end="00:37:23.979" style="s2">liabilities or or debts on the future</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.450" end="00:37:25.869" style="s2">system so we want the least number of</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.979" end="00:37:27.489" style="s2">productive class people to monitor the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.869" end="00:37:29.380" style="s2">most of them possible so one teacher to</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.489" end="00:37:31.539" style="s2">thirty of them typically a low paid</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.380" end="00:37:32.799" style="s2">person because someone that could do</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.539" end="00:37:35.470" style="s2">something more profitable we&#39;d rather</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.799" end="00:37:36.519" style="s2">than generating more profit to get them</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.470" end="00:37:37.930" style="s2">to the point where they&#39;re part of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.519" end="00:37:39.339" style="s2">productive class then as soon as they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.930" end="00:37:40.479" style="s2">too old to be the productive class and</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.339" end="00:37:42.880" style="s2">again we want to ship them off somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.479" end="00:37:47.200" style="s2">where one low paid person takes care of</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.880" end="00:37:50.019" style="s2">lots of them like so we start with that</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.200" end="00:37:51.579" style="s2">and the school system that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.019" end="00:37:53.589" style="s2">facilitate their interest in anything</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.579" end="00:37:55.359" style="s2">forces them to be interested and totally</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.589" end="00:37:56.920" style="s2">uninteresting breaks their interest</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.359" end="00:37:58.779" style="s2">in life as a result so then they want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.920" end="00:38:01.390" style="s2">play video games and watch porn or</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.779" end="00:38:02.799" style="s2">whatever and then we say that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.390" end="00:38:05.079" style="s2">that&#39;s what human nature is is only</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.799" end="00:38:07.690" style="s2">human nature after we broke it right so</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.079" end="00:38:09.430" style="s2">then we medicate that as a disease</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.690" end="00:38:10.930" style="s2">because that&#39;s also a super profitable</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.430" end="00:38:12.940" style="s2">thing to do and then that creates the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.930" end="00:38:15.460" style="s2">beginning of an iatrogenic cascade where</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.940" end="00:38:17.200" style="s2">the riddlin the side effects of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.460" end="00:38:19.119" style="s2">riddlin are going to need an SSRI later</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.200" end="00:38:20.710" style="s2">and then are gonna need a benzo and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.119" end="00:38:22.479" style="s2">that person&#39;s for life but the</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.710" end="00:38:25.359" style="s2">profitability is quite high in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.479" end="00:38:27.789" style="s2">lifetime revenue because if I Drive</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.359" end="00:38:31.119" style="s2">rather than helping people be healthy if</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.789" end="00:38:32.499" style="s2">I override their system in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.119" end="00:38:34.150" style="s2">going to cause ongoing addiction because</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.499" end="00:38:35.559" style="s2">they can&#39;t get off that benzo because</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.150" end="00:38:37.359" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna have rolling panic attacks</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.559" end="00:38:40.150" style="s2">if they do way worse than their anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.359" end="00:38:41.619" style="s2">initially ever was but the side effects</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.150" end="00:38:43.180" style="s2">of that or another drug that we also</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.619" end="00:38:44.789" style="s2">sell that&#39;s just called an upsell or</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.180" end="00:38:48.519" style="s2">cross-sell which is just good business</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.789" end="00:38:52.479" style="s2">so like obviously ADHD is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.519" end="00:38:54.099" style="s2">disease most psychiatric diagnoses it</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.479" end="00:38:56.739" style="s2">would be way more useful to think about</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.099" end="00:38:59.319" style="s2">it differently but also like every</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.739" end="00:39:01.390" style="s2">complex chronic disease their</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.319" end="00:39:03.819" style="s2">diseases in terms of rheumatoid</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.390" end="00:39:08.469" style="s2">arthritis we call it a disease or MS or</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.819" end="00:39:09.730" style="s2">Alzheimer&#39;s they don&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.469" end="00:39:12.040" style="s2">calls</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.730" end="00:39:14.290" style="s2">if I see 10 different people with MS</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.040" end="00:39:15.400" style="s2">there and I actually found out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.290" end="00:39:16.930" style="s2">going on because right now we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.400" end="00:39:19.570" style="s2">what&#39;s going on at all so the disease</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.930" end="00:39:21.070" style="s2">just allows us to know what symptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.570" end="00:39:23.020" style="s2">drugs were a million of drugs were going</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.070" end="00:39:24.430" style="s2">to do but we can&#39;t cure any of them but</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.020" end="00:39:26.920" style="s2">if I want to say what&#39;s actually going</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.430" end="00:39:29.320" style="s2">on the patho ideology is different in</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.920" end="00:39:31.360" style="s2">every case because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.320" end="00:39:33.550" style="s2">multifactorial and they&#39;re not the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.360" end="00:39:35.410" style="s2">set of factors and so the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.550" end="00:39:38.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a cluster of biomarkers and a</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.410" end="00:39:40.870" style="s2">cluster of symptoms that I can make a a</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.100" end="00:39:43.090" style="s2">disease title for to then know what drug</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.870" end="00:39:44.380" style="s2">to prescribe and insurance can do that</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.090" end="00:39:46.570" style="s2">thing doesn&#39;t mean that that tells me</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.380" end="00:39:48.220" style="s2">anything about the pathophysiology of it</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.570" end="00:39:50.680" style="s2">so even insofar as I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.220" end="00:39:52.690" style="s2">the disease ICMS I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.680" end="00:39:55.150" style="s2"> when I hear Ms all I know is okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.690" end="00:39:57.850" style="s2">so there&#39;s some kind of autoimmune</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.150" end="00:40:00.700" style="s2">neurodegenerative stuff going on this</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.850" end="00:40:03.070" style="s2">system was exposed to some things that</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.700" end="00:40:05.110" style="s2">created dysregulation deviations from</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.070" end="00:40:07.000" style="s2">homeo dynamics it probably led to more</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.110" end="00:40:09.730" style="s2">susceptibility to more dysregulation</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.000" end="00:40:11.290" style="s2">that eventually reached a threshold that</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.730" end="00:40:13.240" style="s2">had symptom ology where there was</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.290" end="00:40:15.340" style="s2">probably pathophysiology going on for</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.240" end="00:40:17.440" style="s2">years or decades ahead of time and for</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.340" end="00:40:20.920" style="s2">this person with a massive it was a mold</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.440" end="00:40:23.350" style="s2">exposure 30 years ago that left</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.920" end="00:40:26.770" style="s2">mycotoxins that changed cytokine</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.350" end="00:40:28.810" style="s2">profiles and whatever that then ten</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.770" end="00:40:30.670" style="s2">years later they had a micro TBI from a</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.810" end="00:40:32.770" style="s2">car accident and then a divorce dress</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.670" end="00:40:35.200" style="s2">that threw them over and now it&#39;s MS and</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.770" end="00:40:37.480" style="s2">in somebody else it was a tick-borne</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.200" end="00:40:39.340" style="s2">Lyme exposure and then some food</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.480" end="00:40:41.170" style="s2">poisoning in Guatemala and some</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.340" end="00:40:44.140" style="s2">glyphosate and then some other emotional</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.170" end="00:40:45.970" style="s2">stressor so to actually be able to cure</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.140" end="00:40:48.460" style="s2">it I need to know that stuff which the</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.970" end="00:40:50.500" style="s2">title ms doesn&#39;t give me so not only do</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.460" end="00:40:52.420" style="s2">we want to move to health promotion like</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.500" end="00:40:57.390" style="s2">we want to even think about disease in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.420" end="00:40:57.390" style="s2">reasonable way that is so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.510" end="00:41:01.570" style="s2">it&#39;s so interesting because there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.770" end="00:41:03.280" style="s2">way we do studies at least when when I</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.570" end="00:41:05.710" style="s2">look at the studies that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.280" end="00:41:08.860" style="s2">classic type of clinical studies what we</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.710" end="00:41:10.870" style="s2">what we see is that that there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.860" end="00:41:13.630" style="s2">they&#39;re basically two observations so</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.870" end="00:41:14.860" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a starting point and an</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.630" end="00:41:16.720" style="s2">end point and then we assume that</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.860" end="00:41:19.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a linear association between the</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.720" end="00:41:20.560" style="s2">two and it seems that as we are as we</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.030" end="00:41:25.020" style="s2">are learning more</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.560" end="00:41:27.570" style="s2">as there&#39;s an there&#39;s more insight into</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.020" end="00:41:30.850" style="s2">how we might be able to calculate</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.570" end="00:41:33.400" style="s2">nonlinear associations and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.850" end="00:41:35.320" style="s2">recognizing that that probably a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.400" end="00:41:38.400" style="s2">what is happening during this time of</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.320" end="00:41:42.070" style="s2">observation in a classic clinical trial</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.400" end="00:41:43.870" style="s2">what we observe there is is very much</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.070" end="00:41:45.400" style="s2">dependent on what happened before this</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.870" end="00:41:47.020" style="s2">trial and all the things that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.400" end="00:41:51.130" style="s2">actually describing and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.020" end="00:41:53.560" style="s2">heterogeneity that that is is real it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.130" end="00:41:55.780" style="s2">not usually captured in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.560" end="00:41:58.060" style="s2">typical table one in a paper saying you</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.780" end="00:42:00.100" style="s2">know what is the distribution of sex and</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.060" end="00:42:02.020" style="s2">gender and ethnicity so this is way way</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.100" end="00:42:04.690" style="s2">more complex than that and we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.020" end="00:42:06.850" style="s2">even started to come to grips with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.690" end="00:42:09.010" style="s2">complexity of what what the regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.850" end="00:42:12.400" style="s2">mechanisms are before we start to</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.010" end="00:42:13.750" style="s2">observe something right so a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.400" end="00:42:16.690" style="s2">I hear from you is that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.750" end="00:42:19.110" style="s2">science that that we look at so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.690" end="00:42:22.300" style="s2">a lot of clinical science is based on a</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.110" end="00:42:25.060" style="s2">syndromic diagnosis so we&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.300" end="00:42:27.850" style="s2">this this this patient group shares a</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.060" end="00:42:29.290" style="s2">certain set of signs and symptoms and if</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.850" end="00:42:30.940" style="s2">it&#39;s that then we give it a name and</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.290" end="00:42:32.740" style="s2">that&#39;s a useful thing to give it a name</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.940" end="00:42:36.850" style="s2">so we have a working hypothesis and can</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.740" end="00:42:38.530" style="s2">talk about it but along the line of this</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.850" end="00:42:41.470" style="s2">process of discovering what is actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.530" end="00:42:44.140" style="s2">going on we are kind of taking this</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.470" end="00:42:46.510" style="s2">diagnosis as something set as something</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.140" end="00:42:50.680" style="s2">that exists as in as an entity rather</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.510" end="00:42:52.240" style="s2">than a working hypothesis so then we</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.680" end="00:42:54.550" style="s2">start to developing drugs to fix a</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.240" end="00:42:56.500" style="s2">problem so to fix the signs and symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.550" end="00:42:58.780" style="s2">which is a good idea for those who do</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.500" end="00:43:01.000" style="s2">have the signs and symptoms so it&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.780" end="00:43:04.690" style="s2">least very promising if you do suffer of</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.000" end="00:43:06.070" style="s2">emesis the example you gave if there are</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.690" end="00:43:07.750" style="s2">solutions to the problem that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.070" end="00:43:09.610" style="s2">experienced to the signs and symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.750" end="00:43:12.030" style="s2">that&#39;s a useful thing but we could</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.610" end="00:43:13.930" style="s2">recognize that this is like a painkiller</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.030" end="00:43:15.940" style="s2">rather than something that really</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.930" end="00:43:18.450" style="s2">addresses the cause of disease so what</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.940" end="00:43:21.280" style="s2">might be the steps for us what would be</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.450" end="00:43:22.930" style="s2">the structural approach to take in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.280" end="00:43:24.400" style="s2">future so that we&#39;re actually turning</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.930" end="00:43:25.990" style="s2">our direction and we really drill down</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.400" end="00:43:27.730" style="s2">to the cause of disease rather than</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.990" end="00:43:30.930" style="s2">trying to fix signs and symptoms yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.730" end="00:43:34.080" style="s2">and you know don&#39;t get me wrong</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.930" end="00:43:36.950" style="s2">symptomatic medicine and palliative care</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.080" end="00:43:41.340" style="s2">and you know ameliorating some of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.950" end="00:43:43.650" style="s2">the advancement of pathology like this</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.340" end="00:43:45.450" style="s2">awesome no novocaine is one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.650" end="00:43:48.600" style="s2">inventions ever dentistry totally sucked</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.450" end="00:43:50.160" style="s2">before novocaine so that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.600" end="00:43:53.190" style="s2">addressing something in a causal level</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.160" end="00:44:01.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s awesome right so but we can do</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.190" end="00:44:04.680" style="s2">so much better and there&#39;s a place where</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.040" end="00:44:07.080" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s say I&#39;m looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.680" end="00:44:09.390" style="s2">relationship between the regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.080" end="00:44:11.820" style="s2">bodies so in the US the FDA in</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.390" end="00:44:15.480" style="s2">particular other bodies AMA and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.820" end="00:44:18.990" style="s2">but let&#39;s look at the FDA for is this a</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.480" end="00:44:20.880" style="s2">treatment that can actually a doctor can</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.990" end="00:44:22.860" style="s2">give to treat a disease right so the</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.880" end="00:44:25.770" style="s2">disease has been recognized the</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.860" end="00:44:26.910" style="s2">treatments been recognized and otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.770" end="00:44:28.380" style="s2">the doctor is not allowed to use it</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.910" end="00:44:31.620" style="s2">insurance won&#39;t cover it whatever rain</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.380" end="00:44:33.960" style="s2">so we look at what it takes to get the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.620" end="00:44:35.430" style="s2">regulatory status which also means then</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.960" end="00:44:38.220" style="s2">that it will get trained to new people</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.430" end="00:44:40.650" style="s2">in medical school well so phase three</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.220" end="00:44:42.360" style="s2">clinical trials are gonna cost a billion</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.650" end="00:44:43.740" style="s2">dollars most of a billion dollars but</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.360" end="00:44:45.750" style="s2">now factoring all the things that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.740" end="00:44:50.370" style="s2">make it through matriculating that right</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.750" end="00:44:52.950" style="s2">a billion dollars and so the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.370" end="00:44:55.200" style="s2">ever be able to recoup that money is if</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.950" end="00:44:57.630" style="s2">I can patent the thing because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.200" end="00:44:59.070" style="s2">someone else is just competing on cost</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.630" end="00:45:00.870" style="s2">of goods and they didn&#39;t put the billion</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.070" end="00:45:03.120" style="s2">dollars up that was just going to beat</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.870" end="00:45:04.530" style="s2">me and so if I&#39;m looking at patentable</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.120" end="00:45:06.060" style="s2">stuff then I look at the regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.530" end="00:45:09.750" style="s2">dynamics around patenting I can only</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.060" end="00:45:11.430" style="s2">patent synthetic molecules and that</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.750" end="00:45:12.870" style="s2">means that the things I&#39;m looking at are</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.430" end="00:45:14.010" style="s2">not part of how your body worked when it</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.870" end="00:45:15.360" style="s2">was healthy and are not part of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.010" end="00:45:18.090" style="s2">evolutionary environments that make</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.360" end="00:45:19.320" style="s2">humans in the first place at all ever so</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.090" end="00:45:21.300" style="s2">what&#39;s the chance we&#39;re gonna be able to</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.320" end="00:45:22.650" style="s2">do health promotion was weird synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.300" end="00:45:24.120" style="s2">molecules that were never part of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.650" end="00:45:26.130" style="s2">original picture because the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.120" end="00:45:29.640" style="s2">intersection of the regulatory landscape</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.130" end="00:45:31.530" style="s2">and IP law and the financialization of</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.640" end="00:45:33.660" style="s2">the research make it to where we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.530" end="00:45:36.180" style="s2">even study the right stuff so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.660" end="00:45:38.040" style="s2">I looked at when the same person with</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.180" end="00:45:39.180" style="s2">the same genome didn&#39;t have cancer and</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.040" end="00:45:40.560" style="s2">they were super healthy and now that</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.180" end="00:45:41.730" style="s2">they have cancer what was different in</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.560" end="00:45:43.410" style="s2">their body or before the autoimmune</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.730" end="00:45:45.640" style="s2">disease and I see that there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.410" end="00:45:48.069" style="s2">cell types and certain peptides</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.640" end="00:45:49.150" style="s2">are much more prevalent and other ones</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.069" end="00:45:50.460" style="s2">that are less prevalent and I would</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.150" end="00:45:52.359" style="s2">start to think about types of biological</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.460" end="00:45:54.549" style="s2">endogenous medicine they could do what</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.359" end="00:45:55.690" style="s2">like I can&#39;t even research most of X</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.549" end="00:45:56.799" style="s2">I&#39;ll never be able to patent it which</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.690" end="00:45:58.450" style="s2">means there&#39;s no money for the research</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.799" end="00:46:02.349" style="s2">to ever be able to get it through</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.450" end="00:46:05.589" style="s2">clinical approval so basically the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.349" end="00:46:10.480" style="s2">epistemology that looks for sick one</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.589" end="00:46:14.079" style="s2">drug I mean one disease set of symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.480" end="00:46:17.829" style="s2">one drug it&#39;s totally dumb epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.079" end="00:46:19.109" style="s2">but the there is no incentive to be able</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.829" end="00:46:21.849" style="s2">to try and do better complex</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.109" end="00:46:24.279" style="s2">epistemology from a finance regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.849" end="00:46:28.390" style="s2">point of view so the epistemic Tsar</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.279" end="00:46:31.150" style="s2">actually straight forward which is acute</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.390" end="00:46:33.220" style="s2">causation acute singular causation is</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.150" end="00:46:35.559" style="s2">straightforward you got a physical</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.220" end="00:46:37.569" style="s2">injury that was an acute injury we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.559" end="00:46:37.900" style="s2">going to sew it up don&#39;t do that thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.569" end="00:46:43.059" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.900" end="00:46:44.230" style="s2">right or you had an acute infectious</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.059" end="00:46:46.660" style="s2">exposure we&#39;re gonna give you the</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.230" end="00:46:47.950" style="s2">antibiotic for it even that starts</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.660" end="00:46:50.019" style="s2">getting questionable because did</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.950" end="00:46:50.950" style="s2">everyone who has exposed get the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.019" end="00:46:53.230" style="s2">thing and do you actually have</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.950" end="00:46:54.819" style="s2">underlying immune weakness and is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.230" end="00:46:56.170" style="s2">antibiotic actually necessary and are</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.819" end="00:46:57.400" style="s2">you breeding antibiotic resistance and</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.170" end="00:46:58.960" style="s2">the whole population by using it</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.400" end="00:47:00.700" style="s2">unnecessarily there&#39;s questions there</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.960" end="00:47:05.160" style="s2">but let&#39;s just say there are times where</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.700" end="00:47:09.450" style="s2">that&#39;s true in acute thing but most</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.160" end="00:47:12.460" style="s2">disease does not have a single cause and</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.450" end="00:47:14.200" style="s2">the causes so they&#39;re multifactorial</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.460" end="00:47:16.930" style="s2">they&#39;re different for different people</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.200" end="00:47:20.200" style="s2">and many of them are radically</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.930" end="00:47:22.390" style="s2">time-delayed and so to actually be able</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.200" end="00:47:24.849" style="s2">to do curative work we&#39;ve actually got</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.390" end="00:47:26.859" style="s2">to be able to assess how the regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.849" end="00:47:28.750" style="s2">systems of the body are doing and what</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.859" end="00:47:30.460" style="s2">the deviations to homeo dynamics the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.750" end="00:47:33.250" style="s2">person has been exposed to our find the</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.460" end="00:47:35.529" style="s2">unique set be able to specially reverse</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.250" end="00:47:36.970" style="s2">that unique set and generally support</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.529" end="00:47:38.440" style="s2">the homeo dynamic systems of the body</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.970" end="00:47:41.589" style="s2">it&#39;s a totally different way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.440" end="00:47:43.059" style="s2">about medicine hmm so one of the so when</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.589" end="00:47:44.680" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about in a way you talk</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.059" end="00:47:46.779" style="s2">about personalized medicine precision</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.680" end="00:47:49.359" style="s2">medicine terms that have been used in</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.779" end="00:47:54.789" style="s2">different ways but let&#39;s say N equals</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.359" end="00:47:59.170" style="s2">one medicine yeah part of how research</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.789" end="00:47:59.840" style="s2">is done right now is is to understand</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.170" end="00:48:02.330" style="s2">what is going</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.840" end="00:48:04.130" style="s2">a single case by looking at similar</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.330" end="00:48:06.500" style="s2">cases and comparing them and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.130" end="00:48:08.480" style="s2">understand the pattern so what we do the</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.500" end="00:48:11.770" style="s2">approach to research is to kind of look</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.480" end="00:48:14.120" style="s2">at the disease from the outside and</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.770" end="00:48:16.970" style="s2">recognize patterns of disease that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.120" end="00:48:20.540" style="s2">similar come in a group of people that</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.970" end="00:48:23.240" style="s2">we observe that is essentially different</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.540" end="00:48:25.160" style="s2">to the disease experience of the person</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.240" end="00:48:28.910" style="s2">who had this threshold this</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.160" end="00:48:31.700" style="s2">multifactorial threshold experience how</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.910" end="00:48:33.830" style="s2">do we so it&#39;s basically the way we</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.700" end="00:48:37.250" style="s2">conduct research today is completely</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.830" end="00:48:41.420" style="s2">missing the point it&#39;s not useless right</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.250" end="00:48:42.890" style="s2">like clinical trials aren&#39;t totally</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.420" end="00:48:44.510" style="s2">useless being able to do variable</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.890" end="00:48:47.630" style="s2">isolation and seeing what that variable</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.510" end="00:48:49.190" style="s2">does across the distribution of all the</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.630" end="00:48:50.840" style="s2">other variables gives us an insight</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.190" end="00:48:53.060" style="s2">right so when we do a clinical trial on</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.840" end="00:48:54.890" style="s2">a drug compared to a placebo and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.060" end="00:48:56.660" style="s2">trying to see is there some effect</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.890" end="00:48:58.550" style="s2">beyond the placebo and we see there is</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.660" end="00:49:00.470" style="s2">versus there isn&#39;t there is indicates</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.550" end="00:49:02.180" style="s2">that there is some mechanism that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.470" end="00:49:04.310" style="s2">occurring that&#39;s kind of all it tells us</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.180" end="00:49:05.900" style="s2">that there&#39;s some mechanism but the fact</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.310" end="00:49:07.340" style="s2">that there&#39;s a Gaussian distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.900" end="00:49:09.110" style="s2">the response curve where some people</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.340" end="00:49:12.050" style="s2">have great responses and said maybe have</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.110" end="00:49:13.700" style="s2">terrible responses is a result of lots</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.050" end="00:49:15.380" style="s2">of other things that are going on that</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.700" end="00:49:17.360" style="s2">we don&#39;t recognize where they just get</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.380" end="00:49:19.340" style="s2">put under a bell curve and it would be</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.360" end="00:49:21.200" style="s2">much more interesting if we could start</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.340" end="00:49:24.710" style="s2">to figure that stuff out well you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.200" end="00:49:28.040" style="s2">do that with looking with variable</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.710" end="00:49:29.960" style="s2">isolation on a large population so now</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.040" end="00:49:31.640" style="s2">when I moved all the way to N equals one</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.960" end="00:49:33.050" style="s2">where I&#39;m looking at a population of one</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.640" end="00:49:34.220" style="s2">and trying to look at all the variables</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.050" end="00:49:36.110" style="s2">and look at how they make sense together</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.220" end="00:49:38.150" style="s2">I&#39;ve got it now I&#39;ve got to use</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.110" end="00:49:39.530" style="s2">complexity science I&#39;ve got to use much</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.150" end="00:49:41.960" style="s2">more advanced kind of statistical</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.530" end="00:49:43.760" style="s2">modeling but there are ways of</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.960" end="00:49:45.020" style="s2">simplifying it because we know that if I</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.760" end="00:49:47.210" style="s2">just try and do the brute force</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.020" end="00:49:50.600" style="s2">computation there are things we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.210" end="00:49:52.040" style="s2">measure right so I can I can put a qejy</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.600" end="00:49:53.390" style="s2">on you but I can&#39;t see several cortical</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.040" end="00:49:54.650" style="s2">structures there&#39;s no good way to see</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.390" end="00:49:57.170" style="s2">that in real time there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.650" end="00:49:59.030" style="s2">proteins we can&#39;t measure they and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.170" end="00:50:00.380" style="s2">and there&#39;s that we just don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.030" end="00:50:03.050" style="s2">know that we don&#39;t know about yet that</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.380" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">is a huge part of it and if I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.050" end="00:50:05.690" style="s2">run optimization on it it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:08.090" style="s2">computable</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.690" end="00:50:10.670" style="s2">these are np-hard problems but I can I</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.090" end="00:50:11.910" style="s2">can collapse that entire space two ways</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.670" end="00:50:15.539" style="s2">of thinking about it that make</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.910" end="00:50:17.339" style="s2">sentence which is is the system not</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.539" end="00:50:19.650" style="s2">getting enough of something it needs is</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.339" end="00:50:21.450" style="s2">it getting too much of something to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.650" end="00:50:22.920" style="s2">able to process well like this is kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.450" end="00:50:24.270" style="s2">of Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.920" end="00:50:26.640" style="s2">medicine basics but that we can</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.270" end="00:50:27.960" style="s2">modernize so is it not getting enough of</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.640" end="00:50:31.650" style="s2">something is it not getting enough</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.960" end="00:50:34.079" style="s2">exercise rest love affection sunlight</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.650" end="00:50:37.140" style="s2">micronutrients macronutrients so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.079" end="00:50:41.160" style="s2">say we look at micronutrients we need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.140" end="00:50:43.500" style="s2">think about subclinical deficiency as</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.160" end="00:50:45.390" style="s2">opposed to clinical deficiency so most</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.500" end="00:50:47.220" style="s2">people don&#39;t have scurvy right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.390" end="00:50:49.349" style="s2">awesome that they don&#39;t have scurvy but</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.220" end="00:50:51.210" style="s2">if we look at optimal vitamin C and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.349" end="00:50:52.799" style="s2">we look at scurvy there&#39;s a pretty big</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.210" end="00:50:54.930" style="s2">range in here that is don&#39;t yet have</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.799" end="00:50:56.849" style="s2">scurvy but that is suboptimal so we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.930" end="00:50:58.650" style="s2">call that subclinical deficiency where</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.849" end="00:51:01.079" style="s2">being able to augment those levels would</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.650" end="00:51:03.240" style="s2">make a difference now because I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.079" end="00:51:04.980" style="s2">so many micronutrients look at if I just</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.240" end="00:51:07.500" style="s2">try to control that one variable and</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.980" end="00:51:08.789" style="s2">look at decreased all cause mortality or</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.500" end="00:51:11.970" style="s2">whatever it&#39;s gonna be really hard to</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.789" end="00:51:13.710" style="s2">tell because that one thing also needs</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.970" end="00:51:15.329" style="s2">bioflavonoids synergistically to work</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.710" end="00:51:17.339" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to interact like this so</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.329" end="00:51:20.609" style="s2">many other things going on so if I start</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.339" end="00:51:22.890" style="s2">to look overarching Liat are we</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.609" end="00:51:25.069" style="s2">providing good nutrition and is this</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.890" end="00:51:27.839" style="s2">person absorbing and assimilating it and</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.069" end="00:51:30.839" style="s2">dealing with subclinical deficiency also</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.839" end="00:51:33.839" style="s2">toxicity so until we have reengineered</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.839" end="00:51:35.549" style="s2">our supply chains do I want to look at</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.839" end="00:51:38.520" style="s2">the exposure people have - heavy metals</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.549" end="00:51:39.900" style="s2">- VOCs - mycotoxins also - infections</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.520" end="00:51:43.079" style="s2">that are subclinical meaning they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.900" end="00:51:44.700" style="s2">creating acute medical symptom ology but</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.079" end="00:51:48.270" style="s2">this is not a normal part of the human</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.700" end="00:51:50.730" style="s2">microbiome and when we look at in h</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.270" end="00:51:52.500" style="s2">pylori or an HPV or an EBV that we know</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.730" end="00:51:54.240" style="s2">have statistical correlations with</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.500" end="00:51:56.069" style="s2">diseases that are chronic infections</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.240" end="00:51:57.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a gazillion other things that do</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.069" end="00:52:00.240" style="s2">functional medicine and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.839" end="00:52:01.710" style="s2">functional infectious explorative</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.240" end="00:52:03.750" style="s2">medicine are starting to pioneer this</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.710" end="00:52:05.940" style="s2">more than general medicine but this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.750" end="00:52:08.279" style="s2">too much of something that the body</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.940" end="00:52:10.260" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have we can do stuff about</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.279" end="00:52:12.150" style="s2">that so there&#39;s a way of taking this</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.260" end="00:52:15.650" style="s2">entire search space in optimization</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.150" end="00:52:18.420" style="s2">space and having some kind of heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.650" end="00:52:20.940" style="s2">Diagnostics that are able to get do a</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.420" end="00:52:22.770" style="s2">lot of the work more simply we can also</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.940" end="00:52:24.390" style="s2">think about the primary regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.770" end="00:52:24.610" style="s2">mechanisms of the body and how to look</p>

<p begin="00:52:24.610" end="00:52:30.030" style="s2">robustness of them which indicates</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.890" end="00:52:32.890" style="s2">everything that&#39;s going on so like I</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.030" end="00:52:36.610" style="s2">want to be able to look not just at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.890" end="00:52:38.110" style="s2">homeostatic state is your vitamin D your</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.610" end="00:52:39.820" style="s2">heart rate your cholesterol within a</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.110" end="00:52:41.980" style="s2">level I want to look at the homeo</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.820" end="00:52:43.570" style="s2">dynamic capacity that when I stress it</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.980" end="00:52:45.970" style="s2">how far out does it go and how quickly</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.570" end="00:52:47.830" style="s2">does it come back because if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.970" end="00:52:49.780" style="s2">just want to define disease we want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.830" end="00:52:50.950" style="s2">define health in a way we can measure if</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.780" end="00:52:52.960" style="s2">we want to start to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.950" end="00:52:56.290" style="s2">objectivity of it then I would define</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.960" end="00:52:59.020" style="s2">health as related to the robustness of</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.290" end="00:53:01.420" style="s2">the homeo dynamic regulatory mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.020" end="00:53:03.760" style="s2">how much stress the being can be exposed</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.420" end="00:53:05.590" style="s2">to without going into pathophysiology</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.760" end="00:53:07.690" style="s2">without deviating from the homeo</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.590" end="00:53:09.700" style="s2">dynamics so we that&#39;s a different set of</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.690" end="00:53:12.040" style="s2">tests we need to stress test stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.700" end="00:53:16.260" style="s2">and so I would like to see more of those</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.040" end="00:53:19.420" style="s2">things then we can define disease as</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.260" end="00:53:20.940" style="s2">some of those homeo dynamic markers are</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.420" end="00:53:24.370" style="s2">actually out of range and</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.940" end="00:53:26.500" style="s2">pathophysiology is occurring aging is</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.370" end="00:53:28.240" style="s2">not yet disease they&#39;re in range but</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.500" end="00:53:30.040" style="s2">there&#39;s less robustness which means more</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.240" end="00:53:31.990" style="s2">susceptibility to disease meaning</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.040" end="00:53:35.100" style="s2">smaller stresses can cause larger strain</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.990" end="00:53:37.330" style="s2">and so then the kind of anti-aging</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.100" end="00:53:39.490" style="s2">prevented the preventative health</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.330" end="00:53:41.110" style="s2">promotion work is just increasing the</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.490" end="00:53:42.880" style="s2">robustness of the regulatory mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.110" end="00:53:46.660" style="s2">so we both want to measure and think</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.880" end="00:53:48.700" style="s2">about the body&#39;s regulatory dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.660" end="00:53:51.430" style="s2">how to promote those generally as well</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.700" end="00:53:53.530" style="s2">as look at the specific causes of</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.430" end="00:53:56.890" style="s2">pathology and how to reverse them</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.530" end="00:53:59.680" style="s2">specifically hmm beautiful thank you so</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.890" end="00:54:01.390" style="s2">when we you&#39;re talking about homeo</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.680" end="00:54:03.990" style="s2">dynamic systems so basically the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.390" end="00:54:07.600" style="s2">regulations all the different regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.990" end="00:54:10.240" style="s2">processes going on within a body that</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.600" end="00:54:12.670" style="s2">maintain some sort of range of what we</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.240" end="00:54:14.470" style="s2">perceive within the realm of ease rather</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.670" end="00:54:18.180" style="s2">than this ease which is probably then</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.470" end="00:54:21.630" style="s2">that the outliers of the bells curve so</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.180" end="00:54:21.630" style="s2">when we look at</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.210" end="00:54:29.130" style="s2">when we look at these regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.260" end="00:54:34.980" style="s2">mechanisms within a system we still</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.130" end="00:54:37.080" style="s2">assume that body is a closed system and</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.980" end="00:54:38.970" style="s2">I wonder from what you said before</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.080" end="00:54:41.550" style="s2">whether that&#39;s actually an assumption we</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.970" end="00:54:44.130" style="s2">should take oh whether we should also</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.550" end="00:54:48.600" style="s2">look at a perspective that assumes that</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.130" end="00:54:51.000" style="s2">this body has probably some mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.600" end="00:54:53.370" style="s2">that run within but probably also it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.000" end="00:54:55.740" style="s2">at least susceptible to or interfering</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.370" end="00:54:59.370" style="s2">with mechanisms that that are around</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.740" end="00:55:01.890" style="s2">that body Jonas okay so let&#39;s look at</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.370" end="00:55:03.720" style="s2">layers of holistic Ness and or</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.890" end="00:55:06.090" style="s2">comprehensive &#39;ti and consideration</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.720" end="00:55:08.160" style="s2">so we can&#39;t just do the vertical slices</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.090" end="00:55:10.020" style="s2">called neurology gastroenterology</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.160" end="00:55:12.060" style="s2">Rheumatology oncology because most of</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.020" end="00:55:13.920" style="s2">the complex things occur across those</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.060" end="00:55:16.260" style="s2">yeah right if we look at gut brain</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.920" end="00:55:18.270" style="s2">access dynamics that&#39;s gastroenterology</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.260" end="00:55:19.830" style="s2">neurology immunology Rheumatology all</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.270" end="00:55:22.020" style="s2">mixed together we&#39;re no specialists is</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.830" end="00:55:23.610" style="s2">gonna see the thing right so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.020" end="00:55:26.010" style="s2">look at the interaction of all the body</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.610" end="00:55:28.740" style="s2">systems we also have to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.010" end="00:55:30.300" style="s2">horizontal slices the ah mix of it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.740" end="00:55:32.070" style="s2">just what&#39;s happening at the genomic</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.300" end="00:55:33.720" style="s2">level and the epigenetic and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.070" end="00:55:36.030" style="s2">proteomic but also how the top-down</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.720" end="00:55:37.410" style="s2">connectomics stuff and neuro endocrine</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.030" end="00:55:38.760" style="s2">stuff is affecting the bottom-up stuff</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.410" end="00:55:40.710" style="s2">so we want to think about all the body</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.760" end="00:55:42.240" style="s2">systems together but then it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.710" end="00:55:45.510" style="s2">the body systems of the individual to</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.240" end="00:55:46.890" style="s2">the body and mind psyche emotion spirit</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.510" end="00:55:48.600" style="s2">of the individual right so we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.890" end="00:55:50.130" style="s2">thinking about how all of those interact</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.600" end="00:55:51.900" style="s2">but then it&#39;s not just the individuals</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.130" end="00:55:53.430" style="s2">the individual interacting with the</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.900" end="00:55:56.420" style="s2">greater world and universe they&#39;re part</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.430" end="00:55:59.570" style="s2">of both physically and psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.420" end="00:56:02.040" style="s2">right metaphysically so physically I</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.570" end="00:56:03.420" style="s2">find the person has micro toxins and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.040" end="00:56:06.030" style="s2">send them home to a house that still has</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.420" end="00:56:07.920" style="s2">mold in it like obviously we have to</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.030" end="00:56:12.750" style="s2">address the physical environment therein</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.920" end="00:56:14.880" style="s2">or we know very clearly that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.750" end="00:56:16.680" style="s2">lifestyle of people is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.880" end="00:56:17.790" style="s2">affected by the lifestyle of the people</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.680" end="00:56:20.520" style="s2">they&#39;re spending a lot of time around</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.790" end="00:56:23.250" style="s2">more than almost anything else so the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.520" end="00:56:25.110" style="s2">person has illnesses associated with</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.250" end="00:56:27.000" style="s2">obesity and I send them home to an</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.110" end="00:56:28.950" style="s2">environment and a community in which the</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.000" end="00:56:30.420" style="s2">health habits of everyone suck and are</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.950" end="00:56:32.130" style="s2">self reinforcing and would be</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.420" end="00:56:34.170" style="s2">ostracizing if they did something</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.130" end="00:56:35.790" style="s2">different or where the person&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.170" end="00:56:36.500" style="s2">lonely and loneliness we know drives</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.790" end="00:56:41.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.500" end="00:56:42.980" style="s2">so I&#39;ve got to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.560" end="00:56:44.780" style="s2">physiological and psychological</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.980" end="00:56:46.730" style="s2">interactions of the being with their</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.780" end="00:56:49.850" style="s2">environment and what&#39;s necessary so we</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.730" end="00:56:51.800" style="s2">think about a integrative or a holistic</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.850" end="00:56:55.220" style="s2">medicine or healthcare it has to factor</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.800" end="00:56:59.000" style="s2">all that so to what degree is a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.220" end="00:57:01.430" style="s2">isolation or separation the cause of</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.000" end="00:57:04.790" style="s2">disease whether it&#39;s the subjective</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.430" end="00:57:06.410" style="s2">experience of feeling separated because</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.790" end="00:57:09.350" style="s2">that&#39;s is that a statement you could go</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.410" end="00:57:11.810" style="s2">along with that that the the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.350" end="00:57:14.050" style="s2">separation is is a sense that I may</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.810" end="00:57:18.010" style="s2">create but it is an illusionary sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.050" end="00:57:20.510" style="s2">whilst there is nothing but a connect an</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.010" end="00:57:23.090" style="s2">interconnectedness so as soon as I</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.510" end="00:57:26.510" style="s2">perceive myself as separate from that</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.090" end="00:57:31.360" style="s2">one interconnectedness this is a cause</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.510" end="00:57:34.040" style="s2">of disease when you say that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.360" end="00:57:39.290" style="s2">disconnection is illusory while that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.040" end="00:57:43.010" style="s2">true on some levels it&#39;s also switching</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.290" end="00:57:47.180" style="s2">the burden to the individual perception</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.010" end="00:57:50.900" style="s2">where maybe they actually have social</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.180" end="00:57:53.060" style="s2">dynamics that really are ostracizing or</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.900" end="00:57:54.710" style="s2">really are don&#39;t have real connection</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.060" end="00:57:56.090" style="s2">and of course insofar as I&#39;m talking to</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.710" end="00:57:58.340" style="s2">the individual I want to help them</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.090" end="00:58:00.530" style="s2">figure out how they can take more agency</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.340" end="00:58:02.000" style="s2">to change their life but insofar as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.530" end="00:58:03.290" style="s2">think about how to change systems I want</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.000" end="00:58:05.480" style="s2">to say how do we make systems and</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.290" end="00:58:07.850" style="s2">support individuals more that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.480" end="00:58:09.380" style="s2">the classically right and left</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.850" end="00:58:11.150" style="s2">perspective individual or collective</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.380" end="00:58:12.530" style="s2">focus you have to do both and pay</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.150" end="00:58:16.100" style="s2">attention to the virtuous cycle between</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.530" end="00:58:17.600" style="s2">them when you look at work of people</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.100" end="00:58:21.020" style="s2">like gob or Mateo and others on</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.600" end="00:58:24.890" style="s2">attachment theory and how much the sense</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.020" end="00:58:28.580" style="s2">of isolation drives addiction which then</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.890" end="00:58:30.550" style="s2">drives so many other things from a</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.580" end="00:58:36.290" style="s2">health perspective I think this is huge</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.550" end="00:58:40.850" style="s2">but it&#39;s also like when we look at mass</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.290" end="00:58:43.760" style="s2">shooters none of them that I&#39;m aware of</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.850" end="00:58:46.780" style="s2">had healthy meaningful relationships</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.760" end="00:58:48.700" style="s2">before being mass shooters so</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.780" end="00:58:51.609" style="s2">News goes and interviews and says they</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.700" end="00:58:53.560" style="s2">were all the neighbors the neighbors say</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.609" end="00:58:55.510" style="s2">the person was a loner they totally kept</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.560" end="00:58:57.820" style="s2">themselves nobody ever saw them which</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.510" end="00:59:00.880" style="s2">means that person was getting per to</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.820" end="00:59:02.800" style="s2">progress and they&#39;re how disenfranchised</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.880" end="00:59:04.420" style="s2">they felt how depressed how misanthropic</p>
