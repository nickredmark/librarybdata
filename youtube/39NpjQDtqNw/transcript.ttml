<p begin="00:01:35.259" end="00:01:39.820" style="s2">if you remember they&#39;re very problematic</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.600" end="00:01:43.950" style="s2">but that they&#39;re at the core of many of</p>

<p begin="00:01:43.950" end="00:01:48.040" style="s2">foundational philosophies this is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.509" end="00:01:49.810" style="s2">idea that people have an alternative</p>

<p begin="00:01:55.210" end="00:02:01.299" style="s2">problematic precisely because we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.000" end="00:02:03.850" style="s2">judge realness by how well we get an an</p>

<p begin="00:02:12.910" end="00:02:16.660" style="s2">here with it people do the alternative</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.829" end="00:02:18.850" style="s2">instead of rejecting it the way we</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.660" end="00:02:20.049" style="s2">reject dreaming for example because it</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.850" end="00:02:22.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go here with our everyday</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.049" end="00:02:25.150" style="s2">experience people reject the everyday</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.480" end="00:02:26.870" style="s2">experience as illusory and they say that</p>

<p begin="00:02:29.349" end="00:02:33.670" style="s2">to reality and as you remember as we&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:02:44.840" end="00:02:52.220" style="s2">is central to what wisdom means and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.680" end="00:02:56.420" style="s2">having some deep sense of connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.220" end="00:02:59.200" style="s2">to reality is also central to what it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.420" end="00:03:04.069" style="s2">to regard one&#39;s life as authentically</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.200" end="00:03:06.170" style="s2">meaningful in some fashion so that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.069" end="00:03:08.269" style="s2">the problem we had set up the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.170" end="00:03:10.069" style="s2">higher states of consciousness now I</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.269" end="00:03:13.129" style="s2">want to start by talking about what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.069" end="00:03:13.940" style="s2">like to give a theory that we talked</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.129" end="00:03:16.340" style="s2">about this also</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.940" end="00:03:17.780" style="s2">last time we want a theory that&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.340" end="00:03:20.000" style="s2">descriptively adequate and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.780" end="00:03:22.310" style="s2">prescriptively adequate a descriptive</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.000" end="00:03:25.970" style="s2">theory should tell me like give me a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.310" end="00:03:27.560" style="s2">good explanation for why these higher</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.970" end="00:03:30.379" style="s2">states of consciousness have the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.560" end="00:03:32.090" style="s2">experience feel that they have why they</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.379" end="00:03:33.769" style="s2">and why they&#39;re able to produce these</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.090" end="00:03:36.380" style="s2">deep kinds of transformations because if</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.769" end="00:03:37.880" style="s2">you remember what typically happens is</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.380" end="00:03:40.040" style="s2">because people have sensed this deep</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.880" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">connectedness to reality and because</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.040" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">being connected to reality is one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:46.190" style="s2">fundamental way in which we makes our</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:48.769" style="s2">lives meaningful people will radically</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.190" end="00:03:50.930" style="s2">transform their whole lives their sense</p>

<p begin="00:03:50.930" end="00:03:58.299" style="s2">in order to maintain and enhance that</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.400" end="00:04:02.209" style="s2">connectedness to this deepened reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.299" end="00:04:04.220" style="s2">so we need to explain give a</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.209" end="00:04:05.750" style="s2">descriptively adequate explanation and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.220" end="00:04:07.940" style="s2">this has to work at multiple levels and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.750" end="00:04:10.549" style="s2">this is where cognitive science is so</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.940" end="00:04:12.410" style="s2">important because of the way it tries to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.549" end="00:04:14.480" style="s2">bridge between these various levels and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.410" end="00:04:17.479" style="s2">disciplines we need to give an account</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.480" end="00:04:20.090" style="s2">of the psychological processes of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.479" end="00:04:22.970" style="s2">information processes and ultimately the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.090" end="00:04:24.740" style="s2">brain processes that are at work then we</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.970" end="00:04:26.240" style="s2">need a prescriptively adequate theory of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.740" end="00:04:30.830" style="s2">higher states of consciousness we need</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.240" end="00:04:33.229" style="s2">an account that explains why it might be</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.830" end="00:04:37.400" style="s2">considered rationally justifiable that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.229" end="00:04:40.220" style="s2">these states authorised and legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.400" end="00:04:43.910" style="s2">such transformations can we see</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.220" end="00:04:48.910" style="s2">why these states should be listened to</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.910" end="00:04:53.660" style="s2">when they claim to give us access to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.910" end="00:04:56.540" style="s2">deeper reality now in order to carry out</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.660" end="00:04:59.120" style="s2">the first one seeing what the said</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.540" end="00:05:01.130" style="s2">harder was going through right when he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.120" end="00:05:04.130" style="s2">achieving this higher state of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.130" end="00:05:05.360" style="s2">consciousness this awakened state and if</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.130" end="00:05:08.960" style="s2">you remember last time we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.360" end="00:05:10.670" style="s2">how concept how comprehensively extended</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.960" end="00:05:12.080" style="s2">this is not only qualitatively through</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.670" end="00:05:14.420" style="s2">the world religions but just</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.080" end="00:05:17.150" style="s2">quantitatively through the population a</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.420" end="00:05:19.520" style="s2">30 to 40 percent of people report these</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.150" end="00:05:23.810" style="s2">awakening experiences and the resulting</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.520" end="00:05:26.060" style="s2">deep transformation so in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.810" end="00:05:28.250" style="s2">through that let&#39;s talk about what what</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.060" end="00:05:30.380" style="s2">does it feel like to be in such a state</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.250" end="00:05:32.600" style="s2">and because we have these surveys and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.380" end="00:05:34.970" style="s2">have the work of newburgh and Taylor and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.600" end="00:05:37.820" style="s2">we have lots of first-person accounts we</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.970" end="00:05:40.070" style="s2">can draw some general pictures of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.820" end="00:05:42.260" style="s2">going on so there&#39;s three components we</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.070" end="00:05:47.390" style="s2">want to look at we want to look at how</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.260" end="00:05:49.700" style="s2">is the world being experienced how is</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.390" end="00:05:52.270" style="s2">the self being experienced and how is</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.700" end="00:05:55.760" style="s2">the relationship between the world and</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.270" end="00:05:59.090" style="s2">their self being experienced so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.760" end="00:06:02.770" style="s2">start on the world side so people report</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.090" end="00:06:06.350" style="s2">the following things they report a</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.770" end="00:06:08.540" style="s2">tremendous sense of clarity and this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.350" end="00:06:10.100" style="s2">both perceptual and cognitive so the</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.540" end="00:06:12.860" style="s2">world seems extremely clear to them and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.100" end="00:06:16.190" style="s2">make sense to them in a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.860" end="00:06:18.830" style="s2">hasn&#39;t before the perceptual part of</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.190" end="00:06:23.300" style="s2">that clarity is often experienced as</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.830" end="00:06:27.470" style="s2">bright things are shining and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.300" end="00:06:29.570" style="s2">original meaning of glory for example to</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.470" end="00:06:31.280" style="s2">go back to the Bible for example the</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.570" end="00:06:33.979" style="s2">term that is most often used to describe</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.280" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">God is glory which is not a moral term</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.979" end="00:06:40.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a term about how sort of shining</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:43.040" style="s2">God is how how bright it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.040" end="00:06:45.470" style="s2">now you remember that&#39;s a feature that</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.040" end="00:06:46.850" style="s2">people also reliably report in the flow</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.470" end="00:06:50.870" style="s2">experience that everything seems very</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.850" end="00:06:53.690" style="s2">vivid and in bright and intense</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.870" end="00:06:56.810" style="s2">now what&#39;s interesting is that while</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.690" end="00:06:58.130" style="s2">people describe this clarity and notice</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.810" end="00:06:59.030" style="s2">how this is going to pick up on what we</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.130" end="00:07:01.070" style="s2">talked about when we talked about</p>

<p begin="00:07:01.070" end="00:07:05.720" style="s2">expansion of vision so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.100" end="00:07:07.580" style="s2">comprehensive they get almost like</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.720" end="00:07:10.820" style="s2">they&#39;re somehow aware of the whole of</p>

<p begin="00:07:10.820" end="00:07:16.940" style="s2">finite details so this is captured for</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.330" end="00:07:19.330" style="s2">example in Blake&#39;s famous poem right to</p>

<p begin="00:07:19.330" end="00:07:26.120" style="s2">heaven in a wild flower to hold infinity</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.120" end="00:07:27.770" style="s2">in the palm of your hand and to spend</p>

<p begin="00:07:27.770" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">so you get this deep interpenetration of</p>

<p begin="00:07:33.680" end="00:07:37.400" style="s2">details that you can see that so what</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.570" end="00:07:39.889" style="s2">you&#39;re getting is this massive expansion</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.400" end="00:07:41.900" style="s2">of that attentional scale in that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.889" end="00:07:44.060" style="s2">talked about mindfulness enhancing and</p>

<p begin="00:07:54.710" end="00:08:00.139" style="s2">there&#39;s an increased sense of making</p>

<p begin="00:08:00.139" end="00:08:06.979" style="s2">things so the world is both intricate</p>

<p begin="00:08:06.979" end="00:08:11.720" style="s2">enhanced and shining way so almost</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.830" end="00:08:15.010" style="s2">universally people describe this</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.720" end="00:08:18.289" style="s2">experience as the world is beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.010" end="00:08:19.910" style="s2">it&#39;s deeply beautiful to them and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.289" end="00:08:23.080" style="s2">come back at some point to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.910" end="00:08:25.460" style="s2">the connections between beauty and truth</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.080" end="00:08:29.210" style="s2">particularly the work of scar II about</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.460" end="00:08:31.550" style="s2">this the world is very alive</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.210" end="00:08:34.400" style="s2">it seems very alive during these</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.550" end="00:08:39.849" style="s2">experience because it&#39;s so pregnant with</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.400" end="00:08:44.630" style="s2">energy and significance and all of this</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.849" end="00:08:48.260" style="s2">all of this comprehensiveness but</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.630" end="00:08:50.540" style="s2">intricate detail the shining the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.260" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">the making sense all of this comes</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.540" end="00:08:57.290" style="s2">together in the notion of oneness</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">there&#39;s somehow an underlying oneness to</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.290" end="00:09:03.140" style="s2">everything there&#39;s deep and profound</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:04.670" style="s2">integration which of course makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.140" end="00:09:07.160" style="s2">given that very off</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.670" end="00:09:10.760" style="s2">than when we are explaining something we</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.160" end="00:09:13.970" style="s2">are finding what unifies and integrates</p>

<p begin="00:09:16.130" end="00:09:24.550" style="s2">side of the self is people report a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.100" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">profound sense of peace and this is not</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.550" end="00:09:30.650" style="s2">peace in an empty just lack of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:32.900" style="s2">it&#39;s very similar to what we talked</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.650" end="00:09:36.380" style="s2">about in Plato and you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.900" end="00:09:37.730" style="s2">seeing Plato&#39;s ideas about an agog a</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.380" end="00:09:40.160" style="s2">resonating with this I hope you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.730" end="00:09:42.410" style="s2">seeing that but remember in Plato right</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.160" end="00:09:45.590" style="s2">that inner state of peace is one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.410" end="00:09:47.870" style="s2">inner harmony when all of the various</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.590" end="00:09:51.620" style="s2">components of your personality and your</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.870" end="00:09:53.900" style="s2">cognition are mutually optimally working</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.620" end="00:09:56.030" style="s2">together in concert and this is the kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.900" end="00:09:57.860" style="s2">what people report the often report that</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.030" end="00:09:59.480" style="s2">this is the greatest sense of peace</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.860" end="00:10:01.910" style="s2">they&#39;ve ever experienced in their life</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.480" end="00:10:04.730" style="s2">and you remember in Plato this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.910" end="00:10:07.130" style="s2">peace right is connected to and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.730" end="00:10:09.370" style="s2">resonates with this enhanced sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.130" end="00:10:11.480" style="s2">connectedness to reality and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.370" end="00:10:14.660" style="s2">interestingly enough that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.480" end="00:10:18.260" style="s2">seeing in these and these descriptions</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.660" end="00:10:21.770" style="s2">people also described experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.260" end="00:10:24.440" style="s2">profound joy now of course we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.770" end="00:10:26.270" style="s2">the sense of what this word means we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.440" end="00:10:28.670" style="s2">lost it precisely in words like</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.270" end="00:10:31.580" style="s2">enjoyment where enjoyment means having</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.670" end="00:10:34.130" style="s2">fun or pleasure but joy is not the</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.580" end="00:10:38.300" style="s2">experience or fun or pleasure joy is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.130" end="00:10:41.510" style="s2">positive emotion you have when you</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.300" end="00:10:44.990" style="s2">experience a deep connection to what is</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.510" end="00:10:49.690" style="s2">good so joy is the experience you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.990" end="00:10:49.690" style="s2">of this is really really good</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.830" end="00:10:56.240" style="s2">interestingly people often report a</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.080" end="00:10:57.770" style="s2">fundamental change in their sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.240" end="00:11:02.030" style="s2">self and we&#39;re going to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.770" end="00:11:03.980" style="s2">this they report two things they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.030" end="00:11:05.330" style="s2">often report that their normal sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.980" end="00:11:08.510" style="s2">self has disappeared</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.330" end="00:11:10.580" style="s2">their eccentric autobiographical sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.510" end="00:11:13.400" style="s2">of self has disappeared and if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.580" end="00:11:14.990" style="s2">remember that&#39;s that&#39;s continuous with</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.400" end="00:11:16.460" style="s2">what we saw when people are in the flow</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.990" end="00:11:18.180" style="s2">state they report that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.460" end="00:11:20.390" style="s2">self-consciousness that auto-buy</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.180" end="00:11:25.050" style="s2">graphical narrative self is disappearing</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.390" end="00:11:26.970" style="s2">they often also report remembering in</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.050" end="00:11:29.130" style="s2">the sense we talked about when we talked</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.970" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">about sati and remembering the being</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.130" end="00:11:37.580" style="s2">mode they remember they say I remember</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.120" end="00:11:41.070" style="s2">my true self I remember who I really am</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.580" end="00:11:44.459" style="s2">so there&#39;s a profound connection inward</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.070" end="00:11:47.610" style="s2">to the core machinery of the self that</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.459" end="00:11:50.459" style="s2">is at one with a profound sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.610" end="00:11:53.190" style="s2">connecting to the underlying pattern</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.459" end="00:11:56.339" style="s2">that governs and makes intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.190" end="00:11:59.130" style="s2">reality people report that in this state</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.339" end="00:12:01.529" style="s2">they have a tremendous sense of energy</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.130" end="00:12:05.850" style="s2">and vitality again analogous to the flow</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.529" end="00:12:08.250" style="s2">state and finally they report that</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.850" end="00:12:10.500" style="s2">they&#39;re going state often use this term</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.250" end="00:12:14.360" style="s2">there is a tremendous sense of insight</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.500" end="00:12:18.750" style="s2">and understanding again</p>

<p begin="00:12:18.750" end="00:12:26.610" style="s2">about their relation so this is deep</p>

<p begin="00:12:26.610" end="00:12:32.010" style="s2">at one mint again like the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.500" end="00:12:33.060" style="s2">but even more people feel so at one that</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.010" end="00:12:36.330" style="s2">they start to feel that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.060" end="00:12:38.520" style="s2">participating in their reality that</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.330" end="00:12:41.010" style="s2">they&#39;re connected to this they start to</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.520" end="00:12:43.350" style="s2">feel like they&#39;re sharing identity to it</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.010" end="00:12:45.420" style="s2">and this your way of thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.350" end="00:12:47.310" style="s2">is when we talked about Aristotle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.420" end="00:12:49.620" style="s2">notion of the conformity theory of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.310" end="00:12:52.110" style="s2">knowing there they feel so deeply</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.620" end="00:12:54.540" style="s2">conformed to this underlying reality</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.110" end="00:12:57.050" style="s2">from the very core of their being that</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.540" end="00:13:04.190" style="s2">they are experiencing an identification</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.050" end="00:13:09.900" style="s2">with it but this participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.190" end="00:13:14.040" style="s2">is so superlative and it&#39;s so profound</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.900" end="00:13:16.680" style="s2">and so transformative that inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.040" end="00:13:20.640" style="s2">people to say that the experience that</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.680" end="00:13:22.380" style="s2">this connection is ineffable and we we</p>

<p begin="00:14:02.370" end="00:14:06.690" style="s2">already of course is deep continuity</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.770" end="00:14:08.130" style="s2">with the flow experience I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.690" end="00:14:08.970" style="s2">claiming it&#39;s a flow experience it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.130" end="00:14:10.380" style="s2">more than that</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.970" end="00:14:12.150" style="s2">but I&#39;m showing you that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.380" end="00:14:13.590" style="s2">continuity just like I showed you that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.150" end="00:14:15.510" style="s2">there&#39;s continuity between the flow</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.590" end="00:14:17.520" style="s2">experience and the insight experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.510" end="00:14:18.540" style="s2">and that&#39;s why when people are having</p>

<p begin="00:14:18.540" end="00:14:25.020" style="s2">they are also proposing a very profound</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.310" end="00:14:27.030" style="s2">insight and notice how often when you</p>

<p begin="00:14:38.610" end="00:14:43.440" style="s2">important things we should know about</p>

<p begin="00:14:55.260" end="00:14:59.130" style="s2">these are strategies that are designed</p>

<p begin="00:15:22.860" end="00:15:28.290" style="s2">bring about right a very long-term</p>

<p begin="00:15:28.290" end="00:15:32.760" style="s2">profound disruption in your normal state</p>

<p begin="00:15:32.760" end="00:15:38.010" style="s2">are also can pursue very short-term</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.420" end="00:15:42.690" style="s2">disruptive strategies these include</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.010" end="00:15:46.860" style="s2">things like fasting sexual and sleep</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.690" end="00:15:48.480" style="s2">deprivation the emember we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.860" end="00:15:50.340" style="s2">how shamans will make use of these</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.480" end="00:15:54.690" style="s2">strategies in order to induce the</p>

<p begin="00:15:59.430" end="00:16:04.230" style="s2">of these things disrupt your normal</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.560" end="00:16:07.170" style="s2">level of cognition and of course when we</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.230" end="00:16:09.570" style="s2">talked about this as well people will</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.170" end="00:16:11.670" style="s2">make use of psychedelics precisely</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.570" end="00:16:15.200" style="s2">because of the way they are so deeply</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.670" end="00:16:21.410" style="s2">disruptive of your normal cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.200" end="00:16:25.770" style="s2">your normal state of consciousness so</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.410" end="00:16:27.180" style="s2">what we know is that combinations well</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.770" end="00:16:29.220" style="s2">sorry that&#39;s a little too strong what we</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.180" end="00:16:31.110" style="s2">have good some initial good evidence is</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.220" end="00:16:33.030" style="s2">that combinations of these strategies</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.110" end="00:16:34.620" style="s2">can be very good there was a recent</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.030" end="00:16:38.610" style="s2">experiment coming out of the Griffiths</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.620" end="00:16:41.670" style="s2">lab in 2018 in which people who were</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.610" end="00:16:43.740" style="s2">practicing mindfulness and then took</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.670" end="00:16:45.480" style="s2">psychedelics tended to have a more</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.740" end="00:16:47.700" style="s2">enhanced experience than people who are</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.480" end="00:16:50.790" style="s2">just taking the psychedelics for example</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.700" end="00:16:52.560" style="s2">so you can combine the strategies</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.790" end="00:16:55.500" style="s2">together they can be mutually supportive</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.560" end="00:16:56.850" style="s2">now what&#39;s important for this as we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.500" end="00:17:00.030" style="s2">come back and take a look at more</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.850" end="00:17:02.400" style="s2">carefully in a few minutes is disruptive</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.030" end="00:17:05.280" style="s2">strategies are also central to setting</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.400" end="00:17:06.690" style="s2">up insight and that should make sense to</p>

<p begin="00:17:41.070" end="00:17:47.010" style="s2">across many dimensions of their life</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.240" end="00:17:49.130" style="s2">right there was significant improvement</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.010" end="00:17:52.289" style="s2">in family life health sense of purpose</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.130" end="00:17:54.779" style="s2">spirituality and will and I release from</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.289" end="00:17:58.700" style="s2">the anxiety and fear of death so the</p>

<p begin="00:18:02.460" end="00:18:06.960" style="s2">backing now Yadin also brings out</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.220" end="00:18:09.510" style="s2">something important than that study that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.960" end="00:18:13.919" style="s2">you don&#39;t see very well articulated in</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.510" end="00:18:16.919" style="s2">Newberg and in Taylor and this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.919" end="00:18:19.500" style="s2">the disruptive strategies that are that</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.919" end="00:18:22.890" style="s2">people are often using and it bleeds</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.500" end="00:18:25.260" style="s2">into the phenomenology by that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.890" end="00:18:28.020" style="s2">the experiential feel and structure of</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.260" end="00:18:31.230" style="s2">these experience right and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.020" end="00:18:34.020" style="s2">notion of decentering so when people</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.230" end="00:18:37.159" style="s2">describe these experiences they shift</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.020" end="00:18:39.510" style="s2">from right a very sort of first-person</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.159" end="00:18:42.870" style="s2">orientation and egocentric to an a low</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.510" end="00:18:44.370" style="s2">centric so they are not so egocentric</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.870" end="00:18:45.539" style="s2">this is why this is called decentering</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.370" end="00:18:48.419" style="s2">they&#39;re speaking more from like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.539" end="00:18:49.350" style="s2">third-person perspective and right</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.419" end="00:18:50.779" style="s2">allocentric</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.350" end="00:18:52.320" style="s2">so let me just give you a quick</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.779" end="00:18:54.840" style="s2">understanding of the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.320" end="00:18:57.480" style="s2">these terms I can describe my motion</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.840" end="00:19:00.450" style="s2">egocentric lis right things that are in</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.480" end="00:19:02.820" style="s2">front of me behind me to the right of me</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.450" end="00:19:06.120" style="s2">to the left of me right and that of</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.820" end="00:19:08.370" style="s2">course varies by how I&#39;m oriented</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.120" end="00:19:10.380" style="s2">because it is relative to me but I can</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.370" end="00:19:12.929" style="s2">also describe my position allocentric</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.380" end="00:19:17.130" style="s2">lis I can say where I am relative to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.929" end="00:19:19.530" style="s2">North Pole for example right so the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.130" end="00:19:20.700" style="s2">first is a first-person egocentric way</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.530" end="00:19:22.050" style="s2">of moving through the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.700" end="00:19:24.480" style="s2">the second is an</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.050" end="00:19:27.450" style="s2">eccentric third-person now extend that</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.480" end="00:19:30.270" style="s2">out people are much less egocentric li</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.450" end="00:19:32.780" style="s2">oriented when they&#39;re describing the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.270" end="00:19:35.730" style="s2">experience of their state then they are</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.780" end="00:19:37.770" style="s2">normally they&#39;re much more allocentric</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.730" end="00:19:41.040" style="s2">li oriented and that makes sense given</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.770" end="00:19:43.890" style="s2">how intensified the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.040" end="00:19:48.690" style="s2">reality is to them it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.890" end="00:19:52.230" style="s2">salience of reality is finally capable</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.690" end="00:19:55.890" style="s2">of eclipsing the narcissistic glow of</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.230" end="00:19:58.800" style="s2">our own ego and for a moment at least or</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.890" end="00:20:01.470" style="s2">for several moments we get release right</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.800" end="00:20:04.110" style="s2">and this is an important idea Nirvana</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.470" end="00:20:06.420" style="s2">means to blow out to extinguish or the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.110" end="00:20:11.640" style="s2">vedanta term moksha is release we get a</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.420" end="00:20:14.430" style="s2">release from right the imprisonment the</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.640" end="00:20:16.890" style="s2">self idealization by the super salience</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.430" end="00:20:21.210" style="s2">and therefore the bullshitting of our</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.890" end="00:20:27.840" style="s2">own ego centric perspective I mean do</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.210" end="00:20:31.640" style="s2">you not sometimes wish to be free from</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.840" end="00:20:39.200" style="s2">the prison cell of the super salience of</p>

<p begin="00:20:41.110" end="00:20:45.920" style="s2">as I&#39;ve been suggesting to you these</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.330" end="00:20:50.510" style="s2">higher states of consciousness have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.920" end="00:20:52.370" style="s2">lot of features of insight I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.510" end="00:20:54.710" style="s2">talked about the insight member we did</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.370" end="00:20:57.890" style="s2">the nine dot problem for example those</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.710" end="00:21:00.710" style="s2">aha moments because you get in that</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.890" end="00:21:04.090" style="s2">moment of insight you get a flash of</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.710" end="00:21:07.690" style="s2">insight you get sort of super salience</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.090" end="00:21:11.480" style="s2">things are making sense to you you get</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.690" end="00:21:14.210" style="s2">insight as it&#39;s almost visual into an</p>

<p begin="00:22:49.910" end="00:22:53.420" style="s2">it&#39;s in flow well it&#39;s going to be even</p>

<p begin="00:22:53.420" end="00:22:57.170" style="s2">enhanced sense of meaning in life and we</p>

<p begin="00:22:59.960" end="00:23:04.040" style="s2">and now what if it&#39;s beyond that what if</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.150" end="00:23:09.410" style="s2">it&#39;s a higher state of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.040" end="00:23:11.300" style="s2">that brings you this radical sense of</p>

<p begin="00:23:19.520" end="00:23:26.240" style="s2">that is going to give you a profound</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.470" end="00:23:28.580" style="s2">sense of increased meaning in life now</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.240" end="00:23:30.850" style="s2">if you get try to put this together</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.580" end="00:23:33.950" style="s2">if you get enhanced meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.850" end="00:23:36.740" style="s2">coupled to an enhanced sense of</p>

<p begin="00:23:48.350" end="00:23:55.060" style="s2">of the Buddha&#39;s confidence now what do</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.040" end="00:23:59.300" style="s2">we know about these flashes of insight</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.060" end="00:24:00.650" style="s2">well tow Belinsky and Reber in 2010 this</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.300" end="00:24:03.620" style="s2">is a different reaper not the implicit</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.650" end="00:24:10.430" style="s2">learning reaper right talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.620" end="00:24:12.590" style="s2">insight is a fluency spike although it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.430" end="00:24:16.130" style="s2">related to flow it&#39;s not the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.590" end="00:24:18.620" style="s2">fluency is a general it&#39;s a general</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.130" end="00:24:23.990" style="s2">property of all of your cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.620" end="00:24:25.700" style="s2">processing so how can we understand it</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.990" end="00:24:32.540" style="s2">well initially people thought that</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.700" end="00:24:34.580" style="s2">fluency was a sense of how easy it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.540" end="00:24:37.280" style="s2">to process things so the basic idea is</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.580" end="00:24:40.700" style="s2">if I make it easier for you to process</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.280" end="00:24:43.700" style="s2">information you will rate that</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.700" end="00:24:45.770" style="s2">information as better more trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.700" end="00:24:49.750" style="s2">more believable regardless of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.770" end="00:24:55.450" style="s2">semantic content so for example it</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.750" end="00:24:58.660" style="s2">compared this right to this</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.450" end="00:25:00.610" style="s2">the contrast isn&#39;t as great and if I</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.660" end="00:25:03.400" style="s2">were to get you to read some test text</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.610" end="00:25:07.090" style="s2">in black and the exact same text in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.400" end="00:25:10.540" style="s2">orange you will rate what you read in</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.090" end="00:25:12.940" style="s2">the black as better you&#39;ll have more</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.540" end="00:25:15.340" style="s2">confident it more likely to be true the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.940" end="00:25:17.890" style="s2">semantic content is exactly equal it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.340" end="00:25:20.530" style="s2">because it&#39;s easier for you to process</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.890" end="00:25:22.780" style="s2">the black and white contrast than the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.530" end="00:25:26.290" style="s2">orange on white contrast now it turns</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.780" end="00:25:29.950" style="s2">out it&#39;s not quite ease of processing</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.290" end="00:25:31.720" style="s2">just because simply repeating the</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.950" end="00:25:36.100" style="s2">stimulus doesn&#39;t trigger this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.720" end="00:25:38.050" style="s2">fluency it&#39;s more like how accessible</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.100" end="00:25:40.150" style="s2">information is how applicable it is I</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.050" end="00:25:42.700" style="s2">would argue that it&#39;s how well your</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.150" end="00:25:45.100" style="s2">system is zeroing in on right the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.700" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">relevant information how much has the</p>

<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:52.690" style="s2">that you can zero in on relevant</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.410" end="00:25:54.250" style="s2">information a way of thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.690" end="00:25:56.070" style="s2">to help make sense of it is with our</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.250" end="00:25:58.480" style="s2">discussion of psycho technology&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.070" end="00:26:01.480" style="s2">alphabetic literacy made your cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.480" end="00:26:04.090" style="s2">processing more fluent and that improved</p>

<p begin="00:26:12.850" end="00:26:22.360" style="s2">information you&#39;re processing is so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.400" end="00:26:27.000" style="s2">idea here is when you are fluent you are</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.360" end="00:26:29.890" style="s2">processing information very efficiently</p>

<p begin="00:26:47.020" end="00:26:56.530" style="s2">being more real now is this is this an</p>

<p begin="00:26:56.530" end="00:27:00.160" style="s2">that it&#39;s domain-general</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.150" end="00:27:02.770" style="s2">the fact that it seems to be part of our</p>

<p begin="00:27:05.730" end="00:27:11.770" style="s2">indicating that this fluency</p>

<p begin="00:27:11.770" end="00:27:17.080" style="s2">actually a very good strategy</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.720" end="00:27:19.840" style="s2">it&#39;s very generally the case not</p>

<p begin="00:27:35.350" end="00:27:43.000" style="s2">in and then we talked about flow as an</p>

<p begin="00:30:12.909" end="00:30:19.779" style="s2">although I as I was doing research on</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.760" end="00:30:22.240" style="s2">this Newberg independently for me we</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.779" end="00:30:24.250" style="s2">haven&#39;t spoken has also come up with is</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.240" end="00:30:26.770" style="s2">a version of the continuity hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.250" end="00:30:27.700" style="s2">it&#39;s not as developed as the one I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.770" end="00:30:31.029" style="s2">going to give you but it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.700" end="00:30:34.690" style="s2">consonant with it so the idea is fluency</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.029" end="00:30:38.380" style="s2">gets enhanced an insight insight gets to</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.690" end="00:30:41.649" style="s2">enhanced in flow alright so you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.380" end="00:30:44.230" style="s2">all those arguments already and then the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.649" end="00:30:48.370" style="s2">idea is as I&#39;m trying to show you flow</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.230" end="00:30:52.870" style="s2">experiences can be enhanced into</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.370" end="00:30:54.669" style="s2">mystical experiences and then there are</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.870" end="00:31:00.399" style="s2">mystical experiences that can bring</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.669" end="00:31:01.570" style="s2">about a transformative experience these</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.399" end="00:31:04.809" style="s2">are the higher states of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.570" end="00:31:06.429" style="s2">in which people right are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.809" end="00:31:08.890" style="s2">transform will come back to the problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.429" end="00:31:10.809" style="s2">of transformative experience so the</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.890" end="00:31:12.880" style="s2">continuity hypothesis is basically the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.809" end="00:31:15.640" style="s2">same machineries being used but it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.880" end="00:31:19.360" style="s2">being exact &#39;add remember excitation it</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.640" end="00:31:23.409" style="s2">is being progressively exempted into</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.360" end="00:31:28.000" style="s2">more and more powerful processing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.409" end="00:31:29.380" style="s2">can afford what I&#39;m going to argue a</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.000" end="00:31:31.420" style="s2">rationally justifiable</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.380" end="00:31:34.750" style="s2">guidance into the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.420" end="00:31:36.670" style="s2">transformation that we are seeking when</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.750" end="00:31:38.320" style="s2">we are seeking to cultivate wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.670" end="00:31:40.060" style="s2">enhance meaning in life when we are</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.320" end="00:31:42.160" style="s2">seeking to awaken from the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.060" end="00:31:44.440" style="s2">crisis we are trying to invoke one of</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.160" end="00:31:46.900" style="s2">these awakening experiences and remember</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.440" end="00:31:55.780" style="s2">that&#39;s what Buddha means the awakened</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.900" end="00:31:57.910" style="s2">one so Newburg argues that if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.780" end="00:31:59.140" style="s2">lot of these kinds of experiences what</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.910" end="00:32:02.110" style="s2">he calls little enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.140" end="00:32:04.570" style="s2">experiences or regular insights that</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.110" end="00:32:08.440" style="s2">this will eventually produce these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.570" end="00:32:10.510" style="s2">of experiences and I so this is not only</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.440" end="00:32:12.310" style="s2">a continuity hypothesis this is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.510" end="00:32:12.700" style="s2">priming hypothesis and I support that as</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.310" end="00:32:14.470" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.700" end="00:32:16.360" style="s2">the more you are practicing mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.470" end="00:32:17.830" style="s2">which we know is predictive of insight</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.360" end="00:32:20.440" style="s2">and flow we know that mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.830" end="00:32:21.610" style="s2">practices are predictive of mystical</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.440" end="00:32:23.500" style="s2">experiences we know that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.610" end="00:32:27.250" style="s2">connected to transformative experiences</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.500" end="00:32:30.240" style="s2">the more you can prime this pump the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.250" end="00:32:34.480" style="s2">more you will be able to bring about</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.240" end="00:32:41.190" style="s2">this enhance connectedness this enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.480" end="00:32:43.870" style="s2">and agar gay alright so this I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.190" end="00:32:46.390" style="s2">idea of the continuity hypothesis will</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.870" end="00:32:49.210" style="s2">help us to begin to explain what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.390" end="00:32:51.670" style="s2">on in the higher states of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.210" end="00:32:53.530" style="s2">and eventually use the very same</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.670" end="00:32:56.500" style="s2">machinery that we talked about in</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.530" end="00:32:59.910" style="s2">explaining it and to justify to give a</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.500" end="00:33:03.640" style="s2">rational justification for it all right</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.910" end="00:33:08.590" style="s2">so we know for example that in flow</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.640" end="00:33:10.260" style="s2">there has to be a relevant expertise all</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.590" end="00:33:15.040" style="s2">right remember we&#39;ve talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.260" end="00:33:18.700" style="s2">the flow state is when your skills your</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.040" end="00:33:20.530" style="s2">expertise right can meet the demands of</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.700" end="00:33:22.810" style="s2">the situation if you don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.530" end="00:33:25.720" style="s2">relevant skills you can&#39;t get into the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.810" end="00:33:27.760" style="s2">flow state right so I can get into the</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.720" end="00:33:29.500" style="s2">flow State as a martial artist because I</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.760" end="00:33:31.390" style="s2">have cultivated the expertise I can get</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.500" end="00:33:33.130" style="s2">in as a flow state while lecturing</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.390" end="00:33:37.750" style="s2">because I&#39;ve been doing it for 24 years</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.130" end="00:33:40.000" style="s2">I have the relevant expertise so what we</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.750" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">might ask and what you should ask me</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.000" end="00:33:45.520" style="s2">right now you say well join like what</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:47.650" style="s2">flowing in these higher states of</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.520" end="00:33:52.810" style="s2">consciousness what&#39;s what&#39;s what what</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.650" end="00:33:55.240" style="s2">expertise are you using well what I want</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.810" end="00:33:58.930" style="s2">to argue to you is it&#39;s a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.240" end="00:34:02.170" style="s2">kind of expertise one that&#39;s central to</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.930" end="00:34:05.500" style="s2">your everyday experience of making sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.170" end="00:34:07.980" style="s2">of the world on a day-to-day basis so</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.500" end="00:34:10.870" style="s2">this ultimately goes back to work by</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.980" end="00:34:13.360" style="s2">Marlo Ponte especially in the book the</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.870" end="00:34:16.120" style="s2">phenomenology perception but the people</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.360" end="00:34:18.460" style="s2">who I&#39;m going to most often refer to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.120" end="00:34:20.409" style="s2">work of Herbert Dreyfuss breakfast is</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.460" end="00:34:22.899" style="s2">famous within cognitive science for</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.409" end="00:34:25.179" style="s2">bringing the work of Marla Ponte and</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.899" end="00:34:28.179" style="s2">others into cognitive science and also</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.179" end="00:34:30.159" style="s2">the work of Dreyfuss and Taylor this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.179" end="00:34:31.629" style="s2">the Charles Taylor that we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.159" end="00:34:34.540" style="s2">talked about with connection to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.629" end="00:34:39.100" style="s2">extra revolution in a book called</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.540" end="00:34:47.830" style="s2">retrieving realism so what process is</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.100" end="00:34:50.440" style="s2">being optimized here okay so Dreyfuss</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.830" end="00:34:55.419" style="s2">and others talk about write what they</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.440" end="00:34:56.649" style="s2">call optimal grip now that&#39;s so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.419" end="00:34:58.390" style="s2">they meet it metaphorically because</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.649" end="00:35:01.720" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about cognition but that</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.390" end="00:35:04.410" style="s2">is such a wonderful Lee felicitous term</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.720" end="00:35:07.660" style="s2">because again it harkens back to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.410" end="00:35:09.430" style="s2">conformity theory of cognition a contact</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.660" end="00:35:13.090" style="s2">epistemology that of course Charles</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.430" end="00:35:16.060" style="s2">Taylor introduced us to now what do they</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.090" end="00:35:18.490" style="s2">mean by that so part of this is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.060" end="00:35:20.110" style="s2">that when we&#39;re let&#39;s talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.490" end="00:35:23.050" style="s2">first perceptually when I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.110" end="00:35:24.700" style="s2">perceive an object especially if I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.050" end="00:35:28.240" style="s2">know what the object is initially I</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.700" end="00:35:33.360" style="s2">don&#39;t remain static okay I&#39;m gonna move</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.240" end="00:35:36.310" style="s2">around the object until I get to a place</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.360" end="00:35:37.390" style="s2">that gets into a tradeoff relationship</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.310" end="00:35:39.720" style="s2">remember we&#39;ve talked about these</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.390" end="00:35:42.580" style="s2">trade-off relationships before</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.720" end="00:35:44.650" style="s2">what trade-off relationship I want okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.580" end="00:35:49.000" style="s2">I want to get to a place where I can see</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.650" end="00:35:50.860" style="s2">as many details of the cup as possible</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.000" end="00:35:51.370" style="s2">so that was sort of zooming in right oh</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.860" end="00:35:54.010" style="s2">wow</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.370" end="00:35:56.090" style="s2">but if i zoom in too much I lose on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.010" end="00:35:58.370" style="s2">other end I don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.090" end="00:36:00.020" style="s2">a sense of the gestalt remember that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.370" end="00:36:03.980" style="s2">don&#39;t get a sense of the overall thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.020" end="00:36:05.860" style="s2">so what I do is I move the cup around so</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.980" end="00:36:08.870" style="s2">that I get a place where I get the best</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.860" end="00:36:10.880" style="s2">optimization for my needs because all</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.870" end="00:36:13.640" style="s2">it&#39;s always relative to what I&#39;m doing I</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.880" end="00:36:19.340" style="s2">get a best optimization between the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.640" end="00:36:22.430" style="s2">overall grasp of the cup its Gestalt and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.340" end="00:36:24.830" style="s2">a grasp of its details so I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.430" end="00:36:26.840" style="s2">get a dynamic balance between that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.830" end="00:36:30.110" style="s2">when you draw faces you draw them from</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.840" end="00:36:32.060" style="s2">the perspective of the optimal grip you</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.110" end="00:36:34.910" style="s2">have on them you represent a face in</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.060" end="00:36:36.860" style="s2">such a way right you draw a face in such</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.910" end="00:36:38.900" style="s2">a way that you try to get as much of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.860" end="00:36:40.310" style="s2">whole and as much as the detail together</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.900" end="00:36:42.590" style="s2">you don&#39;t draw a face by like drawing</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.310" end="00:36:44.900" style="s2">someone&#39;s eyes really in detail and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.590" end="00:36:47.990" style="s2">don&#39;t draw a face by zooming out right</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.900" end="00:36:53.620" style="s2">too far you try and get exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.990" end="00:36:55.730" style="s2">right balance so a lot of perception</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.620" end="00:36:59.780" style="s2">you&#39;re unaware of this because you</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.730" end="00:37:02.720" style="s2">learned how to do this when you are like</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.780" end="00:37:04.670" style="s2">a young child but think about for</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.720" end="00:37:08.980" style="s2">example again if you&#39;re learning a</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.670" end="00:37:12.260" style="s2">martial art okay just as integral</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.980" end="00:37:15.590" style="s2">earning how to perceive your opponent</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.260" end="00:37:18.860" style="s2">part of what you&#39;re trying to do is try</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.590" end="00:37:22.070" style="s2">to get an optimal grip on your opponent</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.860" end="00:37:24.440" style="s2">so right in Tai Chi for example we</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.070" end="00:37:26.150" style="s2">talked about Tiger Eyes we you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.440" end="00:37:28.100" style="s2">want a hard focus on the person&#39;s face</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.150" end="00:37:30.110" style="s2">one of the mistakes that many people</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.100" end="00:37:32.330" style="s2">make going into a confrontation is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.110" end="00:37:33.710" style="s2">hard focus on face are they hard focus</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.330" end="00:37:36.260" style="s2">on weapon we know this from</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.710" end="00:37:38.240" style="s2">psychological research by the way you</p>

<p begin="00:38:08.510" end="00:38:11.630" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.080" end="00:38:14.450" style="s2">gonna take a stance right and the point</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.630" end="00:38:17.750" style="s2">about the stance right is to try and</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.450" end="00:38:19.670" style="s2">give you an optimal sense right give you</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.750" end="00:38:20.990" style="s2">an overall sense so now I&#39;m aware of my</p>

<p begin="00:38:20.990" end="00:38:26.360" style="s2">but I&#39;m also aware of it in connection</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.990" end="00:38:28.250" style="s2">to the details of like where my fingers</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.360" end="00:38:30.410" style="s2">are where my wrists are what my joints</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.250" end="00:38:32.510" style="s2">are doing and I&#39;m taking a stance that I</p>

<p begin="00:38:40.130" end="00:38:46.430" style="s2">cognitively Eleanor Rosch pointed this</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.270" end="00:38:48.950" style="s2">out in terms of the categories you use</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.430" end="00:38:50.930" style="s2">so you will describe things as a cat or</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.950" end="00:38:53.990" style="s2">a dog that&#39;s how you&#39;ll usually talk</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.930" end="00:38:58.130" style="s2">about it you usually won&#39;t go a level up</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.990" end="00:39:00.920" style="s2">and say oh that&#39;s a mammal so this</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.130" end="00:39:02.540" style="s2">creatures walking by on the road and</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.920" end="00:39:03.620" style="s2">somebody says hey look at the mammal</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.540" end="00:39:07.580" style="s2">don&#39;t be weird</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.620" end="00:39:11.470" style="s2">right now they might go down to another</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.580" end="00:39:13.790" style="s2">level like there&#39;s the cocker spaniel</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.470" end="00:39:16.130" style="s2">but generally they&#39;re doing that because</p>

<p begin="00:39:28.250" end="00:39:36.440" style="s2">this a marker right why do we default to</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.460" end="00:39:41.050" style="s2">the basic level because it&#39;s how we get</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.440" end="00:39:43.610" style="s2">our cognitively optimal grip you see</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.050" end="00:39:46.010" style="s2">there&#39;s two things I want to trade off</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.610" end="00:39:50.300" style="s2">in when I&#39;m categorizing things here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.010" end="00:39:53.570" style="s2">my category right I want as much</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.300" end="00:39:58.310" style="s2">similarity within the category as I can</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.570" end="00:40:01.280" style="s2">get right but I want as much difference</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.310" end="00:40:03.350" style="s2">between two categories and those aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.280" end="00:40:07.670" style="s2">a trade-off because as I go higher up</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.350" end="00:40:10.250" style="s2">right I get much more abstract and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.670" end="00:40:13.930" style="s2">lose the specific differences when I go</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.250" end="00:40:18.260" style="s2">down here right I&#39;m getting too specific</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.930" end="00:40:20.300" style="s2">I&#39;m losing the broad generality we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.260" end="00:40:22.520" style="s2">talked about this before you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.300" end="00:40:24.290" style="s2">trying to balance between getting</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.520" end="00:40:28.820" style="s2">remember the higher the higher states of</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.290" end="00:40:30.050" style="s2">consciousness and as detailed as you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.820" end="00:40:32.810" style="s2">and those are always in a trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.050" end="00:40:35.540" style="s2">relationship so you talk about dogs and</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.810" end="00:40:40.630" style="s2">cats because that&#39;s your way of getting</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.540" end="00:40:40.630" style="s2">an optimal cognitive grip on the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.780" end="00:40:51.380" style="s2">remember we did this the cat remember we</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.300" end="00:40:53.660" style="s2">talked about how you&#39;re simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.380" end="00:40:56.480" style="s2">going up to the gestalt and down to the</p>

<p begin="00:41:03.020" end="00:41:09.320" style="s2">now you&#39;ve got a way of paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.900" end="00:41:15.830" style="s2">that allows you to read and you had to</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.320" end="00:41:21.940" style="s2">practice that optimal gripping you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.830" end="00:41:25.490" style="s2">going into a first date what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.940" end="00:41:28.760" style="s2">well you&#39;re trying to get a sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.490" end="00:41:32.060" style="s2">person now here&#39;s where the term optimal</p>

<p begin="00:41:38.420" end="00:41:41.960" style="s2">but you&#39;re trying to get an optimal grip</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:44.780" style="s2">on the other person and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.960" end="00:41:47.240" style="s2">difficult notice how your your toggling</p>

<p begin="00:41:47.240" end="00:41:51.200" style="s2">you know this because of the kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:41:51.200" end="00:41:56.380" style="s2">things right I happen to be straight so</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.200" end="00:42:00.250" style="s2">they&#39;ll say to me for example you know</p>

<p begin="00:42:00.250" end="00:42:09.410" style="s2">smile but not too much laughs not too</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.660" end="00:42:12.290" style="s2">often ask the questions but not too many</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.410" end="00:42:15.530" style="s2">and mix it up between these strategies</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.290" end="00:42:21.880" style="s2">but not chaotically and you&#39;re like sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.530" end="00:42:25.520" style="s2">of uh and yet here&#39;s the thing you do it</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.880" end="00:42:28.850" style="s2">it works at least sometimes you figure</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.520" end="00:42:31.780" style="s2">out you find that sweet spot where</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.850" end="00:42:35.510" style="s2">you&#39;re getting the sense of the person</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.780" end="00:42:37.400" style="s2">both as a whole and in detail</p>

<p begin="00:46:06.490" end="00:46:14.230" style="s2">that by using mindfulness and breaking</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.450" end="00:46:17.109" style="s2">frame you also are naturally disposed to</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.230" end="00:46:18.910" style="s2">do this your mind wanders your mind</p>

<p begin="00:46:18.910" end="00:46:25.480" style="s2">us find this annoying it&#39;s like ah why</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.720" end="00:46:30.910" style="s2">can&#39;t I keep my mind on something but</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.480" end="00:46:35.410" style="s2">why is mind wandering so hardwired into</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.910" end="00:46:37.480" style="s2">us and one of my former students and now</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.410" end="00:46:38.980" style="s2">colleague and good friend Zak Irving</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.480" end="00:46:41.410" style="s2">he&#39;s becoming one of the world experts</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.980" end="00:46:43.119" style="s2">on mind wandering I would point you to</p>

<p begin="00:46:43.119" end="00:46:48.910" style="s2">depth what I would want to say for here</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.869" end="00:46:50.980" style="s2">and I think Zak would agree with me on</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.910" end="00:46:53.230" style="s2">this is that one of the things that mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.980" end="00:46:56.590" style="s2">wandering does is enhances your capacity</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.230" end="00:47:01.060" style="s2">for insight because by distracting you</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.590" end="00:47:02.080" style="s2">from how you framed a situation it can</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.060" end="00:47:06.550" style="s2">help you</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.080" end="00:47:08.770" style="s2">return and break up that fixated frame</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.550" end="00:47:10.810" style="s2">and there&#39;s work by Siegel and others</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.770" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">showing that moderate amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.810" end="00:47:14.980" style="s2">distraction actually enhance your</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:16.990" style="s2">cognitive flexibility the reason why we</p>

<p begin="00:47:16.990" end="00:47:21.000" style="s2">not saying it&#39;s the sole reason but one</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.610" end="00:47:24.940" style="s2">of the things it does is it helps</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.000" end="00:47:27.580" style="s2">disrupt our framing so that we can break</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.940" end="00:47:30.100" style="s2">frame and make a new frame that&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.580" end="00:47:31.780" style="s2">why and and and this is why people have</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.100" end="00:47:34.120" style="s2">built a whole mythology around incue</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.780" end="00:47:36.490" style="s2">bation go and sleep on it or go for a</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.120" end="00:47:38.170" style="s2">walk or take a shower basically what</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.490" end="00:47:41.680" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is a disruptive strategy of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.170" end="00:47:43.990" style="s2">distraction right as I mentioned you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.680" end="00:47:45.520" style="s2">deliberately more deliberately engage in</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.990" end="00:47:48.610" style="s2">a disruptive strategy through</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.520" end="00:47:50.500" style="s2">mindfulness practices we know</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.610" end="00:47:52.720" style="s2">experimentally that if you give a person</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.500" end="00:47:55.270" style="s2">problem and you introduce entropy noise</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.720" end="00:47:59.110" style="s2">into the problem a moderate amount that</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.270" end="00:48:01.150" style="s2">can help them have an insight and we</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.110" end="00:48:03.460" style="s2">know for example that when your brain is</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.150" end="00:48:04.900" style="s2">engaging in insight there&#39;s good reason</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.460" end="00:48:06.820" style="s2">to believe as I&#39;ve mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.900" end="00:48:08.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a significant shift we talked</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.820" end="00:48:10.510" style="s2">about this between the left and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.830" end="00:48:12.490" style="s2">right hemisphere that&#39;s an internal</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.510" end="00:48:14.350" style="s2">disruptive strategy so your brain has</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.490" end="00:48:15.820" style="s2">all these strategies and you can learn</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.350" end="00:48:20.050" style="s2">some psycho technologies that enhance</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.820" end="00:48:22.480" style="s2">all this powerful disruption so the</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.050" end="00:48:25.450" style="s2">disruptive machinery that&#39;s integral to</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.480" end="00:48:27.190" style="s2">insight can be exacta dand enhanced to</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.450" end="00:48:32.620" style="s2">bring about a higher state of</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.190" end="00:48:34.120" style="s2">consciousness so what what these all of</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.620" end="00:48:35.320" style="s2">these disruptive strategies do with</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.120" end="00:48:37.950" style="s2">insight is what&#39;s called d</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.320" end="00:48:37.950" style="s2">automatisation</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.250" end="00:48:52.090" style="s2">so you remember with the nine dot</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.810" end="00:48:53.140" style="s2">problem you automatically and remember</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.090" end="00:48:54.670" style="s2">this because we&#39;re gonna need this when</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.140" end="00:48:57.849" style="s2">we talk about other things like stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.670" end="00:49:01.780" style="s2">you automatically unconsciously saw it</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.849" end="00:49:02.140" style="s2">as a square you framed it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.780" end="00:49:05.730" style="s2">the square</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.140" end="00:49:08.020" style="s2">you automatically unconsciously right</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.730" end="00:49:14.070" style="s2">formulated it as they connected on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.020" end="00:49:18.730" style="s2">problem and then that automatic framing</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.070" end="00:49:22.300" style="s2">blocks you from solving it and in order</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.730" end="00:49:24.130" style="s2">to get out of that you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.300" end="00:49:25.810" style="s2">Dymatize your cognition now we talked</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.130" end="00:49:27.970" style="s2">about this when we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.810" end="00:49:31.090" style="s2">attentional scaling and mindfulness just</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.970" end="00:49:33.550" style="s2">reminding you that what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.090" end="00:49:36.609" style="s2">these disruptive strategies is very</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.550" end="00:49:38.260" style="s2">significant the automatization something</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.609" end="00:49:40.690" style="s2">else is going on with these disruptive</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.260" end="00:49:43.240" style="s2">strategies what these destructor</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.690" end="00:49:48.010" style="s2">strategies do is they increase the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.240" end="00:49:51.670" style="s2">variation in your processing often by</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.010" end="00:49:55.750" style="s2">introducing a lot of noise right a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.670" end="00:49:58.540" style="s2">of entropy into your processing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.750" end="00:50:01.060" style="s2">increasing the variation and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.540" end="00:50:02.200" style="s2">paying attention to what processes</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.060" end="00:50:06.280" style="s2">you&#39;re activating in your brain you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.200" end="00:50:09.220" style="s2">just increasing the variation now Y is</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.280" end="00:50:14.020" style="s2">increasing variation good increasing</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.220" end="00:50:17.050" style="s2">variation is good because what when when</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.020" end="00:50:21.780" style="s2">I increase the variation what I can do</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.050" end="00:50:29.470" style="s2">is get more awareness right of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.780" end="00:50:32.380" style="s2">invariant as I the more I vary what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.470" end="00:50:35.980" style="s2">doing the more I become aware of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.380" end="00:50:37.869" style="s2">not changing right so as I move around</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.980" end="00:50:40.900" style="s2">this object right</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.869" end="00:50:43.000" style="s2">lots of stuff is varying but its shape</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.900" end="00:50:45.490" style="s2">is remaining constant to me throughout</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.000" end="00:50:47.380" style="s2">the variation and that&#39;s why I think of</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.490" end="00:50:50.109" style="s2">the shape as more real because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.380" end="00:50:54.730" style="s2">invariant through all this variation so</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.109" end="00:50:56.619" style="s2">when I increase the variance so I pick</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.730" end="00:50:58.599" style="s2">up I&#39;m more able to pick up on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.619" end="00:51:00.270" style="s2">invariant now the thing we need to know</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.599" end="00:51:03.750" style="s2">is that there are two kinds of invariant</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.270" end="00:51:06.810" style="s2">two kinds of things that are not</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.750" end="00:51:10.710" style="s2">changing in your attempts to get a grip</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.810" end="00:51:12.360" style="s2">on the world there is good and right</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.710" end="00:51:22.790" style="s2">there&#39;s good invariants and bad</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.360" end="00:51:22.790" style="s2">invariants okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.970" end="00:51:31.020" style="s2">what&#39;s good invariants by opening up the</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.000" end="00:51:32.880" style="s2">variation I pick up on bigger patterns</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.020" end="00:51:35.670" style="s2">that aren&#39;t changing that are real</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.880" end="00:51:38.370" style="s2">patterns in the world this is what goes</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.670" end="00:51:40.920" style="s2">on in deep learning networks right you</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.370" end="00:51:43.590" style="s2">pick up on much more complex patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.920" end="00:51:47.910" style="s2">invariants you get more in contact with</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.590" end="00:51:49.860" style="s2">what&#39;s really going on again think about</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.910" end="00:51:51.630" style="s2">what you do when you want to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.860" end="00:51:54.840" style="s2">what something is you increase the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.630" end="00:51:56.370" style="s2">variation not only am I looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.840" end="00:51:58.740" style="s2">and looking at it there I&#39;m touching it</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.370" end="00:52:00.780" style="s2">I increase the variation to find out</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.740" end="00:52:03.060" style="s2">what&#39;s invariant because if I have</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.780" end="00:52:05.010" style="s2">increased variation and I find out</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.060" end="00:52:10.670" style="s2">what&#39;s invariant in it that often tells</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.010" end="00:52:15.930" style="s2">me what&#39;s more real that&#39;s good right so</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.670" end="00:52:20.010" style="s2">that can get me real patterns but</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.930" end="00:52:24.930" style="s2">there&#39;s also bad invariance bad</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.010" end="00:52:26.940" style="s2">invariants right it&#39;s like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.930" end="00:52:30.450" style="s2">happening in when you&#39;re trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.940" end="00:52:33.210" style="s2">the nine dot problem you keep trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.450" end="00:52:34.530" style="s2">solve it and you keep failing to solve</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.210" end="00:52:36.540" style="s2">it because there&#39;s something you need to</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.530" end="00:52:39.020" style="s2">change that you&#39;re not changing bad</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.540" end="00:52:41.430" style="s2">invariants are ways in which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.020" end="00:52:43.620" style="s2">formulating your problems framing your</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.430" end="00:52:46.110" style="s2">experience that&#39;s actually blocking you</p>

<p begin="00:52:46.110" end="00:52:52.920" style="s2">so Kaplan and Simon in 1990 talked about</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.100" end="00:53:00.210" style="s2">a heuristic a strategy we use called the</p>

<p begin="00:53:25.590" end="00:53:30.690" style="s2">what you&#39;re not changing is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.380" end="00:53:34.460" style="s2">what you need to change and so the</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.690" end="00:53:38.670" style="s2">notice invariance heuristic can help you</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.460" end="00:53:40.980" style="s2">break bad framing that has been causing</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.670" end="00:53:42.960" style="s2">your failure now this of course requires</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.980" end="00:53:44.460" style="s2">humility on your part this is why the</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.960" end="00:53:48.390" style="s2">deep connection between wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.460" end="00:53:49.170" style="s2">humility I would I would suggest paying</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.390" end="00:53:52.320" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.170" end="00:53:57.980" style="s2">remembering your failures such that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.320" end="00:54:05.310" style="s2">can apply this would be very helpful now</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.980" end="00:54:08.480" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about this is one problem</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.310" end="00:54:14.370" style="s2">they were talking about Kaplan and Simon</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.480" end="00:54:19.830" style="s2">but what if what if I don&#39;t just have</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.370" end="00:54:22.460" style="s2">one error here but I have a whole system</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.830" end="00:54:22.460" style="s2">of errors</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.490" end="00:54:35.940" style="s2">so very often when you look at cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.980" end="00:54:37.950" style="s2">development right you take the</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.940" end="00:54:40.260" style="s2">two-year-old it&#39;s alright</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.950" end="00:54:43.620" style="s2">four-year-old because they can count you</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.260" end="00:54:45.510" style="s2">count out the five candies they can</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.620" end="00:54:48.360" style="s2">count they know that there&#39;s five here</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.510" end="00:54:51.510" style="s2">and there five here but they will</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.360" end="00:54:56.100" style="s2">reliably choose that row five candies</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.510" end="00:54:57.690" style="s2">why because the amount of space taken up</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.100" end="00:55:01.470" style="s2">is super salient to them we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.690" end="00:55:02.790" style="s2">about this before it misleads them but</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.470" end="00:55:04.170" style="s2">they will just make this error with</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.790" end="00:55:05.940" style="s2">candies they make this error</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.170" end="00:55:08.340" style="s2">systematically they make this error all</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.940" end="00:55:12.300" style="s2">over the place in many different domains</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.340" end="00:55:14.250" style="s2">it is a systematic error so I can</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.300" end="00:55:15.750" style="s2">reliably predict that the four-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.250" end="00:55:18.060" style="s2">will not only be making this error</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.750" end="00:55:20.010" style="s2">they&#39;ll be making errors about Sirian</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.060" end="00:55:21.360" style="s2">about trying to line objects up in terms</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.010" end="00:55:24.360" style="s2">of increasing height they&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.360" end="00:55:26.250" style="s2">difficulties etc so it&#39;s not just one</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.360" end="00:55:28.110" style="s2">error it&#39;s an entire system of errors</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.250" end="00:55:30.570" style="s2">and the way you go through a</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.110" end="00:55:35.580" style="s2">developmental change what kids do is</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.570" end="00:55:37.290" style="s2">they find right they find a systematic</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.580" end="00:55:38.940" style="s2">pattern of errors and they find an</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.290" end="00:55:43.790" style="s2">insight that&#39;s not just about one</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.940" end="00:55:47.370" style="s2">problem but an insight that will apply</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.790" end="00:55:50.070" style="s2">systematically to that all of those</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.370" end="00:55:52.320" style="s2">interconnected interrelated errors and</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.070" end="00:55:54.420" style="s2">when they have that systematically</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.320" end="00:55:57.390" style="s2">penetrative insight when they found that</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.420" end="00:55:59.580" style="s2">nexus of errors so they can massively</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.390" end="00:56:01.080" style="s2">intervene on themselves then they go</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.580" end="00:56:05.310" style="s2">through a developmental change and they</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.080" end="00:56:08.190" style="s2">grow up cognitively they mature and that</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.310" end="00:56:11.790" style="s2">is what can be going on in the</p>
