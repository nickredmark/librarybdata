<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:02.850" style="s2">all G of it is that our brains form</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.319" end="00:00:05.040" style="s2">these neural networks these patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.850" end="00:00:06.600" style="s2">firings and those dynamic patterns as</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.040" end="00:00:09.080" style="s2">they unfold are the thoughts that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.600" end="00:00:12.269" style="s2">have and when one of those patterns</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.080" end="00:00:13.950" style="s2">arises it creates a global pattern that</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.269" end="00:00:15.990" style="s2">global pattern is your emergent</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.950" end="00:00:17.580" style="s2">understanding in the moment for that</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.990" end="00:00:19.230" style="s2">global pattern to be coherent it must</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.580" end="00:00:21.090" style="s2">suppress other global patterns it would</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.230" end="00:00:23.519" style="s2">make it end coherent so now think about</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.090" end="00:00:24.930" style="s2">political world view one person has a</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.519" end="00:00:26.609" style="s2">conservative worldview they see things</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.930" end="00:00:28.619" style="s2">with certain concepts then there are</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.609" end="00:00:30.869" style="s2">these progressive concepts they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.619" end="00:00:32.759" style="s2">incompatible with each other one must be</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.869" end="00:00:34.410" style="s2">suppressed for the other to be active so</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.759" end="00:00:36.510" style="s2">even at that conceptual level of how we</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.410" end="00:00:37.890" style="s2">think about politics and morality all</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.510" end="00:00:40.140" style="s2">these things this is happening in our</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.890" end="00:00:41.969" style="s2">brains and that&#39;s why it&#39;s helpful for</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.140" end="00:00:44.910" style="s2">us to know that this is happening so</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.969" end="00:00:48.090" style="s2">it&#39;s a we say there were open-minded</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.910" end="00:00:49.289" style="s2">we&#39;re really well I don&#39;t say when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.090" end="00:00:51.510" style="s2">open-minded what we&#39;re doing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.289" end="00:00:53.610" style="s2">sometimes called channel switching to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.510" end="00:00:55.020" style="s2">differentiate from multitasking cuz you</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.610" end="00:00:56.730" style="s2">can&#39;t really multitask if you think</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.020" end="00:00:58.020" style="s2">about it multitasking would mean that</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.730" end="00:00:59.489" style="s2">you&#39;re splitting your attention to two</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.020" end="00:01:01.379" style="s2">things at exactly the same tenth time</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.489" end="00:01:02.969" style="s2">the only way that can work is through</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.379" end="00:01:04.260" style="s2">different sense modalities your hand can</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.969" end="00:01:05.939" style="s2">be doing one thing wars during another</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.260" end="00:01:08.880" style="s2">and you can keep those somewhat separate</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.939" end="00:01:10.619" style="s2">but I&#39;m pretty limited and you run out</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.880" end="00:01:12.869" style="s2">of attention pretty quickly but mode</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.619" end="00:01:14.189" style="s2">shifting or channel shifting is when you</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.869" end="00:01:15.990" style="s2">go from thinking in one way to thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.189" end="00:01:17.070" style="s2">in another so you&#39;re doing channel</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.990" end="00:01:19.259" style="s2">shifting when you jump back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.070" end="00:01:21.479" style="s2">between these images and so you can take</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.259" end="00:01:22.770" style="s2">on different perspectives it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.479" end="00:01:24.750" style="s2">one of the reasons why learning a second</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.770" end="00:01:26.280" style="s2">language helps people have more empathy</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.750" end="00:01:28.140" style="s2">is that they&#39;re doing / sweat</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.280" end="00:01:30.600" style="s2">perspective shifting and their brain</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.140" end="00:01:31.439" style="s2">develops a greater agility for it but</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.600" end="00:01:33.690" style="s2">they&#39;re still only having one</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.439" end="00:01:35.670" style="s2">perspective at a time</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.690" end="00:01:36.960" style="s2">so it&#39;s important to just understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.670" end="00:01:38.700" style="s2">that you know this is basic stuff about</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.960" end="00:01:41.640" style="s2">the brain but look how powerful it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.700" end="00:01:44.250" style="s2">right it&#39;s huge so so those are just a</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.640" end="00:01:45.540" style="s2">couple examples of of how our brains</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.250" end="00:01:47.940" style="s2">work they tell us something about how</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.540" end="00:01:51.000" style="s2">human beings work and they&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.940" end="00:01:53.820" style="s2">useful for a social change now I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.000" end="00:01:57.090" style="s2">to to talk for a moment about and one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.820" end="00:01:58.350" style="s2">the ideas it&#39;s out there as about how</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.090" end="00:02:01.050" style="s2">the mind works that I think you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.350" end="00:02:03.060" style="s2">recognize in anthropology they call this</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.050" end="00:02:05.070" style="s2">a folk theory just kind of a common</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.060" end="00:02:06.210" style="s2">sense understanding of the mind so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.070" end="00:02:08.250" style="s2">gonna walk through it real quick and see</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.210" end="00:02:09.899" style="s2">if you recognize it so first of all we</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.250" end="00:02:12.030" style="s2">have this idea that thought is conscious</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.899" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">like we can know our own thoughts we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.030" end="00:02:16.200" style="s2">contemplate and introspect about our</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.920" end="00:02:17.640" style="s2">thoughts yeah it&#39;s a pretty common idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.200" end="00:02:19.800" style="s2">that&#39;s another one is it thought is</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.640" end="00:02:21.570" style="s2">literal just like the idea i&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.800" end="00:02:23.490" style="s2">maps and a one-to-one way onto the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.570" end="00:02:25.290" style="s2">i&#39;m thinking about a red cards because</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.490" end="00:02:26.820" style="s2">i&#39;ve actually seen in a red car and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.290" end="00:02:28.830" style="s2">might even be a red mazda or red</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.820" end="00:02:30.270" style="s2">Corvette but it&#39;s a specific one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.830" end="00:02:32.400" style="s2">idea that our thoughts map literally</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.270" end="00:02:34.530" style="s2">onto the world it&#39;s a kind of common</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.400" end="00:02:35.370" style="s2">idea makes sense right another one we</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.530" end="00:02:37.410" style="s2">hear a lot as it thought is</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.370" end="00:02:39.660" style="s2">dispassionate to reason effectively we</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.410" end="00:02:41.459" style="s2">have to suppress our emotions that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.660" end="00:02:43.770" style="s2">that&#39;s one that&#39;s out there you know we</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.459" end="00:02:45.600" style="s2">probably her down before I like this one</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.770" end="00:02:47.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a DA thought is universal so we all</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.600" end="00:02:48.959" style="s2">reason in the same ways so if I present</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.640" end="00:02:52.709" style="s2">the facts to you you&#39;ll reason to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.959" end="00:02:53.970" style="s2">same conclusion I do and and finally</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.709" end="00:02:56.610" style="s2">this one&#39;s a little more subtle thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.970" end="00:02:58.470" style="s2">is logical and more specifically that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.610" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">thought works through the way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.470" end="00:03:03.720" style="s2">symbolic logic works that we have this</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:05.370" style="s2">kind of truth propositional structure</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.720" end="00:03:07.080" style="s2">and you know the interesting thing about</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.370" end="00:03:10.470" style="s2">all of these and I come from Missouri so</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.080" end="00:03:13.640" style="s2">i&#39;ll quote one of my fellow brethren of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.470" end="00:03:17.100" style="s2">missouri is it&#39;s not so much the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.640" end="00:03:21.090" style="s2">we don&#39;t know but the things we know</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.100" end="00:03:22.590" style="s2">that just ain&#39;t so right Mark Twain and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.090" end="00:03:23.880" style="s2">see the funny thing is we have this</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.590" end="00:03:26.610" style="s2">common sense understanding of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.880" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">its pervasive in our culture every bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.610" end="00:03:31.170" style="s2">of those every one of those things is</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:32.790" style="s2">wrong it turns out that most of what we</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.170" end="00:03:34.350" style="s2">call thought happens outside of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.790" end="00:03:36.330" style="s2">conscious awareness some estimates as</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.350" end="00:03:37.980" style="s2">high as ninety-eight percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.330" end="00:03:39.360" style="s2">cognitive processing in our brains</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.980" end="00:03:41.190" style="s2">happens outside our own awareness</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.360" end="00:03:43.140" style="s2">idea of the thought as literal is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.190" end="00:03:44.970" style="s2">not true at all back in the late 70s</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.140" end="00:03:47.370" style="s2">they discovered that thought is</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.970" end="00:03:49.140" style="s2">profoundly metaphorical that we reason</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.370" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">by analogy from one part of our life</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.140" end="00:03:53.610" style="s2">experience to another and that means</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:55.440" style="s2">that thought is not dispassionate but</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.610" end="00:03:57.810" style="s2">actually to reason effectively we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.440" end="00:03:59.160" style="s2">to use emotions the way I like to</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.810" end="00:04:01.260" style="s2">illustrate that is imagine you&#39;re at a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.160" end="00:04:02.370" style="s2">bar trying to get someone&#39;s phone number</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.260" end="00:04:05.010" style="s2">and you&#39;re getting through that awkward</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.370" end="00:04:07.650" style="s2">moment how can you do that without</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.010" end="00:04:09.690" style="s2">emotions to guide how the situation is</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.650" end="00:04:11.490" style="s2">unfolding you can&#39;t reason effectively</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.690" end="00:04:15.270" style="s2">in social context without those emotions</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.490" end="00:04:16.440" style="s2">about guilt shame pride happiness how</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.270" end="00:04:18.419" style="s2">receptive as the other person those are</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.440" end="00:04:21.630" style="s2">all emotional cues so we actually use a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.419" end="00:04:22.950" style="s2">motion to reason and so it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.630" end="00:04:24.750" style="s2">that reasoning requires emotion and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.950" end="00:04:26.520" style="s2">theta thought is universal well if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.750" end="00:04:28.140" style="s2">metaphorical that means whichever</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.520" end="00:04:30.780" style="s2">context were reasoning and will have its</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.140" end="00:04:31.919" style="s2">own self-contained logic and so people</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.780" end="00:04:33.900" style="s2">can reason differently in different</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.919" end="00:04:35.370" style="s2">contexts and we find that happening all</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.900" end="00:04:38.220" style="s2">the time and the idea that thought is</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.370" end="00:04:40.140" style="s2">logical well thought was logical</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.220" end="00:04:41.280" style="s2">politics would be rather different I</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.140" end="00:04:43.169" style="s2">don&#39;t think I need a really elaborate</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.280" end="00:04:45.270" style="s2">that one any further but you can see</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.169" end="00:04:49.229" style="s2">that all these ideas are there in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.270" end="00:04:51.030" style="s2">culture and they&#39;re wrong and and so so</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.229" end="00:04:53.010" style="s2">we gotta this is kind of that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.030" end="00:04:56.160" style="s2">blind spot right as the things we know</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.010" end="00:04:57.240" style="s2">that just ain&#39;t so so to get back the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:04:59.310" style="s2">big question how do we design for</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.240" end="00:05:01.169" style="s2">large-scale change and I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.310" end="00:05:02.729" style="s2">really two pieces one is we have to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.169" end="00:05:04.820" style="s2">outside the boxes of our thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.729" end="00:05:07.110" style="s2">especially one of those boxes are wrong</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.820" end="00:05:08.820" style="s2">like we have a container for thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.110" end="00:05:12.270" style="s2">that&#39;s not correct and then we have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.820" end="00:05:14.790" style="s2">develop tools to use to apply these new</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.270" end="00:05:17.280" style="s2">ways of thinking to the world and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.790" end="00:05:20.130" style="s2">know so so to think about some of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.280" end="00:05:21.450" style="s2">tools there&#39;s this framework that I got</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.130" end="00:05:24.390" style="s2">to help develop with a guy named George</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.450" end="00:05:26.250" style="s2">Lake off we call a cognitive policy and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.390" end="00:05:27.330" style="s2">you know in a really kind of big way</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.250" end="00:05:28.979" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of stuff happening here</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.330" end="00:05:31.260" style="s2">but let&#39;s imagine no you can think about</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.979" end="00:05:32.430" style="s2">how worldview works and the psychology</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.260" end="00:05:33.750" style="s2">of identity and the norms and values</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.430" end="00:05:35.220" style="s2">these different models we have for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.750" end="00:05:37.590" style="s2">world all these different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.220" end="00:05:40.860" style="s2">knowledge we funnel them into a design</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.590" end="00:05:43.350" style="s2">process that puts the user at the center</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.860" end="00:05:45.479" style="s2">so the years in this case is the person</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.350" end="00:05:47.310" style="s2">in their community and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.479" end="00:05:49.500" style="s2">design for social change say do you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.310" end="00:05:51.340" style="s2">cognitive policy is to take all this</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.500" end="00:05:53.800" style="s2">understanding about how the mind works</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.340" end="00:05:55.389" style="s2">and bring it into the design process so</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.800" end="00:05:56.620" style="s2">how are people interacting with this</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.389" end="00:05:58.960" style="s2">what are they thinking about how do they</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.620" end="00:06:00.820" style="s2">feel about it how could we change the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.960" end="00:06:02.380" style="s2">structure of their environment the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.820" end="00:06:04.540" style="s2">that Amazon did when they put that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.380" end="00:06:06.550" style="s2">this review helpful and it&#39;s changed the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.540" end="00:06:08.680" style="s2">way that online review is work so you</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.550" end="00:06:10.630" style="s2">know use this user centered design you</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.680" end="00:06:12.880" style="s2">corporate all this knowledge into the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.630" end="00:06:15.850" style="s2">design process and you&#39;ll have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.880" end="00:06:18.130" style="s2">better design at the end of the day so</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.850" end="00:06:19.900" style="s2">this idea of cognitive policy is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.130" end="00:06:21.220" style="s2">toolkit of all that knowledge though we</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.900" end="00:06:23.680" style="s2">could bring together to do that design</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.220" end="00:06:26.380" style="s2">work and we&#39;ll go through some more of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.680" end="00:06:28.650" style="s2">what those particular pieces might be as</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.380" end="00:06:30.520" style="s2">we go through the day so another one</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.650" end="00:06:32.050" style="s2">well really to give you a sense of how</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.520" end="00:06:34.690" style="s2">this cognitive policy idea works let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.050" end="00:06:37.210" style="s2">look an example I&#39;ll use social security</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.690" end="00:06:38.740" style="s2">so we know social security is a policy</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.210" end="00:06:40.419" style="s2">it&#39;s piece of legislation and it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.740" end="00:06:42.550" style="s2">an institution around it there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.419" end="00:06:44.620" style="s2">it works but cognitively how does it</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.550" end="00:06:45.970" style="s2">work what does it mean to people well</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.620" end="00:06:48.250" style="s2">what it means to people is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.970" end="00:06:50.800" style="s2">they work and they make money and they</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.250" end="00:06:53.229" style="s2">pay into this big national community</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.800" end="00:06:55.000" style="s2">piggy bank and then they know that when</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.229" end="00:06:57.880" style="s2">they get old and retired that community</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.000" end="00:06:59.110" style="s2">will take care of them and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.880" end="00:07:00.700" style="s2">the way that people understand it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.110" end="00:07:03.639" style="s2">this is part of their experience of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.700" end="00:07:05.500" style="s2">Social Security and so they learn things</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.639" end="00:07:07.990" style="s2">like they learned that people who work</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.500" end="00:07:10.450" style="s2">hard to be taken care of that we all do</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.990" end="00:07:12.970" style="s2">better when we all do better and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.450" end="00:07:14.260" style="s2">someone in a civil society should be</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.970" end="00:07:15.849" style="s2">taken care of in their old age we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.260" end="00:07:17.590" style="s2">these sets of values and moral</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.849" end="00:07:18.970" style="s2">principles that are just intuitive and</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.590" end="00:07:20.770" style="s2">the experience that people have with</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.970" end="00:07:23.260" style="s2">Social Security you don&#39;t actually have</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.770" end="00:07:24.610" style="s2">to teach them now the full logic of</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.260" end="00:07:26.380" style="s2">Social Security they just get it when</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.610" end="00:07:27.250" style="s2">money is garnished from their check and</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.380" end="00:07:28.750" style="s2">they know it&#39;s going to take care of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.250" end="00:07:31.720" style="s2">them when they&#39;re old as long as it</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.750" end="00:07:33.669" style="s2">still works and this is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.720" end="00:07:36.070" style="s2">reason why social security has been so</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.669" end="00:07:38.680" style="s2">hard to get rid of there has been a</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.070" end="00:07:40.510" style="s2">concerted effort for about 20 years to</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.680" end="00:07:41.979" style="s2">privatizing at rid of Social Security</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.510" end="00:07:44.229" style="s2">and I can&#39;t do it because it&#39;s popular</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.979" end="00:07:45.430" style="s2">people want it and why do they want it</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.229" end="00:07:48.070" style="s2">because they understand it and they know</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.430" end="00:07:50.950" style="s2">it&#39;s valuable so the cognitive policy</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.070" end="00:07:52.389" style="s2">piece is the understandings and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.950" end="00:07:54.030" style="s2">values and the priorities built into</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.389" end="00:07:56.370" style="s2">their experience of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.030" end="00:07:59.400" style="s2">then make it something that lasts for</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.370" end="00:08:01.890" style="s2">them so a quick counter example would be</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.400" end="00:08:04.530" style="s2">a don&#39;t no child left behind which was</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.890" end="00:08:05.910" style="s2">designed to defund schools make it a bad</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.530" end="00:08:07.200" style="s2">experience and move us to private high</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.910" end="00:08:09.390" style="s2">school so we can never to public schools</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.200" end="00:08:11.310" style="s2">so using the experience people have with</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.390" end="00:08:13.560" style="s2">education to achieve a strategic</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.310" end="00:08:15.330" style="s2">objective and so it works in different</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.560" end="00:08:17.760" style="s2">ways but you can kind of see how that</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.330" end="00:08:21.690" style="s2">fits I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m a little confused</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.760" end="00:08:23.730" style="s2">because I think in general this is not</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.690" end="00:08:25.890" style="s2">at all characteristic of this culture in</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.730" end="00:08:28.020" style="s2">a kettle of society people indoctrinated</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.890" end="00:08:30.990" style="s2">into believing you&#39;re not doing well at</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.020" end="00:08:34.500" style="s2">your fault and it&#39;s a you to create your</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.990" end="00:08:36.150" style="s2">world which i think is why we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.500" end="00:08:38.760" style="s2">comfortable with so much in your quality</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.150" end="00:08:41.910" style="s2">and equity in this society whereas you</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.760" end="00:08:44.040" style="s2">look at other societies say maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.910" end="00:08:46.290" style="s2">Western Europe that have social</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.040" end="00:08:48.720" style="s2">democracy where people pay high taxes</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.290" end="00:08:50.430" style="s2">and we have social security for health</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.720" end="00:08:52.500" style="s2">care free education where people get</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.430" end="00:08:55.080" style="s2">that when everybody is doing better</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.500" end="00:08:57.170" style="s2">everybody is doing better but so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.080" end="00:08:59.790" style="s2">really actually I&#39;m confused about why</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.170" end="00:09:02.040" style="s2">social security has lasted this long</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.790" end="00:09:04.080" style="s2">because that&#39;s really not the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.040" end="00:09:05.580" style="s2">here well it doesn&#39;t have to be the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.080" end="00:09:06.990" style="s2">dominant paradigm for still to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.580" end="00:09:08.940" style="s2">prevalent in the experiences of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.990" end="00:09:10.200" style="s2">culture and so there you can have these</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.940" end="00:09:11.610" style="s2">different views kind of floating around</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.200" end="00:09:14.040" style="s2">and you&#39;re absolutely right that in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.610" end="00:09:16.620" style="s2">US yeah by the charts of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.040" end="00:09:17.820" style="s2">communal to and individual we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.620" end="00:09:20.310" style="s2">most individualistic culture on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.820" end="00:09:22.200" style="s2">planet so the u.s. just take that in</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.310" end="00:09:23.760" style="s2">droves Japan in case you&#39;re curious is</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.200" end="00:09:25.740" style="s2">actually the most communal culture in</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.760" end="00:09:27.830" style="s2">the world and Scandinavian countries</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.740" end="00:09:30.030" style="s2">ranked pretty highly in that as well so</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.830" end="00:09:32.370" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s happening though is</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.030" end="00:09:33.600" style="s2">there was a period in our history cuz we</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.370" end="00:09:35.310" style="s2">actually have this rich history of</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.600" end="00:09:37.200" style="s2">communities coming together like one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.310" end="00:09:39.450" style="s2">the classic stories of American history</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.200" end="00:09:40.770" style="s2">is the barn-raising story so idea that</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.450" end="00:09:41.940" style="s2">people in the pioneering days on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.770" end="00:09:43.800" style="s2">frontier had to come together and help</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.940" end="00:09:46.560" style="s2">each other so we have the communal</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.800" end="00:09:48.360" style="s2">component of our culture and what social</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.560" end="00:09:50.010" style="s2">security does is it it builds off of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.360" end="00:09:52.440" style="s2">those values in that part of the culture</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.010" end="00:09:54.840" style="s2">and Social Security&#39;s been harder to</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.440" end="00:09:57.120" style="s2">make people have a distaste for that</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.840" end="00:09:58.800" style="s2">education has so there there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.120" end="00:10:00.900" style="s2">intentional agenda to try to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.800" end="00:10:02.280" style="s2">social security and there and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.900" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">trying and actually I now with the debt</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.280" end="00:10:04.360" style="s2">crisis or some</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:06.459" style="s2">movement they actually weaken it some</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.360" end="00:10:08.440" style="s2">more but but it&#39;s been persistent</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.459" end="00:10:10.470" style="s2">because the experience is intuitive and</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.440" end="00:10:12.820" style="s2">it feeds into those values for people</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.470" end="00:10:14.550" style="s2">within our culture a lot of people look</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.820" end="00:10:19.140" style="s2">at is I pay in</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.550" end="00:10:21.839" style="s2">i won by now so it still to salsa and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.140" end="00:10:25.260" style="s2">that&#39;s why it why it&#39;s hard to get rid</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.839" end="00:10:27.340" style="s2">of it since people are now collecting it</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.260" end="00:10:29.360" style="s2">they feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.340" end="00:10:30.770" style="s2">dad actually it aligns with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.360" end="00:10:32.690" style="s2">self-interest focus and with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.770" end="00:10:34.580" style="s2">community focus and so it&#39;s got benefits</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.690" end="00:10:36.350" style="s2">from both of them you can see how if we</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.580" end="00:10:38.990" style="s2">think about the policy through this kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.350" end="00:10:40.610" style="s2">of cognitive lens it enlightens the</p>
