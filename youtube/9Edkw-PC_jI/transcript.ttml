<p begin="00:00:04.009" end="00:00:08.910" style="s2">hello and welcome to the question and</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.259" end="00:00:11.759" style="s2">answer it&#39;s a great pleasure to be here</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.910" end="00:00:13.980" style="s2">again as usual we&#39;re going to tackle</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.759" end="00:00:15.660" style="s2">questions first from patreon supporters</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.980" end="00:00:18.029" style="s2">and then some questions that have been</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.660" end="00:00:20.279" style="s2">tweeted and if we have a chance on some</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.029" end="00:00:21.539" style="s2">remaining questions that are live so</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.279" end="00:00:23.519" style="s2">let&#39;s get right to it because these</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.539" end="00:00:26.910" style="s2">questions are always very good questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.519" end="00:00:29.550" style="s2">and I want to try and get as many in as</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.910" end="00:00:33.059" style="s2">possible because I think they&#39;re usually</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.550" end="00:00:34.680" style="s2">beneficial for a wide variety of might</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.059" end="00:00:37.850" style="s2">number of people well the first question</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.680" end="00:00:37.850" style="s2">there&#39;s one second</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.540" end="00:01:12.410" style="s2">we&#39;re going to start typing with your PC</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.410" end="00:01:12.410" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.409" end="00:01:32.770" style="s2">I could say something here I&#39;m good you</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.119" end="00:01:34.329" style="s2">guys hear me if somebody please respond</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.770" end="00:01:37.020" style="s2">we&#39;re just think there might be some</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.329" end="00:01:37.020" style="s2">audio problems</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.689" end="00:01:50.110" style="s2">thank you guys appreciate it we just had</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.009" end="00:01:51.640" style="s2">a bit of a glitch there okay so thank</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.110" end="00:01:52.479" style="s2">you very much it&#39;s great pleasure to see</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.640" end="00:01:55.390" style="s2">you all</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.479" end="00:01:59.289" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s begin so the first question</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.390" end="00:02:02.619" style="s2">is from Sergey Mac Makar Ken and he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.289" end="00:02:04.599" style="s2">patron and the question is could you</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.619" end="00:02:06.899" style="s2">provide a definition of some example on</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.599" end="00:02:08.860" style="s2">some examples of what it&#39;s propositional</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.899" end="00:02:10.780" style="s2">perspectival and participatory knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.860" end="00:02:14.230" style="s2">I&#39;ll also throw in the fourth procedural</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.780" end="00:02:15.459" style="s2">I think I guess then this review goes on</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.230" end="00:02:18.970" style="s2">to say I think I understand what our</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.459" end="00:02:20.440" style="s2">first two but want to make sure in case</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.970" end="00:02:21.970" style="s2">you have done that already in one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.440" end="00:02:24.430" style="s2">your first videos on the me crisis that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.970" end="00:02:25.810" style="s2">affected me to it I started watching the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.430" end="00:02:26.980" style="s2">meeting crisis Series somewhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.810" end="00:02:29.709" style="s2">middle so I might have missed something</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.980" end="00:02:32.440" style="s2">that&#39;s fine I should mention that I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.709" end="00:02:34.870" style="s2">just being interviewed by Ali from rebel</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.440" end="00:02:37.060" style="s2">wisdom this morning and the whole video</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.870" end="00:02:39.639" style="s2">is basically about the four kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.060" end="00:02:41.560" style="s2">knowing and that&#39;s going to come out at</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.639" end="00:02:45.430" style="s2">some point but let&#39;s let&#39;s address this</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.560" end="00:02:47.109" style="s2">question right now so this is a taxonomy</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.430" end="00:02:48.940" style="s2">and of course taxon these are true or</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.109" end="00:02:51.040" style="s2">false they&#39;re they&#39;re effective or not</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.940" end="00:02:52.720" style="s2">how well do they explicate how well do</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.040" end="00:02:55.510" style="s2">they integrate how what would the afford</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.720" end="00:02:57.790" style="s2">explanation an integrated set of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.510" end="00:03:01.150" style="s2">phenomena in a systematic and useful</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.790" end="00:03:02.560" style="s2">manner so then what thereat the form of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.150" end="00:03:03.730" style="s2">our knowing that we&#39;re all familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.560" end="00:03:05.889" style="s2">and I call it knowing because I want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.730" end="00:03:07.690" style="s2">emphasize the process the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.889" end="00:03:11.410" style="s2">process as opposed to the resulting</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.690" end="00:03:13.870" style="s2">product so we&#39;re very familiar with with</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.410" end="00:03:16.569" style="s2">propositional knowing this is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.870" end="00:03:18.280" style="s2">knowing you have by believing that some</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.569" end="00:03:21.130" style="s2">proposition is the case like I believe</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.280" end="00:03:21.790" style="s2">that a cat is a mammal and that could be</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.130" end="00:03:25.419" style="s2">true or false</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.790" end="00:03:27.280" style="s2">and so what I acquire when I am applying</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.419" end="00:03:30.130" style="s2">propositional knowledge is I acquire</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.280" end="00:03:31.610" style="s2">presumably well-justified sets of</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.130" end="00:03:33.470" style="s2">beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.610" end="00:03:36.260" style="s2">and I get a conviction from that I could</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.470" end="00:03:38.630" style="s2">get convinced about it so I get</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.260" end="00:03:40.610" style="s2">conviction about the truth of my beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.630" end="00:03:43.610" style="s2">and that&#39;s done nationally and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.610" end="00:03:45.110" style="s2">systematically we call that a theory I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.610" end="00:03:46.700" style="s2">using theory the way it&#39;s used in</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.110" end="00:03:51.230" style="s2">science not the way it&#39;s used in</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.700" end="00:03:53.120" style="s2">everyday discourse and so the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.230" end="00:03:55.250" style="s2">realness that goes with propositional</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.120" end="00:03:57.320" style="s2">knowledge is that sense of conviction in</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.250" end="00:03:58.610" style="s2">the truth of the proposition for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.320" end="00:04:01.520" style="s2">first philosophers who spilled a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.610" end="00:04:03.410" style="s2">ink I&#39;m trying to figure out what that</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.520" end="00:04:04.970" style="s2">is and I&#39;m not going to go into that all</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.410" end="00:04:06.650" style="s2">I need now is to get clear what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.970" end="00:04:08.600" style="s2">referent is I&#39;m not trying to offer a</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.650" end="00:04:09.070" style="s2">theory of what truth is or some such</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.600" end="00:04:11.930" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.070" end="00:04:13.610" style="s2">next is procedural knowing this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.930" end="00:04:17.120" style="s2">knowing how to do something this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.610" end="00:04:22.670" style="s2">knowing how to catch a ball how to ride</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.120" end="00:04:26.510" style="s2">a bike how to walk to the street on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.670" end="00:04:29.360" style="s2">street to the corner store and so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.510" end="00:04:31.040" style="s2">these are things that are not a matter</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.360" end="00:04:32.720" style="s2">of belief now of course you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.040" end="00:04:34.250" style="s2">exercising beliefs while you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.720" end="00:04:35.810" style="s2">these things we&#39;re making an analytic</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.250" end="00:04:37.430" style="s2">distinction here I&#39;m not claiming that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.810" end="00:04:38.810" style="s2">it&#39;s ever the case that is one kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.430" end="00:04:41.930" style="s2">knowingness of operation this is an</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.810" end="00:04:43.880" style="s2">analytic taxonomy but in addition to all</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.930" end="00:04:45.830" style="s2">your beliefs you have to know how to</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.880" end="00:04:47.000" style="s2">catch a ball which is very different</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.830" end="00:04:48.380" style="s2">from all the beliefs you might have</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.000" end="00:04:50.300" style="s2">about Falls and all the beliefs you</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.380" end="00:04:53.120" style="s2">might even have a ball catching that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.300" end="00:04:55.700" style="s2">actually know how to board innate and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.120" end="00:04:58.160" style="s2">move your mind and body in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.700" end="00:04:59.660" style="s2">that you catch a ball and so what</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.160" end="00:05:01.850" style="s2">results from that is not a theory</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.660" end="00:05:03.830" style="s2">getting a sense of empowerment you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.850" end="00:05:05.930" style="s2">getting a sense of power the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.830" end="00:05:07.210" style="s2">being connected to reality isn&#39;t a</p>

<p begin="00:05:07.210" end="00:05:14.360" style="s2">its it is the sense that your skill is</p>

<p begin="00:05:18.260" end="00:05:23.210" style="s2">it is the thing our culture has really</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.200" end="00:05:27.620" style="s2">emphasized and perhaps fetishized</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.210" end="00:05:29.090" style="s2">propositional knowing perhaps because a</p>

<p begin="00:05:30.800" end="00:05:36.050" style="s2">what they spend their time on I&#39;m guilty</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.320" end="00:05:38.330" style="s2">of such a sin as well but most of your</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.050" end="00:05:39.650" style="s2">cognitive agency is actually carried by</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.840" end="00:05:48.590" style="s2">now very hard to give to artificial</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.460" end="00:05:49.940" style="s2">intelligence so that&#39;s your procedural</p>

<p begin="00:05:49.940" end="00:05:55.310" style="s2">knowing well if you perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.460" end="00:05:58.280" style="s2">is the knowing that&#39;s not had by like</p>

<p begin="00:05:59.690" end="00:06:05.030" style="s2">consciousness and so this is knowing</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.030" end="00:06:09.530" style="s2">knowing what it&#39;s like to be here now in</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.730" end="00:06:11.630" style="s2">a particular way so when I&#39;m sober</p>

<p begin="00:06:11.630" end="00:06:16.070" style="s2">it&#39;s more adverbial I know how I know</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.270" end="00:06:19.430" style="s2">what how it&#39;s what it&#39;s like to be here</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.070" end="00:06:22.130" style="s2">now in this particular way so it gives</p>

<p begin="00:06:33.650" end="00:06:38.990" style="s2">you so this is knowing what it&#39;s like to</p>

<p begin="00:10:14.499" end="00:10:22.239" style="s2">an example from toads book on on</p>

<p begin="00:10:22.239" end="00:10:26.889" style="s2">and world so it has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.790" end="00:10:30.189" style="s2">philosopher David Hume the famous</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.889" end="00:10:33.339" style="s2">sceptic and what toads points out is if</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.189" end="00:10:35.679" style="s2">you look if you look behind Humes</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.339" end="00:10:37.600" style="s2">epistemological arguments well yes you</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.679" end="00:10:40.089" style="s2">have to pay attention to the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.600" end="00:10:44.399" style="s2">on rule and ultimately the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.089" end="00:10:47.769" style="s2">knowing that he&#39;s engaging it so Hume is</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.399" end="00:10:50.919" style="s2">relating to the world as if he was as if</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.769" end="00:10:52.569" style="s2">he was static and on moving and just</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.919" end="00:10:54.879" style="s2">observing so what would the world be</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.569" end="00:10:56.709" style="s2">like if I don&#39;t move and I&#39;m just a</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.879" end="00:10:58.899" style="s2">spectator if I&#39;m an unmoving</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.709" end="00:11:01.299" style="s2">non-interacting spectator well the thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.899" end="00:11:04.509" style="s2">is if you inhabit your body in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.299" end="00:11:06.669" style="s2">purely sedentary frozen fashion like you</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.509" end="00:11:08.889" style="s2">do not get a sense of your continuity</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.669" end="00:11:12.089" style="s2">through time and space you do not get a</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.889" end="00:11:15.040" style="s2">sense of causation you do not get a</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.089" end="00:11:17.290" style="s2">sense of the interpenetration of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.040" end="00:11:21.129" style="s2">past into the present in the future so</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.290" end="00:11:24.160" style="s2">what you find is Humes ontology is so</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.129" end="00:11:26.619" style="s2">constrained by his participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.160" end="00:11:29.439" style="s2">that his salience landscape gets shaped</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.619" end="00:11:31.660" style="s2">such that you get all the famous human</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.439" end="00:11:34.389" style="s2">conclusions right that he can&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.660" end="00:11:37.679" style="s2">agency he can&#39;t find causation you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.389" end="00:11:40.449" style="s2">really find time it&#39;s phase etc and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.679" end="00:11:43.540" style="s2">what this shows is the way you are</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.449" end="00:11:45.819" style="s2">inhabiting your mind body your habitus</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.540" end="00:11:48.249" style="s2">need the effects you&#39;re on to us the way</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.819" end="00:11:51.279" style="s2">in which being can be structured for you</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.249" end="00:11:54.100" style="s2">so the participatory knowing is in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.279" end="00:11:56.769" style="s2">sense very deep it sets off the agent</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.100" end="00:11:58.720" style="s2">Sorina relationship that then right it</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.769" end="00:12:01.029" style="s2">sets up the constraints that constrain</p>

<p begin="00:12:01.029" end="00:12:05.739" style="s2">then get what&#39;s going on in the person</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.669" end="00:12:07.449" style="s2">you get the existential mode right at</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.739" end="00:12:09.609" style="s2">the participatory level which then</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.449" end="00:12:11.739" style="s2">constrains the salience landscaping</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.609" end="00:12:14.169" style="s2">which and then that that salience</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.739" end="00:12:16.089" style="s2">landscaping can strange your situational</p>

<p begin="00:12:18.489" end="00:12:23.499" style="s2">can apply are ultimately determining</p>

<p begin="00:13:36.510" end="00:13:40.410" style="s2">missing is that more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.829" end="00:13:42.620" style="s2">attunement because we have over focused</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.410" end="00:13:44.910" style="s2">on propositional knowledge and reduced</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.620" end="00:13:48.570" style="s2">everything to propositional knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.910" end="00:13:50.670" style="s2">reduce all realness to truth and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.570" end="00:13:51.120" style="s2">never really actually pursue truth I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.670" end="00:13:53.339" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.120" end="00:13:55.589" style="s2">we always pursue relevant truth because</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.339" end="00:13:58.589" style="s2">of the combinatorial explosive nature of</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.589" end="00:13:59.640" style="s2">reality but because of week we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.589" end="00:14:01.620" style="s2">fetishized</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.640" end="00:14:04.290" style="s2">this upper level it has tended to</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.620" end="00:14:06.779" style="s2">disconnect us from the procedural</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.290" end="00:14:09.180" style="s2">perspective another participatory the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.779" end="00:14:11.279" style="s2">embodied aspects of our knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.180" end="00:14:13.620" style="s2">connect us to the grounding of our</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.279" end="00:14:15.329" style="s2">agency and connect us to the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.620" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">grammar for the disclosure of the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.329" end="00:14:20.220" style="s2">and that&#39;s why the four kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:22.110" style="s2">are deeply relevant to understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.220" end="00:14:24.060" style="s2">meaning process so I hope that was</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.110" end="00:14:25.560" style="s2">helpful and like I say there is going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.060" end="00:14:27.810" style="s2">be a more extensive discussion that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.560" end="00:14:30.529" style="s2">did with Ali from noble wisdom about</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.810" end="00:14:34.500" style="s2">this coming out so and he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.529" end="00:14:36.390" style="s2">preparing a film and an essay about</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.500" end="00:14:37.480" style="s2">these kinds of knowing so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.390" end="00:14:39.399" style="s2">of stuff that&#39;s going to be coming</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.480" end="00:14:44.380" style="s2">about this if you have extra resources</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.399" end="00:14:50.170" style="s2">beyond just the question I just gave so</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.380" end="00:14:55.079" style="s2">next this is from an anonymous patron</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.170" end="00:14:57.760" style="s2">and I should say forget all the way</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.079" end="00:14:59.699" style="s2">let&#39;s do this right now I want to again</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.760" end="00:15:02.260" style="s2">express my gratitude for all the patrons</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.699" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">for their support both the financial</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.260" end="00:15:07.180" style="s2">support and many people you know you</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.480" end="00:15:09.790" style="s2">know I get into fantastic conversation</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.180" end="00:15:11.110" style="s2">with the patrons and that that&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.790" end="00:15:13.089" style="s2">kind of support because some of those</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.110" end="00:15:15.339" style="s2">discussions are so encouraging and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.089" end="00:15:18.310" style="s2">enlightening so thank you all of you</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.339" end="00:15:19.839" style="s2">very much the question is in the future</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.310" end="00:15:21.490" style="s2">with a scientific will you be able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.839" end="00:15:23.589" style="s2">incorporate thoughts consciousness of</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.490" end="00:15:25.480" style="s2">respect level knowledge are there things</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.589" end="00:15:28.110" style="s2">about being that will forever be beyond</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.480" end="00:15:30.940" style="s2">our grasp well those are two questions</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.110" end="00:15:33.040" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting that they&#39;re put</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.940" end="00:15:34.329" style="s2">together because they are it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.040" end="00:15:37.480" style="s2">not a mistake to put them together at a</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.329" end="00:15:40.240" style="s2">cultural offer does but let&#39;s do the</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.480" end="00:15:45.100" style="s2">first one it depends what you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.240" end="00:15:49.930" style="s2">thoughts if you mean by thoughts both</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.100" end="00:15:53.050" style="s2">things analogous to statements of belief</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.930" end="00:15:55.180" style="s2">in drawing our relevant implications I</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.050" end="00:15:57.010" style="s2">think that&#39;s something we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.180" end="00:15:59.110" style="s2">very close to being able to do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.010" end="00:16:01.060" style="s2">skills with the advent of you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.110" end="00:16:03.569" style="s2">networks and deep learning we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.060" end="00:16:05.800" style="s2">something that is also capable of</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.569" end="00:16:07.329" style="s2">implementing a lot of skills so if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.800" end="00:16:08.740" style="s2">give you give you include in thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.329" end="00:16:11.350" style="s2">what&#39;s happening with you when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.740" end="00:16:15.339" style="s2">catching a ball then those two I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.350" end="00:16:17.880" style="s2">are already sort of coming to fruition</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.339" end="00:16:20.199" style="s2">right now the perspect I will know and</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.880" end="00:16:23.110" style="s2">that has to do of course with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.199" end="00:16:24.970" style="s2">central issue of of consciousness pin</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.110" end="00:16:27.430" style="s2">because as I explained there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.970" end="00:16:29.019" style="s2">woven together so this comes down to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.430" end="00:16:30.399" style="s2">deeper question about whether or not I</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.019" end="00:16:34.000" style="s2">think there will be a naturalistic</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.399" end="00:16:40.029" style="s2">explanation of consciousness and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.000" end="00:16:41.829" style="s2">what we have to slow down because only</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.029" end="00:16:44.100" style="s2">consciousness is the holy grail of</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.829" end="00:16:49.660" style="s2">partner science trying to explain it</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.100" end="00:16:50.950" style="s2">it&#39;s the hardest thing I do I have</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.660" end="00:16:54.130" style="s2">argued in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.950" end="00:16:58.240" style="s2">argued elsewhere and I&#39;m going to be at</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.130" end="00:17:00.339" style="s2">a conference next to September the urban</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.240" end="00:17:01.930" style="s2">Abbey with paul van der clay and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.339" end="00:17:03.910" style="s2">jonathan pazzo and this is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.930" end="00:17:06.010" style="s2">the topic the topic of the conference is</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.910" end="00:17:08.500" style="s2">consciousness and conscience um what are</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.010" end="00:17:10.510" style="s2">you talking about this I do think a</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.500" end="00:17:13.929" style="s2">naturalistic explanation of</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.510" end="00:17:16.390" style="s2">consciousness is possible I&#39;m I might</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.929" end="00:17:18.699" style="s2">laid out an argument on that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.390" end="00:17:20.980" style="s2">large manuscript I don&#39;t have published</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.699" end="00:17:24.069" style="s2">that bits and pieces of it circulated</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.980" end="00:17:27.040" style="s2">and I&#39;m also presented bits and pieces</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.069" end="00:17:30.520" style="s2">at various conferences and I teach a</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.040" end="00:17:31.809" style="s2">course regularly on neuro scientific and</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.520" end="00:17:33.549" style="s2">part of scientific theories of</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.809" end="00:17:36.220" style="s2">consciousness so do I think so yes I do</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.549" end="00:17:37.270" style="s2">think so because I do think that I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.220" end="00:17:38.890" style="s2">give it I give it here because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.270" end="00:17:42.340" style="s2">an easy argument so I&#39;m just going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.890" end="00:17:44.500" style="s2">gesture towards it I do think that if we</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.340" end="00:17:47.620" style="s2">can explain relevance realization and we</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.500" end="00:17:49.179" style="s2">can explain complex recursive dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.620" end="00:17:51.490" style="s2">relevance realization and</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.179" end="00:17:53.530" style="s2">an involving connectedness to the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.490" end="00:17:55.780" style="s2">so that it makes sense to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.530" end="00:17:58.570" style="s2">that and then we can talk about how all</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.780" end="00:18:00.549" style="s2">of that can be relevant to something</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.570" end="00:18:04.150" style="s2">like what&#39;s going on in working memory</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.549" end="00:18:06.880" style="s2">both an online and an offline global</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.150" end="00:18:08.260" style="s2">work space that&#39;s doing entire order of</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.880" end="00:18:09.669" style="s2">the curse of relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.260" end="00:18:11.290" style="s2">because that&#39;s what working memory seems</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.669" end="00:18:13.750" style="s2">to be doing and that&#39;s the what</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.290" end="00:18:16.000" style="s2">consciousness seems to be for we can get</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.750" end="00:18:18.340" style="s2">a long way towards explaining the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.000" end="00:18:20.500" style="s2">function of consciousness and then once</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.340" end="00:18:23.110" style="s2">you have the idea of salient landscaping</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.500" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">and this for stuff double milling you</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.110" end="00:18:26.470" style="s2">can get a lot of the features of</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:28.750" style="s2">consciousness you can get the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.470" end="00:18:29.919" style="s2">here Ness the sense of nowness the sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.750" end="00:18:31.570" style="s2">of how things are centered on you</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.919" end="00:18:33.400" style="s2">because of other things are relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.570" end="00:18:35.500" style="s2">you in this highly complex textured</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.400" end="00:18:37.809" style="s2">manner so consciousness is basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.500" end="00:18:39.549" style="s2">this highly texturized salience</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.809" end="00:18:43.150" style="s2">landscape it&#39;s doing here in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.549" end="00:18:45.340" style="s2">nowness it&#39;s a sexualizing everything so</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.150" end="00:18:47.440" style="s2">things are appearing to you under a</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.340" end="00:18:49.660" style="s2">particular way of presentation like this</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.440" end="00:18:51.520" style="s2">is presenting itself to me as a cup</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.660" end="00:18:55.450" style="s2">because that&#39;s how it&#39;s a specialized as</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.520" end="00:18:58.179" style="s2">relevant to me and so consciousness is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.450" end="00:18:59.890" style="s2">lot of the phenomenal aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.179" end="00:19:02.380" style="s2">consciousness the hereness the noun is</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.890" end="00:19:03.190" style="s2">the togetherness a lot of the features</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.380" end="00:19:04.510" style="s2">that go into</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.190" end="00:19:06.580" style="s2">subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.510" end="00:19:09.130" style="s2">and a sense of centeredness and a sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.580" end="00:19:13.440" style="s2">of ongoingness a lot of the central</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.130" end="00:19:16.410" style="s2">features of consciousness I think will</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.440" end="00:19:19.030" style="s2">will be capable of being given a</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.410" end="00:19:20.380" style="s2">naturalist explanation error I have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.030" end="00:19:21.970" style="s2">lot of respect for people who would</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.380" end="00:19:25.059" style="s2">disagree with me on that because right</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.970" end="00:19:28.120" style="s2">now there is a lot of philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.059" end="00:19:30.040" style="s2">degree but from a lot of people that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.120" end="00:19:32.919" style="s2">respect about all of this consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.040" end="00:19:34.360" style="s2">is very very hard like they said so I am</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.919" end="00:19:35.980" style="s2">answering the question as it was asked</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.360" end="00:19:37.990" style="s2">I&#39;m answering the question as to what I</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.980" end="00:19:39.880" style="s2">have what do I believe in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.990" end="00:19:42.669" style="s2">I have argued for what I do think</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.880" end="00:19:44.110" style="s2">there&#39;s argument in evidence for now I</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.669" end="00:19:46.059" style="s2">want to pass to the second question</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.110" end="00:19:47.530" style="s2">which I don&#39;t think is identical to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.059" end="00:19:50.590" style="s2">first but I can see why it gets promoted</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.530" end="00:19:52.720" style="s2">by the first do I think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.590" end="00:19:56.429" style="s2">anything you know the that&#39;s always</p>

<p begin="00:20:02.710" end="00:20:05.919" style="s2">that that has to be the case because of</p>

<p begin="00:20:39.070" end="00:20:44.290" style="s2">is just to deny the basis of the</p>

<p begin="00:20:44.290" end="00:20:49.990" style="s2">means ignorance means you can&#39;t draw any</p>

<p begin="00:21:10.679" end="00:21:16.080" style="s2">that&#39;s one way of answering the question</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.929" end="00:21:18.250" style="s2">are there things that are in principle</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.080" end="00:21:19.750" style="s2">unknowable to us not so</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.250" end="00:21:22.210" style="s2">now we&#39;re shifting from for a</p>

<p begin="00:21:25.270" end="00:21:30.370" style="s2">about different kinds of patterns but</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.830" end="00:21:32.170" style="s2">just for to try and get more clear now</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.370" end="00:21:35.980" style="s2">we&#39;re talking qualitatively other kinds</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.170" end="00:21:37.180" style="s2">of things you can&#39;t know so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.980" end="00:21:40.110" style="s2">different question this is a question</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.180" end="00:21:43.930" style="s2">not of our finitude which of course</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.110" end="00:21:46.870" style="s2">limits us really limits us in powerful</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.930" end="00:21:47.980" style="s2">ways but now we&#39;re turning to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.870" end="00:21:51.040" style="s2">question of it&#39;s called epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.980" end="00:21:53.700" style="s2">boundedness epidemic boundedness is a</p>

<p begin="00:21:53.700" end="00:22:01.570" style="s2">affinity so for example I know a cat I</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.620" end="00:22:05.530" style="s2">love this cat and this cat is really</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.570" end="00:22:07.210" style="s2">smart he&#39;s a really smart cat highly</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.530" end="00:22:09.940" style="s2">intelligent and we he can do things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.210" end="00:22:13.420" style="s2">there&#39;s no move around the world and</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.940" end="00:22:15.640" style="s2">solve problems and deceive me in any you</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.420" end="00:22:18.790" style="s2">know still affectionate manner I really</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.640" end="00:22:21.970" style="s2">love this cat precisely because this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.790" end="00:22:26.290" style="s2">intelligent so he&#39;s clearly intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.970" end="00:22:28.480" style="s2">better than any robot we way beyond what</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.290" end="00:22:30.520" style="s2">any robot is capable right now because</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.480" end="00:22:31.870" style="s2">he&#39;s intelligent you does that mean he</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.520" end="00:22:35.740" style="s2">could generate a theory that explains</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.870" end="00:22:39.720" style="s2">his intelligence no all right it would</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.740" end="00:22:44.050" style="s2">be utterly miraculous if he somehow was</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.720" end="00:22:45.400" style="s2">able to generate a theory that explains</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.050" end="00:22:47.110" style="s2">his intelligence what am I trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.400" end="00:22:49.090" style="s2">show you that the possession of a</p>

<p begin="00:22:49.090" end="00:22:53.830" style="s2">to explain it but by no means many</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.390" end="00:22:57.400" style="s2">creatures have very sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.830" end="00:23:02.890" style="s2">intelligence of chimps will far beyond</p>

<p begin="00:23:02.890" end="00:23:10.390" style="s2">I would be absolutely dumbfounded if</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.170" end="00:23:14.560" style="s2">somehow a chimp using perhaps sign</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.390" end="00:23:16.510" style="s2">language was able to give a an</p>

<p begin="00:23:22.150" end="00:23:27.880" style="s2">event so the chip while being highly</p>

<p begin="00:23:27.880" end="00:23:32.050" style="s2">aren&#39;t capable of explaining</p>

<p begin="00:24:00.220" end="00:24:03.640" style="s2">that there are certain kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.600" end="00:24:06.670" style="s2">no matter how much information we were</p>

<p begin="00:24:09.610" end="00:24:16.300" style="s2">I think it is humoristic to a very great</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.650" end="00:24:19.090" style="s2">degree to conclude that all other</p>

<p begin="00:24:23.770" end="00:24:27.870" style="s2">is because we aren&#39;t we&#39;ve knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.690" end="00:24:30.010" style="s2">that children are epistemic we bounded</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.870" end="00:24:31.900" style="s2">we acknowledge that there are many</p>

<p begin="00:24:34.420" end="00:24:38.410" style="s2">we&#39;re basically saying is even though</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.580" end="00:24:40.420" style="s2">the really smart human beings that our</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.410" end="00:24:45.700" style="s2">children are epistemic we found it but</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.420" end="00:24:48.130" style="s2">not us adults I find that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.700" end="00:24:49.870" style="s2">that&#39;s special pleading and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.130" end="00:24:53.080" style="s2">technically it requires an independent</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.870" end="00:24:55.030" style="s2">piece of information as to why we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.080" end="00:24:57.100" style="s2">this even highly intelligent even highly</p>

<p begin="00:24:59.380" end="00:25:05.050" style="s2">so I think it&#39;s likely that not only are</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.740" end="00:25:06.640" style="s2">we quantitatively but limited by the</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.050" end="00:25:08.680" style="s2">finitary predicament and the fact of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.640" end="00:25:10.150" style="s2">earliest published article so I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.680" end="00:25:12.130" style="s2">that it&#39;s quite possible that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.150" end="00:25:14.410" style="s2">epistemically founded in a qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.130" end="00:25:16.960" style="s2">manner not just quantitatively and</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.410" end="00:25:21.820" style="s2">therefore what do we draw about that</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.960" end="00:25:23.530" style="s2">well the point is again we&#39;re where we</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.820" end="00:25:24.610" style="s2">are economically bounded we are ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.530" end="00:25:27.940" style="s2">and there in the earth we should be</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.610" end="00:25:30.100" style="s2">silent we should be sonic then say oh</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.940" end="00:25:32.800" style="s2">because you&#39;ve acknowledged that for</p>

<p begin="00:25:32.800" end="00:25:40.390" style="s2">can claim that Zeus exists or some such</p>

<p begin="00:35:02.840" end="00:35:10.130" style="s2">I mean I was familiar with the</p>

<p begin="00:35:20.930" end="00:35:25.220" style="s2">you always have to take sort of a large</p>

<p begin="00:35:25.220" end="00:35:29.480" style="s2">about sort of statistically normal</p>

<p begin="00:35:35.350" end="00:35:39.290" style="s2">hemispheres so you have to be a little</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.250" end="00:35:41.630" style="s2">bit it&#39;s more a functional thing than an</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.290" end="00:35:43.550" style="s2">anatomical thing and the way I</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.630" end="00:35:45.440" style="s2">understand it which is similar but I</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.550" end="00:35:48.290" style="s2">think different from the dullest is and</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.440" end="00:35:50.390" style="s2">is in terms of the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.290" end="00:35:53.260" style="s2">problem-solving so I think a functional</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.390" end="00:35:56.150" style="s2">analysis the left hemisphere is</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.260" end="00:35:58.850" style="s2">basically for dealing with well-defined</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.150" end="00:36:00.260" style="s2">problems and because the world of mind</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.850" end="00:36:02.360" style="s2">they have a large degree of familiarity</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.260" end="00:36:04.520" style="s2">for us where&#39;s the right hemisphere is</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.360" end="00:36:07.940" style="s2">about dealing with real defined problems</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.520" end="00:36:11.330" style="s2">and therefore they often have three of</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.940" end="00:36:12.830" style="s2">unpredicted novelty for us and so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.330" end="00:36:15.800" style="s2">left hemisphere is you may expect for</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.830" end="00:36:19.990" style="s2">familiarity and for well-defined</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.800" end="00:36:22.880" style="s2">problems it looks with very bright very</p>

<p begin="00:36:22.880" end="00:36:26.360" style="s2">because that&#39;s like gonna make your way</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.440" end="00:36:28.010" style="s2">through a well-defined problem it looks</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.360" end="00:36:29.600" style="s2">for clarity and certainty because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.010" end="00:36:31.070" style="s2">again the standards you should hold</p>

<p begin="00:36:31.070" end="00:36:35.480" style="s2">the problem whereas when you&#39;re doing so</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.920" end="00:36:39.830" style="s2">it&#39;s very feature lis oriented very</p>

<p begin="00:36:39.830" end="00:36:46.250" style="s2">according to a high standard of clarity</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.980" end="00:36:48.350" style="s2">even pursuing certainty on at least in a</p>

<p begin="00:36:49.330" end="00:36:52.540" style="s2">the right hemisphere of course included</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.370" end="00:36:56.290" style="s2">with all the fun problems it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.540" end="00:36:58.330" style="s2">go to the result it&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.290" end="00:37:00.310" style="s2">worried it&#39;s gonna be very ambiguity</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.330" end="00:37:05.020" style="s2">tolerant it&#39;s not gonna be that worried</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.310" end="00:37:06.910" style="s2">about absolute clarity or certainty it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.020" end="00:37:08.410" style="s2">not gonna do things step in step by step</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.910" end="00:37:11.520" style="s2">it&#39;s going to try and get you to react</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.410" end="00:37:14.350" style="s2">overall so you can you know think about</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.520" end="00:37:16.540" style="s2">search or well-defined problem sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.350" end="00:37:18.520" style="s2">you know searching in an area for your</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.540" end="00:37:19.870" style="s2">lost keys or something like that that</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.520" end="00:37:21.370" style="s2">you drop in the glass you&#39;re very</p>

<p begin="00:37:21.370" end="00:37:26.530" style="s2">look you could brighten you used to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.770" end="00:37:28.270" style="s2">this step-by-step search well but then</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.530" end="00:37:29.920" style="s2">while you&#39;re doing that a huge evil</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.270" end="00:37:31.630" style="s2">sweeps in from the left and is about to</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:33.130" style="s2">hit you in the head with its clogs then</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.630" end="00:37:34.600" style="s2">you&#39;re going to relax at the fish stall</p>

<p begin="00:37:34.600" end="00:37:38.890" style="s2">sure what kind of predator it is and I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:37:38.890" end="00:37:43.330" style="s2">predator if you&#39;re gonna dodge and move</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.930" end="00:37:45.610" style="s2">all at once right what&#39;s interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.330" end="00:37:47.500" style="s2">this seems to and this is something if</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.610" end="00:37:49.360" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t talk about but central to</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.500" end="00:37:51.220" style="s2">my work but what seems to happen in an</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.360" end="00:37:53.620" style="s2">inside problem if this goes back to work</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.220" end="00:37:57.010" style="s2">ongoing work by Cooney on sand demon</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.620" end="00:37:58.210" style="s2">moment is that you start a problem and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.010" end="00:37:59.500" style="s2">you&#39;re it&#39;s mostly in the left</p>

<p begin="00:38:01.690" end="00:38:04.930" style="s2">problem it&#39;s not working and then you</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.430" end="00:38:07.450" style="s2">get a sudden shift into the right</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.930" end="00:38:09.370" style="s2">hemisphere where you&#39;re opening up the</p>

<p begin="00:38:13.180" end="00:38:17.140" style="s2">formulation and you bring it back into</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.710" end="00:38:19.480" style="s2">the left hemisphere by the way metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.140" end="00:38:21.820" style="s2">seems to trigger the same kind of</p>

<p begin="00:38:25.180" end="00:38:30.670" style="s2">and therefore we should understand</p>

<p begin="00:38:30.670" end="00:38:37.990" style="s2">all that being said I think I can say</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.590" end="00:38:40.710" style="s2">something to the effect that when</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.990" end="00:38:43.090" style="s2">Madoka&#39;s talks about left hemispheric</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.710" end="00:38:46.420" style="s2">dominance I will translate that into</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.090" end="00:38:49.030" style="s2">saying that&#39;s preponderance a dominance</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.420" end="00:38:50.770" style="s2">for preferring well-defined problems</p>

<p begin="00:38:52.900" end="00:38:56.980" style="s2">into the point I made about the</p>

<p begin="00:39:24.780" end="00:39:28.890" style="s2">is it&#39;s not just a left-right thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.670" end="00:39:30.450" style="s2">that&#39;s too simplistic because if we</p>

<p begin="00:41:16.980" end="00:41:20.609" style="s2">this book is you know should be ignored</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.290" end="00:41:23.250" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t address all these</p>

<p begin="00:41:52.609" end="00:42:03.030" style="s2">so as I mentioned and I&#39;m doing a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.460" end="00:42:05.430" style="s2">about this and some of you can I I&#39;m so</p>

<p begin="00:42:15.600" end="00:42:19.680" style="s2">myself and it&#39;s again it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.400" end="00:42:21.810" style="s2">this project of trying to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.680" end="00:42:23.670" style="s2">cyber technology of dialectic and trying</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.810" end="00:42:25.619" style="s2">to understand the process within</p>

<p begin="00:42:25.619" end="00:42:32.070" style="s2">cognition of the Ilocos it and so I</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.760" end="00:42:35.640" style="s2">bring that up because what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.070" end="00:42:36.900" style="s2">right now is just so much I&#39;m putting a</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.640" end="00:42:39.780" style="s2">lot of work in but I&#39;m getting so much</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.900" end="00:42:42.450" style="s2">help and insight and feedback and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.780" end="00:42:44.609" style="s2">just plain fun to working on after</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.450" end="00:42:46.500" style="s2">Socrates the next series the one I</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.609" end="00:42:48.690" style="s2">mentioned earlier so we&#39;ve got the I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.500" end="00:42:51.150" style="s2">working on the follow-up which is you</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.690" end="00:42:54.000" style="s2">know after Socrates the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.150" end="00:42:56.130" style="s2">the pursuit of wisdom through authentic</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.000" end="00:42:57.720" style="s2">dialogue so it&#39;s after Socrates in both</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.130" end="00:43:00.030" style="s2">senses the word in that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.720" end="00:43:02.190" style="s2">emulate and come after him in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.030" end="00:43:04.890" style="s2">but also after Socrates historically so</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.190" end="00:43:07.590" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to first of all look right at</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.890" end="00:43:09.150" style="s2">the ancient practice of dialectic that</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.590" end="00:43:11.250" style="s2">seems to have started around Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.150" end="00:43:14.369" style="s2">what was going on there what are the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.250" end="00:43:16.350" style="s2">dimensions what is it doing because it</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.369" end="00:43:17.790" style="s2">seems to be what Jordan Hall was asking</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.350" end="00:43:21.240" style="s2">for it seems to be a meta site of</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.790" end="00:43:23.400" style="s2">technology that basically accesses and</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.240" end="00:43:25.560" style="s2">accentuates the power of collective</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.400" end="00:43:27.600" style="s2">intelligence and bootstraps it up into</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.560" end="00:43:30.960" style="s2">collective rationality then therefore</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.600" end="00:43:35.640" style="s2">acts as a place acts as a way in</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.960" end="00:43:37.320" style="s2">we can curate that perhaps generate the</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.640" end="00:43:38.850" style="s2">ecology of psycho technologies that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.320" end="00:43:40.320" style="s2">certainly what dialectic was doing in</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.850" end="00:43:42.480" style="s2">the ancient world I want to get a very</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.320" end="00:43:43.800" style="s2">clear understanding of that and then and</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.480" end="00:43:45.860" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of great work that&#39;s come</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.800" end="00:43:48.480" style="s2">out on that and then put that into you</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.860" end="00:43:50.040" style="s2">put that into dialogue with all these</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.480" end="00:43:51.660" style="s2">practices and many of which I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.040" end="00:43:56.610" style="s2">doing participant observation with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.660" end="00:43:58.260" style="s2">help of Peter Lambert my really valued</p>

<p begin="00:43:58.260" end="00:44:03.870" style="s2">we&#39;ve been doing circling practices</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.770" end="00:44:06.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve done the inside dialogue we did</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.870" end="00:44:09.270" style="s2">empathy circling just trying to learn</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.480" end="00:44:14.280" style="s2">and of course the ongoing rich dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.270" end="00:44:20.130" style="s2">I&#39;m having with Dyson stock who is just</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.280" end="00:44:22.800" style="s2">an amazing a source of insight and</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.130" end="00:44:24.540" style="s2">wisdom he created circling and created</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.800" end="00:44:28.290" style="s2">and philosophically profound way he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.540" end="00:44:29.820" style="s2">just also a fantastic friend so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.290" end="00:44:31.980" style="s2">doing all of that because the second</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.820" end="00:44:34.200" style="s2">half of the series is going to be once</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.980" end="00:44:36.810" style="s2">we get an understanding of what ancient</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.200" end="00:44:39.990" style="s2">dialectic was going to use I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.810" end="00:44:41.160" style="s2">discuss all these merging practices so</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.990" end="00:44:43.740" style="s2">they think it gets something like a</p>

<p begin="00:45:04.410" end="00:45:12.150" style="s2">good to hear from you and the question</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.280" end="00:45:14.670" style="s2">there is was there ever a specific</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.150" end="00:45:16.410" style="s2">moment where you realize you needed to</p>

<p begin="00:45:16.410" end="00:45:21.270" style="s2">or has this always been pursued that</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.330" end="00:45:28.280" style="s2">interested you that&#39;s a fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.270" end="00:45:34.350" style="s2">question specific moment and it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.280" end="00:45:37.290" style="s2">maybe a specific period so as I</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.350" end="00:45:41.910" style="s2">mentioned when I was in high school I</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.290" end="00:45:44.230" style="s2">sort of because of the work as I left a</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.910" end="00:45:46.930" style="s2">fundamentalist Christian upbringing</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.230" end="00:45:49.420" style="s2">which is like leaving alcoholism and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.930" end="00:45:51.369" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry that sounds like it&#39;s harsh to</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.420" end="00:45:53.310" style="s2">people who pursue that I&#39;m speaking from</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.369" end="00:45:56.590" style="s2">my personal experience in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.310" end="00:45:58.950" style="s2">like it was harmful and traumatizing but</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.590" end="00:46:04.600" style="s2">nevertheless it needs a craving in you</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.950" end="00:46:06.580" style="s2">and so I fell into a kind of personal</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.600" end="00:46:10.359" style="s2">meaning crisis existential crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.580" end="00:46:12.300" style="s2">that was developed by encountering some</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.359" end="00:46:18.550" style="s2">science fiction that introduced me to</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.300" end="00:46:20.290" style="s2">the philosophies and pathologies I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.550" end="00:46:22.810" style="s2">tired of the Christian framework and</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.290" end="00:46:26.170" style="s2">that has a huge impact on me and then I</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.810" end="00:46:31.300" style="s2">read I read stigmata by Hermann Hesse</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.170" end="00:46:33.010" style="s2">and that was like all these these sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.300" end="00:46:37.600" style="s2">of Buddhist and Hindu mythology&#39;s can</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.010" end="00:46:40.510" style="s2">actually be directed towards the pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.600" end="00:46:42.280" style="s2">of wisdom and the overcoming of a sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.510" end="00:46:45.100" style="s2">of alienation because that&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.280" end="00:46:47.440" style="s2">what&#39;s it heart is famously about the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.100" end="00:46:49.270" style="s2">inner journey that has to talked about</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.440" end="00:46:52.660" style="s2">you know the locust said it&#39;s actually</p>

<p begin="00:46:52.660" end="00:46:57.820" style="s2">quite that romantic but I I appreciated</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.730" end="00:46:59.440" style="s2">that very very deeply about the same</p>

<p begin="00:46:59.440" end="00:47:02.460" style="s2">business by lover to Davies which</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.850" end="00:47:05.530" style="s2">introduced me great Canadian literature</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.460" end="00:47:07.390" style="s2">to young and then I got a sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.530" end="00:47:09.460" style="s2">depth of the unconscious and that it</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.390" end="00:47:10.720" style="s2">could that there&#39;s all there&#39;s aspects</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.460" end="00:47:13.540" style="s2">to our cognition that are stopped</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.720" end="00:47:18.820" style="s2">organizing and they can be the source of</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.540" end="00:47:21.609" style="s2">growth and insight but that was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.820" end="00:47:25.030" style="s2">like this scattered existentially</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.609" end="00:47:27.010" style="s2">inchoate for me and then I read Plato in</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.030" end="00:47:29.770" style="s2">first university rather the public and</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.010" end="00:47:31.990" style="s2">about Socrates and then it crystallized</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.770" end="00:47:34.180" style="s2">not into a dead crystal not like the</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.990" end="00:47:37.420" style="s2">cold beauty of a diamond but like the</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.180" end="00:47:40.690" style="s2">Living beauty of a fire right it came</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.420" end="00:47:43.780" style="s2">together for me it caught fire and that</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.690" end="00:47:49.210" style="s2">this the unexamined life is not worth</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.780" end="00:47:52.060" style="s2">living right Socrates died for that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.210" end="00:47:55.150" style="s2">unexamined life is not worth living and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.060" end="00:47:56.830" style="s2">that went very deep and it correlated</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.150" end="00:47:58.100" style="s2">all that together and it set into motion</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.830" end="00:47:59.390" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.100" end="00:48:01.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s when it began from you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.390" end="00:48:03.890" style="s2">Plato is sacred for me I constantly</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.400" end="00:48:08.120" style="s2">return back to that and as I grow and</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.890" end="00:48:12.140" style="s2">learn to to which I have right I get a</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.120" end="00:48:13.250" style="s2">deeper understanding not just sets of</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.140" end="00:48:16.280" style="s2">beliefs but a deeper understanding</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.250" end="00:48:18.320" style="s2">through all the kinds of knowing of why</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.280" end="00:48:22.010" style="s2">the unexamined life is not worth living</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.320" end="00:48:24.440" style="s2">so I guess that would be the Kairos for</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.010" end="00:48:25.820" style="s2">me there&#39;s all these important</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.440" end="00:48:31.250" style="s2">precursors but the encounter with</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.820" end="00:48:33.680" style="s2">Socrates and the that the the the wake</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.250" end="00:48:35.570" style="s2">up the clarion call that the unexamined</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.680" end="00:48:40.610" style="s2">life is not worth living is what really</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.570" end="00:48:42.080" style="s2">saying to me Andre I tell you the</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.610" end="00:48:43.790" style="s2">another question could you be to</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.080" end="00:48:45.560" style="s2">describe your own personal journey in</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.790" end="00:48:50.120" style="s2">your daily meditative and contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.560" end="00:48:54.550" style="s2">practice habits yeah so I have a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.120" end="00:48:59.390" style="s2">of practices that I do every morning I</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.550" end="00:49:01.340" style="s2">do a whole bunch of a set of warm-up</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.390" end="00:49:04.400" style="s2">practices and also practices for helping</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.340" end="00:49:09.680" style="s2">to ameliorate the venires that I have in</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.400" end="00:49:13.010" style="s2">my left ear and then I I do some Tai Chi</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.680" end="00:49:14.840" style="s2">I do usually I do I go there fast form</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.010" end="00:49:16.340" style="s2">of the gym I do a weapons forum or a</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.840" end="00:49:18.590" style="s2">sword form I use a wooden sword by the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.340" end="00:49:21.230" style="s2">way I don&#39;t try and hurt anybody and</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.590" end="00:49:23.270" style="s2">then I do a slow form a modified version</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.230" end="00:49:26.330" style="s2">of the Beijing form I do that very</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.270" end="00:49:28.940" style="s2">deeply I use the supplement that with</p>

<p begin="00:49:33.650" end="00:49:41.330" style="s2">and then I sit I do practices that are</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.740" end="00:49:45.260" style="s2">again supposed to just get me sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.330" end="00:49:48.350" style="s2">deeply into my body within a sitting</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.260" end="00:49:50.420" style="s2">posture it basically has to do is sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.350" end="00:49:52.360" style="s2">of holding your breath and rotating</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.420" end="00:49:55.220" style="s2">various parts of your body to try and</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.360" end="00:50:02.510" style="s2">really interior eyes and open up your</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.220" end="00:50:04.850" style="s2">intro section and get sort of the the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.510" end="00:50:06.620" style="s2">the central nervous system peripheral</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.850" end="00:50:09.600" style="s2">nervous system communication flowing I</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.620" end="00:50:11.970" style="s2">do all that and then I go into</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.600" end="00:50:15.390" style="s2">a form of meditation that is taking me</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.970" end="00:50:16.980" style="s2">very deeply in oh and right and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.390" end="00:50:19.710" style="s2">I&#39;ve been a contemplative practice it</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.980" end="00:50:24.690" style="s2">takes me out and then I do a practice</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.710" end="00:50:26.160" style="s2">that Praja that sort of synthesizes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.690" end="00:50:27.780" style="s2">more like stereoscopic fusion the way</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.160" end="00:50:30.540" style="s2">the left in the right visual field give</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.780" end="00:50:33.720" style="s2">you depth where so I&#39;m getting the the</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.540" end="00:50:35.910" style="s2">the deepest of the internal movements of</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.720" end="00:50:38.610" style="s2">meditation inward the deepest of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.910" end="00:50:40.320" style="s2">outward movements in contemplation but</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.610" end="00:50:42.930" style="s2">I&#39;m getting them simultaneously at depth</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.320" end="00:50:46.530" style="s2">that&#39;s proj not and then within that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.930" end="00:50:48.150" style="s2">move towards you&#39;re not meditating you</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.530" end="00:50:50.250" style="s2">you you become sort of aware of your</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.150" end="00:50:52.230" style="s2">awareness and then aware of the self</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.250" end="00:50:55.620" style="s2">presencing of your awareness and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.230" end="00:50:57.360" style="s2">you move to right to the the self</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.620" end="00:50:59.610" style="s2">presencing of the self presencing and</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.360" end="00:51:01.830" style="s2">then there&#39;s no difference between sort</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.610" end="00:51:03.960" style="s2">of how reality is self presencing to you</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.830" end="00:51:06.270" style="s2">and how your own fundamental awareness</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.960" end="00:51:08.910" style="s2">is self present present presencing</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.270" end="00:51:16.620" style="s2">itself to you you you get this this deep</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.910" end="00:51:19.050" style="s2">place of Prajnaparamita dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.620" end="00:51:21.900" style="s2">intelligence into the depths of your</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.050" end="00:51:23.580" style="s2">perspective of knowing and right into</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.900" end="00:51:25.140" style="s2">the place where it&#39;s interfacing with</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.580" end="00:51:26.610" style="s2">your participatory knowing the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.140" end="00:51:28.770" style="s2">fundamental sense of identity the</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.610" end="00:51:31.710" style="s2">fundamental way in which your habitus</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.770" end="00:51:34.050" style="s2">and your autos are Co determining and Co</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.710" end="00:51:38.010" style="s2">structuring each other and then I end</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.050" end="00:51:40.200" style="s2">with a gratitude practice the practice</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.010" end="00:51:43.080" style="s2">flow is basically something like this on</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.200" end="00:51:45.750" style="s2">I thank the self persistence of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.080" end="00:51:47.700" style="s2">physical or I do not make it I am bridge</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.750" end="00:51:51.890" style="s2">from it to trust and participate in it</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.700" end="00:51:55.650" style="s2">so I think I&#39;m grateful for the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.890" end="00:51:58.650" style="s2">self-organization of the vital because I</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.650" end="00:52:02.220" style="s2">do not make it I emerged from it to</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.650" end="00:52:04.440" style="s2">trust and participate in it I&#39;m grateful</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.220" end="00:52:07.710" style="s2">for the self presencing are the</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.440" end="00:52:09.900" style="s2">intelligible you not make it emerge from</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.710" end="00:52:12.000" style="s2">it to trust and participate in it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.900" end="00:52:15.000" style="s2">grateful for the spiritual lack of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.000" end="00:52:17.520" style="s2">better adjective my grateful for this</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.000" end="00:52:19.790" style="s2">the self transcendence of the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.520" end="00:52:22.040" style="s2">I do not make it</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.790" end="00:52:24.320" style="s2">emerge from it to trust and participate</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.040" end="00:52:27.850" style="s2">in it and so what that does is you get</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.320" end="00:52:31.580" style="s2">this all you get this comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.850" end="00:52:34.070" style="s2">permeation of gratitude which which</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.580" end="00:52:35.900" style="s2">resonates with that state of Praja and</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.070" end="00:52:38.109" style="s2">then that sets me ready for the day and</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.900" end="00:52:40.670" style="s2">so that&#39;s what I do</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.109" end="00:52:43.730" style="s2">and what that was helpful to you what I</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.670" end="00:52:45.650" style="s2">also do in the morning before I</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.730" end="00:52:48.290" style="s2">undertake those practices so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.650" end="00:52:51.140" style="s2">set of practices I also record any</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.290" end="00:52:53.960" style="s2">dreams I had the night before because</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.140" end="00:52:55.820" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to maintain as open a line of</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.960" end="00:52:58.790" style="s2">communication between conscious and</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.820" end="00:53:00.770" style="s2">unconscious mind I also will read about</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.790" end="00:53:02.000" style="s2">a particular cognitive bias but remind</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.770" end="00:53:02.930" style="s2">myself that I need to look for</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.000" end="00:53:05.300" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.930" end="00:53:07.070" style="s2">I need to look for ways in which I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:53:21.770" end="00:53:25.580" style="s2">the day and I try to notice them I try</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.960" end="00:53:28.010" style="s2">to actively counteract them and at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.580" end="00:53:29.900" style="s2">end of the day I journal about when I</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.010" end="00:53:31.910" style="s2">was able to notice what I might have</p>

<p begin="00:53:31.910" end="00:53:35.630" style="s2">now know this retrospectively because of</p>

<p begin="00:54:06.830" end="00:54:10.609" style="s2">Stephen Mitchell which is prose and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.600" end="00:54:12.470" style="s2">and then I do let go Davina on it</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.609" end="00:54:13.760" style="s2">lectio Divina and then I read a passage</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.470" end="00:54:14.450" style="s2">from the enlightened part which is</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.760" end="00:54:16.850" style="s2">poetry</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.450" end="00:54:20.060" style="s2">I do Alexio Davina on that so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.850" end="00:54:22.040" style="s2">after I do the gratitude I then do the</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.060" end="00:54:23.720" style="s2">Lexi Adina I forgot that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.040" end="00:54:25.609" style="s2">important to me by the way and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.720" end="00:54:27.320" style="s2">really interesting for me is how the</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.609" end="00:54:28.700" style="s2">let&#39;s see Oh Davina which we brings me</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.320" end="00:54:30.440" style="s2">back into propositions</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.700" end="00:54:33.019" style="s2">resonates with all this non-propositions</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.440" end="00:54:35.449" style="s2">or stuff like you do at the point she</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.019" end="00:54:37.249" style="s2">Asian and the contemplation practices</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.449" end="00:54:41.119" style="s2">and then it&#39;s also really interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.249" end="00:54:43.009" style="s2">see how the poetry and the pros the like</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.119" end="00:54:45.469" style="s2">in the let Co Divina not only how each</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.009" end="00:54:47.209" style="s2">one resonates with me but also how they</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.469" end="00:54:49.640" style="s2">resonate with each other and how that</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.209" end="00:54:52.969" style="s2">that resonance between them also deepens</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.640" end="00:54:55.509" style="s2">the resonance with me and I find that a</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.969" end="00:54:59.719" style="s2">very powerful practice</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.509" end="00:55:01.519" style="s2">okay so we got Steven last month patron</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.719" end="00:55:03.319" style="s2">and Chad can you explicate how</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.519" end="00:55:05.059" style="s2">inexhaustible Ness can function as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.319" end="00:55:06.709" style="s2">constraint relevance it seems</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.059" end="00:55:09.380" style="s2">contradictory that something internet</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.709" end="00:55:11.419" style="s2">can function as limited yes I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.380" end="00:55:13.939" style="s2">that&#39;s right if I said it functions as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.419" end="00:55:16.549" style="s2">constraint that is I think technically</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.939" end="00:55:19.279" style="s2">incorrect what I should be saying to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.549" end="00:55:21.319" style="s2">more precise is that our cognition has</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.279" end="00:55:23.569" style="s2">to have constitutive constraints</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.319" end="00:55:25.399" style="s2">constraints that actually constitute in</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.569" end="00:55:28.339" style="s2">structural functional organization in</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.399" end="00:55:30.679" style="s2">response to inexhaustible mystery in a</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.339" end="00:55:33.319" style="s2">response to the fact that reality is</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.679" end="00:55:35.449" style="s2">combinatorially explosive so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.319" end="00:55:37.279" style="s2">I should have said and you&#39;re right to</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.449" end="00:55:39.319" style="s2">catch me on a kind of sloppiness</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.279" end="00:55:42.380" style="s2">in presentation of how I mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.319" end="00:55:45.289" style="s2">the much the correct way I think of</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.380" end="00:55:48.019" style="s2">saying it is the inexhaustible Ness of</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.289" end="00:55:50.179" style="s2">reality which we will encounter as comp</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.019" end="00:55:52.849" style="s2">the combinatorial explosive nature of</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.179" end="00:55:55.489" style="s2">our problem-solving very broadly</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.849" end="00:55:59.089" style="s2">construed our adaptive attempts to deal</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.489" end="00:56:01.969" style="s2">with reality demands that there are</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.089" end="00:56:04.009" style="s2">constitutive constraints so that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.969" end="00:56:06.649" style="s2">avoid the combinatorial explosion and</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.009" end="00:56:08.539" style="s2">that avoiding right when it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.649" end="00:56:10.339" style="s2">adaptively and all the ways I described</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.539" end="00:56:15.169" style="s2">in my series that&#39;s the process that</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.339" end="00:56:19.489" style="s2">gives us relevance realization so</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.169" end="00:56:20.839" style="s2">everyone once again as always I I feel</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.489" end="00:56:24.229" style="s2">like we&#39;re just beginning I could do</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.839" end="00:56:27.949" style="s2">this for more because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.229" end="00:56:29.479" style="s2">interesting to get it to answering</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.949" end="00:56:31.549" style="s2">people&#39;s questions it&#39;s so helpful to me</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.479" end="00:56:33.169" style="s2">because I can see where I&#39;ve gone wrong</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.549" end="00:56:35.269" style="s2">and sometimes I can also see perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.169" end="00:56:37.789" style="s2">where it&#39;s not right and the relative</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.269" end="00:56:40.579" style="s2">balance between them and how to how to</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.789" end="00:56:43.599" style="s2">improve and also how to be more helpful</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.579" end="00:56:46.880" style="s2">to the people that are following my work</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.599" end="00:56:51.530" style="s2">and one more time I want to</p>
