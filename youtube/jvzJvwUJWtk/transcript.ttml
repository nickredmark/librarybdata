<p begin="00:00:17.060" end="00:00:23.340" style="s2">all right everyone we&#39;re about to begin</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.970" end="00:00:26.340" style="s2">welcome to the stoah I am Peter</p>

<p begin="00:00:30.210" end="00:00:35.220" style="s2">decided to launch the stoah and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.640" end="00:00:38.070" style="s2">viewing this as not just a space to</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.220" end="00:00:40.380" style="s2">discuss and practice stoicism there</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.070" end="00:00:42.450" style="s2">surely be some of that but I&#39;m viewing</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.380" end="00:00:44.700" style="s2">it as a digital campfire to cohere and</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.450" end="00:00:47.610" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.700" end="00:00:49.590" style="s2">knife&#39;s edge of this moment today we</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.610" end="00:00:53.670" style="s2">have Jordan Hall who&#39;s going to provide</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.590" end="00:00:56.460" style="s2">a situational assessment and I&#39;ll hand</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.670" end="00:00:58.650" style="s2">it to Jordan in the moment but how today</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.460" end="00:01:00.540" style="s2">is going to work Jordan will provide a</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.650" end="00:01:02.579" style="s2">situational assessment I&#39;ll ask him a</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.540" end="00:01:04.439" style="s2">few questions and when I&#39;m asking him</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.579" end="00:01:07.530" style="s2">questions just write down your question</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.439" end="00:01:10.860" style="s2">in the chat box and I will call on you</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.530" end="00:01:13.950" style="s2">just unmute yourself and then ask a</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.860" end="00:01:16.170" style="s2">question of Jordan if you prefer that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.950" end="00:01:17.810" style="s2">read your question on your behalf just</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.170" end="00:01:20.430" style="s2">indicate that when you write it down</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.810" end="00:01:24.620" style="s2">that being said I&#39;ll hand it over to</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.430" end="00:01:24.620" style="s2">Jordan uh what&#39;s the situation my friend</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.240" end="00:01:34.010" style="s2">unmute myself thank you did you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.290" end="00:01:36.060" style="s2">haha mercy all right so let me see I</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.010" end="00:01:42.450" style="s2">guess the first thing that comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.060" end="00:01:44.400" style="s2">is a very clear sense of the I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.450" end="00:01:49.409" style="s2">recognition of the fact that the primary</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.400" end="00:01:51.479" style="s2">situation is is building chaos that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.409" end="00:01:52.740" style="s2">ability to even try to grasp the whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.479" end="00:01:55.560" style="s2">of what&#39;s happening in any particular</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.740" end="00:01:58.680" style="s2">perspective and narrowly focus it into a</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.560" end="00:02:01.820" style="s2">set of linear words as uh sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.680" end="00:02:04.979" style="s2">obviously not the right possibility so</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.820" end="00:02:06.680" style="s2">I&#39;ll sort of try to just give some</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.979" end="00:02:10.950" style="s2">richness of the things that I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.680" end="00:02:12.180" style="s2">recognizing that my perspective has some</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.950" end="00:02:14.459" style="s2">things going forward and a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.180" end="00:02:16.110" style="s2">of things that aren&#39;t and just put it</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.459" end="00:02:18.480" style="s2">out there but the hope is that this</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.110" end="00:02:21.450" style="s2">notion that there is a way of us being</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.480" end="00:02:26.010" style="s2">able to rediscover this campfire concept</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.450" end="00:02:27.329" style="s2">and to rapidly rebuild a capacity to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.010" end="00:02:29.219" style="s2">the thing that humans are natively and</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.329" end="00:02:29.580" style="s2">dad to do which is to come together for</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.219" end="00:02:31.470" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.580" end="00:02:34.290" style="s2">kind of shared perspective shared</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.470" end="00:02:36.330" style="s2">consciousness it&#39;s what I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.290" end="00:02:37.440" style="s2">is the thing at the very front end so</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.330" end="00:02:39.900" style="s2">there&#39;s lots and lots of things that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.440" end="00:02:41.400" style="s2">going on in kind of the day-to-day and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.900" end="00:02:43.560" style="s2">everybody&#39;s unique circumstances other</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.400" end="00:02:45.450" style="s2">unique circumstances but the one thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.560" end="00:02:47.670" style="s2">that I think is shared is this event is</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.450" end="00:02:49.020" style="s2">the prototype of what in fact everybody</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.670" end="00:02:51.960" style="s2">should be beginning to get better at</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.020" end="00:02:55.260" style="s2">doing so TL DR that&#39;s the beginning the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.960" end="00:02:57.360" style="s2">end so a note from our sponsor I need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.260" end="00:02:59.250" style="s2">make sure that brett weinstein is called</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.360" end="00:03:00.840" style="s2">out as the person who first and foremost</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.250" end="00:03:02.580" style="s2">urged me to be thinking about that kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.840" end="00:03:04.980" style="s2">of thing the notion of the campfire as</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.580" end="00:03:06.510" style="s2">being both the the beginning and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.980" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">archetype of what it means for people to</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.510" end="00:03:10.650" style="s2">come together in a place of where</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:13.860" style="s2">consciousness arises so hopefully we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.650" end="00:03:15.270" style="s2">be seeing more of him on this front so</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.860" end="00:03:19.050" style="s2">as I look around I noticed that my own</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.270" end="00:03:20.700" style="s2">personal life there&#39;s such a very wide</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.050" end="00:03:23.640" style="s2">variety of different places where my</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.700" end="00:03:26.370" style="s2">attention is pulled I spent this morning</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.640" end="00:03:29.280" style="s2">talking to literally actual Special</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.370" end="00:03:31.470" style="s2">Operations people who are embedding</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.280" end="00:03:34.320" style="s2">themselves directly into the gaps in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.470" end="00:03:36.030" style="s2">medical system in New York City so one</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.320" end="00:03:38.130" style="s2">element of the situation assessment at</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.030" end="00:03:41.280" style="s2">least for people in North America is</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.130" end="00:03:44.580" style="s2">that the kind of the capital of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.280" end="00:03:47.700" style="s2">American Empire happens to be the hot</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.580" end="00:03:48.989" style="s2">spot and it is within days of having</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.700" end="00:03:51.900" style="s2">what is known as medical system</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.989" end="00:03:53.610" style="s2">overwhelm and maybe did today medical</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.900" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">system overwhelm in a big way meaning</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.610" end="00:03:57.060" style="s2">will begin to start having overflow</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:03:59.940" style="s2">individuals who need I see who can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.060" end="00:04:01.800" style="s2">access to ICU and that will continue to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.940" end="00:04:03.780" style="s2">proceed in some sort of exponential path</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.800" end="00:04:05.250" style="s2">over the next few days and weeks so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.780" end="00:04:07.560" style="s2">the situation on the ground in New York</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.250" end="00:04:09.530" style="s2">is a is supposed to real thing that has</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.560" end="00:04:12.270" style="s2">really human beings undergoing real</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.530" end="00:04:15.770" style="s2">situations but also serves as an</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.270" end="00:04:15.770" style="s2">enormous archetype</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.019" end="00:04:21.549" style="s2">get back to that in a second actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.209" end="00:04:24.250" style="s2">let me jump to Sweden I was just getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.549" end="00:04:26.680" style="s2">off a call with Nora Bateson who by the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.250" end="00:04:29.710" style="s2">way her virtual version of the warm data</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.680" end="00:04:33.699" style="s2">labs also serves as a deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.710" end="00:04:36.129" style="s2">insightful prototype or model of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.699" end="00:04:38.409" style="s2">kind of thing done well so Peter I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.129" end="00:04:39.490" style="s2">gonna connect you with her Orville s I</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.409" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">was actually writing the email before I</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.490" end="00:04:44.080" style="s2">had to jump onto this those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:45.849" style="s2">things need to be cross fertilized</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.080" end="00:04:47.470" style="s2">yesterday I was on a call with Benita</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.849" end="00:04:48.879" style="s2">Roy and she has a group called the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.470" end="00:04:51.280" style="s2">radical of who&#39;s doing their own</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.879" end="00:04:52.630" style="s2">variation on the theme and my</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.280" end="00:04:54.699" style="s2">conversation with Norah she was pointing</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.630" end="00:04:56.349" style="s2">out the way that Sweden is responding to</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.699" end="00:04:58.750" style="s2">what&#39;s happening which is on its own</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.349" end="00:05:01.750" style="s2">knife&#39;s edge and there&#39;s a shared</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.750" end="00:05:03.069" style="s2">sensibility that we&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.750" end="00:05:05.710" style="s2">something that is in many ways best</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.069" end="00:05:07.930" style="s2">grasped not at the at the physical level</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.710" end="00:05:10.090" style="s2">but actually at the mythopoetic level at</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.930" end="00:05:12.819" style="s2">the level of you know the way artists</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.090" end="00:05:13.960" style="s2">relate to reality and that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.819" end="00:05:17.259" style="s2">something that&#39;s going on there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.960" end="00:05:20.169" style="s2">something where there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.259" end="00:05:22.690" style="s2">something so like almost how would I say</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.169" end="00:05:24.930" style="s2">it well I&#39;ll just say perfect about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.690" end="00:05:28.599" style="s2">nature of how this crisis is unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.930" end="00:05:31.810" style="s2">that is shaking out the particularity of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.599" end="00:05:34.060" style="s2">cultures and the way that the the dark</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.810" end="00:05:38.139" style="s2">shadow aspects of the Swedish culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.060" end="00:05:41.289" style="s2">for example cannot help but become rise</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.139" end="00:05:46.020" style="s2">to the surface switching back to the US</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.289" end="00:05:48.969" style="s2">of A it&#39;s sort of almost funny that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.020" end="00:05:51.639" style="s2">sort of the robber baron archetype that</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.969" end="00:05:55.990" style="s2">is so much woven into the fabric of the</p>

<p begin="00:06:01.180" end="00:06:06.310" style="s2">degree to which they are endeavoring to</p>

<p begin="00:06:06.310" end="00:06:10.120" style="s2">even be clever about it they have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.960" end="00:06:11.650" style="s2">come up and stand on stage and say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.120" end="00:06:13.449" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna blow through four trillion</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.650" end="00:06:14.889" style="s2">dollars in the next 48 hours and by the</p>

<p begin="00:12:03.110" end="00:12:06.050" style="s2">just not say we all certainly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.820" end="00:12:08.480" style="s2">what I think has been the case for a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.050" end="00:12:09.860" style="s2">long time that this structure this</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.480" end="00:12:11.720" style="s2">architecture that was actually very</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.860" end="00:12:13.850" style="s2">effective at doing certain things in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.720" end="00:12:16.430" style="s2">middle of the 20th century probably</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.850" end="00:12:19.960" style="s2">peaked in the late 70s has been engaging</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.430" end="00:12:23.510" style="s2">an increasingly delusional and manic</p>

<p begin="00:12:23.510" end="00:12:28.910" style="s2">relevance but it was obsolete a long</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.300" end="00:12:31.100" style="s2">time ago and to the best extent possible</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.910" end="00:12:33.620" style="s2">if we can use this crisis in this meta</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.100" end="00:12:37.010" style="s2">crisis to forces to move from</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.620" end="00:12:40.120" style="s2">complacency and addiction into something</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.010" end="00:12:43.070" style="s2">like a new form of agency it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.120" end="00:12:44.750" style="s2">very very good thing the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.070" end="00:12:47.089" style="s2">course is if we do that in piecemeal and</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.750" end="00:12:49.130" style="s2">it is not a way to find some coherence</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.089" end="00:12:50.510" style="s2">in that movement and smaller groups</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.130" end="00:12:55.460" style="s2">begin to pull against each other that</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.510" end="00:12:58.279" style="s2">creates an enormous new form of crisis</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.460" end="00:12:59.660" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a that&#39;s what I&#39;ve got my</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.279" end="00:13:01.850" style="s2">eyes on right now to be perfectly frank</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.660" end="00:13:04.580" style="s2">there&#39;s a crisis that emerges when</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.850" end="00:13:06.650" style="s2">people begin to decohere and begin to</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.580" end="00:13:08.810" style="s2">start to find new ways of coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.650" end="00:13:10.550" style="s2">whether that in those new ways are able</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.810" end="00:13:11.810" style="s2">to hold together in anything they could</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.550" end="00:13:13.670" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason why there couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.810" end="00:13:15.850" style="s2">amazing but it&#39;s not clear that they</p>

<p begin="00:13:17.740" end="00:13:23.200" style="s2">active which would be focusing on now so</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.430" end="00:13:25.750" style="s2">if you have a question for Jordan write</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.200" end="00:13:27.250" style="s2">it down in the chat and I&#39;ll ask him a</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.750" end="00:13:28.930" style="s2">question right now and then I&#39;ll read</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.250" end="00:13:31.260" style="s2">out your questions or I&#39;ll call you on</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.930" end="00:13:33.490" style="s2">you to ask it to Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.260" end="00:13:37.480" style="s2">so to circle back to that campfire</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.490" end="00:13:39.370" style="s2">analogy John came in yesterday I had a</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.480" end="00:13:41.290" style="s2">session here he talked about how the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.370" end="00:13:45.250" style="s2">campfire sword like a proto religious</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.290" end="00:13:47.290" style="s2">space and and I&#39;m feeling sort of like a</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.250" end="00:13:49.000" style="s2">churchly vibe in the stole on the last</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.290" end="00:13:51.430" style="s2">like eight sessions I&#39;ve done especially</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.000" end="00:13:54.250" style="s2">with like when I&#39;m using more of the we</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.430" end="00:13:56.050" style="s2">space tech and the frame I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.250" end="00:13:58.230" style="s2">hold over this whole project is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.050" end="00:14:00.940" style="s2">I think Jim rut called it the proto B</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.230" end="00:14:03.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like this space is designed to fail</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.940" end="00:14:05.020" style="s2">in the game a sense and you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.640" end="00:14:07.330" style="s2">all these other people are like doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.020" end="00:14:09.310" style="s2">similar type like things and projects</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.330" end="00:14:12.580" style="s2">and so I guess what is your advice or</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.310" end="00:14:14.500" style="s2">recommendation to the hold the frame in</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.580" end="00:14:16.770" style="s2">the space in order to be maximally</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.500" end="00:14:19.090" style="s2">collaborative during this these times</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.770" end="00:14:20.500" style="s2">well I don&#39;t know how many people have</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.090" end="00:14:22.180" style="s2">been watching the conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.500" end="00:14:23.620" style="s2">John and I have been having but one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.180" end="00:14:25.480" style="s2">the things that I think is coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.620" end="00:14:27.820" style="s2">that I really appreciate is the rescuing</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.480" end="00:14:31.030" style="s2">of the recovery the archaeological</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.820" end="00:14:33.460" style="s2">resuscitation of concepts and terms and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.030" end="00:14:36.220" style="s2">you just mentioned Church Lee so I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.460" end="00:14:38.710" style="s2">it&#39;s let&#39;s be clear when church is not</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.220" end="00:14:40.420" style="s2">the building the churches the people it</p>

<p begin="00:15:12.760" end="00:15:15.400" style="s2">not sure that we actually need to use</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.750" end="00:15:19.600" style="s2">any of the language this sort of Jim and</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.400" end="00:15:21.640" style="s2">I have sort of hacked with poor tools</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.600" end="00:15:23.620" style="s2">out of the conceptual environment it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.640" end="00:15:26.640" style="s2">not named game B let&#39;s just do it and be</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.620" end="00:15:29.290" style="s2">the people that are acting in that way</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.640" end="00:15:31.480" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to be telling stories we</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.290" end="00:15:36.639" style="s2">need to be enacting them living them</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.480" end="00:15:38.740" style="s2">and now is a very good time for it Joe</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.639" end="00:15:40.779" style="s2">asked this question of John last night</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.740" end="00:15:42.639" style="s2">he wanted to ask it to you again so Joe</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.779" end="00:15:45.459" style="s2">if you can put yourself off mutant ask</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.639" end="00:15:47.829" style="s2">Jordan sure thanks for doing this Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.459" end="00:15:51.220" style="s2">uh like Peter said I asked this question</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.829" end="00:15:53.380" style="s2">to Johnny v yesterday on a campfire call</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.220" end="00:15:54.639" style="s2">it was pretty highly resonant with what</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.380" end="00:15:57.070" style="s2">you were saying at the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.639" end="00:15:59.769" style="s2">talk so I&#39;ll just ask it I wrote in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.070" end="00:16:02.050" style="s2">eyes of regular people the people who</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.769" end="00:16:04.329" style="s2">are in the positions of strategic</p>

<p begin="00:16:04.329" end="00:16:09.040" style="s2">government of Education what have you</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.100" end="00:16:11.829" style="s2">they seem to be locked into some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.040" end="00:16:13.269" style="s2">game a fundamentalism and have been you</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.829" end="00:16:16.769" style="s2">know for many decades which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.269" end="00:16:21.670" style="s2">essentially the whole blue church idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.769" end="00:16:23.440" style="s2">does the game B crowd seeing the people</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.670" end="00:16:26.350" style="s2">who are working on this project sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.440" end="00:16:29.709" style="s2">behind the scenes have a concrete plan</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.350" end="00:16:31.870" style="s2">for simply nudging these people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.709" end="00:16:34.000" style="s2">direction making or these people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.870" end="00:16:36.970" style="s2">decision making and sort of transforming</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.000" end="00:16:40.089" style="s2">from nudging to sort of transforming the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.970" end="00:16:40.930" style="s2">framework entirely because like from</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.089" end="00:16:43.209" style="s2">what you&#39;ve written</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.930" end="00:16:45.910" style="s2">start at the individual upgrade your</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.209" end="00:16:49.440" style="s2">sovereignty upgrade your your integrity</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.910" end="00:16:54.370" style="s2">and sort of let it scale from there but</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.440" end="00:16:56.940" style="s2">you know from plebeian like myself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.370" end="00:16:59.110" style="s2">like well what more can I do</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.940" end="00:17:00.610" style="s2">so are you asking the question of how</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.110" end="00:17:02.199" style="s2">can I get President Trump to change this</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.610" end="00:17:05.530" style="s2">framework omastar ask them questions I</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.199" end="00:17:07.929" style="s2">get Joe Rivera to be effective I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.530" end="00:17:10.209" style="s2">you&#39;ve made it pretty clear in your</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.929" end="00:17:12.850" style="s2">talks and the things you wrote how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.209" end="00:17:17.589" style="s2">make Joe are very effective but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.850" end="00:17:20.500" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know how that scales up aha</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.589" end="00:17:22.900" style="s2">all right in some sense the scales</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.500" end="00:17:25.089" style="s2">sideways but let&#39;s let&#39;s pause for a bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.900" end="00:17:27.309" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s two big moves that</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.089" end="00:17:30.130" style="s2">are going on in terms of that question</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.309" end="00:17:31.120" style="s2">as far as I can tell one thing is to</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.130" end="00:17:33.940" style="s2">recognize that you can ever change</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.120" end="00:17:37.630" style="s2">anybody&#39;s mind and every endeavor you do</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.940" end="00:17:39.130" style="s2">so actually hardens it okay great now</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.630" end="00:17:43.280" style="s2">what you can do is you can be of service</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.130" end="00:17:45.170" style="s2">you can tell the truth and you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.280" end="00:17:46.550" style="s2">interact with humility I&#39;m here to help</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.170" end="00:17:47.750" style="s2">if you were interested here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.550" end="00:17:50.870" style="s2">perspective and by the way I&#39;m probably</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.750" end="00:17:52.610" style="s2">as out of touch and blindsided and</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.870" end="00:17:55.540" style="s2">bullshitting myself as anybody else and</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.610" end="00:17:58.130" style="s2">it&#39;s just trying to be of service now</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.540" end="00:17:59.810" style="s2">there&#39;s another thing this is this other</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.130" end="00:18:01.820" style="s2">things really really big and it has to</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.810" end="00:18:05.900" style="s2">do with something like what&#39;s the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.820" end="00:18:07.280" style="s2">where attention goes energy flows one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.900" end="00:18:09.230" style="s2">the phrases that came into my head last</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.280" end="00:18:11.600" style="s2">night was the calculus of cowardice I</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.230" end="00:18:13.940" style="s2">think this is a big illness that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.600" end="00:18:15.200" style="s2">suffer from Erik Weinstein is I think</p>

<p begin="00:20:00.260" end="00:20:03.890" style="s2">one piece and the reason I bring that up</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.540" end="00:20:05.000" style="s2">is this thing I wrote on my Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.890" end="00:20:07.040" style="s2">page about the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.000" end="00:20:08.690" style="s2">peacetime and wartime one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.040" end="00:20:10.400" style="s2">that we know happens is that during</p>

<p begin="00:20:10.400" end="00:20:14.600" style="s2">crisis where choices have real</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.320" end="00:20:16.610" style="s2">consequences and when the implications</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.600" end="00:20:18.710" style="s2">of those choices can be felt quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.610" end="00:20:21.320" style="s2">in a very visceral salient fashion</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.710" end="00:20:23.330" style="s2">there&#39;s an opportunity to select against</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.320" end="00:20:24.830" style="s2">cowards and to reselect for heroes and</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.330" end="00:20:26.030" style="s2">heroes and leadership can be at any</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.830" end="00:20:28.190" style="s2">level and in any way and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.030" end="00:20:30.410" style="s2">happening all over the place right down</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.190" end="00:20:32.780" style="s2">in those into those emergency rooms</p>

<p begin="00:20:32.780" end="00:20:37.610" style="s2">suits that have trash bags and go right</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.370" end="00:20:39.080" style="s2">back into the into the frontlines so</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.610" end="00:20:40.549" style="s2">that&#39;s one piece right collectively if</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.080" end="00:20:42.559" style="s2">we simply begin to make that choice and</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.549" end="00:20:44.299" style="s2">begin to orient in that way and select</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.559" end="00:20:45.830" style="s2">against cowardice and select for heroism</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.299" end="00:20:49.760" style="s2">then individuals who are sitting right</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.830" end="00:20:52.340" style="s2">next to the levers of power can begin to</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.760" end="00:20:53.929" style="s2">find ways in themselves to either step</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.340" end="00:20:56.570" style="s2">into that not the person who can make</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.929" end="00:20:59.809" style="s2">good choices for the commonweal can find</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.570" end="00:21:01.100" style="s2">themselves in power to do so and also of</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.809" end="00:21:04.070" style="s2">course the individuals who won&#39;t you may</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.100" end="00:21:07.309" style="s2">find themselves shamed or best rode out</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.070" end="00:21:08.840" style="s2">on a rail now how do then we the people</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.309" end="00:21:10.040" style="s2">step into it whoops I&#39;m going to close</p>

<p begin="00:21:17.419" end="00:21:22.160" style="s2">superficially how many people are in</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.400" end="00:21:25.790" style="s2">this call right now about 30 or 40 maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.160" end="00:21:26.870" style="s2">50 37 look I have digital technology</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.790" end="00:21:29.929" style="s2">telling me exactly the number don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:21:32.900" end="00:21:35.780" style="s2">many of those need to be done stochastic</p>

<p begin="00:21:42.230" end="00:21:45.350" style="s2">good at it and start figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.820" end="00:21:47.540" style="s2">flow that in a period of two or three</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.350" end="00:21:49.370" style="s2">weeks we will have in fact developed the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.540" end="00:21:51.800" style="s2">capacity to begin to move back into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.370" end="00:21:53.870" style="s2">meshwork of human interrelationships in</p>

<p begin="00:21:56.780" end="00:22:00.530" style="s2">we find ways of finding those people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.400" end="00:22:03.170" style="s2">are most salient and resonant with most</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.530" end="00:22:04.400" style="s2">our values and our sensibilities but we</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.170" end="00:22:06.020" style="s2">can also do that in a way that has a</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.400" end="00:22:07.520" style="s2">meshwork connection so we&#39;re not tribes</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.020" end="00:22:09.110" style="s2">standing next to each other with inside</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.520" end="00:22:11.060" style="s2">and outside but we&#39;re actually finding</p>

<p begin="00:22:28.850" end="00:22:32.300" style="s2">the answer to the question there is no</p>

<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:48.380" style="s2">and to get better as practitioners I</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.430" end="00:22:50.790" style="s2">mean imagine if I told you a story about</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.380" end="00:22:52.770" style="s2">what a jazz van looked like</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.790" end="00:22:53.910" style="s2">until you start fucking playing music</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.770" end="00:22:54.960" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna really get it but once</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.910" end="00:22:56.490" style="s2">you get it and start feeling what the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.960" end="00:23:00.020" style="s2">group feels like it suddenly becomes</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.490" end="00:23:00.020" style="s2">quite obvious and that&#39;s where we are</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.049" end="00:23:07.179" style="s2">all right so we have a lot of questions</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.940" end="00:23:10.480" style="s2">coming in I think would be good to start</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.179" end="00:23:12.370" style="s2">with Amy&#39;s because it&#39;s pretty practical</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.480" end="00:23:15.270" style="s2">on the ground level so Amy if you could</p>

<p begin="00:23:29.740" end="00:23:38.290" style="s2">you think has shown the best response</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.230" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">thus far and why it&#39;s actually a super</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.290" end="00:23:41.890" style="s2">super interesting question because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:43.570" style="s2">actually hard to know what best means</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.890" end="00:23:44.770" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually hard to know</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.570" end="00:23:48.760" style="s2">exactly what it is we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.770" end="00:23:52.500" style="s2">now in terms of inhibiting the rollout</p>

<p begin="00:32:55.870" end="00:33:01.000" style="s2">in the meta crisis and I&#39;ve recently</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.060" end="00:33:04.330" style="s2">read a lot of them Jungian thinkers like</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.000" end="00:33:07.120" style="s2">Robert Wise iron John comes to mind and</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.330" end="00:33:09.520" style="s2">where they diagnosed the crisis of</p>

<p begin="00:33:09.520" end="00:33:14.830" style="s2">rituals from boyhood to manhood so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.280" end="00:33:19.150" style="s2">wondering if you have any suggestions on</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.830" end="00:33:20.950" style="s2">how Gen X or little men can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.150" end="00:33:22.990" style="s2">build that framework for the young</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.950" end="00:33:24.510" style="s2">generation I guess another way of</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.990" end="00:33:28.620" style="s2">putting it is how can you bring</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.510" end="00:33:32.980" style="s2">teenagers into the campfire that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.620" end="00:33:34.540" style="s2">really good question that&#39;s a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.980" end="00:33:36.070" style="s2">and I liked what you actually named it</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.540" end="00:33:37.330" style="s2">in terms of Gen X Millennials and</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.070" end="00:33:39.070" style="s2">teenagers right because it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.330" end="00:33:40.470" style="s2">about the phases of life that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.070" end="00:33:43.280" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.470" end="00:33:43.280" style="s2">he&#39;ll do this</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.899" end="00:33:51.080" style="s2">you&#39;re on mute 31 31 how many kids you</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.379" end="00:33:52.279" style="s2">got I don&#39;t have kids right so you and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.080" end="00:33:54.320" style="s2">are sort of somewhat the different</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.279" end="00:33:55.519" style="s2">positions in terms of the this arc of</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.320" end="00:33:57.619" style="s2">life and there&#39;s a couple of folks here</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.519" end="00:33:59.950" style="s2">look like they&#39;re you know my senior and</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.619" end="00:34:02.659" style="s2">pop a couple folks maybe your junior</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.950" end="00:34:04.039" style="s2">then man oh man it sure is the case that</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.659" end="00:34:06.830" style="s2">we dropped the ball on that isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.039" end="00:34:09.020" style="s2">like to the degree to which we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.830" end="00:34:11.179" style="s2">just not initiate people into adulthood</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.020" end="00:34:12.679" style="s2">we sort of did exactly opposite in every</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.179" end="00:34:15.139" style="s2">possible way so we&#39;ve got a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.679" end="00:34:17.990" style="s2">catching up to do and I got to really</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.139" end="00:34:19.279" style="s2">say I have a bad feeling and I apologize</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.990" end="00:34:21.520" style="s2">for that bad feeling but I have a bad</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.279" end="00:34:27.340" style="s2">feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.520" end="00:34:29.409" style="s2">my elders they&#39;re the ones who had an</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.340" end="00:34:31.890" style="s2">opportunity to actually have what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.409" end="00:34:34.210" style="s2">called intergenerational transmission</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.890" end="00:34:36.250" style="s2">but for whatever reason chose to step</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.210" end="00:34:39.300" style="s2">away from that and did not rebuild it in</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.250" end="00:34:42.700" style="s2">a new way Delius to it to my awareness</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.300" end="00:34:44.500" style="s2">so we&#39;re kind of happy to go inside we</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.700" end="00:34:45.580" style="s2">can&#39;t rely on rituals or traditions that</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.500" end="00:34:47.050" style="s2">been handed down to us because whenever</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.580" end="00:34:48.580" style="s2">originals traditions were handed down to</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.050" end="00:34:50.620" style="s2">us or other handed down and dropped and</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.580" end="00:34:52.120" style="s2">left behind or so out of place that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.620" end="00:34:53.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to use them while now we</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.120" end="00:34:55.300" style="s2">can recover stuff from from older</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.760" end="00:34:56.409" style="s2">environments and there&#39;s actually some</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.300" end="00:34:58.990" style="s2">pretty good stuff out there that other</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.409" end="00:35:03.340" style="s2">cultures still do and use but we should</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.990" end="00:35:04.900" style="s2">be careful not to simulate and I use I</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.340" end="00:35:07.270" style="s2">oftentimes refer to the folks who wear</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.900" end="00:35:10.240" style="s2">way too many feathers I mean I think you</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.270" end="00:35:12.820" style="s2">know who I&#39;m talking about I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.240" end="00:35:14.170" style="s2">call that a certain simulation but there</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.820" end="00:35:15.430" style="s2">are lots of good things that exist in</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.170" end="00:35:16.510" style="s2">lots of cultures around the world that</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.430" end="00:35:18.940" style="s2">understand how to do this thing well</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.510" end="00:35:21.340" style="s2">what I would say is that here&#39;s more or</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.940" end="00:35:24.340" style="s2">less than nature the beasts each of us</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.340" end="00:35:26.590" style="s2">has kind of cohorts the Boomers the Xers</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.340" end="00:35:28.750" style="s2">the Millennials and Gen Z have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.590" end="00:35:30.550" style="s2">like a generational crisis that has to</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.750" end="00:35:34.360" style="s2">do with something like the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.550" end="00:35:35.590" style="s2">that we have to get over to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.360" end="00:35:37.840" style="s2">the boomers have to get over and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.590" end="00:35:40.270" style="s2">just gonna call it narcissism and it has</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.840" end="00:35:41.950" style="s2">to do with something like I mean can we</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.270" end="00:35:44.290" style="s2">look for Frank when they were young they</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.950" end="00:35:46.690" style="s2">were golden children right and</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.290" end="00:35:47.890" style="s2">everything whether they is individuals I</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.690" end="00:35:49.300" style="s2">think everybody&#39;s an individual their</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.890" end="00:35:51.700" style="s2">life arc as individuals quite diverse</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.300" end="00:35:53.320" style="s2">but as a generation things kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.700" end="00:35:55.150" style="s2">worked out they have an embodied sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.320" end="00:35:56.530" style="s2">of things kind of working out but now</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.150" end="00:35:58.030" style="s2">they&#39;re into life and by the way with</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.530" end="00:35:59.020" style="s2">this virus that may be closed into life</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.030" end="00:36:01.780" style="s2">and they maybe thought they were going</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.020" end="00:36:03.910" style="s2">to be and it&#39;s the ability to turn their</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.780" end="00:36:06.250" style="s2">attention towards what is in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.910" end="00:36:09.160" style="s2">legacy of their generation to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.250" end="00:36:13.870" style="s2">that they probably don&#39;t have a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.160" end="00:36:15.880" style="s2">the terms of let&#39;s call it know-how</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.870" end="00:36:17.200" style="s2">to say their expertise is expertise</p>

<p begin="00:40:11.680" end="00:40:15.970" style="s2">in my wife for example as she digs</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.900" end="00:40:18.280" style="s2">deeper and deeper and deeper into</p>

<p begin="00:42:40.359" end="00:42:43.340" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of an interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.050" end="00:42:44.930" style="s2">isn&#39;t it because you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.340" end="00:42:46.160" style="s2">bootstrap yourself into that because the</p>

<p begin="00:42:50.060" end="00:42:54.859" style="s2">noticed not just be very upfront we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.119" end="00:42:58.100" style="s2">a my particular family situation has a</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.859" end="00:42:59.750" style="s2">very odd circumstance which is that my</p>

<p begin="00:42:59.750" end="00:43:05.390" style="s2">and we got some interesting data back on</p>

<p begin="00:43:05.390" end="00:43:10.490" style="s2">makes things would say challenging to</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.880" end="00:43:12.380" style="s2">deal with and so as I was doing like</p>

<p begin="00:43:16.310" end="00:43:23.390" style="s2">I noticed the desire to bullshit myself</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.570" end="00:43:26.750" style="s2">I noticed the desire as I&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.390" end="00:43:28.700" style="s2">reading scientific papers to uproot the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.750" end="00:43:29.810" style="s2">ones that made me feel better and down</p>

<p begin="00:43:29.810" end="00:43:33.920" style="s2">worse that&#39;s a pretty simple thing if</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.390" end="00:43:36.500" style="s2">you built the capacity to just be</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.920" end="00:43:38.840" style="s2">metacognitive to be aware of that</p>

<p begin="00:43:38.840" end="00:43:43.670" style="s2">tell I can kind of notice to myself</p>

<p begin="00:43:45.530" end="00:43:50.090" style="s2">that sophisticated if you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.500" end="00:43:51.260" style="s2">get outside of it and allow yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.090" end="00:43:52.430" style="s2">just be aware of the fact that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.260" end="00:43:54.200" style="s2">bullshit just going to be working</p>

<p begin="00:43:54.200" end="00:43:57.980" style="s2">have a mindfulness of oh oh</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.850" end="00:44:00.440" style="s2">yep there it is it&#39;s showing-up there I</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.980" end="00:44:01.520" style="s2">think that&#39;s pretty helpful you know I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:44:04.160" end="00:44:07.550" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly the place where you</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.330" end="00:44:09.200" style="s2">create a blind spot so it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.550" end="00:44:10.910" style="s2">like just recognize they just have to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.200" end="00:44:12.920" style="s2">in it and try to be listening and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.910" end="00:44:14.720" style="s2">how about think a lot of self</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.920" end="00:44:16.160" style="s2">forgiveness and humility humility is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.720" end="00:44:17.210" style="s2">key that humility really helps in the</p>

<p begin="00:44:17.210" end="00:44:21.140" style="s2">yourself to become self righteous then</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.370" end="00:44:22.430" style="s2">allow yourself to become right you</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.140" end="00:44:23.540" style="s2">actually just really allow yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.430" end="00:44:24.860" style="s2">kind of be in the middle of it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.540" end="00:44:26.570" style="s2">looking and trying to do your best</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.860" end="00:44:30.620" style="s2">that creates a smoother surface it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.570" end="00:44:32.810" style="s2">harder for the bullshit to stick so</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.620" end="00:44:34.130" style="s2">myself by the way I also resort back to</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.810" end="00:44:35.240" style="s2">a lot of the tools and techniques that</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.130" end="00:44:36.650" style="s2">I&#39;ve been working on for the past five</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.240" end="00:44:38.450" style="s2">or six years middle of these store of</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.650" end="00:44:40.130" style="s2">practices or Buddhist practices or</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.450" end="00:44:43.070" style="s2">Taoist practice and just take a timeout</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.130" end="00:44:45.470" style="s2">ground yourself and go out into nature</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.070" end="00:44:46.940" style="s2">I&#39;d go at least two hours a day I try to</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.470" end="00:44:48.290" style="s2">be as barefoot and these days since I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.940" end="00:44:51.140" style="s2">out and the Texas Dilek aren&#39;t you naked</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.290" end="00:44:52.550" style="s2">in the in the you know in the flowers</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.140" end="00:44:55.190" style="s2">the fields of flowers and just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.550" end="00:44:56.270" style="s2">allow nature to flow and tune in out</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.190" end="00:44:59.030" style="s2">everything and just listen to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.270" end="00:45:00.920" style="s2">going on and that creates space it</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.030" end="00:45:03.140" style="s2">creates gaps it doesn&#39;t let the ego mind</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.920" end="00:45:04.760" style="s2">and the limbic system to kind of narrow</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.140" end="00:45:05.180" style="s2">your visibility when it fears the mind</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.760" end="00:45:06.860" style="s2">killer</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.180" end="00:45:09.590" style="s2">this is sort of like grounding as the</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.860" end="00:45:10.760" style="s2">mind releaser stuff like that I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.590" end="00:45:13.080" style="s2">those are good things and frankly this</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.760" end="00:45:14.610" style="s2">is very powerful and I find that</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.080" end="00:45:15.810" style="s2">then too much of my time focused on</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.610" end="00:45:18.060" style="s2">trying to address things that you might</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.810" end="00:45:19.410" style="s2">consider to be tactical and I can notice</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.060" end="00:45:23.700" style="s2">upon reflection that I actually get very</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.410" end="00:45:25.590" style="s2">locked into a sort of an optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.700" end="00:45:27.390" style="s2">framework for moving sense-making into</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.590" end="00:45:29.519" style="s2">action</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.390" end="00:45:31.289" style="s2">how that feels because you have to use a</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.519" end="00:45:32.700" style="s2">lot of sense making and you want to move</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.289" end="00:45:34.859" style="s2">from a liminal space to an effective</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.700" end="00:45:38.010" style="s2">space alright so how do you actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.859" end="00:45:39.180" style="s2">move back and forth closing and open and</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.010" end="00:45:41.519" style="s2">closing and opening and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.180" end="00:45:43.710" style="s2">breathing and breathing out and using</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.519" end="00:45:45.569" style="s2">nature and using people and using bodies</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.710" end="00:45:48.480" style="s2">to be able to support you in that</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.569" end="00:45:50.789" style="s2">movement and then I guess there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.480" end="00:45:53.420" style="s2">last one which is hopefully by this</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.789" end="00:46:01.769" style="s2">point you know what your addictions are</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.420" end="00:46:04.349" style="s2">don&#39;t do that be very careful mmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.769" end="00:46:07.950" style="s2">it&#39;s the circle back that Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.349" end="00:46:09.869" style="s2">Peterson and he was my therapist for for</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.950" end="00:46:11.640" style="s2">two years before he became famous and we</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.869" end="00:46:13.440" style="s2">talked a lot about Millennials and</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.640" end="00:46:16.079" style="s2">masculinity and during that time I</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.440" end="00:46:18.510" style="s2">developed this kind of aggressive debate</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.079" end="00:46:20.220" style="s2">debate modality that kept our bullshit</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.510" end="00:46:21.869" style="s2">in check which you know Peterson helped</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.220" end="00:46:24.180" style="s2">boost that signal so I might return that</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.869" end="00:46:28.500" style="s2">to the the stoah could be helpful during</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.180" end="00:46:32.940" style="s2">these these times knowing you had a</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.500" end="00:46:34.799" style="s2">question sure this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.940" end="00:46:36.930" style="s2">potentially more tactical so I hope you</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.799" end="00:46:40.410" style="s2">do answer in a less tactical way that</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.930" end="00:46:43.079" style="s2">may be appropriate so my sense is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.410" end="00:46:46.230" style="s2">if you have this mesh type of structure</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.079" end="00:46:47.759" style="s2">building not everything obviously when</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.230" end="00:46:52.859" style="s2">you have individual responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.759" end="00:46:54.480" style="s2">grab bottom-up responsibility we you</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.859" end="00:46:57.210" style="s2">know nobody can control anybody at a</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.480" end="00:46:58.859" style="s2">certain distance and people may be</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.210" end="00:47:01.079" style="s2">inclined towards many many different</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.859" end="00:47:03.930" style="s2">interpretations and many different ways</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.079" end="00:47:07.109" style="s2">of dealing with what&#39;s in front of them</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.930" end="00:47:09.779" style="s2">and some of those may feel to them right</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.109" end="00:47:11.609" style="s2">and good and it may not be and it may in</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.779" end="00:47:13.259" style="s2">fact get pathological and they may be</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.609" end="00:47:16.109" style="s2">taking shortcuts and the incentives may</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.259" end="00:47:18.480" style="s2">be there to do things in ways that I</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.109" end="00:47:21.509" style="s2">mean if they become us a force that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.480" end="00:47:24.750" style="s2">that&#39;s destructive so how do you</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.509" end="00:47:27.779" style="s2">communicate across different domains so</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.750" end="00:47:29.789" style="s2">that we can that&#39;s people that can</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.779" end="00:47:33.559" style="s2">influence things in a way that creates</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.789" end="00:47:36.690" style="s2">more space creates more pause and</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.559" end="00:47:38.460" style="s2">ultimately ultimately more of a game be</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.690" end="00:47:41.530" style="s2">I guess answer we&#39;re more of a game B</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.460" end="00:47:44.060" style="s2">outcome well</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.530" end="00:47:45.440" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s funny cuz you said that to go</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.060" end="00:47:46.760" style="s2">by can&#39;t I help but actually just go up</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.440" end="00:47:49.460" style="s2">to sort of morning Direction principles</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.760" end="00:47:52.010" style="s2">well here&#39;s my sense here&#39;s my sense of</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.460" end="00:47:54.110" style="s2">it it&#39;s funny because I&#39;m about to</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.010" end="00:47:56.240" style="s2">reveal with my own personal addictions</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.110" end="00:47:58.700" style="s2">but I found myself watching episode 2 of</p>

<p begin="00:51:35.640" end="00:51:38.339" style="s2">to do is take that data run it in</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.109" end="00:51:40.200" style="s2">through all three of these note that</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.339" end="00:51:41.759" style="s2">they&#39;re probably all all wrong but at</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.200" end="00:51:44.609" style="s2">least I get some to be a perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.759" end="00:51:46.140" style="s2">it and it&#39;s not worth our time to go</p>

<p begin="00:51:46.140" end="00:51:54.329" style="s2">would say is and I say this more or less</p>
