<p begin="00:04:27.680" end="00:04:30.639" style="s2">review the turning</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.720" end="00:04:40.160" style="s2">so i&#39;m trying to i think i&#39;m just maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">a little bit more over here</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.160" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">so 45 degrees inhale</p>

<p begin="00:05:07.280" end="00:05:14.080" style="s2">and then they turn even more</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">i think it&#39;s actually yeah so here</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.080" end="00:05:19.840" style="s2">and then even more a little</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">past 45 degrees in fact as you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:05:42.160" end="00:05:46.479" style="s2">like so for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.280" end="00:05:46.479" style="s2">it&#39;s here heel to toe</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.800" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">okay so now we&#39;re going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.720" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">how we turn</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.400" end="00:05:58.639" style="s2">so first of all i&#39;ll show you straight</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.800" end="00:06:01.840" style="s2">on how we turn</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.639" end="00:06:02.960" style="s2">so i just want to keep on my mark sorry</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.840" end="00:06:04.880" style="s2">i have to keep checking</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.960" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">make sure you&#39;re not losing my feet all</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.880" end="00:06:09.039" style="s2">right so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:11.360" style="s2">i want to end with this foot forward my</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.039" end="00:06:14.319" style="s2">right foot</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:15.919" style="s2">and then i pull this back and i pivot</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.319" end="00:06:18.479" style="s2">and see how my weight is all back</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.919" end="00:06:19.199" style="s2">also do this side on my weight comes</p>

<p begin="00:06:22.880" end="00:06:27.440" style="s2">okay and then i pivot even more as i</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.600" end="00:06:29.280" style="s2">shift my weight from my left to my right</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.440" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">and then i bring this foot up and over</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.280" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">and i go forward</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.840" end="00:06:38.720" style="s2">okay so what does that</p>

<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:53.919" style="s2">last time and i said only do it with one</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.759" end="00:06:55.680" style="s2">foot i&#39;m showing you both ways now</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.919" end="00:06:59.520" style="s2">but if this foot is forward my left foot</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">is bored i come back and i pivot</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.520" end="00:07:07.039" style="s2">and then up and over okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:10.400" style="s2">so let&#39;s just do the turning here</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.039" end="00:07:14.840" style="s2">here here</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.400" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">and back pivot</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.840" end="00:07:22.880" style="s2">here back</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.639" end="00:07:26.479" style="s2">pivot here</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.880" end="00:07:29.840" style="s2">back pivot</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.479" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">stop okay now let&#39;s put the walking and</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.840" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">the turnings together</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.199" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">so exhale</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.479" end="00:07:52.560" style="s2">this way i&#39;m going to turn this way</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.120" end="00:07:55.680" style="s2">because i&#39;m running out of space</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.560" end="00:08:00.560" style="s2">so back pivot</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.680" end="00:08:00.560" style="s2">up and over again</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.479" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">and pivot this way because i&#39;m running</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">out of space</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.680" end="00:08:26.160" style="s2">so always inhale right</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.599" end="00:08:28.240" style="s2">as you&#39;re drawing in always exhale as</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:30.879" style="s2">you&#39;d be expressing force</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.240" end="00:08:30.879" style="s2">going forward</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.759" end="00:08:35.360" style="s2">so here i&#39;m inhale although i&#39;m bringing</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.599" end="00:08:35.760" style="s2">this leg up because no weight&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.360" end="00:08:37.919" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.760" end="00:08:40.080" style="s2">i&#39;m actually drawing everything into my</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.919" end="00:08:43.519" style="s2">right hip so that&#39;s why i&#39;m inhaling</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:45.919" style="s2">and then exhaling like you put force</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.519" end="00:08:45.919" style="s2">into that</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.640" end="00:08:52.839" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.920" end="00:08:54.160" style="s2">that&#39;s the foot movement that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.839" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">breathing</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.160" end="00:08:57.200" style="s2">what are you doing with your mind well</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.399" end="00:09:00.560" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.200" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">trying to make the sensations in your</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.560" end="00:09:06.560" style="s2">dantean</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">right here so like as if you were doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.560" end="00:09:10.480" style="s2">the pasta you&#39;re here you&#39;re following</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:12.880" style="s2">your breath</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.480" end="00:09:14.560" style="s2">because the movements are tied to your</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.880" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">breath</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:21.600" style="s2">and you&#39;re also right</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:23.200" style="s2">i&#39;m also aware i&#39;m meditating on</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.600" end="00:09:25.760" style="s2">you you already know how to do this but</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.200" end="00:09:26.560" style="s2">i&#39;m not not only meditating on my breath</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.760" end="00:09:29.279" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.560" end="00:09:30.880" style="s2">i&#39;m meditating on the centeredness and</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.279" end="00:09:33.920" style="s2">rootedness</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.880" end="00:09:36.720" style="s2">i&#39;m really making them focal in in my</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.920" end="00:09:37.680" style="s2">walking meditation so that while i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.720" end="00:09:40.000" style="s2">moving</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.680" end="00:09:41.360" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to keep that sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.000" end="00:09:44.000" style="s2">centered and rooted</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.360" end="00:09:45.200" style="s2">so i&#39;m focusing obviously on the walking</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.000" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.200" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">i&#39;m focusing on my breath because the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.800" end="00:09:52.160" style="s2">breath is timed</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:54.240" style="s2">with this steps and i&#39;m my meditative</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:54.640" style="s2">focus is also on my center around my</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.240" end="00:09:56.480" style="s2">root</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.640" end="00:09:58.000" style="s2">now that that&#39;s a lot more than normal i</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.480" end="00:10:00.959" style="s2">get that and that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:02.000" style="s2">but those four will be very soon very</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.959" end="00:10:03.839" style="s2">integrated together</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.000" end="00:10:05.760" style="s2">because when you&#39;re moving in this</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.839" end="00:10:08.160" style="s2">fashion</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.760" end="00:10:09.519" style="s2">right when you&#39;re moving in this fashion</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.160" end="00:10:11.760" style="s2">being centered and rooted</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.519" end="00:10:14.079" style="s2">is natural to it and so you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.760" end="00:10:16.160" style="s2">feeling the center and the root</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.079" end="00:10:17.200" style="s2">that contact all the way down the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.160" end="00:10:19.600" style="s2">centeredness</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.200" end="00:10:20.959" style="s2">and then you breathe it and i&#39;m feeling</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.600" end="00:10:23.920" style="s2">the center and the root</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.959" end="00:10:26.240" style="s2">throughout and i&#39;m following my breath</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.920" end="00:10:29.040" style="s2">because the breath is timed</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.240" end="00:10:29.040" style="s2">with the movement</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.160" end="00:10:33.600" style="s2">okay everyone i will review all of this</p>

<p begin="00:24:49.440" end="00:24:52.960" style="s2">helpful for speeding things up a bit i</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.000" end="00:24:56.480" style="s2">still think that</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.960" end="00:24:59.279" style="s2">the three lines of uh looking at</p>

<p begin="00:25:05.039" end="00:25:08.640" style="s2">uh open up more space view</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.440" end="00:25:13.279" style="s2">i&#39;m assuming that what you mean is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.200" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of too much time</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.279" end="00:25:17.200" style="s2">and so in order to open up space so that</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:17.840" style="s2">more of your practice is for other</p>
