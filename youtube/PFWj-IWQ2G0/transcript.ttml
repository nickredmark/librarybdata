<p begin="00:00:07.450" end="00:00:13.300" style="s2">and are newing paradoxes are an</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.450" end="00:00:16.330" style="s2">indication that something about what we</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.300" end="00:00:17.680" style="s2">think we know is off okay</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.330" end="00:00:20.110" style="s2">that&#39;s why things appear to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.680" end="00:00:21.820" style="s2">incompatible yeah the universe has to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.110" end="00:00:23.199" style="s2">compatible everything and it simply does</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.820" end="00:00:25.359" style="s2">exist and because everything in it</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.199" end="00:00:27.820" style="s2">exists at the same time it all gets</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.359" end="00:00:29.830" style="s2">along in some way so if some set of</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.820" end="00:00:32.140" style="s2">facts doesn&#39;t seem to be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.830" end="00:00:34.120" style="s2">reconciled that means that something</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.140" end="00:00:35.620" style="s2">within the set of assumptions that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.120" end="00:00:37.180" style="s2">using to process them or the set of</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.620" end="00:00:40.269" style="s2">facts that we think we know to be true</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.180" end="00:00:42.250" style="s2">is actually not right when something</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.269" end="00:00:44.290" style="s2">tells you that there is a missing piece</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.250" end="00:00:46.420" style="s2">of knowledge most people&#39;s reaction to</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.290" end="00:00:48.400" style="s2">that is darn I wish we weren&#39;t missing</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.420" end="00:00:50.229" style="s2">knowledge but the right reaction if you</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.400" end="00:00:52.900" style="s2">want to discover new things is well</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.229" end="00:00:54.580" style="s2">here&#39;s one that we can detect is missing</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.900" end="00:00:56.110" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what it is but if we could</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.580" end="00:00:58.299" style="s2">figure out what it is who knows what</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.110" end="00:01:00.100" style="s2">might flow from it the fact that we get</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.299" end="00:01:02.260" style="s2">headaches tell us that something is</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.100" end="00:01:03.159" style="s2">being reported to our brain but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.260" end="00:01:06.159" style="s2">no reason that anything should be</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.159" end="00:01:08.290" style="s2">imported that doesn&#39;t have that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.159" end="00:01:10.930" style="s2">change your course of action in some way</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.290" end="00:01:14.440" style="s2">that would have benefited an ancestor so</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.930" end="00:01:17.230" style="s2">it is mysterious why we would have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.440" end="00:01:20.530" style="s2">kind of pain that not only doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.230" end="00:01:22.720" style="s2">inform us of something useful to do but</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.530" end="00:01:24.010" style="s2">it debilitates us a headache we&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.720" end="00:01:25.390" style="s2">you out you might have something that</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.010" end="00:01:27.220" style="s2">you could do that you can&#39;t do because</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.390" end="00:01:29.350" style="s2">you can&#39;t do it while you got ahead so</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.220" end="00:01:30.130" style="s2">that&#39;s hobbling that&#39;s obviously bad for</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.350" end="00:01:31.810" style="s2">you from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.130" end="00:01:35.170" style="s2">accomplishing whatever it is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.810" end="00:01:39.880" style="s2">built to do so why would a system have</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.170" end="00:01:40.900" style="s2">no useful output when you have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.880" end="00:01:45.360" style="s2">headache you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.900" end="00:01:46.659" style="s2">supposed to do about it but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.360" end="00:01:49.780" style="s2">debilitate us</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.659" end="00:01:53.350" style="s2">that&#39;s a paradoxical thing and so my</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.780" end="00:01:55.390" style="s2">contention is that in fact there is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.350" end="00:01:56.950" style="s2">utility to the information that we get</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.390" end="00:01:59.680" style="s2">from headaches and that it&#39;s a bit lost</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.950" end="00:02:01.780" style="s2">in the modern firemen so let me go</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.680" end="00:02:03.640" style="s2">through an example where pain works in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.780" end="00:02:06.280" style="s2">normal fashion so if people can see what</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.640" end="00:02:09.619" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to map</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.280" end="00:02:11.090" style="s2">imagine the iconic situation where</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.619" end="00:02:14.450" style="s2">you&#39;ve touched something that&#39;s too hot</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.090" end="00:02:16.819" style="s2">on the stove and you feel pain and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.450" end="00:02:18.140" style="s2">causes you to withdraw your hand I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.819" end="00:02:20.300" style="s2">draw in your hand you limit the amount</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.140" end="00:02:22.310" style="s2">of damage that you do to the tissue of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.300" end="00:02:24.319" style="s2">your hand so the pain had a value in</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.310" end="00:02:26.870" style="s2">that it reduced the amount of burning</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.319" end="00:02:28.220" style="s2">the pain is a secondary value in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.870" end="00:02:29.629" style="s2">sense that if you didn&#39;t pull your hand</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.220" end="00:02:32.569" style="s2">away in time and you have actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.629" end="00:02:33.890" style="s2">burned some tissue the pain will get you</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.569" end="00:02:36.440" style="s2">to protect that tissue so it has a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.890" end="00:02:39.980" style="s2">chance but then it has a third value</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.440" end="00:02:42.590" style="s2">which is it will cause you to learn that</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.980" end="00:02:44.569" style="s2">things sitting on the stove may be more</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.590" end="00:02:46.790" style="s2">dangerous than those objects for you to</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.569" end="00:02:49.579" style="s2">see them sitting somewhere else and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.790" end="00:02:51.230" style="s2">presumably you don&#39;t have to learn this</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.579" end="00:02:52.700" style="s2">lesson each time but you start to</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.230" end="00:02:54.170" style="s2">recognize the danger on the stove and</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.700" end="00:02:56.269" style="s2">burn yourselves very much less</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.170" end="00:02:59.150" style="s2">frequently and pain has served an</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.269" end="00:03:02.750" style="s2">adaptive function in that laughing so my</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.150" end="00:03:04.340" style="s2">contention with with headaches and in</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.750" end="00:03:09.709" style="s2">particular with migraine headaches is</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.340" end="00:03:12.739" style="s2">that they are an indicator of some sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.709" end="00:03:15.590" style="s2">of internal measurement of damage so</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.739" end="00:03:18.049" style="s2">imagine for example that an ancestor</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.590" end="00:03:20.870" style="s2">maybe a hunter-gatherer that was part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.049" end="00:03:24.370" style="s2">a migrant band moved at some point in</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.870" end="00:03:26.389" style="s2">the year to a particular waterhole and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.370" end="00:03:28.880" style="s2">let&#39;s say that that source of water</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.389" end="00:03:30.319" style="s2">tasted good enough because there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.880" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">nothing decaying in it that made it</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.319" end="00:03:35.510" style="s2">dangerous and it was safe in that way</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:37.970" style="s2">but maybe it has heavy metal</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.510" end="00:03:41.660" style="s2">concentrations that result in cellular</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.970" end="00:03:46.880" style="s2">damage when when you you drink enough of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.660" end="00:03:47.810" style="s2">it well if such damage triggered a</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.880" end="00:03:49.790" style="s2">headache</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.810" end="00:03:52.310" style="s2">an ancestor would be very likely to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.790" end="00:03:54.709" style="s2">detect the pattern that is to say at</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.310" end="00:03:56.840" style="s2">every point in the year where the group</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.709" end="00:03:59.329" style="s2">moves from one water source to another</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.840" end="00:04:02.840" style="s2">headaches begin many people experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.329" end="00:04:03.980" style="s2">them people who for whatever reason have</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.840" end="00:04:07.239" style="s2">drunk from a different water source</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.980" end="00:04:10.700" style="s2">might not get them and then when people</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.239" end="00:04:12.609" style="s2">went away for a hunting trip the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.700" end="00:04:16.970" style="s2">headaches might vanish so there would be</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.609" end="00:04:19.230" style="s2">pattern observable in the distribution</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.970" end="00:04:21.540" style="s2">of headaches across the population and</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.230" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">and over time and that would very likely</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.540" end="00:04:27.090" style="s2">be detectable it could be mediated</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:29.520" style="s2">through something like cytokines which</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.090" end="00:04:32.370" style="s2">are molecules that are internally</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.520" end="00:04:34.050" style="s2">generated when certain kinds of stress</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.370" end="00:04:36.180" style="s2">and damage are experienced but it</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.050" end="00:04:37.650" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be the hypothesis is</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.180" end="00:04:41.310" style="s2">simply that those headaches are an</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.650" end="00:04:44.370" style="s2">indicator of some kind of harm that can</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.310" end="00:04:46.020" style="s2">be mitigated if a person is driven to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.370" end="00:04:49.350" style="s2">modify their behavior so as not to</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.020" end="00:04:51.750" style="s2">encounter the stimulus imagine though</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.350" end="00:04:54.390" style="s2">that in our circumstance you&#39;re for</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.750" end="00:04:56.250" style="s2">whatever reasons sensitive to broccoli</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.390" end="00:04:59.010" style="s2">let&#39;s say that you have an allergy to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.250" end="00:05:01.650" style="s2">broccoli and that it is a trigger for</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.010" end="00:05:05.220" style="s2">migraines for you well you might not</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.650" end="00:05:07.740" style="s2">detect that because in our circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.220" end="00:05:08.990" style="s2">even though broccoli grows you know in</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.740" end="00:05:11.730" style="s2">the spring</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.990" end="00:05:13.440" style="s2">broccoli is available year-round because</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.730" end="00:05:15.330" style="s2">the supermarket sources it from other</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.440" end="00:05:17.220" style="s2">places and make sure that you have it</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.330" end="00:05:19.080" style="s2">have it available for cooking and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.220" end="00:05:20.610" style="s2">what that means is that the patterns</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.080" end="00:05:22.620" style="s2">that would be detectable to an ancestor</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.610" end="00:05:26.370" style="s2">get lost in our circumstance in the</p>

<p begin="00:05:26.370" end="00:05:30.090" style="s2">seeing them in general so one if one</p>

<p begin="00:05:30.090" end="00:05:34.860" style="s2">to go through a very deliberate process</p>
