<p begin="00:00:03.890" end="00:00:11.160" style="s2">Friday&#39;s idea cafe today we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.950" end="00:00:16.460" style="s2">about the year 2030 what does your</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.160" end="00:00:16.460" style="s2">project look like anyone want to start</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.550" end="00:00:26.119" style="s2">today right yeah I just started looking</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.090" end="00:00:29.580" style="s2">at this a little bit ahead of time I</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.119" end="00:00:31.560" style="s2">guess it&#39;s hard to say how fast the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.580" end="00:00:34.790" style="s2">adoption would be so let&#39;s look at</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.560" end="00:00:34.790" style="s2">best-case scenario</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.300" end="00:00:39.809" style="s2">yeah I&#39;d really pull off onto a drew if</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.010" end="00:00:42.000" style="s2">you have something already planned</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.809" end="00:00:43.530" style="s2">then go ahead but I could pontificate</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.000" end="00:00:44.670" style="s2">well no plan for this I mean I think you</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.530" end="00:00:46.079" style="s2">and I are probably in the same boat</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.670" end="00:00:48.180" style="s2">where it&#39;s like we&#39;ve planned it out to</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.079" end="00:00:50.370" style="s2">sort of see what it&#39;s like in her heads</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.180" end="00:00:53.489" style="s2">over time and there&#39;s a you know a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.370" end="00:00:56.129" style="s2">of different places it could go I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.489" end="00:00:58.559" style="s2">if we&#39;re talking hey hey Medusa</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.129" end="00:01:00.239" style="s2">talking like sort of big best-case</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.559" end="00:01:03.359" style="s2">scenario</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.239" end="00:01:06.990" style="s2">I mean odds are it would have definitely</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.359" end="00:01:09.090" style="s2">changed a couple elections that would</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.990" end="00:01:10.920" style="s2">sort of be the new like go-to place for</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.090" end="00:01:14.250" style="s2">a politician to set up their profile and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.920" end="00:01:18.869" style="s2">to communicate with their either actual</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.250" end="00:01:22.640" style="s2">constituents or potential ones it would</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.869" end="00:01:26.340" style="s2">have either replaced or gently nudged</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.640" end="00:01:27.750" style="s2">existing news sources into sort of being</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.340" end="00:01:29.490" style="s2">more transparent about their evidence</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.750" end="00:01:36.049" style="s2">and sort of making it a bit harder for</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.490" end="00:01:36.049" style="s2">them to just tell bold-faced lies um I</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.409" end="00:01:44.009" style="s2">mean there&#39;s so much oh just like day</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.820" end="00:01:47.549" style="s2">there pronounced I keep going but good</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.009" end="00:01:50.009" style="s2">good I could dive in so I I would like</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.549" end="00:01:54.090" style="s2">to see by 2030 and maybe reason score</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.009" end="00:01:57.899" style="s2">being used in something like ad riyals</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.090" end="00:02:00.990" style="s2">project so you know as as they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.899" end="00:02:02.280" style="s2">looking at us do science studies that</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.990" end="00:02:04.140" style="s2">comes out or people are having political</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.280" end="00:02:06.299" style="s2">debates that it would be one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.140" end="00:02:09.509" style="s2">resources you go to to group and</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.299" end="00:02:12.900" style="s2">categorize and assess the kind of facts</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.509" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">of the case it would be nice if goalie</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.900" end="00:02:15.960" style="s2">bought which</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:17.550" style="s2">kind of a personification of the system</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.960" end="00:02:20.700" style="s2">would be a place that people would link</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.550" end="00:02:22.530" style="s2">to to kind of like Snopes and politifact</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.700" end="00:02:26.370" style="s2">and i wish i could think of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.530" end="00:02:28.400" style="s2">conservative version of that but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.370" end="00:02:31.050" style="s2">I don&#39;t think they have a really good</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.400" end="00:02:32.730" style="s2">fact-checking site that leans that way</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.050" end="00:02:35.010" style="s2">although all the effects check sites are</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.730" end="00:02:37.470" style="s2">not supposed to be leaning but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.010" end="00:02:39.950" style="s2">perception of leaning so yeah kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.470" end="00:02:44.250" style="s2">have a community of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.950" end="00:02:48.660" style="s2">starting to categorize facts and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.250" end="00:02:52.880" style="s2">information in a holistic way and being</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.660" end="00:02:52.880" style="s2">and you know and sharing that content</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.230" end="00:02:59.880" style="s2">know in a hundred years I have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.160" end="00:03:05.459" style="s2">different thing so awesome they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.880" end="00:03:08.459" style="s2">next week next week to say 3020 that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.459" end="00:03:10.260" style="s2">thousand years 21:20 what is your</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.459" end="00:03:13.320" style="s2">project look like I&#39;m not here what</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.260" end="00:03:15.690" style="s2">would it look like for me in ten years</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.320" end="00:03:19.200" style="s2">stick with like solution raising in and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.690" end="00:03:21.390" style="s2">process raising I would love if we had a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:23.550" style="s2">site that anyone could come on to and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.390" end="00:03:26.580" style="s2">either start with an idea or start with</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.550" end="00:03:29.340" style="s2">a problem and a process to work through</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.580" end="00:03:31.320" style="s2">with ten thousand or more people so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.340" end="00:03:33.180" style="s2">solutions are from the ground up just</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.320" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">like we want to be part of the solution</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.180" end="00:03:37.350" style="s2">rather than trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:39.060" style="s2">the mass is want and trying to market it</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.350" end="00:03:43.769" style="s2">to them actually just recreating</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.060" end="00:03:45.090" style="s2">solutions and so I imagine that that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.769" end="00:03:48.090" style="s2">hopefully what I have going in a couple</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.090" end="00:03:50.040" style="s2">years and therefore we have we have done</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.090" end="00:03:53.940" style="s2">solution raisings and done this process</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.040" end="00:03:55.950" style="s2">on dozens and dozens of areas of life so</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.940" end="00:03:58.140" style="s2">we have an app that works for food and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.950" end="00:04:00.810" style="s2">maybe local community projects that work</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.140" end="00:04:02.430" style="s2">for hubs and anything that anyone can</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.810" end="00:04:04.680" style="s2">spark there&#39;s a way to go through</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.430" end="00:04:08.700" style="s2">through the process and we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.680" end="00:04:10.830" style="s2">relate we don&#39;t need to rely on outside</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.700" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">third parties solving things like we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.830" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">actually work through the process in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:17.760" style="s2">way that we want to be part of so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:19.820" style="s2">is what I would love to see I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.760" end="00:04:22.470" style="s2">see it a lot sooner than twenty thirty</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.820" end="00:04:24.950" style="s2">Matus what was your project look like in</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.470" end="00:04:24.950" style="s2">23</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.180" end="00:04:32.100" style="s2">ah ok so the thought was a question you</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.000" end="00:04:34.710" style="s2">could say oh it&#39;s camping I can meditate</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.100" end="00:04:36.780" style="s2">and then I have to reverse engineer what</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.710" end="00:04:42.539" style="s2">the question is</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.780" end="00:04:44.310" style="s2">so yeah what you said actually and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.539" end="00:04:48.889" style="s2">best scenario for my project would be to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.310" end="00:04:48.889" style="s2">be the application to do exactly this</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.160" end="00:04:56.660" style="s2">from now on yesterday I finally managed</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.039" end="00:05:04.979" style="s2">to get my VPS up and running so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.660" end="00:05:06.440" style="s2">first time I can actually show it almost</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.979" end="00:05:09.300" style="s2">because I still work on some</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.440" end="00:05:14.660" style="s2">configuration but in 10 years it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.300" end="00:05:20.099" style="s2">like the most popular mapping tool for</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.660" end="00:05:24.120" style="s2">solutions and blueprints and</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.099" end="00:05:32.910" style="s2">documentation about all things related</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.120" end="00:05:42.449" style="s2">to the things we talked about that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.910" end="00:05:46.500" style="s2">would be the ideal outcome right now all</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.449" end="00:05:48.300" style="s2">right the conversation in stay in 2030</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.500" end="00:05:51.360" style="s2">or time travel back and forth between</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.300" end="00:05:53.970" style="s2">2020 and 2030 maybe go back a few years</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.360" end="00:05:56.880" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a weird space to live in he</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.970" end="00:06:00.229" style="s2">said maybe we can go back to 2018 who</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.880" end="00:06:00.229" style="s2">would have thought that was simpler time</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.130" end="00:06:08.909" style="s2">Jubilee I was wondering on your picture</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.349" end="00:06:11.580" style="s2">do you see it as like being a 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.909" end="00:06:14.010" style="s2">people or is it like some 50,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.580" end="00:06:16.680" style="s2">that may choose to join a project or</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.010" end="00:06:20.460" style="s2">have you thought and I and I know you</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.680" end="00:06:22.080" style="s2">know you&#39;re not you&#39;re not determined to</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.460" end="00:06:24.060" style="s2">follow a specific path but I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.080" end="00:06:26.010" style="s2">wondering if you&#39;ve had that part of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.060" end="00:06:27.599" style="s2">vision yeah yeah I would definitely hope</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.010" end="00:06:30.060" style="s2">there&#39;s millions of people on the site</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.599" end="00:06:33.680" style="s2">but the idea is to create it so that it</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.060" end="00:06:33.680" style="s2">works if there&#39;s only 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.270" end="00:06:39.570" style="s2">that&#39;s all they need to connect their</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.169" end="00:06:43.020" style="s2">mic ok</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.570" end="00:06:44.220" style="s2">okay that&#39;s happening so so there might</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.020" end="00:06:45.900" style="s2">be a million people in there and someone</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.220" end="00:06:47.490" style="s2">says hey this is what I&#39;d like to do and</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.900" end="00:06:49.260" style="s2">the hope is that at least like for each</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.490" end="00:06:51.500" style="s2">of those projects some 10,000 would</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.260" end="00:06:54.330" style="s2">choose to participate in that solution</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.500" end="00:06:55.650" style="s2">yeah that there are 10,000 or more</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.330" end="00:06:58.170" style="s2">I mean we&#39;re hopefully coming up with a</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.650" end="00:06:59.580" style="s2">process that works for 10,000 people so</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.170" end="00:07:01.530" style="s2">it&#39;ll hopefully work for more it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.580" end="00:07:03.300" style="s2">the bar but yeah if I could go on any</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.530" end="00:07:05.910" style="s2">any problem in the world right instead</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.300" end="00:07:07.950" style="s2">of like someone ought to literally I</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.910" end="00:07:10.260" style="s2">could be the ought to like let&#39;s start a</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.950" end="00:07:11.550" style="s2">conversation see what comes out of it so</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.260" end="00:07:13.140" style="s2">there&#39;s something going on instead of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.550" end="00:07:14.670" style="s2">like leaving it up to the big other or</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.140" end="00:07:17.220" style="s2">taking it all on like okay I am a</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.670" end="00:07:19.050" style="s2">solution and then rolling it out how do</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.220" end="00:07:20.580" style="s2">do 10,000 people work through it and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.050" end="00:07:25.350" style="s2">then yes I imagine there is multiple</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.580" end="00:07:26.910" style="s2">projects I guess we could we could let</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.350" end="00:07:28.920" style="s2">shallow differential but I got a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.910" end="00:07:30.690" style="s2">question for Marty show and me get back</p>

<p begin="00:07:32.490" end="00:07:36.300" style="s2">looks like in 2030 I would love to hear</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.050" end="00:07:38.490" style="s2">the answer assuming it like started now</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.300" end="00:07:40.080" style="s2">at you guys all right I&#39;m having some</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.490" end="00:07:43.590" style="s2">technical difficulties so I&#39;ll check</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.080" end="00:07:43.950" style="s2">that all right all right thanks all</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.590" end="00:07:46.320" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.950" end="00:07:49.740" style="s2">what&#39;s your question for Mateus so much</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.320" end="00:07:51.210" style="s2">I was just so you mentioned your mapping</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.740" end="00:07:55.980" style="s2">software and we&#39;ve talked a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.210" end="00:07:59.850" style="s2">about it but is this a general mapping</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.980" end="00:08:01.320" style="s2">software like like the brains and all</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.850" end="00:08:07.020" style="s2">those other things or is there a</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.320" end="00:08:10.040" style="s2">specific kind of vertical that&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.020" end="00:08:13.500" style="s2">easy question to answer because I</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.040" end="00:08:18.180" style="s2">started stuff in two very different and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.500" end="00:08:22.200" style="s2">only after seeing all the mind mapping</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.180" end="00:08:26.520" style="s2">tools recently I realized that what I am</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.200" end="00:08:30.510" style="s2">doing is in fact some sort of general</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.520" end="00:08:35.669" style="s2">generalized mapping tool for not</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.510" end="00:08:46.200" style="s2">specifically going B but I my personal</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.669" end="00:08:49.770" style="s2">use for it something like babies never</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.200" end="00:08:52.899" style="s2">got the memo and this is like only their</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.770" end="00:08:57.459" style="s2">freedom of speech that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.899" end="00:09:00.430" style="s2">yeah so it is general but I would love</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.459" end="00:09:04.839" style="s2">to and I am doing that to map stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.430" end="00:09:07.510" style="s2">related to games okay I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.839" end="00:09:10.300" style="s2">mention also that in the canonical</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.510" end="00:09:13.690" style="s2">debate group it&#39;s a mapping software</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.300" end="00:09:15.820" style="s2">specifically for debating but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.690" end="00:09:18.220" style="s2">several people joining from other debate</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.820" end="00:09:22.329" style="s2">groups like there&#39;s Jerry&#39;s from Jerry&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.220" end="00:09:24.010" style="s2">brain in that group now so you might</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.329" end="00:09:26.410" style="s2">find that community an interesting one</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.010" end="00:09:28.089" style="s2">to hang out with just to see how the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.410" end="00:09:35.610" style="s2">debate tools are using mapping software</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.089" end="00:09:35.610" style="s2">so so it&#39;s the canonical debate lab oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.850" end="00:09:43.990" style="s2">oh it&#39;s a another group I&#39;m member with</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.579" end="00:09:46.180" style="s2">so canonical debate lab calm or you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.990" end="00:09:47.649" style="s2">just message me and I&#39;ll get you on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.180" end="00:09:50.019" style="s2">slack channel if you want to listen in</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.649" end="00:09:51.910" style="s2">or or whatever you might find that</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.019" end="00:09:54.430" style="s2">interesting as a specific vertical</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.910" end="00:10:02.589" style="s2">implementation of your tool might be</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.430" end="00:10:04.089" style="s2">interesting for debates then I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.589" end="00:10:06.130" style="s2">to know I want a question for Adriel</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.089" end="00:10:11.170" style="s2">because cuz I asked everyone else a</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.130" end="00:10:13.329" style="s2">question that I can&#39;t think of any does</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.170" end="00:10:18.940" style="s2">anyone want to hear my crazy diabolical</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.329" end="00:10:21.010" style="s2">hundred year plan yes okay I think the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.940" end="00:10:22.720" style="s2">the plan I&#39;m gonna you know when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.010" end="00:10:24.579" style="s2">when you&#39;re giving like your plant your</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.720" end="00:10:26.290" style="s2">your thoughts of what this tool could</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.579" end="00:10:29.560" style="s2">your tool and your project could be used</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.290" end="00:10:30.880" style="s2">for you you you have to decide how far</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.560" end="00:10:32.380" style="s2">down the path you&#39;re gonna get them</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.880" end="00:10:34.899" style="s2">because people think it&#39;s impossible and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.380" end="00:10:36.670" style="s2">it turns out the the initial nut of my</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.899" end="00:10:40.480" style="s2">idea is impossible</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.670" end="00:10:42.550" style="s2">so I don&#39;t usually get to go further but</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.480" end="00:10:45.760" style="s2">I was thinking if it works out and this</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.550" end="00:10:48.670" style="s2">is kind of how people come to a central</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.760" end="00:10:50.740" style="s2">understanding of what reality is what</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.670" end="00:10:52.180" style="s2">like what&#39;s real and what&#39;s true and one</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.740" end="00:10:53.410" style="s2">of the definitions of the word true</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.180" end="00:10:56.800" style="s2">meaning kind of what&#39;s the objective</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.410" end="00:10:59.110" style="s2">truth here on a specific narrow fact if</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.800" end="00:11:01.720" style="s2">that&#39;s all possible then I kind of hope</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.110" end="00:11:03.310" style="s2">that the decision-making process in</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.720" end="00:11:05.570" style="s2">governments and a lot of things we vote</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.310" end="00:11:07.310" style="s2">on today and</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.570" end="00:11:08.930" style="s2">things that the Congress people in</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.310" end="00:11:11.180" style="s2">Congress and Senate and the different</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.930" end="00:11:13.240" style="s2">you know most of the governments that</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.180" end="00:11:16.790" style="s2">will have some sort of legislative body</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.240" end="00:11:19.160" style="s2">that they would use this as a tool for</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.790" end="00:11:23.650" style="s2">making the decisions and also deciding</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.160" end="00:11:31.250" style="s2">what to do so someone would float this</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.650" end="00:11:35.840" style="s2">you know a a I can&#39;t a bill I have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.250" end="00:11:37.580" style="s2">think back to my classes on how</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.840" end="00:11:39.740" style="s2">government works but they&#39;d float a bill</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.580" end="00:11:42.200" style="s2">but the the whole United States an</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.740" end="00:11:43.340" style="s2">action for the US or actually anyone</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.200" end="00:11:45.170" style="s2">from around the world if they have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.340" end="00:11:46.940" style="s2">good idea to contribute to this since</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.170" end="00:11:49.250" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of fact-based as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.940" end="00:11:52.400" style="s2">just opinion and stuff that you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.250" end="00:11:54.380" style="s2">able to you know create legislation out</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.400" end="00:11:56.060" style="s2">in the wild and by the time it comes</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.380" end="00:11:57.440" style="s2">around you wouldn&#39;t even really have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.060" end="00:11:59.800" style="s2">have a vote because it&#39;d be obvious that</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.440" end="00:12:02.270" style="s2">this would be the right thing to do so</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.800" end="00:12:03.740" style="s2">you might still have the voting at that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.270" end="00:12:05.150" style="s2">point but maybe in a hundred years it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.740" end="00:12:06.710" style="s2">be like well this is the tool on how we</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.150" end="00:12:09.050" style="s2">make decisions and you still have</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.710" end="00:12:10.520" style="s2">elected officials to an extent that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.050" end="00:12:12.200" style="s2">need someone to make decisions and short</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.520" end="00:12:15.110" style="s2">term but for a long term legislation</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.200" end="00:12:17.150" style="s2">change it&#39;s really a group of its</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.110" end="00:12:19.610" style="s2">society using this tool or something</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.150" end="00:12:22.520" style="s2">similar it has this mathematical model</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.610" end="00:12:26.120" style="s2">in it using to decide how we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.520" end="00:12:31.700" style="s2">governed and that&#39;s just one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.120" end="00:12:33.140" style="s2">things yeah anyways but that&#39;s the crazy</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.700" end="00:12:36.530" style="s2">thing I don&#39;t normally talk about those</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.140" end="00:12:43.700" style="s2">people but they flip what call flipping</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.530" end="00:12:52.790" style="s2">the blow bozo bit sure that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.700" end="00:12:54.260" style="s2">supposed to not that&#39;s the weird thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.790" end="00:12:56.300" style="s2">about transformative technologies though</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.260" end="00:12:57.590" style="s2">right if you&#39;re explaining them before</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.300" end="00:12:59.600" style="s2">they happen they always sound stupid</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.590" end="00:12:59.900" style="s2">like if you went back in time and tried</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.600" end="00:13:01.880" style="s2">to explain</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.900" end="00:13:03.560" style="s2">Facebook or Amazon to someone be like</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.880" end="00:13:05.390" style="s2">there&#39;s no way you&#39;re gonna get a</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.560" end="00:13:09.020" style="s2">billion people using the same site like</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.390" end="00:13:11.150" style="s2">that&#39;s stupid yeah it turns out yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.020" end="00:13:12.770" style="s2">the thing that one must first project</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.150" end="00:13:14.390" style="s2">was oh we&#39;re gonna put people on Mars</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.770" end="00:13:17.450" style="s2">people would have been like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.390" end="00:13:19.619" style="s2">think so buddy right but now it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.450" end="00:13:25.449" style="s2">it&#39;s done the way they&#39;re you&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.619" end="00:13:27.369" style="s2">might do that like Bentley when you were</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.449" end="00:13:29.829" style="s2">first started your hundred year it</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.369" end="00:13:31.629" style="s2">brought up so in the Omega Group</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.829" end="00:13:32.769" style="s2">Wednesday conversation we&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.629" end="00:13:35.829" style="s2">really imagine seen emerging</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.769" end="00:13:37.689" style="s2">conversation about more of like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.829" end="00:13:39.100" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion or God</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.689" end="00:13:41.679" style="s2">that&#39;s not a God something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.100" end="00:13:43.600" style="s2">emerging from that space because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.679" end="00:13:46.839" style="s2">emerging from all of us individually and</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.600" end="00:13:48.279" style="s2">then it&#39;s like it&#39;s not am I crazy do</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.839" end="00:13:49.809" style="s2">you experience this the same way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.279" end="00:13:51.100" style="s2">like I can&#39;t come to my sanity and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.809" end="00:13:52.329" style="s2">pretty sure that&#39;s the same but I also</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.100" end="00:13:55.049" style="s2">understand it sounds crazy because</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.329" end="00:13:57.939" style="s2">everyone else does too there&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.049" end="00:13:59.439" style="s2">it&#39;s not a new religion everyone has to</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.939" end="00:14:01.149" style="s2">agree with it it&#39;s like we&#39;re on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.439" end="00:14:02.559" style="s2">like we&#39;re excavating something and</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.149" end="00:14:05.009" style="s2">discovery in something but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.559" end="00:14:08.470" style="s2">scientific like it can&#39;t really be</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.009" end="00:14:09.730" style="s2">reasoned or sense made but I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.470" end="00:14:11.199" style="s2">if you can do reason and sense making</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.730" end="00:14:13.569" style="s2">without it like I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.199" end="00:14:15.399" style="s2">can&#39;t honor we show up and say hey does</p>

<p begin="00:14:15.399" end="00:14:18.519" style="s2">doesn&#39;t right I don&#39;t need it to work</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.689" end="00:14:20.829" style="s2">it&#39;s not just gravity exists it&#39;s like a</p>

<p begin="00:14:20.829" end="00:14:27.189" style="s2">guys even play in that space for your</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.350" end="00:14:32.769" style="s2">projects so there&#39;s a group for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.189" end="00:14:34.689" style="s2">general that it&#39;s not a religion no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.769" end="00:14:37.299" style="s2">just it&#39;s an Omega cos Omega brutal</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.689" end="00:14:40.029" style="s2">converse we started the group in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.299" end="00:14:41.619" style="s2">fall to practice Omega roll and what has</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.029" end="00:14:43.059" style="s2">come out of that group is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.619" end="00:14:45.160" style="s2">talking about like our own personal</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.059" end="00:14:46.869" style="s2">lives like the magic God the universe</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.160" end="00:14:49.839" style="s2">whatever you call it that runs</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.869" end="00:14:51.790" style="s2">throughout it and the we venus of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.839" end="00:14:55.299" style="s2">indie game be space in the world but</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.790" end="00:14:58.600" style="s2">like there&#39;s an emergence that happens</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.299" end="00:15:00.699" style="s2">so yeah the way i think about all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.600" end="00:15:03.249" style="s2">that in relation to my project is my</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.699" end="00:15:06.220" style="s2">project is pretty much i guess right</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.249" end="00:15:10.660" style="s2">right brained it is very rational and</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.220" end="00:15:13.929" style="s2">logical and mathematical but it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.660" end="00:15:15.850" style="s2">simply a tool it&#39;s like a checkbook you</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.929" end="00:15:18.790" style="s2">know it&#39;s like an you know a bank</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.850" end="00:15:20.379" style="s2">account system it&#39;s it&#39;s just the place</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.790" end="00:15:23.199" style="s2">where you kind of keep track of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.379" end="00:15:25.509" style="s2">numbers and stuff like that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.199" end="00:15:29.110" style="s2">supposed to free us up so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.509" end="00:15:31.779" style="s2">then use this you know the skills and</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.110" end="00:15:33.100" style="s2">this wonderful brain that we have that</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.779" end="00:15:35.350" style="s2">can make leaps it</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.100" end="00:15:39.010" style="s2">logic things then that can communicate</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.350" end="00:15:43.600" style="s2">to other people and these and and touch</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.010" end="00:15:45.460" style="s2">other people in a way that so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.600" end="00:15:47.940" style="s2">kind of the generative function that</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.460" end="00:15:50.020" style="s2">type of conversation and that type of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.940" end="00:15:51.580" style="s2">feelings and emotion it&#39;s a jitter and</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.020" end="00:15:52.990" style="s2">of function and then when you want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.580" end="00:15:54.850" style="s2">actually put something in the world this</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.990" end="00:16:00.040" style="s2">kind of helps you get down to the atoms</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.850" end="00:16:02.290" style="s2">and the bits to make it happen so so my</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.040" end="00:16:03.940" style="s2">system does kind of stay out of that but</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.290" end="00:16:05.470" style="s2">it knows its boundaries so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.940" end="00:16:07.360" style="s2">going to say oh you shouldn&#39;t do that or</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.470" end="00:16:08.830" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t be emotional and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.360" end="00:16:10.690" style="s2">lot of ways that you can put emotion</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.830" end="00:16:12.430" style="s2">into the system because you can say well</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.690" end="00:16:14.520" style="s2">people feel this way or let&#39;s do a</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.430" end="00:16:17.650" style="s2">survey and all the people feel this way</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.520" end="00:16:19.420" style="s2">or this experience has happened and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.650" end="00:16:21.220" style="s2">you can use that in your logical</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.420" end="00:16:24.730" style="s2">reasoning on whether you should do it</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.220" end="00:16:27.910" style="s2">together as a community but so the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.730" end="00:16:32.650" style="s2">definitely not like an isolation of</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.910" end="00:16:36.900" style="s2">emotions but it is it is a tool - it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.650" end="00:16:36.900" style="s2">it is after kind of it&#39;s after that step</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.960" end="00:16:43.240" style="s2">but that&#39;s a very much needed part I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.560" end="00:16:45.340" style="s2">say that what the election does sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.240" end="00:16:47.350" style="s2">have some plans to handle something like</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.340" end="00:16:48.760" style="s2">that where it&#39;s not meant to be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.350" end="00:16:50.980" style="s2">cut and dry and this is true and false</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.760" end="00:16:52.720" style="s2">and that person is good and bad I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.980" end="00:16:55.420" style="s2">the true and false hopefully we can get</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.720" end="00:16:57.400" style="s2">there but the the good and bad a big</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.420" end="00:16:58.870" style="s2">part of is what the person values and</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.400" end="00:17:00.760" style="s2">one of the main things is that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.870" end="00:17:02.680" style="s2">trying to tell you what you to value is</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.760" end="00:17:04.180" style="s2">just trying to categorize things you</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.680" end="00:17:06.340" style="s2">tell it what you value and then it can</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.180" end="00:17:07.990" style="s2">say based on what you said you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.340" end="00:17:09.910" style="s2">here&#39;s what uh you know you should know</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.990" end="00:17:13.930" style="s2">about that person that organization this</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.910" end="00:17:16.110" style="s2">election whatever it is it&#39;s sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.930" end="00:17:18.400" style="s2">know shows you those things so if</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.110" end="00:17:19.930" style="s2">Bentley and I are both members but we</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.400" end="00:17:22.180" style="s2">have very different values we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.930" end="00:17:23.440" style="s2">see different information either even if</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.180" end="00:17:26.560" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at the same person we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.440" end="00:17:29.020" style="s2">gonna see you know different scores for</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.560" end="00:17:30.610" style="s2">different categories if we were both</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.020" end="00:17:34.480" style="s2">interested in the same category it</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.610" end="00:17:36.940" style="s2">should be the same score yeah so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.480" end="00:17:38.910" style="s2">sort of an attempt at it partially</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.940" end="00:17:41.170" style="s2">because a lot of people vote based on</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.910" end="00:17:42.880" style="s2">religion and emotion and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.170" end="00:17:44.800" style="s2">and so you&#39;re trying to come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.880" end="00:17:46.600" style="s2">system to help people vote you can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.800" end="00:17:48.640" style="s2">purely scientific</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.600" end="00:17:51.610" style="s2">in my mind because then leaves a whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.640" end="00:17:54.370" style="s2">swath of people out so there is some a</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.610" end="00:17:55.570" style="s2">little bit there there&#39;s something I</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.370" end="00:17:56.950" style="s2">don&#39;t know if anyone saw the thing I</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.570" end="00:17:58.630" style="s2">posted in gave me this week that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.950" end="00:18:01.270" style="s2">very game B but there was some reason I</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.630" end="00:18:02.530" style="s2">post it there of like the influencers</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.270" end="00:18:06.850" style="s2">the person trying to influence the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.530" end="00:18:08.470" style="s2">influencers No did you guys about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.850" end="00:18:12.039" style="s2">people that click on it okay so so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.470" end="00:18:13.870" style="s2">person had it had a fake a picture they</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.039" end="00:18:15.190" style="s2">had taken of them trying to be an</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.870" end="00:18:17.020" style="s2">influencer and they had it behind the</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.190" end="00:18:18.280" style="s2">screen and they had three privately</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.020" end="00:18:20.650" style="s2">pretty well-known influencers on</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.280" end="00:18:23.530" style="s2">Instagram I don&#39;t know them but and had</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.650" end="00:18:25.360" style="s2">them in this in this cafe taking with</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.530" end="00:18:27.010" style="s2">props a picture right they could go</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.360" end="00:18:29.590" style="s2">around and take any any picture and</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.010" end="00:18:30.789" style="s2">because of the subconscious thing he did</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.590" end="00:18:32.020" style="s2">in the beginning he the anyway he got</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.789" end="00:18:33.520" style="s2">them all they had hundreds of rolls on</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.020" end="00:18:35.350" style="s2">their film they all picked one all</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.520" end="00:18:36.940" style="s2">posted at the same time and then he</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.350" end="00:18:38.500" style="s2">basically said hey did you pick this</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.940" end="00:18:41.110" style="s2">prop did you pick this location</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.500" end="00:18:42.700" style="s2">me too and so he was showing so all</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.110" end="00:18:44.080" style="s2">three of them had the exact same prop</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.700" end="00:18:45.820" style="s2">they held it in front of their face they</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.080" end="00:18:48.669" style="s2">were on the exact same the same thing in</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.820" end="00:18:49.900" style="s2">the in the restaurant and they of course</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.669" end="00:18:52.390" style="s2">were like oh wait this was an original</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.900" end="00:18:55.169" style="s2">thought it clearly wasn&#39;t right and to</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.390" end="00:18:57.280" style="s2">me it made it more it like was was a</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.169" end="00:18:58.630" style="s2">bigger than if they had had the thought</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.280" end="00:18:59.860" style="s2">themselves that wasn&#39;t their thinking I</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.630" end="00:19:01.419" style="s2">thought they couldn&#39;t be influenced I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.860" end="00:19:03.309" style="s2">like the fact that you&#39;re an influencer</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.419" end="00:19:05.380" style="s2">on social media says of course you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.309" end="00:19:07.510" style="s2">be influenced but like there was</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.380" end="00:19:09.370" style="s2">something about like if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.510" end="00:19:12.610" style="s2">dealing with the magic behind the scenes</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.370" end="00:19:14.620" style="s2">or like that that subconscious bias of</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.610" end="00:19:16.030" style="s2">like that this just emerged right if he</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.620" end="00:19:17.799" style="s2">hadn&#39;t been he had that picture there</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.030" end="00:19:18.850" style="s2">and hadn&#39;t had that happen it still</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.799" end="00:19:20.500" style="s2">could have happened and they all would</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.850" end="00:19:21.880" style="s2">have posted it and then like you copied</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.500" end="00:19:24.940" style="s2">me know we all posted the exact same</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.880" end="00:19:27.010" style="s2">time like there&#39;s something about if</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.940" end="00:19:28.750" style="s2">we&#39;re not dealing with the emergent like</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.010" end="00:19:31.240" style="s2">the what can emerge in that space</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.750" end="00:19:33.010" style="s2">otherwise you have we can have a debate</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.240" end="00:19:34.750" style="s2">and we could maybe say who won and who</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.010" end="00:19:36.700" style="s2">didn&#39;t but if we&#39;re not owning what our</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.750" end="00:19:40.360" style="s2">emotions is behind it and what that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.700" end="00:19:42.100" style="s2">that&#39;s like I like anyway just like</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.360" end="00:19:46.390" style="s2">owning that it&#39;s there so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.100" end="00:19:48.940" style="s2">somewhat be discounted yeah and I just</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.390" end="00:19:51.760" style="s2">thought of something else on how my</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.940" end="00:19:53.409" style="s2">system kind of tangentially hits that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.760" end="00:19:56.799" style="s2">that a lot of times people are voting</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.409" end="00:19:58.270" style="s2">and making decisions and we feel like we</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.799" end="00:19:59.740" style="s2">know the reasons why and there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.270" end="00:20:03.250" style="s2">lost oh you&#39;re saying that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.740" end="00:20:04.960" style="s2">you tend to generate a story on why you</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.250" end="00:20:07.929" style="s2">came to that conclusion and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.960" end="00:20:10.539" style="s2">match usually really what the influence</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.929" end="00:20:12.940" style="s2">was and that seems crazy but they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.539" end="00:20:15.220" style="s2">done some really crazy studies showing</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.940" end="00:20:17.049" style="s2">that that that&#39;s kind of true that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.220" end="00:20:18.399" style="s2">the reason the logic the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.049" end="00:20:19.990" style="s2">someone said why they made a decision</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.399" end="00:20:22.570" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have happened because I set up</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.990" end="00:20:25.090" style="s2">the experiment in such a way it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.570" end="00:20:26.950" style="s2">really fascinating to see but what</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.090" end="00:20:29.380" style="s2">reason school kind of does is it it does</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.950" end="00:20:32.679" style="s2">help you kind of dig down into your</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.380" end="00:20:34.630" style="s2">reasons why no further than if someone</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.679" end="00:20:36.070" style="s2">challenges but two people were different</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.630" end="00:20:38.440" style="s2">that it does make you kind of think</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.070" end="00:20:41.590" style="s2">through why do I believe this is true or</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.440" end="00:20:46.049" style="s2">why do I want this to happen so I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.590" end="00:20:48.100" style="s2">it helps you explore those emotions</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.049" end="00:20:49.960" style="s2">because sometimes you just feel an</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.100" end="00:20:51.820" style="s2">affinity for this person you want them</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.960" end="00:20:55.360" style="s2">to win the election well what are the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.820" end="00:20:57.250" style="s2">real reasons why not saying that those</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.360" end="00:20:59.110" style="s2">reasons are right or wrong although when</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.250" end="00:21:01.600" style="s2">you when you actually ride them out and</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.110" end="00:21:05.200" style="s2">see them maybe you&#39;ll realize some of</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.600" end="00:21:07.380" style="s2">them are wrong but well yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.200" end="00:21:11.980" style="s2">another way that I think it helps people</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.380" end="00:21:13.720" style="s2">explore that space a little bit yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.980" end="00:21:15.309" style="s2">think that&#39;s good yeah but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.720" end="00:21:18.700" style="s2">people haven&#39;t have an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.309" end="00:21:20.649" style="s2">stance but nobody has an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.700" end="00:21:22.570" style="s2">stance right like you&#39;re gonna bring all</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.649" end="00:21:23.830" style="s2">of your emotion and bias into it but</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.570" end="00:21:26.049" style="s2">like your concept like this is the only</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.830" end="00:21:27.970" style="s2">conclusion you could come to and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.049" end="00:21:29.770" style="s2">came to the wrong one and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.970" end="00:21:31.090" style="s2">actually dealing with the debate because</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.770" end="00:21:33.039" style="s2">you&#39;re not owning that there&#39;s any of</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.090" end="00:21:35.590" style="s2">that piece there and I&#39;ve had a few of</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.039" end="00:21:37.929" style="s2">those conversations right yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.590" end="00:21:40.120" style="s2">what&#39;s great about the way reason score</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.929" end="00:21:43.299" style="s2">helps and I won&#39;t stay on my project too</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.120" end="00:21:45.130" style="s2">long but is that when the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.299" end="00:21:46.510" style="s2">end up kind of coming to a different</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.130" end="00:21:47.919" style="s2">stance than the other person is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.510" end="00:21:50.770" style="s2">some of them say something and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.919" end="00:21:52.899" style="s2">do what you just kind of though it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.770" end="00:21:54.370" style="s2">dismissed by the other side because</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.899" end="00:21:56.440" style="s2">they&#39;ll say they&#39;ll say this and so no I</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.370" end="00:21:57.880" style="s2">have like 50 facts that put that so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.440" end="00:21:59.620" style="s2">gonna just throw that away</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.880" end="00:22:01.240" style="s2">but in reason score when you put it in</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.620" end="00:22:03.700" style="s2">there it affects the score so they have</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.240" end="00:22:05.350" style="s2">to address that point directly as</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.700" end="00:22:07.600" style="s2">opposed to this kind of even not</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.350" end="00:22:08.770" style="s2">intentional dismissing but like I said a</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.600" end="00:22:10.240" style="s2">lot of times someone will throw five</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.770" end="00:22:13.480" style="s2">points at you and you only have time to</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.240" end="00:22:15.040" style="s2">address one or two so</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.480" end="00:22:17.169" style="s2">yeah having a system that kind of keeps</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.040" end="00:22:19.350" style="s2">track of the of where your discussion</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.169" end="00:22:22.750" style="s2">has been and the gaps that you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.350" end="00:22:26.790" style="s2">finished talking about I think also</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.750" end="00:22:26.790" style="s2">helps in in situations like yours</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.840" end="00:22:31.370" style="s2">ha ha I don&#39;t know what your tech is at</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.840" end="00:22:33.529" style="s2">the moment do you want to share what</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.370" end="00:22:37.519" style="s2">your division is or just one chime it</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.529" end="00:22:39.470" style="s2">like have an open conversation and as</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.519" end="00:22:46.240" style="s2">long as this works well I&#39;ll try to give</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.470" end="00:22:49.970" style="s2">my is it 10 years in the future yeah ok</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.240" end="00:22:53.059" style="s2">10 years in the future with my project</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.970" end="00:22:56.570" style="s2">idea would be that we would have mini</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.059" end="00:23:03.220" style="s2">hubs like community hubs across the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.570" end="00:23:06.499" style="s2">world and all of them working towards</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.220" end="00:23:08.600" style="s2">the greater good for the health and</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.499" end="00:23:10.730" style="s2">well-being of each individual in their</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.600" end="00:23:14.450" style="s2">community as well as the environment and</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.730" end="00:23:17.330" style="s2">we would have our meta currency system</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.450" end="00:23:19.490" style="s2">that would be valuing all the good that</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.330" end="00:23:21.730" style="s2">we&#39;re doing so we&#39;re kind of rebuilding</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.490" end="00:23:25.309" style="s2">all of our broken relationships</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.730" end="00:23:27.350" style="s2">localized but also globally so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.309" end="00:23:30.499" style="s2">working towards a kind of a unified</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.350" end="00:23:32.570" style="s2">humanity I mean all individuals able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.499" end="00:23:36.350" style="s2">have their own opinions or beliefs or</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.570" end="00:23:38.210" style="s2">whatnot but a way that we are unified so</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.350" end="00:23:39.860" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know we&#39;re going out into</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.210" end="00:23:42.259" style="s2">space and who knows what we&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.860" end="00:23:45.649" style="s2">next but if we&#39;re just a rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.259" end="00:23:48.289" style="s2">human existence that&#39;s pretty rough to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.649" end="00:23:51.049" style="s2">think of how great space can be in a new</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.289" end="00:23:53.929" style="s2">frontier but if we do have ways to unite</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.049" end="00:23:57.769" style="s2">that are supported by the community and</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.929" end="00:23:59.029" style="s2">there&#39;s like a bigger support system for</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.769" end="00:24:02.379" style="s2">people they don&#39;t really fall through</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.029" end="00:24:04.700" style="s2">the cracks we support one another&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.379" end="00:24:06.259" style="s2">needs if anybody has needs in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.700" end="00:24:08.869" style="s2">community they can come to their centers</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.259" end="00:24:10.309" style="s2">stay what their needs are people in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.869" end="00:24:11.799" style="s2">community that are available can help</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.309" end="00:24:14.119" style="s2">them you know if they need a new roof</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.799" end="00:24:16.129" style="s2">different things where money is less</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.119" end="00:24:20.289" style="s2">important but really what we&#39;re valuing</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.129" end="00:24:23.240" style="s2">is our interconnectedness and our</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.289" end="00:24:25.549" style="s2">ability to help each other out because</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.240" end="00:24:29.110" style="s2">it like raises our own well so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.549" end="00:24:32.090" style="s2">building this humanitarian wealth that</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.110" end="00:24:35.269" style="s2">permeates every aspect of humanity at</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.090" end="00:24:37.549" style="s2">the same time balances capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.269" end="00:24:39.890" style="s2">balances that power structures and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.549" end="00:24:48.530" style="s2">powerful without needing money</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.890" end="00:24:51.020" style="s2">because we&#39;re United so shadow is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.530" end="00:24:52.730" style="s2">I&#39;ve been hearing that it almost sounds</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.020" end="00:25:02.360" style="s2">like it&#39;s kind of like your local</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.730" end="00:25:04.940" style="s2">library except for it&#39;s kind of yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.360" end="00:25:06.170" style="s2">in a way it&#39;s a form of code governance</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.940" end="00:25:08.150" style="s2">like I know there&#39;s a lot of those Co</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.170" end="00:25:10.790" style="s2">governance wording going around in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.150" end="00:25:13.550" style="s2">world but in my mind when I thought of</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.790" end="00:25:18.040" style="s2">governance years ago it was like</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.550" end="00:25:20.600" style="s2">actually citizens governing in</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.040" end="00:25:23.990" style="s2">cooperation with our bigger government</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.600" end="00:25:26.720" style="s2">so that we were meeting each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.990" end="00:25:30.170" style="s2">needs on the ground level instead of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.720" end="00:25:31.490" style="s2">just trying to if we needed help from</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.170" end="00:25:33.410" style="s2">our government it&#39;s really hard to ask</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.490" end="00:25:34.850" style="s2">access just like right now people are</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.410" end="00:25:38.960" style="s2">really struggling but we already had</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.850" end="00:25:40.760" style="s2">this I guess in a way it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.960" end="00:25:42.050" style="s2">institution but it&#39;s not really an</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.760" end="00:25:44.120" style="s2">institution from the top it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.050" end="00:25:48.050" style="s2">institutions from the bottom so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.120" end="00:25:49.820" style="s2">like neutral centers like if we had hubs</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.050" end="00:25:53.090" style="s2">across the world that say they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.820" end="00:25:55.250" style="s2">like the Commons and it&#39;s a place for</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.090" end="00:25:58.040" style="s2">people to go like I could go and travel</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.250" end="00:26:00.440" style="s2">the world neck me through Commons</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.040" end="00:26:02.930" style="s2">instead of just the capitalist hotels</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.440" end="00:26:05.390" style="s2">and having that kind of experience you</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.930" end="00:26:07.340" style="s2">actually have like a really yes I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.390" end="00:26:10.900" style="s2">too deep wealth and deep experiences</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.340" end="00:26:10.900" style="s2">though yeah I don&#39;t wanna</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.710" end="00:26:18.650" style="s2">it sounds great just because you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.300" end="00:26:21.590" style="s2">started off your talk we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.650" end="00:26:22.760" style="s2">about space I couldn&#39;t help but think of</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.590" end="00:26:25.430" style="s2">sort of the difference between Star Wars</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.760" end="00:26:26.930" style="s2">and Star Trek like it&#39;s just Star Wars</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.430" end="00:26:29.090" style="s2">tends to be sort of very combative and</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.930" end="00:26:30.980" style="s2">there&#39;s the one group in charge and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.090" end="00:26:33.140" style="s2">Star Trek is very much sort of all going</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.980" end="00:26:34.610" style="s2">in the same direction like the I forget</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.140" end="00:26:39.220" style="s2">the names of everything but that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.610" end="00:26:39.220" style="s2">what came to mind when you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.799" end="00:26:46.559" style="s2">that sounds really nice I appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.470" end="00:26:46.559" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.010" end="00:26:58.280" style="s2">one of them longer okay please this cuz</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.630" end="00:27:00.470" style="s2">it happens in the political right versus</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.280" end="00:27:02.419" style="s2">left the right ends up being sorry the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.470" end="00:27:05.330" style="s2">right is kind of more United in the left</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.419" end="00:27:07.940" style="s2">is very fractured that because like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.330" end="00:27:10.340" style="s2">left&#39;s values are to change but to hold</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.940" end="00:27:12.530" style="s2">out like to hold values that we hope</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.340" end="00:27:14.299" style="s2">right not just a change for change sake</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.530" end="00:27:17.570" style="s2">but like we want progression we want</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.299" end="00:27:19.520" style="s2">less racism we want less but it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.570" end="00:27:20.990" style="s2">easier to be traditional right it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:27:20.990" end="00:27:25.250" style="s2">here and we can agree on this it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.880" end="00:27:26.960" style="s2">to agree when you&#39;re dispersing right</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.250" end="00:27:30.020" style="s2">like you&#39;re changing so there can change</p>

<p begin="00:27:30.020" end="00:27:33.890" style="s2">tension right now is hard to hold in</p>

<p begin="00:27:36.470" end="00:27:39.400" style="s2">figure out on new in solutions so we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.970" end="00:27:44.690" style="s2">all have our projects you create them</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.400" end="00:27:45.740" style="s2">there&#39;s something happening like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.690" end="00:27:47.780" style="s2">because I&#39;m talking about the political</p>

<p begin="00:27:47.780" end="00:27:51.470" style="s2">like world changing space of like again</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.850" end="00:27:55.100" style="s2">when I was a countering this week of</p>

<p begin="00:27:59.030" end="00:28:02.240" style="s2">else&#39;s I&#39;m like yeah what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.049" end="00:28:05.720" style="s2">solution well they come on board my idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.240" end="00:28:08.120" style="s2">like yeah exactly that&#39;s my solution I</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.720" end="00:28:14.900" style="s2">like that except with my idea instead of</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.120" end="00:28:16.909" style="s2">that person&#39;s idea but I think it</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.900" end="00:28:18.620" style="s2">happens in the political left of like oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.909" end="00:28:20.840" style="s2">no no but racism we just have to solve</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.620" end="00:28:22.640" style="s2">racism the like currency and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.840" end="00:28:24.650" style="s2">what about all of it right like can we</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.640" end="00:28:26.900" style="s2">hold our sovereignty you hold that they</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.650" end="00:28:31.520" style="s2">can be different and they&#39;re still an</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.900" end="00:28:34.220" style="s2">ally like there&#39;s still that I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.520" end="00:28:36.650" style="s2">that is the D main thing where the left</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.220" end="00:28:38.659" style="s2">will like JK Rowling is a great example</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.650" end="00:28:41.270" style="s2">right he gave ton of money like super</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.659" end="00:28:42.890" style="s2">philanthropic all the stuff said one bad</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.270" end="00:28:46.669" style="s2">thing about a trans person it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.890" end="00:28:48.289" style="s2">you&#39;re canceled forever and well and</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.669" end="00:28:49.640" style="s2">even then she&#39;s she&#39;s come out and does</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.289" end="00:28:53.809" style="s2">stuff that people have been happy about</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.640" end="00:28:55.280" style="s2">but like at what point are you willing</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.809" end="00:28:57.080" style="s2">to do that and it seems like the right</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.280" end="00:28:59.030" style="s2">is way more willing to forgive and like</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.080" end="00:29:01.309" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s why we still have enough in</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.030" end="00:29:02.900" style="s2">common come on over and the left as he</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.309" end="00:29:04.549" style="s2">said kinda tends to fracture it tends to</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.900" end="00:29:05.120" style="s2">be like well on the list of a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.549" end="00:29:08.990" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.120" end="00:29:10.010" style="s2">99 but that one sorry get out and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.990" end="00:29:12.170" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly getting a smaller</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.010" end="00:29:14.300" style="s2">smaller group I just watched the</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.170" end="00:29:16.520" style="s2">documentary you know safe spaces and</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.300" end="00:29:18.020" style="s2">that&#39;s basically a lot of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.520" end="00:29:19.880" style="s2">talking about is like that the left</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.020" end="00:29:21.559" style="s2">cannibalizes itself that it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.880" end="00:29:23.510" style="s2">know all these people that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.559" end="00:29:25.940" style="s2">protesting like ben shapiro and jordan</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.510" end="00:29:29.420" style="s2">Peterson are actually leftist right</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.940" end="00:29:35.330" style="s2">they&#39;re just not as leftist as you and</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.420" end="00:29:37.370" style="s2">so it&#39;s like more of complicity but then</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.330" end="00:29:40.190" style="s2">there&#39;s like more security on campus</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.370" end="00:29:42.110" style="s2">it&#39;s just like it&#39;s it&#39;s we&#39;re hurting</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.190" end="00:29:44.360" style="s2">ourselves but it&#39;s really hard to zoom</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.110" end="00:29:46.460" style="s2">out and be like am I also causing the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.360" end="00:29:48.710" style="s2">problem right because it&#39;s like I know</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.460" end="00:29:52.010" style="s2">I&#39;ve been in on it or it&#39;s like yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.710" end="00:29:53.929" style="s2">come on my project right like I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.010" end="00:29:55.790" style="s2">the solution and it&#39;s like I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.929" end="00:29:57.860" style="s2">think you can possibly open unless you</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.790" end="00:30:00.679" style="s2">can at least own that right like that</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.860" end="00:30:03.380" style="s2">that exists and like the babies of like</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.679" end="00:30:05.120" style="s2">wanting to control other people and am I</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.380" end="00:30:07.070" style="s2">trying to control other people or might</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.120" end="00:30:08.390" style="s2">try to offer them something am i trying</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.070" end="00:30:09.620" style="s2">to create a better world for me or right</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.390" end="00:30:13.760" style="s2">trying to control the world and</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.620" end="00:30:16.070" style="s2">constantly being in that dance how can I</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:18.260" style="s2">invite people to this how can without a</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.070" end="00:30:21.250" style="s2">force and I think you know I hope the</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.260" end="00:30:24.920" style="s2">solutions I think I have this mission</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.250" end="00:30:27.320" style="s2">and I think yeah one of the main kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.920" end="00:30:29.600" style="s2">solutions partial solutions to that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.320" end="00:30:31.970" style="s2">is this kind of take out the tech thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.600" end="00:30:34.010" style="s2">where we volunteer to help on each</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.970" end="00:30:37.490" style="s2">other&#39;s projects and we get feedback and</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.010" end="00:30:41.840" style="s2">stuff and then it hopes it&#39;s at some</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.490" end="00:30:43.730" style="s2">point you know if if we lose passion and</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.840" end="00:30:45.230" style="s2">one of our projects or find out it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.730" end="00:30:48.920" style="s2">gonna work then we can jump on another</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.230" end="00:30:50.420" style="s2">and start building up or just someone</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.920" end="00:30:57.440" style="s2">gets the ball rolling and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.420" end="00:30:58.910" style="s2">that so yeah yeah I am anyone who ends</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.440" end="00:31:00.230" style="s2">up watching this I think there is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.910" end="00:31:02.840" style="s2">point you get far enough along in this</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.230" end="00:31:05.570" style="s2">space but all that tension is still</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.840" end="00:31:07.670" style="s2">there you can see it and therefore you</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.570" end="00:31:09.350" style="s2">can start to see the emergence of okay I</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.670" end="00:31:11.570" style="s2">may be may be my solution as much as</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.350" end="00:31:12.830" style="s2">this is mine right now I&#39;m focused on it</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.570" end="00:31:15.860" style="s2">because I can&#39;t focus on the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.830" end="00:31:18.170" style="s2">it&#39;s not the solution and someone has it</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.860" end="00:31:18.890" style="s2">right like that us all winning is us</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.170" end="00:31:20.180" style="s2">winning like</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.890" end="00:31:22.850" style="s2">like it doesn&#39;t matter if it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.180" end="00:31:24.890" style="s2">me it doesn&#39;t matter that like and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.850" end="00:31:26.570" style="s2">I&#39;m still annoyed by other people saying</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.890" end="00:31:28.430" style="s2">what I just said right they&#39;re like wait</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.570" end="00:31:31.490" style="s2">no my is the umbrella on what you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.430" end="00:31:33.560" style="s2">even see how ironic that is and because</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.490" end="00:31:36.650" style="s2">they&#39;re not they&#39;re not there yet that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.560" end="00:31:39.380" style="s2">that&#39;s fine but that if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.650" end="00:31:40.790" style="s2">progression that you get there and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.380" end="00:31:43.580" style="s2">it breaks open in the most beautiful way</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.790" end="00:31:45.080" style="s2">it&#39;s still frustrating but I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.580" end="00:31:48.890" style="s2">like over that hill and it starts to</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.080" end="00:31:50.180" style="s2">come together or not it&#39;s why I&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.890" end="00:31:52.250" style="s2">of weird because that&#39;s kind of a hybrid</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.180" end="00:31:54.380" style="s2">of the like two sides with the ellipse</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.250" end="00:31:56.030" style="s2">and right where it&#39;s like here&#39;s my idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.380" end="00:31:57.500" style="s2">and they&#39;re sort of almost a purity</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.030" end="00:31:59.570" style="s2">involved with I trying to keep it close</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.500" end="00:32:00.980" style="s2">to its thing but then it&#39;s also it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.570" end="00:32:02.960" style="s2">fine the peanut agrees he&#39;ll come over</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.980" end="00:32:05.590" style="s2">still come over here at help and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.960" end="00:32:14.110" style="s2">all work on agreeing with me together</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.590" end="00:32:14.110" style="s2">yes I love it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.390" end="00:32:25.740" style="s2">I guess that is one of the strengths of</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.179" end="00:32:27.660" style="s2">this is that there&#39;s no real like</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.740" end="00:32:29.640" style="s2">there&#39;s no project owner for together</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.660" end="00:32:33.809" style="s2">tech or GME projects it&#39;s just everyone</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.640" end="00:32:35.340" style="s2">brought a project and that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.809" end="00:32:36.870" style="s2">separation and to me like that I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.340" end="00:32:38.460" style="s2">heard of anyone else doing that so like</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.870" end="00:32:39.690" style="s2">this is as far as I know the only Mehta</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.460" end="00:32:41.880" style="s2">project the only thing where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.690" end="00:32:45.710" style="s2">you know keep your project family you</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.880" end="00:32:49.860" style="s2">keep reason score Julie you keep the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.710" end="00:32:52.860" style="s2">whatever you&#39;re doing everyone keeps</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.860" end="00:32:54.600" style="s2">there and then also keep that and still</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.860" end="00:32:56.400" style="s2">be whoever you&#39;re gonna be and own it</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.600" end="00:32:58.380" style="s2">and be predictive of it but then be that</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.400" end="00:33:00.390" style="s2">person here together so we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.380" end="00:33:03.929" style="s2">protective of our projects but then also</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.390" end="00:33:05.730" style="s2">like at the end of the day my goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.929" end="00:33:07.590" style="s2">fix misinformation if my thing crashes</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.730" end="00:33:10.350" style="s2">and burns and Brenda and that leads is</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.590" end="00:33:15.720" style="s2">taking off sweet as long as something is</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.350" end="00:33:17.850" style="s2">working I don&#39;t care mm-hmm yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.720" end="00:33:19.230" style="s2">I think this is how like it&#39;s tackling</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.850" end="00:33:24.299" style="s2">it from any angles this is one way to</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.230" end="00:33:26.520" style="s2">tackle it this I love it yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.299" end="00:33:28.650" style="s2">think the fact that there is no owner is</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.520" end="00:33:30.150" style="s2">one of the reasons why it works it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.650" end="00:33:32.370" style="s2">because it&#39;s no no it&#39;s not doing me</p>

<p begin="00:34:28.590" end="00:34:31.649" style="s2">you&#39;ll have some code and Adriel</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.270" end="00:34:33.840" style="s2">probably hasn&#39;t hit this yeah but he</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.649" end="00:34:35.310" style="s2">will show you well and the new developer</p>

<p begin="00:34:43.470" end="00:34:47.520" style="s2">know what&#39;s the play between the amount</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.510" end="00:34:48.780" style="s2">of time spent making it perfect and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.520" end="00:34:50.640" style="s2">amount of time getting it out the door</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.780" end="00:34:52.800" style="s2">and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.640" end="00:34:55.470" style="s2">and I felt really bad because I&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.800" end="00:34:59.790" style="s2">working on a project for five years and</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.470" end="00:35:02.040" style="s2">then I&#39;m handing it over you know you</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.790" end="00:35:06.330" style="s2">know there&#39;s skeletons in there you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.040" end="00:35:08.220" style="s2">where some of them are but you can&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.330" end="00:35:09.780" style="s2">are perfect but people are gonna come a</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.220" end="00:35:11.790" style="s2">new person gonna come in with their</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.780" end="00:35:13.980" style="s2">ideas of the right way to handle this</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.790" end="00:35:17.310" style="s2">project and I even had a project that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.980" end="00:35:19.050" style="s2">worked on for like 15 years for a</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.310" end="00:35:21.450" style="s2">company and they came and said oh well</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.050" end="00:35:22.860" style="s2">we replaced it and you know in a weekend</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.450" end="00:35:25.410" style="s2">and I&#39;m like well the business</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.860" end="00:35:27.540" style="s2">requirements had changed in that time so</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.410" end="00:35:30.270" style="s2">the original design requirements were</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.540" end="00:35:31.770" style="s2">completely different but anyways the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.270" end="00:35:34.080" style="s2">main thing is that yeah anytime anyone</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.770" end="00:35:35.430" style="s2">comes in it&#39;s gonna be like well I want</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.080" end="00:35:37.230" style="s2">to start over from scratch everyone</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.430" end="00:35:39.090" style="s2">prefers what we&#39;ve got greenfield which</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.230" end="00:35:41.430" style="s2">element so interestingly I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.090" end="00:35:43.440" style="s2">experienced that as a developer but I</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.430" end="00:35:45.030" style="s2">have experienced that being a part of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.440" end="00:35:46.980" style="s2">development team and experienced a</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.030" end="00:35:48.150" style="s2">number of times and the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.980" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">thing is that when the new person comes</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.150" end="00:35:51.810" style="s2">in you don&#39;t know if they&#39;re good or not</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.680" end="00:35:53.010" style="s2">yet so they&#39;re asking to refactor it</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.810" end="00:35:54.930" style="s2">you&#39;re like I&#39;ve worked with developers</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.010" end="00:35:56.580" style="s2">who were rock stars and then they left</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.930" end="00:35:58.440" style="s2">somebody came in like we have to redo it</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.580" end="00:36:00.000" style="s2">we&#39;re like but are you better than the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.440" end="00:36:02.520" style="s2">last person because if you&#39;re not then</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.000" end="00:36:04.380" style="s2">no and unless you&#39;re like light years</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.520" end="00:36:05.700" style="s2">better then still no because we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.380" end="00:36:06.690" style="s2">really gonna get anything out of it</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.700" end="00:36:09.150" style="s2">except that you&#39;ll be more comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.690" end="00:36:10.320" style="s2">working but what about the next person</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.150" end="00:36:14.570" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna say that about your work</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.320" end="00:36:16.860" style="s2">so yeah there&#39;s always quite a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.570" end="00:36:18.800" style="s2">personality and what we do because even</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.860" end="00:36:22.560" style="s2">software development is part art and</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.800" end="00:36:24.540" style="s2">database and project management I see</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.560" end="00:36:26.430" style="s2">this same thing comes into factor when I</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.540" end="00:36:27.900" style="s2">get a new doctor or specialist when</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.430" end="00:36:29.370" style="s2">they&#39;re like alright bring it I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.900" end="00:36:31.590" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;d bring you can&#39;t bring me</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.370" end="00:36:33.780" style="s2">down to scratch it</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.590" end="00:36:35.100" style="s2">restart do all the tests and like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.780" end="00:36:37.020" style="s2">done the tests I can tell you what they</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.100" end="00:36:40.440" style="s2">are off my heart it&#39;s like no we have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.020" end="00:36:43.620" style="s2">redo it like no no we don&#39;t my codes</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.440" end="00:36:43.890" style="s2">already in place for good yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.620" end="00:36:46.530" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.890" end="00:36:49.120" style="s2">welcome here to I guess that&#39;s in almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.530" end="00:36:51.910" style="s2">every every Avenue</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.120" end="00:36:53.590" style="s2">which I think I might have a worst</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.910" end="00:36:55.840" style="s2">version of that normal because I have</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.590" end="00:36:58.390" style="s2">that for myself if I did it like over a</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.840" end="00:37:04.840" style="s2">week ago I was like what a daddy idiot</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.390" end="00:37:06.190" style="s2">do I gonna start over again yes I do</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.840" end="00:37:10.060" style="s2">that to have enough of a memory problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.190" end="00:37:11.710" style="s2">that it is to truly fresh like I&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.060" end="00:37:13.810" style="s2">this same idea went together and be like</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.710" end="00:37:15.490" style="s2">oh yeah the food app and it will be like</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.810" end="00:37:17.410" style="s2">it&#39;s brand new but like with a different</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.490" end="00:37:19.720" style="s2">layer to it I&#39;m like the memory problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.410" end="00:37:21.130" style="s2">is you&#39;re actually helping like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.720" end="00:37:23.440" style="s2">different angle and got to the same</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.130" end="00:37:28.300" style="s2">place so this is brilliant sound</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.440" end="00:37:29.860" style="s2">familiar right sometimes I think I did</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.300" end="00:37:31.990" style="s2">that in reason school recently like now</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.860" end="00:37:35.470" style="s2">I came out there there oh now I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.990" end="00:37:37.180" style="s2">too much trouble picking like debates or</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.470" end="00:37:39.310" style="s2">decisions to do so now I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.180" end="00:37:40.660" style="s2">pick something I&#39;m passionate about but</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.310" end="00:37:42.010" style="s2">they&#39;re too big and I thought oh I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.660" end="00:37:44.110" style="s2">just break it down to smaller pieces and</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.010" end="00:37:47.530" style="s2">I thought you know I think I had that</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.110" end="00:37:53.170" style="s2">idea a year ago but I had that exact</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.530" end="00:37:56.370" style="s2">same idea so yeah yeah so even yeah even</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.170" end="00:37:59.110" style="s2">our temporal selves are different and</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.370" end="00:38:00.940" style="s2">thankful well I think we always trust</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.110" end="00:38:02.200" style="s2">our current mindset that we&#39;re in even</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.940" end="00:38:04.780" style="s2">if the one that we&#39;re comparing it to is</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.200" end="00:38:07.210" style="s2">us yesterday we&#39;re still like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.780" end="00:38:08.830" style="s2">sure where that guy&#39;s head was that and</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.210" end="00:38:10.540" style="s2">what his problem was but I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.830" end="00:38:13.890" style="s2">right now and I&#39;m sure that me a week</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.540" end="00:38:13.890" style="s2">from now is gonna agree with this right</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.020" end="00:38:22.060" style="s2">yeah that is partly what process raising</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.180" end="00:38:24.190" style="s2">I&#39;m hoping can hopefully like own that</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.060" end="00:38:25.720" style="s2">because it it is it&#39;s like we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.190" end="00:38:27.520" style="s2">have every time someone comes in there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.720" end="00:38:29.170" style="s2">gonna have been work done and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.520" end="00:38:30.460" style="s2">somewhat right you&#39;re gonna want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.170" end="00:38:32.830" style="s2">bring it down to scratch does that make</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.460" end="00:38:34.810" style="s2">sense right but like if we can bring it</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.830" end="00:38:36.700" style="s2">down to scratch and keep building it but</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.810" end="00:38:38.050" style="s2">owning what as individuals we know it</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.700" end="00:38:40.270" style="s2">actually can make it better and better</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.050" end="00:38:41.560" style="s2">but there is cuz it happens I was like</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.270" end="00:38:43.570" style="s2">that when I came into the game bees face</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.560" end="00:38:44.770" style="s2">I have a solution here who&#39;d want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.570" end="00:38:46.660" style="s2">talk to you now that other people are</p>

<p begin="00:39:28.579" end="00:39:32.569" style="s2">solution raising might really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.559" end="00:39:36.140" style="s2">help with that because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.569" end="00:39:38.119" style="s2">reasons why I think that it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.140" end="00:39:42.170" style="s2">difficult to jump on projects is that it</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.119" end="00:39:44.569" style="s2">a lot of us started on our own and thus</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.170" end="00:39:46.849" style="s2">we have a lot of ownership around those</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.569" end="00:39:49.160" style="s2">initial decisions and stuff so if it</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.849" end="00:39:52.910" style="s2">started in a group I think you hold it</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.160" end="00:39:54.650" style="s2">less tightly so I think it&#39;ll be easier</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.910" end="00:39:58.039" style="s2">if you start with a group of three or</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.650" end="00:40:01.819" style="s2">five or ten or ten thousand working on</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.039" end="00:40:03.710" style="s2">this project I think the natural</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.819" end="00:40:06.710" style="s2">tendency to need to be less dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.710" end="00:40:09.109" style="s2">about the solution and to know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.710" end="00:40:10.609" style="s2">a compromise I think there&#39;s also an</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.109" end="00:40:11.119" style="s2">element of that if you were just part of</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.609" end="00:40:12.470" style="s2">the group</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.119" end="00:40:13.640" style="s2">like there&#39;s things that I&#39;ve built</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.470" end="00:40:15.230" style="s2">where like I was actually the one in</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.640" end="00:40:16.609" style="s2">there building it but then I talked to</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.230" end="00:40:18.770" style="s2">somebody about it later and they think</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.609" end="00:40:20.720" style="s2">that they like were the main person that</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.770" end="00:40:21.589" style="s2">was responsible for that thing and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.720" end="00:40:23.089" style="s2">like there&#39;s three or four people who</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.589" end="00:40:25.279" style="s2">all think they&#39;re responsible it&#39;s cuz</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.089" end="00:40:27.410" style="s2">we sort of designed it as a group and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.279" end="00:40:29.150" style="s2">just went and built it cuz you all</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.410" end="00:40:31.010" style="s2">picked the watermelon swing with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.150" end="00:40:32.270" style="s2">thing in front of your face and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.010" end="00:40:34.130" style="s2">thought it was an original thought and</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.270" end="00:40:36.680" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t it was like some subconscious</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.130" end="00:40:40.700" style="s2">the super conscious that they happen</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.680" end="00:40:41.630" style="s2">that&#39;s took me a while to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.700" end="00:40:43.069" style="s2">what the hell you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.630" end="00:40:46.160" style="s2">mentally all the Instagram thing oh</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.069" end="00:40:47.450" style="s2">here&#39;s your watermelon swing what bring</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.160" end="00:40:49.220" style="s2">that into oh yeah they all picked the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.450" end="00:40:50.660" style="s2">watermelon swing with an ice cube tray</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.220" end="00:40:54.319" style="s2">over their mouth just like almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.660" end="00:40:56.779" style="s2">smile dressed they had really weird</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.319" end="00:41:04.549" style="s2">props like right things that weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.779" end="00:41:06.709" style="s2">glamorous what&#39;s the whole point you</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.549" end="00:41:09.140" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking I mean maybe we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.709" end="00:41:12.229" style="s2">going we&#39;re not in the ten year thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.140" end="00:41:14.239" style="s2">anymore but I do keep coming back to</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.229" end="00:41:16.249" style="s2">this how do we like you know Mar -</p>

<p begin="00:41:16.249" end="00:41:21.229" style="s2">because he&#39;s gonna spend some</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.049" end="00:41:22.789" style="s2">hard-earned cash what is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.229" end="00:41:25.549" style="s2">the limiting factor someone has to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.789" end="00:41:29.599" style="s2">willing to to pay you to work on their</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.549" end="00:41:31.759" style="s2">project and maybe it is which is also</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.599" end="00:41:33.259" style="s2">with not to bring a process but like</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.759" end="00:41:34.640" style="s2">when you have a pool of money and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.259" end="00:41:36.439" style="s2">you&#39;re deciding on it and that&#39;s a new</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.640" end="00:41:37.519" style="s2">group decision right that you can then</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.439" end="00:41:38.900" style="s2">kind of get behind it be like either</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.519" end="00:41:41.900" style="s2">agree with it or I don&#39;t but the group</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.900" end="00:41:43.579" style="s2">decided in a different way then like</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.900" end="00:41:45.229" style="s2">this is what it is and then just uh you</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.579" end="00:41:47.299" style="s2">know decide to decide differently like</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.229" end="00:41:49.219" style="s2">there&#39;s I think it is about we have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.299" end="00:41:50.539" style="s2">keep owning our emotions like what works</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.219" end="00:41:51.289" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t work in this process what</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.539" end="00:41:53.089" style="s2">works and doesn&#39;t work in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.289" end="00:41:54.679" style="s2">conversation and like how can we keep</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.089" end="00:41:56.150" style="s2">inviting because we do have that meta</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.679" end="00:41:58.279" style="s2">conversation right how do we invite more</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.150" end="00:41:59.779" style="s2">people here are we getting something out</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.279" end="00:42:01.189" style="s2">of this what could we offer to other</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.779" end="00:42:04.880" style="s2">people to get something out of this well</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.189" end="00:42:06.799" style="s2">also yeah I keep thinking about starting</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.880" end="00:42:08.660" style="s2">a patreon but then I&#39;m like - I started</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.799" end="00:42:11.329" style="s2">over one project and then what happens</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.660" end="00:42:13.489" style="s2">when I go to another project so I keep</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.329" end="00:42:17.599" style="s2">thinking I just need to do it like fun -</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.489" end="00:42:18.949" style="s2">Bentley&#39;s crazy ideas alright and this</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.599" end="00:42:21.019" style="s2">is what I&#39;m working on now</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.949" end="00:42:24.799" style="s2">stick around after we go off being live</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.019" end="00:42:31.579" style="s2">I have something for that - I like fun</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.799" end="00:42:33.199" style="s2">but you are in - and also something to</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.579" end="00:42:34.400" style="s2">tell you when we&#39;re not not live also</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.199" end="00:42:41.420" style="s2">Bentley then everyone else can be privy</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.400" end="00:42:46.729" style="s2">to just not YouTube&#39;s biggest buddy I</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.420" end="00:42:49.390" style="s2">don&#39;t know yeah I don&#39;t know I am</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.729" end="00:42:52.939" style="s2">looking forward to 2030 if that if that</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.390" end="00:42:54.920" style="s2">so you&#39;re hopeful huh with all these</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.939" end="00:42:56.779" style="s2">things yes cuz it&#39;s emerging like</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.920" end="00:42:58.729" style="s2">something is coming together in all of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.779" end="00:43:01.069" style="s2">the chaos and all of the stuff it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.729" end="00:43:03.410" style="s2">things are happening and coalescing it</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.069" end="00:43:05.119" style="s2">and that is more what I want to give the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.410" end="00:43:07.369" style="s2">world than anything else that just like</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.119" end="00:43:09.319" style="s2">hope is on its way there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.369" end="00:43:11.479" style="s2">people working on so many things and</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.319" end="00:43:14.359" style="s2">it&#39;s a what if it fails like we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.479" end="00:43:15.949" style="s2">all fail but all of this is emergent and</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.359" end="00:43:18.599" style="s2">the same thing that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.949" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">annoying to me that we all are fractured</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.599" end="00:43:22.739" style="s2">is also its blessing and it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:24.299" style="s2">bench label coalesce eventually we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.739" end="00:43:25.890" style="s2">figure out if it&#39;s not processed or</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.299" end="00:43:27.089" style="s2">anything someone will figure out how do</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.890" end="00:43:28.709" style="s2">we bring people together</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.089" end="00:43:30.539" style="s2">what does governance look like without</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.709" end="00:43:32.939" style="s2">it needing to be for me like all of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.539" end="00:43:35.189" style="s2">stuff is being solved in many different</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.939" end="00:43:37.589" style="s2">ways it&#39;s almost like we need this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.189" end="00:43:39.569" style="s2">bringing it back down to like the base</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.589" end="00:43:41.910" style="s2">right you create a code - for governance</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.569" end="00:43:45.150" style="s2">or ID or whatever it is and nobody comes</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.910" end="00:43:46.559" style="s2">on board so it fails and like people</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.150" end="00:43:47.969" style="s2">keep doing that process until enough</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.559" end="00:43:49.529" style="s2">people have done over there like what ID</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.969" end="00:43:52.140" style="s2">and governance aren&#39;t even needed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.529" end="00:43:53.640" style="s2">like no bring it back down so we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.140" end="00:43:55.109" style="s2">figure out what went wrong on each</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.640" end="00:43:58.289" style="s2">project and how can we come together</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.109" end="00:44:00.539" style="s2">create something or one succeeds right</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.289" end="00:44:02.819" style="s2">like one of the sense-making succeeds or</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.539" end="00:44:05.009" style="s2">they don&#39;t and you all guys are all so</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.819" end="00:44:06.869" style="s2">frustrated you do bring it back and say</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.009" end="00:44:09.029" style="s2">okay what can we weave together with all</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.869" end="00:44:11.069" style="s2">of these things yeah which I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.029" end="00:44:12.599" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the strongest counter</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.069" end="00:44:13.650" style="s2">points to the new person coming on board</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.599" end="00:44:16.949" style="s2">and saying we have to start from scratch</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.650" end="00:44:19.410" style="s2">if you have like a crowdsourcing you</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.949" end="00:44:21.989" style="s2">know a document saying how things work</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.410" end="00:44:23.789" style="s2">say great here&#39;s what 30 people came up</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.989" end="00:44:25.619" style="s2">with tell us what should change because</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.789" end="00:44:27.390" style="s2">usually in my experience it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.619" end="00:44:29.249" style="s2">they don&#39;t like the code structure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.390" end="00:44:32.099" style="s2">like something kind of minimal that</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.249" end="00:44:33.179" style="s2">really no one else is going to notice it</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.099" end="00:44:34.529" style="s2">sort of saying no we&#39;re not just going</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.179" end="00:44:36.299" style="s2">to read you everything based on what you</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.529" end="00:44:38.369" style="s2">want here&#39;s what the community decided</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.299" end="00:44:39.539" style="s2">if there&#39;s something wrong there by all</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.369" end="00:44:43.199" style="s2">means we&#39;ll discuss it with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.539" end="00:44:47.189" style="s2">community and usually there is a time to</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.199" end="00:44:49.289" style="s2">go back and kind of clean things up when</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.189" end="00:44:51.329" style="s2">you&#39;re redeveloping something you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.289" end="00:44:53.369" style="s2">there are some many fresh starts I guess</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.329" end="00:44:55.410" style="s2">right yeah large project there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.369" end="00:44:56.579" style="s2">reason like hey it&#39;s super slow then</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.410" end="00:44:58.859" style="s2">yeah it probably does need some</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.579" end="00:45:00.119" style="s2">refactoring but if it&#39;s like doing great</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.859" end="00:45:01.829" style="s2">and you&#39;re just like I just don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.119" end="00:45:04.049" style="s2">the way they coded no we&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.829" end="00:45:06.269" style="s2">spend time on that yeah and in the same</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.049" end="00:45:08.640" style="s2">way this pandemics kind of a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.269" end="00:45:10.890" style="s2">veil it mini reboot for certain areas</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.640" end="00:45:14.160" style="s2">like in and you know they&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.890" end="00:45:15.839" style="s2">like vaccines to only take 15 years and</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.160" end="00:45:20.239" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna try and get it down to one</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.839" end="00:45:24.029" style="s2">or two which is sounds way too long but</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.239" end="00:45:26.599" style="s2">you to prove it stuff like that yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.029" end="00:45:31.500" style="s2">just like Jubilee was saying that this</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.599" end="00:45:34.110" style="s2">catastrophe is it does have</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.500" end="00:45:38.450" style="s2">is a forcing function and an inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.110" end="00:45:41.370" style="s2">to improve the world funny cuz I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.450" end="00:45:45.090" style="s2">atrial and I have moved a lot in our</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.370" end="00:45:47.160" style="s2">lifetime and so my ID like I clean my</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.090" end="00:45:50.040" style="s2">house when I move like it&#39;s like I you</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.160" end="00:45:51.720" style="s2">know I throw away packing into</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.040" end="00:45:54.360" style="s2">boxes move throw away while I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.720" end="00:45:56.280" style="s2">unpacking it and that is how I down suck</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.360" end="00:45:58.950" style="s2">you know and I haven&#39;t moved in nine</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.280" end="00:46:00.540" style="s2">years and so now it&#39;s like I have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.950" end="00:46:01.740" style="s2">actually take it on my kitchen in my</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.540" end="00:46:03.780" style="s2">shed you know what I mean like I have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.740" end="00:46:05.520" style="s2">tackle it and that&#39;s the economy like</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.780" end="00:46:06.780" style="s2">that is there gonna be like what</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.520" end="00:46:08.580" style="s2">impossible one do is bring everything</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.780" end="00:46:10.260" style="s2">back to zero and be like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.580" end="00:46:12.090" style="s2">recreate it but you can&#39;t because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.260" end="00:46:13.950" style="s2">lived here right like we got billions of</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.090" end="00:46:16.080" style="s2">years on this planet we can&#39;t raise it</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.950" end="00:46:17.640" style="s2">and start again it&#39;s like how do you fix</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.080" end="00:46:19.530" style="s2">this piece and this piece and this piece</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.640" end="00:46:23.630" style="s2">and still have it be like you moved in</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.530" end="00:46:23.630" style="s2">fresh with every with every you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.780" end="00:46:28.560" style="s2">yeah I haven&#39;t looked at the seasteading</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.950" end="00:46:31.650" style="s2">though it&#39;d be nice to just go out and</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.560" end="00:46:33.600" style="s2">build an island and start fresh on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.650" end="00:46:39.930" style="s2">island at least yeah it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.600" end="00:46:44.580" style="s2">possible talk to you long yeah actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.930" end="00:46:47.040" style="s2">I want to do it yeah I mean it may be</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.580" end="00:46:48.630" style="s2">the palm is what all do you want what</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.040" end="00:46:50.100" style="s2">all can yourself produce and you still</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.630" end="00:46:52.770" style="s2">have to work with the outside world to</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.100" end="00:46:55.380" style="s2">some extent and global climate change</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.770" end="00:46:58.350" style="s2">still affects you so yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.380" end="00:47:02.960" style="s2">there&#39;s some stuff we can start over and</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.350" end="00:47:08.280" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of painful overlap</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.960" end="00:47:12.870" style="s2">yeah I thinking about this I have this</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.280" end="00:47:15.960" style="s2">picture in mind of domes</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.870" end="00:47:21.210" style="s2">and how they would be very appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.960" end="00:47:25.650" style="s2">to exist in any environment as well as</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.210" end="00:47:29.810" style="s2">in severely climate changed environments</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.650" end="00:47:35.220" style="s2">like oh not even climate changed but</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.810" end="00:47:37.880" style="s2">Sahara and extremes and then the same</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.220" end="00:47:44.040" style="s2">thing in space once you have a dome that</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.880" end="00:47:45.150" style="s2">sealed and resistance to the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.040" end="00:47:48.420" style="s2">outside</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.150" end="00:47:52.200" style="s2">well it&#39;s gonna be yours even on Mars so</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.420" end="00:47:54.720" style="s2">yeah other places yeah it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.200" end="00:47:59.609" style="s2">interesting experiment I was remembering</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.720" end="00:48:02.130" style="s2">the biosphere one or something that</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.609" end="00:48:03.599" style="s2">experiment a while back and they found</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.130" end="00:48:05.460" style="s2">out some of the problems with oxygen and</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.599" end="00:48:09.450" style="s2">stuff was just because cement did stuff</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.460" end="00:48:12.390" style="s2">we didn&#39;t know like Oh cement is that it</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.450" end="00:48:14.069" style="s2">interacts with water and it creates this</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.390" end="00:48:16.200" style="s2">type of acid and it&#39;s like no one knew</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.069" end="00:48:18.029" style="s2">that that chemistry was going cool so</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.200" end="00:48:21.299" style="s2">yeah it&#39;d be great to experiment with it</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.029" end="00:48:24.140" style="s2">here when you have a escape hatch rather</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.299" end="00:48:26.970" style="s2">than on Mars where you know a lot harder</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.140" end="00:48:33.089" style="s2">to start over</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.970" end="00:48:34.740" style="s2">I don&#39;t think spacefaring is like if you</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.089" end="00:48:36.359" style="s2">like like that&#39;s the solution like we</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.740" end="00:48:37.950" style="s2">get off of the planet I&#39;m like I really</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.359" end="00:48:39.509" style="s2">don&#39;t think we get to that level of</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.950" end="00:48:41.069" style="s2">spacefaring like yes we can get off our</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.509" end="00:48:43.079" style="s2">planet but like we&#39;re not getting to</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.069" end="00:48:44.670" style="s2">like actually get further places unless</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.079" end="00:48:46.740" style="s2">we can actually live in equilibrium with</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.670" end="00:48:47.400" style="s2">the world that&#39;s designed to live in</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.740" end="00:48:49.769" style="s2">equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.400" end="00:48:50.940" style="s2">that being said part of me is like oh if</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.769" end="00:48:53.700" style="s2">the rich people all want to go live on</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.940" end="00:48:55.289" style="s2">Mars let&#39;s let them go for it can</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.700" end="00:48:57.930" style="s2">automate your world and we&#39;ll all have</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.289" end="00:48:59.549" style="s2">this one and we&#39;ll figure this hood just</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.930" end="00:49:02.220" style="s2">don&#39;t break it first don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.549" end="00:49:04.470" style="s2">everything and go we&#39;ll have this one</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.220" end="00:49:06.599" style="s2">instead of guillotine you sure go live</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.470" end="00:49:08.789" style="s2">on Mars have fun with that</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.599" end="00:49:11.849" style="s2">I know we all watch Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.789" end="00:49:13.769" style="s2">to the galaxy in this story there was an</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.849" end="00:49:16.470" style="s2">arc that they sent off and they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.769" end="00:49:18.660" style="s2">take all the like standard workers like</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.470" end="00:49:20.160" style="s2">the telephone cleaners and then they all</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.660" end="00:49:22.470" style="s2">died of a disease they got off their</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.160" end="00:49:23.999" style="s2">telephones and then so the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.470" end="00:49:29.880" style="s2">human race was everyone that was left</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.999" end="00:49:32.279" style="s2">behind kind of funny girl Hitchhiker&#39;s</p>
