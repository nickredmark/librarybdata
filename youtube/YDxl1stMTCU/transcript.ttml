<p begin="00:00:04.880" end="00:00:12.120" style="s2">this is the first rebel wisdom podcast</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.160" end="00:00:15.139" style="s2">and we&#39;re basically my name&#39;s David</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.120" end="00:00:18.509" style="s2">fuller I&#39;m Alexander Boehner and</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.139" end="00:00:19.829" style="s2">together we are rebel wisdom and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.509" end="00:00:21.060" style="s2">assume that most people who watch this</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.829" end="00:00:22.109" style="s2">will be subscribers and they&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.060" end="00:00:23.819" style="s2">seen some of the stuff that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.109" end="00:00:25.859" style="s2">putting out the Jordan Peters and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.819" end="00:00:27.300" style="s2">and whatever so the idea is to give a</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.859" end="00:00:29.640" style="s2">little bit of background about what the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.300" end="00:00:32.640" style="s2">rebel wisdom project is where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.640" end="00:00:36.360" style="s2">going and yeah what the kind of what the</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.640" end="00:00:37.320" style="s2">thought behind it is so even though this</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.360" end="00:00:39.330" style="s2">is addressed at you I&#39;m gonna keep</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.320" end="00:00:40.800" style="s2">looking at hell even though that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.330" end="00:00:44.940" style="s2">real even that Ali knows everything like</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.800" end="00:00:45.920" style="s2">Italian so my background I used to work</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.940" end="00:00:48.240" style="s2">for Channel four News</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.920" end="00:00:51.780" style="s2">I&#39;ve been a journalist for about 15</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.240" end="00:00:56.190" style="s2">years left started doing documentaries</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.780" end="00:00:58.020" style="s2">and during that time I&#39;ve also done a</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.190" end="00:00:59.910" style="s2">lot of I studied philosophy at</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.020" end="00:01:01.470" style="s2">University and have always been</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.910" end="00:01:03.480" style="s2">interested in big ideas and also</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.470" end="00:01:05.549" style="s2">personal growth work lots of shadow work</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.480" end="00:01:07.969" style="s2">lots of which is the stuff that really</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.549" end="00:01:10.520" style="s2">kind of drew me to Jordan Peterson a</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.969" end="00:01:12.960" style="s2">couple of years ago a year or so ago and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.520" end="00:01:14.759" style="s2">all through that time I&#39;ve also been</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.960" end="00:01:17.549" style="s2">kind of thinking about how to get some</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.759" end="00:01:20.639" style="s2">of these more interesting slightly</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.549" end="00:01:22.200" style="s2">esoteric subjects onto mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.639" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">and realizing it&#39;s very difficult to get</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.200" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">these in because there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:30.209" style="s2">gatekeepers there&#39;s a huge resistance</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:33.450" style="s2">especially to stuff that sort of is in</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.209" end="00:01:35.369" style="s2">you might call spiritual or religious or</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.450" end="00:01:40.439" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of materialist skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.369" end="00:01:44.240" style="s2">and I think that is a real yes it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.439" end="00:01:50.999" style="s2">real barrier and through rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.240" end="00:01:52.590" style="s2">aim is to bring a deeper sense of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.999" end="00:01:53.639" style="s2">just a much deeper conversation than the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.590" end="00:01:55.560" style="s2">one that we&#39;re really seeing in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.639" end="00:01:56.789" style="s2">mainstream media at the moment which</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.560" end="00:01:58.619" style="s2">sort of ties into the whole intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.789" end="00:01:59.969" style="s2">dark web thing and a lot of the films</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.619" end="00:02:03.149" style="s2">and stuff that we&#39;ve done and stuff we</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.969" end="00:02:04.740" style="s2">are going to cover so what you tell me</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.149" end="00:02:07.649" style="s2">about your background stuff yes stuff</p>

<p begin="00:02:47.220" end="00:02:52.590" style="s2">writer Andrew Sweeney he&#39;s been doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.840" end="00:02:56.030" style="s2">some really good stuff for us and so far</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.590" end="00:02:58.830" style="s2">I think we&#39;ve done I mean I we did</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.030" end="00:03:02.220" style="s2">pretty well with the Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.830" end="00:03:03.870" style="s2">stuff I mean I remember discovering</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.220" end="00:03:07.260" style="s2">Jordan Peterson last June and just</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.870" end="00:03:08.760" style="s2">immediately thinking this is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.260" end="00:03:11.430" style="s2">that is needed right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.760" end="00:03:12.930" style="s2">this is about the reinterment of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.430" end="00:03:15.090" style="s2">world the assimilation of spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.930" end="00:03:17.370" style="s2">the assimilation of religion this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.090" end="00:03:19.380" style="s2">this is the thing and I was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.370" end="00:03:22.739" style="s2">obsessed like digesting listening to all</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.380" end="00:03:24.330" style="s2">of his stuff and then pitched an</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.739" end="00:03:25.709" style="s2">interview to him and was lucky enough to</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.330" end="00:03:28.860" style="s2">get an interview with him in October</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.709" end="00:03:31.500" style="s2">that we then put out as the truth in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.860" end="00:03:34.170" style="s2">time of chaos documentary in in January</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.500" end="00:03:38.430" style="s2">at exactly the time that ironically he</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.170" end="00:03:40.920" style="s2">then kind of shot to fame with an</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.430" end="00:03:42.920" style="s2">interview with my ex colleague Kathy</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.920" end="00:03:46.050" style="s2">Newman on Channel 4 News</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.920" end="00:03:48.300" style="s2">when a lot of what I had gone to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.050" end="00:03:52.140" style="s2">Jordan Peterson about was synchronicity</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.300" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">and it was just uncanny that&#39;s when the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.140" end="00:03:55.019" style="s2">synchronicity stopped that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:56.970" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s when things start to</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.019" end="00:03:59.519" style="s2">line up yeah and the more you&#39;re in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.970" end="00:04:02.580" style="s2">space the more they line up yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.519" end="00:04:03.480" style="s2">the question is if you&#39;re like really in</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.580" end="00:04:06.090" style="s2">that space</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.480" end="00:04:08.010" style="s2">how much do things line up all of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.090" end="00:04:10.230" style="s2">was happening and I I wondered what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.010" end="00:04:12.720" style="s2">was gonna make what to make of this and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.230" end="00:04:15.480" style="s2">for quite a while I was thinking well I</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.720" end="00:04:17.100" style="s2">have this kind of link to to Kathy and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.480" end="00:04:19.019" style="s2">have some kind of link to Jordan so what</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.100" end="00:04:21.090" style="s2">I need to do is the am and get them to</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.019" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">go and do the second interview that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.090" end="00:04:24.460" style="s2">thought was necessary and so for a while</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">I was doing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.460" end="00:04:30.100" style="s2">kind of trying to do stuff behind the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.080" end="00:04:31.810" style="s2">scenes and then it was clear that Cathy</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.100" end="00:04:32.530" style="s2">wasn&#39;t interested Channel four weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.810" end="00:04:34.840" style="s2">interested</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.530" end="00:04:37.479" style="s2">so Channel four News sorry weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.840" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">interested so in the end I thought well</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.479" end="00:04:41.740" style="s2">I came and then it came to me okay I</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:44.620" style="s2">should make a documentary glitching the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.740" end="00:04:46.389" style="s2">matrix which then was a way of like just</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.620" end="00:04:48.490" style="s2">downloading all the stuff that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.389" end="00:04:50.199" style="s2">thinking about for quite a while and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.490" end="00:04:52.090" style="s2">especially since the election of Trump</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.199" end="00:04:54.820" style="s2">about kind of the the shadow side of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.090" end="00:04:56.350" style="s2">liberalism and all of the the blind</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.820" end="00:04:58.330" style="s2">spots of liberalism so glitching the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.350" end="00:05:02.919" style="s2">matrix was kind of a the title of it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.330" end="00:05:05.650" style="s2">it all it was it came from a very from a</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.919" end="00:05:07.120" style="s2">real flow state of like being really a</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.650" end="00:05:08.889" style="s2">line and feeling like okay this is what</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.120" end="00:05:10.750" style="s2">I meant to be doing which is the essence</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.889" end="00:05:12.389" style="s2">of kind of synchronicity and the essence</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.750" end="00:05:14.590" style="s2">of Jordan Peterson&#39;s deeper meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.389" end="00:05:17.530" style="s2">you know when you&#39;re aligned at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.590" end="00:05:20.320" style="s2">right place and then your sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.530" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">meaning tells you what to do so this and</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.320" end="00:05:24.190" style="s2">I think the impact that it&#39;s had so far</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:26.229" style="s2">which has been pretty great like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.190" end="00:05:28.539" style="s2">response has been really great and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.229" end="00:05:30.550" style="s2">quite proud of it as a piece of work has</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.539" end="00:05:33.280" style="s2">shown that it&#39;s something that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.550" end="00:05:35.860" style="s2">people really wanted and I met a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.280" end="00:05:37.990" style="s2">people at the Jordan Peterson event last</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.860" end="00:05:39.520" style="s2">night who were saying you came up to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.990" end="00:05:40.690" style="s2">and shook my hand and said wow this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:43.659" style="s2">really interesting it really showed me</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.690" end="00:05:45.400" style="s2">it kind of opened my eyes to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.659" end="00:05:49.530" style="s2">what was going on so I&#39;m quite proud of</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.400" end="00:05:53.199" style="s2">that and really keen that we keep going</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.530" end="00:05:56.520" style="s2">so you could say why why the obsession</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.199" end="00:05:59.110" style="s2">with Jordan Pederson and for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.520" end="00:06:00.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not really about Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.110" end="00:06:07.150" style="s2">Jordan Pederson is kind of the messenger</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.880" end="00:06:09.159" style="s2">and is an amazing advocate for something</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.150" end="00:06:11.440" style="s2">that we&#39;ve forgotten and that for me is</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.159" end="00:06:13.750" style="s2">the deep story of Western culture and he</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.440" end="00:06:15.490" style="s2">is embodying that deep story of Western</p>

<p begin="00:06:15.490" end="00:06:20.169" style="s2">about aligning yourself with the truth</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.840" end="00:06:23.380" style="s2">the logos and I think he&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.169" end="00:06:26.110" style="s2">misconstrued by people who can&#39;t get</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.389" end="00:06:34.120" style="s2">less than channeling and fully</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.080" end="00:06:35.279" style="s2">articulating the deep story of Western</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.120" end="00:06:38.879" style="s2">culture for the first</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.279" end="00:06:40.439" style="s2">and well certainly for the first time in</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.879" end="00:06:43.019" style="s2">the Internet age you could argue that</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.439" end="00:06:45.599" style="s2">Young was doing the same thing back in</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.019" end="00:06:47.309" style="s2">the in the 50s and that there are people</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.599" end="00:06:49.739" style="s2">who come along and do this at times in</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.309" end="00:06:52.439" style="s2">the past but effectively saying we</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.739" end="00:06:54.569" style="s2">already know a lot of the answers we</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.439" end="00:06:56.429" style="s2">already know the way to live it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.569" end="00:07:00.029" style="s2">embodied interaction that&#39;s embodied in</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.429" end="00:07:01.469" style="s2">mythologies embodied in our religions</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.029" end="00:07:03.689" style="s2">it&#39;s embodied and all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.469" end="00:07:05.759" style="s2">look at this piece of art what is it</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.689" end="00:07:07.619" style="s2">saying we represented it in art we</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.759" end="00:07:09.360" style="s2">represented it in all these ways and now</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.619" end="00:07:13.199" style="s2">we can fully articulate it tie into</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.360" end="00:07:19.769" style="s2">neuroscience tie into and that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.199" end="00:07:21.659" style="s2">it&#39;s an epic epic project and so I get</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.769" end="00:07:22.889" style="s2">accused and it&#39;s very easy to say well</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.659" end="00:07:25.969" style="s2">you&#39;re obsessed with Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.889" end="00:07:28.409" style="s2">you&#39;re a fanboy and all that stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.969" end="00:07:31.169" style="s2">but for me the message that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.409" end="00:07:35.159" style="s2">bringing forward is that deep it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.169" end="00:07:38.669" style="s2">deep and therefore I want to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.159" end="00:07:41.009" style="s2">use his thought as a lens to link into</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.669" end="00:07:42.809" style="s2">other great thinkers like we just put</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.009" end="00:07:45.059" style="s2">out an interview with Rupert Sheldrake</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.809" end="00:07:46.469" style="s2">who I think is an amazing rebellious</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.059" end="00:07:50.339" style="s2">thinker he&#39;s been doing this stuff for a</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.469" end="00:07:52.559" style="s2">long time and I want to also continue to</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.339" end="00:07:54.689" style="s2">kind of expand that into other into</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.559" end="00:07:57.119" style="s2">other thinkers make the conscious link</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.689" end="00:07:59.939" style="s2">to to this sort of deeper worldview and</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.119" end="00:08:02.789" style="s2">help yeah just bring out great</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.939" end="00:08:04.649" style="s2">bring out great content really what do</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.789" end="00:08:06.629" style="s2">you make of Jordan Peterson it took you</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.649" end="00:08:09.029" style="s2">a little bit longer maybe to get into it</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.629" end="00:08:11.819" style="s2">yeah it did I mean I&#39;m thinking back to</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.029" end="00:08:13.829" style="s2">to like maybe this time last year and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.819" end="00:08:16.349" style="s2">think one of the first things we started</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.829" end="00:08:18.539" style="s2">talking about was Wilbur&#39;s Trump and a</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.349" end="00:08:22.379" style="s2">post truth world so Ken Wilber</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.539" end="00:08:24.479" style="s2">yeah Ken Wilber who kind of yeah was the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.379" end="00:08:27.449" style="s2">driving force or is behind integral</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.479" end="00:08:29.369" style="s2">studies which is to cut a long story</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.449" end="00:08:30.989" style="s2">short and we are gonna be releasing a</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.369" end="00:08:33.899" style="s2">lot of interviews with integral thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.989" end="00:08:36.180" style="s2">coming up so but this idea of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.899" end="00:08:38.579" style="s2">see reality as fully as possible and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.180" end="00:08:39.769" style="s2">it&#39;s really it&#39;s a really deep model it</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.579" end="00:08:43.620" style="s2">was one of the first things that really</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.769" end="00:08:45.360" style="s2">got me into wanting to integrate my</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.620" end="00:08:47.000" style="s2">shadow and really see the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.360" end="00:08:50.120" style="s2">that and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.000" end="00:08:51.709" style="s2">we&#39;re the Eastern traditions couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.120" end="00:08:53.950" style="s2">comment on the Western traditions and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.709" end="00:08:57.529" style="s2">vice versa and quite a big model so</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.950" end="00:09:02.570" style="s2">after Trump was elected he wrote a great</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.529" end="00:09:04.790" style="s2">piece where he pointed out that part of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.570" end="00:09:06.529" style="s2">the part of the reason if not the reason</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.790" end="00:09:08.060" style="s2">is because the leading edge of culture</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.529" end="00:09:09.769" style="s2">had been what in their model they</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.060" end="00:09:14.060" style="s2">defined as green which is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.769" end="00:09:16.010" style="s2">pluralistic relative progressive you you</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.060" end="00:09:19.310" style="s2">could say and that it can become kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.010" end="00:09:20.839" style="s2">the leading edge of our arts and our</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.310" end="00:09:23.089" style="s2">assumptions and kind of a leading edge</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.839" end="00:09:25.820" style="s2">of culture however to cut a long story</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.089" end="00:09:27.649" style="s2">short it&#39;s not nearly as inclusive as it</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.820" end="00:09:29.570" style="s2">thinks it is so it&#39;s got a shadow it</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.649" end="00:09:31.730" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want to look at its own and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.570" end="00:09:34.660" style="s2">performative contradictions yes so Green</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.730" end="00:09:37.399" style="s2">basically is inclusivity</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.660" end="00:09:40.220" style="s2">it&#39;s what fuels civil rights it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.399" end="00:09:43.579" style="s2">fuels so the wave of kind of equality of</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.220" end="00:09:45.950" style="s2">the 60s and 70s but then it became</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.579" end="00:09:48.079" style="s2">corrupt yeah because it didn&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.950" end="00:09:49.490" style="s2">it was a tribalism yeah and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.079" end="00:09:51.350" style="s2">really key thing with it is that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.490" end="00:09:53.420" style="s2">really important stage of development so</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.350" end="00:09:55.010" style="s2">that so all of integral Studies is</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.420" end="00:09:56.779" style="s2">really based around not throwing out the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.010" end="00:09:58.910" style="s2">baby with the bathwater it&#39;s a real it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.779" end="00:10:00.800" style="s2">a model that says yes and just like when</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.910" end="00:10:02.990" style="s2">you become nine years old you don&#39;t kill</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.800" end="00:10:04.670" style="s2">your five-year-old self you grow and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.990" end="00:10:06.199" style="s2">and your five year old self is you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.670" end="00:10:08.810" style="s2">your experiences are all there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.199" end="00:10:10.430" style="s2">recontextualized so yeah that was</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.810" end="00:10:14.839" style="s2">exactly it is that Green has become</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.430" end="00:10:17.660" style="s2">toxic effectively and you know to almost</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.839" end="00:10:19.040" style="s2">a very tribal degree of you know will be</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.660" end="00:10:21.920" style="s2">inclusive as long as you&#39;re as inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.040" end="00:10:23.899" style="s2">as us otherwise you are a deplorable so</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.920" end="00:10:26.089" style="s2">it&#39;s really what Hillary Clinton said so</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.899" end="00:10:28.399" style="s2">that really was a one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.089" end="00:10:30.440" style="s2">interesting things I read and resonated</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.399" end="00:10:31.940" style="s2">with me the most and then it took me a</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.440" end="00:10:34.790" style="s2">while to get into Jordan Peterson you</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.940" end="00:10:37.640" style="s2">know I was interested but it just took</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.790" end="00:10:40.370" style="s2">well it takes a while to really get to</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.640" end="00:10:43.459" style="s2">watch enough of this stuff because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.370" end="00:10:46.040" style="s2">complex it&#39;s not an easy it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.459" end="00:10:49.880" style="s2">easily understood thing it takes time to</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.040" end="00:10:52.310" style="s2">really wrestle with and get into yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.880" end="00:10:53.149" style="s2">and then then I think there&#39;s two things</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.310" end="00:10:55.700" style="s2">with him that I think are really</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.149" end="00:10:58.820" style="s2">important that I really see is that a</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.700" end="00:11:01.100" style="s2">he&#39;s very hard to categorize and he is</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.820" end="00:11:04.550" style="s2">part of if not the main driving force</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.100" end="00:11:06.860" style="s2">now in getting green to look at his own</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.550" end="00:11:08.660" style="s2">shadow you know and he&#39;s bringing up</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.860" end="00:11:10.910" style="s2">some of what integral studies they would</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.660" end="00:11:12.710" style="s2">call the kind of the the levels before</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.910" end="00:11:14.300" style="s2">that the traditionalism all of that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.710" end="00:11:17.030" style="s2">know clean your room and really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.300" end="00:11:18.830" style="s2">connecting with certainty and that and</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.030" end="00:11:21.170" style="s2">then that&#39;s the key thing it&#39;s truth and</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.830" end="00:11:24.080" style="s2">more than that he&#39;s sort of channeling a</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.170" end="00:11:26.060" style="s2">kind of traditionalist knowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.080" end="00:11:28.700" style="s2">has been forgotten by the relativistic</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.060" end="00:11:31.010" style="s2">and postmodern world basically and</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.700" end="00:11:32.720" style="s2">that&#39;s why we would and we were so</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.010" end="00:11:34.310" style="s2">thirsty for it and that&#39;s where his</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.720" end="00:11:36.080" style="s2">color of success has come from yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.310" end="00:11:38.480" style="s2">definitely I think and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.080" end="00:11:40.250" style="s2">this there&#39;s a huge power in that but</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.480" end="00:11:44.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a need for it it&#39;s it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.250" end="00:11:45.800" style="s2">a deep need for it and I&#39;ve always had a</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.030" end="00:11:47.840" style="s2">problem with post-modernism ever since I</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.800" end="00:11:50.600" style="s2">would I studied English universe I</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.840" end="00:11:53.300" style="s2">studied English in University and a</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.600" end="00:11:54.710" style="s2">postmodern writing is is really bad you</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.300" end="00:11:56.390" style="s2">know because it doesn&#39;t follow the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.710" end="00:11:58.130" style="s2">mythic journey you know doesn&#39;t follow</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.390" end="00:11:59.150" style="s2">the mono myth it kind of subvert and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.130" end="00:12:02.810" style="s2">can be interesting it&#39;s kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.150" end="00:12:04.550" style="s2">intellectual masturbation but in general</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.810" end="00:12:06.530" style="s2">I thought this is smoke and mirrors you</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.550" end="00:12:08.900" style="s2">know this is not tapping into the depths</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.530" end="00:12:10.670" style="s2">of the psyche and everyone knows</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.900" end="00:12:12.470" style="s2">everyone when you read a story whether</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.670" end="00:12:14.960" style="s2">you&#39;re five years old or whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.470" end="00:12:16.910" style="s2">90 years old it resonates with you</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.960" end="00:12:18.770" style="s2">because but that&#39;s Joseph Campbell&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.910" end="00:12:20.300" style="s2">insight into the mono myth it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.770" end="00:12:21.620" style="s2">the story isn&#39;t about what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.300" end="00:12:22.910" style="s2">reading it&#39;s about your own inner</p>

<p begin="00:13:04.220" end="00:13:07.150" style="s2">you know it&#39;s all about kind of playing</p>

<p begin="00:13:07.150" end="00:13:10.960" style="s2">which is fine you know that&#39;s a literary</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.560" end="00:13:13.510" style="s2">thing but when when the values of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.960" end="00:13:16.570" style="s2">are applied to how people actually live</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.510" end="00:13:18.040" style="s2">their lives it&#39;s insane it&#39;s it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.570" end="00:13:19.900" style="s2">can we work all day</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.040" end="00:13:22.180" style="s2">it creates narcissism but it also</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.900" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">creates what he called a perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.180" end="00:13:25.600" style="s2">madness because it everything is</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:27.730" style="s2">relative and there&#39;s no truth and</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.600" end="00:13:29.920" style="s2">there&#39;s no certainty you you go mad</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.730" end="00:13:31.029" style="s2">we&#39;re human beings we we need it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.920" end="00:13:32.740" style="s2">we&#39;ll finally so that becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.029" end="00:13:35.080" style="s2">certainty the eighth pursuit of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.740" end="00:13:37.060" style="s2">prospective or madness as well is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.080" end="00:13:39.940" style="s2">certain there&#39;s no truth like oh so</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.060" end="00:13:43.330" style="s2">that&#39;s the truth is it it&#39;s I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.940" end="00:13:45.040" style="s2">been yeah that&#39;s always being an</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.330" end="00:13:47.230" style="s2">argument I feel that has come up again</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.040" end="00:13:48.940" style="s2">and again and again and again like when</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.230" end="00:13:49.930" style="s2">I&#39;m talking to someone it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.940" end="00:13:53.350" style="s2">well there is no truth it&#39;s like though</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.930" end="00:13:55.060" style="s2">but hang on yeah and it becomes kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.350" end="00:13:58.660" style="s2">completely yo just disappear down the</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.060" end="00:14:01.420" style="s2">rabbit hole yeah the other it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.660" end="00:14:03.100" style="s2">interesting as well the the reactivity</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.420" end="00:14:04.570" style="s2">to Peterson because the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.100" end="00:14:06.670" style="s2">about integral theory that&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.570" end="00:14:08.230" style="s2">and I think is also informing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.670" end="00:14:11.529" style="s2">what we&#39;re interested in and doing is</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.230" end="00:14:14.770" style="s2">the idea of yes end so integral theory</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.529" end="00:14:16.600" style="s2">is always yes and so it&#39;s it&#39;s a process</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.770" end="00:14:18.700" style="s2">of integrating and moving beyond and</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.600" end="00:14:23.080" style="s2">integrating and moving beyond and I do</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.700" end="00:14:25.570" style="s2">think that there is almost certainly a</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.080" end="00:14:26.970" style="s2">deeper resolution than Dan Peterson by</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.570" end="00:14:29.290" style="s2">Peterson is bringing forward something</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.970" end="00:14:30.459" style="s2">something timeless and eternal and</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.290" end="00:14:33.459" style="s2">something that has to be integrated</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.459" end="00:14:35.680" style="s2">before we move forward but I think there</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.459" end="00:14:36.940" style="s2">is a part that we can move forward and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.680" end="00:14:38.290" style="s2">think Peterson himself is actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.940" end="00:14:42.010" style="s2">trying to do that I mean you get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.290" end="00:14:44.080" style="s2">when he&#39;s talking on stage he&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.010" end="00:14:45.459" style="s2">and he&#39;s genuinely trying to work out</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.080" end="00:14:49.120" style="s2">where he&#39;s wrong where he can get better</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.459" end="00:14:50.860" style="s2">and more and and and I think he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.120" end="00:14:52.959" style="s2">probably now that he&#39;s kind of reached a</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.860" end="00:14:55.089" style="s2">level ii he&#39;s reached is having</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.959" end="00:14:57.730" style="s2">conversations with other thinkers on a</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.089" end="00:15:00.670" style="s2">similar level to him that are going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.730" end="00:15:04.630" style="s2">probably develop his thought even</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.670" end="00:15:06.040" style="s2">further and I would say the only level I</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.630" end="00:15:07.450" style="s2">often challenged by people is like where</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.040" end="00:15:09.670" style="s2">you know you&#39;re never critical at</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.450" end="00:15:12.220" style="s2">Peterson like well that&#39;s because most</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.670" end="00:15:13.870" style="s2">of the criticisms are nonsense and they</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.220" end="00:15:16.660" style="s2">show more about you than they do about</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.870" end="00:15:19.740" style="s2">him like their reactivity but I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.660" end="00:15:21.470" style="s2">the one criticism I think is valid is</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.740" end="00:15:23.510" style="s2">one that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.470" end="00:15:26.210" style="s2">now a thinker on the world stage he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.510" end="00:15:28.340" style="s2">not he&#39;s not in student politics anymore</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.210" end="00:15:32.480" style="s2">and I think there&#39;s a certain reactivity</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.340" end="00:15:35.210" style="s2">to to student politics that that I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.480" end="00:15:37.370" style="s2">comes across as a sort of an anger and a</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.210" end="00:15:40.310" style="s2">peevishness and a kind of reactivity</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.370" end="00:15:43.430" style="s2">that puts some people off and also I</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.310" end="00:15:45.320" style="s2">challenge him a little bit on he says</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.430" end="00:15:48.950" style="s2">that ideas have people people don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.320" end="00:15:50.420" style="s2">ideas so I&#39;d like to see him so why not</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.950" end="00:15:52.880" style="s2">have compassion for people who have</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.420" end="00:15:54.680" style="s2">who&#39;ve been kind of taken in by this new</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.880" end="00:15:59.060" style="s2">Marxist ideology or this relativistic</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.680" end="00:16:00.800" style="s2">ideology it&#39;s in in some sense you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.060" end="00:16:03.230" style="s2">have a lot of anger towards their kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.800" end="00:16:06.170" style="s2">of professors and whatever and but</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.230" end="00:16:07.910" style="s2">actually if if he was I think part of</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.170" end="00:16:09.890" style="s2">the reason this is the other paradox of</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.910" end="00:16:11.630" style="s2">Peterson he&#39;s like his message is about</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.890" end="00:16:13.970" style="s2">transcending division talking to people</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.630" end="00:16:16.010" style="s2">you don&#39;t agree with him coming like and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.970" end="00:16:20.330" style="s2">yet he is one of the most divisive</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.010" end="00:16:21.680" style="s2">characters in society and I think part</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.330" end="00:16:24.470" style="s2">of that is this kind of intense</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.680" end="00:16:27.230" style="s2">reactivity to him by the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.470" end="00:16:29.240" style="s2">culture this kind of neo Marxism this</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.230" end="00:16:30.920" style="s2">kind of green thinking that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.240" end="00:16:33.740" style="s2">integrate what he&#39;s saying because it</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.920" end="00:16:35.420" style="s2">can&#39;t deal with the idea of hierarchy it</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.740" end="00:16:36.410" style="s2">can&#39;t deal with the idea of truth it</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.420" end="00:16:38.210" style="s2">can&#39;t deal with all these things and</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.410" end="00:16:40.310" style="s2">that&#39;s part of it for sure that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.210" end="00:16:44.300" style="s2">part of it but I think there is some</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.310" end="00:16:47.120" style="s2">part where he is still in a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.300" end="00:16:49.160" style="s2">angry reactivity to probably what</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.120" end="00:16:51.140" style="s2">happened to him and probably kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.160" end="00:16:53.120" style="s2">that his job was at risk for like eight</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.140" end="00:16:58.130" style="s2">months and and he was under it and he is</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.120" end="00:17:02.300" style="s2">still under attack completely unfairly</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.130" end="00:17:04.550" style="s2">on a regular basis but there is I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.300" end="00:17:06.380" style="s2">if part of it is this sort of anger and</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.550" end="00:17:09.020" style="s2">reactivity that a lot of people sense in</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.380" end="00:17:10.460" style="s2">him that actually means that they have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.020" end="00:17:13.790" style="s2">reactivity to listening to what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.460" end="00:17:16.880" style="s2">saying and and I think I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.790" end="00:17:20.480" style="s2">the only not maybe not the only but</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.880" end="00:17:24.020" style="s2">that&#39;s the main thing that I think his</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.480" end="00:17:28.790" style="s2">critics have a point on although I also</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.020" end="00:17:31.580" style="s2">think that he has he uses anger and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.790" end="00:17:32.750" style="s2">in a really useful way as well and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.580" end="00:17:34.580" style="s2">think a lot of people don&#39;t recognize</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.750" end="00:17:34.970" style="s2">that like you see him revving himself up</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.580" end="00:17:37.400" style="s2">and stay</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.970" end="00:17:39.980" style="s2">that part of his performative aspect</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.400" end="00:17:41.900" style="s2">he&#39;s really aligned himself he&#39;s he uses</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.980" end="00:17:44.270" style="s2">anger as a tool like he&#39;s a he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.900" end="00:17:47.210" style="s2">integrated in Wilbur terms and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.270" end="00:17:50.330" style="s2">integrated his red like red the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.210" end="00:17:53.030" style="s2">anger shadow tribalism you all right</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.330" end="00:17:55.400" style="s2">like he&#39;s integrated that in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.030" end="00:17:57.380" style="s2">very few people in our culture have and</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.400" end="00:17:59.000" style="s2">it&#39;s often sort of shamed and rejected</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.380" end="00:18:01.730" style="s2">and lots of people have a problem with</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.000" end="00:18:04.159" style="s2">anger so when they see him in that kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.730" end="00:18:05.929" style="s2">of but anger if it&#39;s integrated as he</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.159" end="00:18:07.640" style="s2">talks about like the Jungian shadow it</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.929" end="00:18:09.169" style="s2">becomes force it becomes power it</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.640" end="00:18:10.490" style="s2">becomes all of the stuff in the world so</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.169" end="00:18:12.289" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a reactivity as well on</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.490" end="00:18:13.940" style="s2">the other side so it&#39;s a complete it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.289" end="00:18:15.380" style="s2">really complex picture is really complex</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.940" end="00:18:16.789" style="s2">yeah and I think there is AI know I</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.380" end="00:18:18.620" style="s2">think that is a valid criticism that</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.789" end="00:18:20.480" style="s2">I&#39;ve read for many of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.620" end="00:18:22.820" style="s2">describing where it&#39;s you know could he</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.480" end="00:18:24.080" style="s2">be saying yes and a bit more with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.820" end="00:18:26.120" style="s2">postmodern side of it because there are</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.080" end="00:18:27.230" style="s2">benefits there are good things and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.120" end="00:18:28.960" style="s2">good we went through a civil rights but</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.230" end="00:18:30.799" style="s2">and all those things they&#39;re positives</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.960" end="00:18:32.539" style="s2">so how would you some of the good things</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.799" end="00:18:35.840" style="s2">about green I would say the good things</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.539" end="00:18:38.570" style="s2">about green are that so I would copy</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.840" end="00:18:40.490" style="s2">anything this postmodern kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.570" end="00:18:42.710" style="s2">everything as a stage to develop as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.490" end="00:18:44.539" style="s2">stage of development is that it takes</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.710" end="00:18:47.030" style="s2">you out of the rigidity of the previous</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.539" end="00:18:49.309" style="s2">stages so it allows you to start playing</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.030" end="00:18:50.809" style="s2">yeah playing with identity playing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.309" end="00:18:53.840" style="s2">the way things are done playing with</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.809" end="00:18:56.000" style="s2">power dynamics and that playing creates</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.840" end="00:18:57.429" style="s2">growth and it&#39;s an important stage you</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.000" end="00:18:59.929" style="s2">know because we free ourselves from</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.429" end="00:19:01.520" style="s2">restrictive social situations from</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.929" end="00:19:04.039" style="s2">restrictive laws from restrictive ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.520" end="00:19:05.210" style="s2">of seeing things you know I&#39;ve got and</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.039" end="00:19:08.450" style="s2">getting different perspectives from</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.210" end="00:19:10.159" style="s2">different is a big part of it is getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.450" end="00:19:11.330" style="s2">the the perspective of the underdog of</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.159" end="00:19:14.539" style="s2">the person who&#39;s oppressed you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.330" end="00:19:17.510" style="s2">which they&#39;ve taken to absurd levels but</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.539" end="00:19:23.559" style="s2">as a concept it&#39;s important to get many</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.510" end="00:19:26.720" style="s2">voices but you also need to have a so</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.559" end="00:19:29.510" style="s2">Francois Lyotard said that who&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.720" end="00:19:31.340" style="s2">the kind of fathers of post-modernism or</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.510" end="00:19:32.840" style="s2">what would become post-modernism this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.340" end="00:19:35.539" style="s2">very postmodern it&#39;s like oh there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.840" end="00:19:38.510" style="s2">such thing as post-modernism but he said</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.539" end="00:19:40.730" style="s2">without the sublime which is this I this</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.510" end="00:19:43.460" style="s2">is the point at which language fails</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.730" end="00:19:45.169" style="s2">it&#39;s the point at which the you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.460" end="00:19:46.820" style="s2">encounter the transcendent and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.169" end="00:19:48.840" style="s2">cannot describe it is it kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.820" end="00:19:51.210" style="s2">ineffable so without the sublime</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.840" end="00:19:53.250" style="s2">this whole thing is doomed to madness</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.210" end="00:19:55.470" style="s2">because you have to with all that</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.250" end="00:19:57.029" style="s2">playing this whole relativity you like</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.470" end="00:19:59.100" style="s2">with all of that playing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.029" end="00:20:01.110" style="s2">doing you&#39;ve got to have an anchor</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.100" end="00:20:02.909" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to have an anchor then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.110" end="00:20:05.340" style="s2">safe then it reminds me actually then</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.909" end="00:20:06.900" style="s2">it&#39;s very psychedelic it&#39;s a you know in</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.340" end="00:20:09.330" style="s2">the psychedelic experience it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.900" end="00:20:13.230" style="s2">deconstructed experience extremely so</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.330" end="00:20:14.820" style="s2">and when you have a bad trip it&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.230" end="00:20:16.620" style="s2">you forget that you&#39;re tripping and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.820" end="00:20:18.299" style="s2">forget that you&#39;re present you lose your</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.620" end="00:20:20.929" style="s2">ground of being you lose your presence</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.299" end="00:20:23.730" style="s2">and you get swept up in the the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.929" end="00:20:25.409" style="s2">that&#39;s why they always you always tell</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.730" end="00:20:27.690" style="s2">people in a psychedelic emergency this</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.409" end="00:20:29.010" style="s2">will end it contextualizes that you are</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.690" end="00:20:31.440" style="s2">having a drug experience you are having</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.010" end="00:20:33.779" style="s2">this experience and it&#39;s going to end so</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.440" end="00:20:37.230" style="s2">that kind of madness can can infect the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.779" end="00:20:38.700" style="s2">whole society as well in addition to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.230" end="00:20:44.070" style="s2">films and stuff we&#39;re putting out we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.700" end="00:20:45.450" style="s2">also doing events because I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.070" end="00:20:46.919" style="s2">reason I really wanted to see Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.450" end="00:20:49.700" style="s2">and a lot of my questions were about</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.919" end="00:20:52.200" style="s2">integration of the shadow because what</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.700" end="00:20:54.149" style="s2">I&#39;ve done a lot of shadow work a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.200" end="00:20:56.159" style="s2">integration work we&#39;re sort of working</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.149" end="00:20:58.289" style="s2">with your anger working integrating all</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.159" end="00:21:00.450" style="s2">the negative parts of yourself the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.289" end="00:21:01.980" style="s2">Jungian idea of all the parts we repress</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.450" end="00:21:03.450" style="s2">and deny and integrating them to become</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.980" end="00:21:06.480" style="s2">most of the present in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.450" end="00:21:08.429" style="s2">powerful and I found my life being</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.480" end="00:21:10.649" style="s2">transformed as I&#39;ve done that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.429" end="00:21:13.470" style="s2">work like being yeah things have started</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.649" end="00:21:15.179" style="s2">to sort of come together and I found it</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.470" end="00:21:19.080" style="s2">really powerful and hearing him talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.179" end="00:21:21.570" style="s2">about it just overlaid everything I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.080" end="00:21:23.010" style="s2">ever learned the hard way like he was</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.570" end="00:21:24.649" style="s2">describing the process that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.010" end="00:21:26.700" style="s2">through he was describing all of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.649" end="00:21:29.190" style="s2">integration stuff so I was like wow this</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.700" end="00:21:31.409" style="s2">the first thinker I&#39;ve found to describe</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.190" end="00:21:35.399" style="s2">this process in detail and get it</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.409" end="00:21:37.950" style="s2">exactly right so also therefore the</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.399" end="00:21:40.740" style="s2">focus on this message of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.950" end="00:21:42.899" style="s2">integration also demands for me like</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.740" end="00:21:46.110" style="s2">real-world events but we have to do the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.899" end="00:21:47.820" style="s2">work it&#39;s not enough just to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.110" end="00:21:51.110" style="s2">it and it&#39;s it&#39;s invaluable to talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.820" end="00:21:53.309" style="s2">about it and to do it and to kind of to</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.110" end="00:21:54.750" style="s2">bring this knowledge out to as many</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.309" end="00:21:58.530" style="s2">people as possible but actually to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.750" end="00:22:00.630" style="s2">people give people the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.530" end="00:22:01.480" style="s2">doing the work themselves is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.630" end="00:22:04.389" style="s2">essential part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.480" end="00:22:06.549" style="s2">and therefore and this was happening in</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.389" end="00:22:08.590" style="s2">parallel we like both of us have done</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.549" end="00:22:11.559" style="s2">quite a lot this kind of work and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.590" end="00:22:14.080" style="s2">being mentored by a guy who&#39;s done this</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.559" end="00:22:16.360" style="s2">work for about 40 years and where we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.080" end="00:22:18.549" style="s2">been learning to lead groups ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.360" end="00:22:22.990" style="s2">or little facilitate workshops where</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.549" end="00:22:24.940" style="s2">people can come and just have a weekend</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.990" end="00:22:27.039" style="s2">or a certain time to just look at what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.940" end="00:22:28.299" style="s2">at their shadow look at what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.039" end="00:22:30.669" style="s2">working in their lives look at what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.299" end="00:22:32.230" style="s2">holding them back and identifying that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.669" end="00:22:35.010" style="s2">part of themselves that wants it to</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.230" end="00:22:38.620" style="s2">change and can make it change and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.010" end="00:22:40.570" style="s2">yeah and transforming or getting a taste</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.620" end="00:22:41.889" style="s2">of what it might be like to move past</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.570" end="00:22:45.460" style="s2">whatever these blockages are in their</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.889" end="00:22:48.130" style="s2">lives and and what&#39;s fascinating as well</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.460" end="00:22:51.070" style="s2">is that this has really mapped onto the</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.130" end="00:22:52.659" style="s2">Jordan Pederson work like it&#39;s before a</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.070" end="00:22:55.510" style="s2">lot of this work is sort of often done</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.659" end="00:22:58.690" style="s2">in a sort of cuts like a New Age hippie</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.510" end="00:23:00.820" style="s2">kind of vibe of vulnerability and</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.690" end="00:23:03.789" style="s2">sharing a truth and all this other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.820" end="00:23:08.289" style="s2">and what Peterson does is reframes in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.789" end="00:23:11.230" style="s2">much more solid way of you are coming</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.289" end="00:23:12.490" style="s2">here to align yourself with your deeper</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.230" end="00:23:14.440" style="s2">truth you&#39;re coming to align yourself</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.490" end="00:23:15.940" style="s2">with the logos you are coming to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.440" end="00:23:18.190" style="s2">integrate your shadow and you&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.940" end="00:23:20.380" style="s2">to become more fully present to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.190" end="00:23:22.539" style="s2">and this is the deeper story of Western</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.380" end="00:23:25.000" style="s2">culture and that for me is is an</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.539" end="00:23:26.200" style="s2">incredibly powerful reframing of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.000" end="00:23:28.630" style="s2">kind of work we&#39;ve been doing for quite</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.200" end="00:23:32.409" style="s2">a long time absolutely yeah and it it</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.630" end="00:23:34.570" style="s2">really speaks to the you know he talks</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.409" end="00:23:36.700" style="s2">about this difference between rights and</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.570" end="00:23:38.110" style="s2">responsibilities you know a law and men</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.700" end="00:23:41.380" style="s2">really connect with that we you know I</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.110" end="00:23:44.470" style="s2">certainly do and the ultimate person</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.380" end="00:23:46.690" style="s2">responsibility is is over your own your</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.470" end="00:23:50.230" style="s2">own inner house over your own being you</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.690" end="00:23:52.659" style="s2">know it&#39;s that you do the work and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.230" end="00:23:56.620" style="s2">show up as we say a lot you know you</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.659" end="00:23:58.240" style="s2">have to show up tell the truth you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.620" end="00:24:00.370" style="s2">be honest with yourself be honest with</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.240" end="00:24:01.750" style="s2">someone else which is even more</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.370" end="00:24:05.500" style="s2">challenging I would say but more</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.750" end="00:24:07.210" style="s2">rewarding and also be be brave enough to</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.500" end="00:24:09.159" style="s2">go into the places you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.210" end="00:24:10.570" style="s2">look at you know if that responsibly</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.159" end="00:24:12.730" style="s2">because no one else can do that for you</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.570" end="00:24:13.960" style="s2">so all you can really do in a workshop</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.730" end="00:24:16.299" style="s2">is really</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.960" end="00:24:18.940" style="s2">hold the space and guide that process to</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.299" end="00:24:20.140" style="s2">happen but it&#39;s it&#39;s every man I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.940" end="00:24:22.240" style="s2">talking specific about the men&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.140" end="00:24:23.590" style="s2">that we&#39;re doing because we there is</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.240" end="00:24:25.210" style="s2">women&#39;s work as well but we don&#39;t run it</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.590" end="00:24:28.120" style="s2">so you know and we connect deeply with</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.210" end="00:24:31.000" style="s2">men&#39;s work it&#39;s that kind of personal</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.120" end="00:24:33.010" style="s2">responsibility and then the support of</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.000" end="00:24:35.559" style="s2">one another which is astonishing you</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.010" end="00:24:38.080" style="s2">know it always amazes me yeah I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.559" end="00:24:40.720" style="s2">started again I think we started this</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.080" end="00:24:42.279" style="s2">before even I discovered you know we</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.720" end="00:24:43.539" style="s2">started this before you can discovering</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.279" end="00:24:45.309" style="s2">Jordan Peterson which is another kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.539" end="00:24:47.649" style="s2">uncanny synchronicity that it overlaid</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.309" end="00:24:53.860" style="s2">on to this as we started teaching men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.649" end="00:24:55.720" style="s2">work and because this is where I we see</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.860" end="00:24:58.720" style="s2">the greatest need right now it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.720" end="00:25:02.980" style="s2">this is men as Peterson talks about are</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.720" end="00:25:05.980" style="s2">in some sense more lost by this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.980" end="00:25:07.899" style="s2">rights against responsibilities men have</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.980" end="00:25:09.580" style="s2">to carry a load men have to be directed</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.899" end="00:25:11.440" style="s2">men have to have to take on</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.580" end="00:25:14.679" style="s2">responsibility without responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.440" end="00:25:19.480" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of lost and I guess I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.679" end="00:25:21.520" style="s2">knew that before and I also really</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.480" end="00:25:24.220" style="s2">recognized in my own life as I started</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.520" end="00:25:27.370" style="s2">working on my masculinity and working on</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.220" end="00:25:29.409" style="s2">it with other men there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.370" end="00:25:33.909" style="s2">we&#39;re missing a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.409" end="00:25:37.960" style="s2">this idea of vitamin M that something of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.909" end="00:25:40.860" style="s2">being around with other men and talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.960" end="00:25:43.210" style="s2">truthfully with them and really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.860" end="00:25:45.340" style="s2">looking at ourselves really owning our</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.210" end="00:25:48.880" style="s2">stuff is feeding something like really</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.340" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">deep in us like I think and and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.880" end="00:25:52.419" style="s2">who we are and seeing who we are in</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:54.760" style="s2">these spaces like we would have kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.419" end="00:25:56.320" style="s2">worked together on a common project it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.760" end="00:26:01.270" style="s2">like a common project we can find and do</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.320" end="00:26:03.789" style="s2">together and this really feeds my soul</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.270" end="00:26:05.919" style="s2">to be of all the things that we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.789" end="00:26:07.960" style="s2">like I know all the success that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.919" end="00:26:09.789" style="s2">had so far with the films and stuff what</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.960" end="00:26:12.820" style="s2">really feeds my soul is the workshops</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.789" end="00:26:14.590" style="s2">and being there and hearing guys say wow</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.820" end="00:26:17.440" style="s2">I never never felt this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.590" end="00:26:19.929" style="s2">brotherhood before I&#39;ve never I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.440" end="00:26:23.440" style="s2">realized stuff about myself and had a</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.929" end="00:26:24.820" style="s2">and a life-changing experience and this</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.440" end="00:26:27.280" style="s2">is what&#39;s extraordinary we did the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.820" end="00:26:28.960" style="s2">workshop in in April and</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.280" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">cuz a lot of the guys have come through</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.960" end="00:26:33.430" style="s2">the Jordan Peterson documentaries there</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:35.050" style="s2">was a they knew the shadow they knew the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.430" end="00:26:38.200" style="s2">idea of aligning oneself with the truth</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.050" end="00:26:40.900" style="s2">they were ready to go and they really</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.200" end="00:26:44.650" style="s2">went deep and it was just or inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.900" end="00:26:48.430" style="s2">to behold and really feels like we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.650" end="00:26:49.990" style="s2">the verge of something if we can keep</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.430" end="00:26:51.880" style="s2">building this and people will keep</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.990" end="00:26:54.730" style="s2">coming to the workshop I think we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.880" end="00:26:56.020" style="s2">the verge of but this this for me is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.730" end="00:27:00.040" style="s2">cutting edge of where we need to go as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.020" end="00:27:06.100" style="s2">culture to re-embrace I think what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.040" end="00:27:07.780" style="s2">what we&#39;ve confused is the idea of we do</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.100" end="00:27:10.210" style="s2">need to integrate both masculine and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.780" end="00:27:12.790" style="s2">feminine qualities within ourselves but</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.210" end="00:27:15.070" style="s2">the way to do that is by really</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.790" end="00:27:17.470" style="s2">connecting with our four men with our</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.070" end="00:27:19.780" style="s2">masculinity and then we can connect with</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.470" end="00:27:22.150" style="s2">sort of more feminine side what Jung</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.780" end="00:27:24.100" style="s2">called the master work is integrating</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.150" end="00:27:27.190" style="s2">the Animas of the female part of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.100" end="00:27:29.230" style="s2">ourselves and that comes through through</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.190" end="00:27:31.240" style="s2">really connecting to our masculine it</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.230" end="00:27:32.830" style="s2">gives us the grounding to then be able</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.240" end="00:27:35.080" style="s2">to integrate the feminine and also to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.830" end="00:27:37.630" style="s2">able to like meeting women for a much</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.080" end="00:27:39.460" style="s2">more grounded place so the coming young</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.630" end="00:27:44.080" style="s2">me in terms the inner and outer feminine</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.460" end="00:27:45.880" style="s2">but you get a much like women can feel</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.080" end="00:27:46.900" style="s2">that they can trust you far more when</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.880" end="00:27:48.550" style="s2">you&#39;re really connected to your</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.900" end="00:27:50.260" style="s2">masculine you&#39;re not you&#39;re not ashamed</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.550" end="00:27:52.830" style="s2">of it you&#39;re not kind of sneaking around</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.260" end="00:27:55.270" style="s2">trying to it&#39;s it&#39;s a very different</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.830" end="00:27:57.400" style="s2">quality of presence that you bring yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.270" end="00:28:00.460" style="s2">absolutely with with women and men you</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.400" end="00:28:03.370" style="s2">know and presence is such an important</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.460" end="00:28:05.200" style="s2">word because true presence were you</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.370" end="00:28:08.860" style="s2">really connected to yourself implies</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.200" end="00:28:10.330" style="s2">that you are aligning yourself properly</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.860" end="00:28:12.250" style="s2">because I you know having taught</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.330" end="00:28:14.980" style="s2">meditation for years one thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.250" end="00:28:17.350" style="s2">noticed is that there&#39;s something you</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.980" end="00:28:19.360" style="s2">know when we&#39;re not present it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.350" end="00:28:21.610" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to be we don&#39;t really want</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.360" end="00:28:23.290" style="s2">to be with ourselves in that moment you</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.610" end="00:28:24.670" style="s2">know so when you come into being like</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.290" end="00:28:26.470" style="s2">Who am I</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.670" end="00:28:27.790" style="s2">like what am i bringing what am I</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.470" end="00:28:30.580" style="s2">feeling what do I need to go through</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.790" end="00:28:32.710" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the Warriors process it</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.580" end="00:28:35.980" style="s2">really is it&#39;s a process of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.710" end="00:28:38.410" style="s2">inner it&#39;s a deep inner process that</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.980" end="00:28:39.920" style="s2">requires courage and like you were</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.410" end="00:28:42.590" style="s2">saying you know when it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.920" end="00:28:46.850" style="s2">and on the workshops you know I&#39;ve sat</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.590" end="00:28:49.850" style="s2">in many psychedelic ceremonies and many</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.850" end="00:28:51.530" style="s2">meditation retreats and some amazing</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.850" end="00:28:53.960" style="s2">group work and there is just something</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.530" end="00:28:56.600" style="s2">that happens in that space with just men</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.960" end="00:28:59.930" style="s2">that you know we call it vitamin M</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.600" end="00:29:01.700" style="s2">because it needs some kind of a afraid&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.930" end="00:29:03.890" style="s2">because it&#39;s very hard to describe in</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.700" end="00:29:05.870" style="s2">language it&#39;s a feeling you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.890" end="00:29:08.690" style="s2">feeling in the air and it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.870" end="00:29:10.910" style="s2">groundedness and it&#39;s one of support and</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.690" end="00:29:14.350" style="s2">also for me I feel a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.910" end="00:29:17.330" style="s2">relief in the whole space of like oh</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.350" end="00:29:19.580" style="s2">it&#39;s okay to be a man okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.330" end="00:29:23.230" style="s2">and when you come into that place you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.580" end="00:29:27.080" style="s2">a much wiser more you know integrated</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.230" end="00:29:29.560" style="s2">honest man and you know when men come</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.080" end="00:29:32.810" style="s2">back to you know their partners</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.560" end="00:29:35.330" style="s2">afterwards generally their partners see</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.810" end="00:29:36.890" style="s2">that first off it&#39;s that kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.330" end="00:29:38.750" style="s2">know their feeling in it and that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.890" end="00:29:44.180" style="s2">know they often have good sex and why</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.750" end="00:29:48.050" style="s2">here&#39;s well yeah so yeah it feels yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.180" end="00:29:50.570" style="s2">it feels like that&#39;s where we have to go</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.050" end="00:29:54.550" style="s2">as a culture to me that this reom</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.570" end="00:29:56.900" style="s2">bracing of polarity and then consciously</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.550" end="00:29:58.700" style="s2">so it&#39;s like a paradox I think we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.900" end="00:29:59.960" style="s2">this sort of idea like the even the</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.700" end="00:30:02.210" style="s2">Greeks talked about like this this</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.960" end="00:30:03.530" style="s2">spiritual state of the hero&#39;s gamos the</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.210" end="00:30:05.360" style="s2">idea is the inner marriage of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.530" end="00:30:08.510" style="s2">masculine or feminine within oneself as</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.360" end="00:30:10.280" style="s2">the higher spiritual truth and there and</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.510" end="00:30:11.780" style="s2">I think perhaps we have some echo of</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.280" end="00:30:14.240" style="s2">that because in our culture it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.780" end="00:30:16.610" style="s2">well then gender neutrality is is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.240" end="00:30:17.990" style="s2">way to go it&#39;s like no no gender</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.610" end="00:30:20.750" style="s2">neutrality is not the way to go the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.990" end="00:30:23.900" style="s2">to go is full conscious embodiment of</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.750" end="00:30:26.200" style="s2">the masculine for men full conscious</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.900" end="00:30:28.940" style="s2">embodiment of the feminine for women and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.200" end="00:30:31.220" style="s2">then we can integrate our own in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.940" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">masculine as a woman and in a feminine</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.220" end="00:30:37.070" style="s2">as a man and and then that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:39.950" style="s2">the place that we need to go and that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.070" end="00:30:42.110" style="s2">think is so it&#39;s a paradox as most</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.950" end="00:30:43.660" style="s2">things are a paradox as I also think</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.110" end="00:30:47.740" style="s2">that the paradox of individuality and</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.660" end="00:30:50.030" style="s2">connection is that only by truly</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.740" end="00:30:51.680" style="s2">individuating only by truly going deeply</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.030" end="00:30:52.740" style="s2">into ourselves and going through our</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.680" end="00:30:55.050" style="s2">stuff can we</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.740" end="00:30:57.210" style="s2">reach this point where we can really</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.050" end="00:30:59.640" style="s2">meet other people and we can feel that</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.210" end="00:31:02.610" style="s2">in some sense this sort of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.640" end="00:31:04.920" style="s2">truth that we are all the same person</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.610" end="00:31:06.540" style="s2">looking at each other in some sense like</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.920" end="00:31:09.720" style="s2">we are consciousness discovering itself</p>

<p begin="00:31:09.720" end="00:31:14.330" style="s2">the paradox is we can only get there</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.420" end="00:31:16.350" style="s2">through the deep work on ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.330" end="00:31:17.670" style="s2">individually and this is something in</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.350" end="00:31:19.080" style="s2">our workshops we talk about and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:31:22.290" end="00:31:26.790" style="s2">don&#39;t have to do it alone</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.280" end="00:31:30.540" style="s2">which i think is a perfect summation and</p>
