<p begin="00:02:04.159" end="00:02:07.439" style="s2">being sort of the the over mind of not</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.159" end="00:02:08.800" style="s2">going too much into the details but</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.439" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">asking questions and then the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.800" end="00:02:12.080" style="s2">person will sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">try to think more short term but give</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.080" end="00:02:15.040" style="s2">precise answers i get this feeling</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">sometimes for uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.040" end="00:02:18.480" style="s2">even in the conversations i had with</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:20.480" style="s2">john sometimes we sort of did</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.480" end="00:02:22.080" style="s2">sometimes it went both ways like i think</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.480" end="00:02:24.560" style="s2">our in our second conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.080" end="00:02:26.480" style="s2">i had like a i had a good grasp of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.560" end="00:02:29.440" style="s2">john&#39;s overall body of work and i asked</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.480" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">for such questions in a few places uh so</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.440" end="00:02:32.000" style="s2">there i was more</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:33.599" style="s2">trying to be all-encompassing and john</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.000" end="00:02:34.879" style="s2">gave precise answers but for all of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.599" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">other discussions and especially the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.879" end="00:02:39.920" style="s2">last one i really felt it were</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">he he he sort of had a much</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.920" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">wider perspective and he was asking me</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">precise questions and i was able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">give precise answers that he found</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:49.360" style="s2">interesting but i i was able to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:50.400" style="s2">lose myself into the details and i could</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.360" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2">trust that it would sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.400" end="00:02:54.239" style="s2">bring us back into like a wire topic</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.200" end="00:02:57.120" style="s2">afterwards it was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.239" end="00:02:58.400" style="s2">nice nice uh nice duel well on my</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.120" end="00:03:00.560" style="s2">podcast what i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.400" end="00:03:02.720" style="s2">enjoying lately is just going deep with</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.560" end="00:03:05.519" style="s2">people and i&#39;ve also noticed that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.720" end="00:03:07.280" style="s2">enjoyed a a three-person dynamic a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.519" end="00:03:08.879" style="s2">and that i was i&#39;m sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.280" end="00:03:10.480" style="s2">i think of it as like a rock band where</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.879" end="00:03:11.680" style="s2">i&#39;m like the drummer or something or the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.480" end="00:03:14.879" style="s2">bassist or</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.680" end="00:03:16.239" style="s2">you know and um i like this dynamic of</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.879" end="00:03:18.239" style="s2">three because it&#39;s not just so</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.239" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">intense one-on-one and there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.239" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">always someone to bring you back</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:23.360" style="s2">kind of to uh um so i often my role in</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.360" end="00:03:26.959" style="s2">discussions with guys like like john and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:29.840" style="s2">zach and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.959" end="00:03:31.040" style="s2">um sort of they go very into the you</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.840" end="00:03:33.440" style="s2">know intense</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.040" end="00:03:35.840" style="s2">um conceptual stuff and i want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.440" end="00:03:37.519" style="s2">compress that and i want to make that</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.840" end="00:03:39.360" style="s2">particular that i want to make that</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.519" end="00:03:42.159" style="s2">understandable to me and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.360" end="00:03:43.200" style="s2">so i sort of bring it back in every time</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.159" end="00:03:46.159" style="s2">does that make</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.200" end="00:03:47.760" style="s2">yes yeah i think so so yeah maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.159" end="00:03:51.680" style="s2">try to do this with uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.760" end="00:03:54.879" style="s2">with symbolism to to start with um</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.680" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">so the way i see symbolism is</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.879" end="00:03:58.480" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to use the same metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:01.120" style="s2">and analogies to get that symbols</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.480" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">uh where we try to study let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.120" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">structural relations between</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:06.080" style="s2">the different layers of being to try to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:08.319" style="s2">pinpoint some</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.080" end="00:04:09.760" style="s2">symbols where i see symbols at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.319" end="00:04:13.040" style="s2">mediators between</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.760" end="00:04:15.360" style="s2">those different layers of being so</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.040" end="00:04:17.199" style="s2">one i like to use a lot is the the head</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.360" end="00:04:20.000" style="s2">in the case of head body symbolism</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.199" end="00:04:20.799" style="s2">because we&#39;re on the one end we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.000" end="00:04:24.000" style="s2">material</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.799" end="00:04:27.120" style="s2">uh our body is is is material</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.000" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">but we also have a mind and we know that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.120" end="00:04:29.600" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:31.440" style="s2">the head mediates between the two and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.600" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">don&#39;t have to get into the precise</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.440" end="00:04:36.880" style="s2">um like theories of mind that</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.639" end="00:04:38.479" style="s2">would you rather be a non-reductive</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.880" end="00:04:39.600" style="s2">cyclist like john would you rather be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.479" end="00:04:40.960" style="s2">dualist a materialist</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.600" end="00:04:43.440" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really matter as long as you</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.960" end="00:04:44.800" style="s2">admit that there is something like mine</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.440" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">that there&#39;s something like matter</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.800" end="00:04:47.840" style="s2">and we know that the head media is</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:51.120" style="s2">between the two and we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.840" end="00:04:53.120" style="s2">this uh this symbolic fact that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.120" end="00:04:54.320" style="s2">the head is a symbol that mediates</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.120" end="00:04:56.479" style="s2">between our body</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.320" end="00:04:57.440" style="s2">and our mind so we can see that the head</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.479" end="00:05:01.039" style="s2">is a symbol of our</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.440" end="00:05:04.160" style="s2">mind you can say right right and i</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.039" end="00:05:05.840" style="s2">and we can use this</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.160" end="00:05:07.919" style="s2">basic pattern and apply that other</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.840" end="00:05:09.280" style="s2">levels of being as well the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.919" end="00:05:11.280" style="s2">the hand mediates between the head and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.280" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">the body is analogous to what happens</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.280" end="00:05:14.479" style="s2">uh sorry the fact that the enemy is</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:15.759" style="s2">between the mind and the body is</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.479" end="00:05:18.800" style="s2">analogous what happens</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.759" end="00:05:19.840" style="s2">in a cell between the the genetic</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.800" end="00:05:22.800" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.840" end="00:05:24.320" style="s2">is mediated by the nucleus to the other</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.800" end="00:05:25.199" style="s2">organelles so you have again something</p>

<p begin="00:05:35.280" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">this all together and the the nucleus is</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:42.160" style="s2">the symbol of the the cell it&#39;s the the</p>

<p begin="00:05:43.759" end="00:05:46.880" style="s2">organelles and we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.280" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">take this up at i o levels of being as</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.880" end="00:05:53.280" style="s2">well right so that&#39;s what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.919" end="00:05:55.039" style="s2">we don&#39;t really understand often how</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.280" end="00:05:57.039" style="s2">how you know how we&#39;re using symbols all</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.039" end="00:05:58.639" style="s2">the time when we talk about the atom</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.039" end="00:06:01.039" style="s2">or something like that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.639" end="00:06:01.919" style="s2">describing anything that&#39;s actual like</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.039" end="00:06:03.199" style="s2">we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.919" end="00:06:05.600" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re compressing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.199" end="00:06:07.919" style="s2">information and making a map and just</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.600" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">and calling that an atom but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.919" end="00:06:11.199" style="s2">resemble</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.639" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">uh an atom in any kind of way right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.199" end="00:06:15.039" style="s2">yeah you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:17.600" style="s2">kill this don&#39;t we i mean yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.039" end="00:06:19.520" style="s2">yeah we have to guess i think that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">the atom can be an interesting one</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.520" end="00:06:25.759" style="s2">it&#39;s it we do work with symbols</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.280" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">the the atom well the way we would</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.759" end="00:06:30.080" style="s2">represent it let&#39;s say in a book</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">uh let&#39;s see you have the you have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.080" end="00:06:33.120" style="s2">nucleus and then you have a few</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:34.319" style="s2">particles orbiting around it like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.120" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">solar system</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.319" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">we know that it&#39;s not actually like this</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:39.840" style="s2">but it&#39;s a good symbol</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">for the atom it&#39;s a good representation</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.840" end="00:06:43.199" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:45.360" style="s2">communicate between us uh humans and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.199" end="00:06:48.639" style="s2">what actually happens within</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.360" end="00:06:49.919" style="s2">a within a real atom so it mediates</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.639" end="00:06:51.840" style="s2">between the atom and those</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.919" end="00:06:53.039" style="s2">and in that sense it&#39;s it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.840" end="00:06:54.400" style="s2">symbol and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.039" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">don&#39;t have the choice but to work with</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.400" end="00:06:57.120" style="s2">with those all the time even with words</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:06:58.960" style="s2">you can see words</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.120" end="00:07:00.800" style="s2">this way you can say that symbols are a</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.960" end="00:07:04.319" style="s2">mediator between</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.800" end="00:07:07.520" style="s2">you know uh complexity</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.319" end="00:07:08.319" style="s2">um and so it&#39;s a language that we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.520" end="00:07:10.240" style="s2">understand that</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.319" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">it&#39;s always the mediator that makes the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.240" end="00:07:15.360" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:17.520" style="s2">complex information um</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">uh articulate to us or something</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.520" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">otherwise we would just</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.639" end="00:07:21.759" style="s2">live in a sea of you know infinite sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:24.639" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.759" end="00:07:25.520" style="s2">regress and chaos and and combinatorial</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.639" end="00:07:28.400" style="s2">explosion</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.520" end="00:07:29.840" style="s2">yeah john&#39;s language yeah we sort of be</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.400" end="00:07:31.440" style="s2">stuck at the ground level of physics</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.840" end="00:07:33.919" style="s2">it would just be like potential and</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.440" end="00:07:34.639" style="s2">chaos and we need symbols to reach</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.919" end="00:07:37.039" style="s2">higher yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.639" end="00:07:38.560" style="s2">we need symbols to abstract into higher</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.039" end="00:07:42.479" style="s2">level phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.560" end="00:07:45.280" style="s2">right higher level yeah so um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.479" end="00:07:46.400" style="s2">um and we also need symbols to ground us</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.280" end="00:07:48.879" style="s2">too like you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:50.319" style="s2">higher level phenomena right yeah but i</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.879" end="00:07:52.240" style="s2">would assume that we also need symbols</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.319" end="00:07:54.319" style="s2">to bring us back into embodied reality</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.240" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">right at the same time so there&#39;s a sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.319" end="00:07:57.599" style="s2">of um</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">you know upward motion and then a</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.599" end="00:08:01.199" style="s2">grounding motion as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:02.400" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah that&#39;s what symbols can</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.199" end="00:08:05.360" style="s2">like allow</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.400" end="00:08:06.080" style="s2">the ir to come down to our level if uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.360" end="00:08:08.639" style="s2">let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.080" end="00:08:10.479" style="s2">yeah and we can probably get into what</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.639" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">would happen in buddhism for instance</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.479" end="00:08:15.599" style="s2">but i know that within</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:16.319" style="s2">let&#39;s say uh christianity when you go to</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.599" end="00:08:18.479" style="s2">church</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.319" end="00:08:19.759" style="s2">there are symbols that will make hit</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.479" end="00:08:20.560" style="s2">between the community and you and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.759" end="00:08:23.840" style="s2">ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.560" end="00:08:25.680" style="s2">we claim between uh the ground of being</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.840" end="00:08:27.360" style="s2">and us and it will go through symbols</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.680" end="00:08:28.479" style="s2">that we see in the church so</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.360" end="00:08:31.360" style="s2">the fact that let&#39;s see we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:34.959" style="s2">assembled together in a building facing</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.360" end="00:08:37.680" style="s2">the eucharist for instance uh is</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.959" end="00:08:39.839" style="s2">the eucharist there will be a symbol of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.680" end="00:08:41.360" style="s2">the community and also of god uh that</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.839" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">unites all of us together</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.360" end="00:08:44.880" style="s2">we all we&#39;re it&#39;s really like a body</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">united around itself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.880" end="00:08:48.399" style="s2">we&#39;re all facing in the same direction</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:51.279" style="s2">we all bring our our own</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.399" end="00:08:53.279" style="s2">like concerns and thoughts and so on to</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.279" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">this one point and we also let this one</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.279" end="00:08:55.760" style="s2">point inform</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:57.440" style="s2">all of us with all of its rich geology</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.760" end="00:08:59.839" style="s2">and different people have different</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.440" end="00:09:00.959" style="s2">let&#39;s say slivers of all of this in</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.839" end="00:09:03.760" style="s2">their in their minds</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.959" end="00:09:05.519" style="s2">but still we&#39;re all informed by this uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:09.360" style="s2">one symbol that gathers all of us</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.519" end="00:09:12.720" style="s2">uh and so this fact this symbol</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.360" end="00:09:14.080" style="s2">will allow let&#39;s say transcendent value</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.720" end="00:09:16.080" style="s2">ultimately i would claim the goal of</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.080" end="00:09:17.440" style="s2">being if if and you know this is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.080" end="00:09:18.080" style="s2">specifically christian claim but if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.440" end="00:09:19.519" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.080" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">the ground of being really became</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.519" end="00:09:23.279" style="s2">manifest in in judea 2000 years ago and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:26.080" style="s2">instituted</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.279" end="00:09:27.279" style="s2">the eucharist then uh you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.080" end="00:09:29.200" style="s2">through the ground of being</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.279" end="00:09:30.959" style="s2">institute instituting this 2000 years</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.200" end="00:09:32.480" style="s2">ago and us still doing it today</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.959" end="00:09:35.120" style="s2">it&#39;s the part of being talking to us</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.480" end="00:09:38.399" style="s2">through the symbol through the eucharist</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.120" end="00:09:40.080" style="s2">and unfolding so his life 2000 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.399" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">through the eucharist through the church</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.080" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">in us as well today so</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:46.720" style="s2">so as you said it&#39;s not only that when</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.720" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">you say ground of being that&#39;s a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.720" end="00:09:51.600" style="s2">as well because there&#39;s no ground</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:52.320" style="s2">right uh a literal ground there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.600" end="00:09:54.880" style="s2">bottom or</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.320" end="00:09:55.920" style="s2">top right you just have to use that as</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.880" end="00:09:59.279" style="s2">as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.920" end="00:10:03.120" style="s2">short form right to to say that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.279" end="00:10:06.000" style="s2">within some kind of a cosmos yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.120" end="00:10:08.079" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s right it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.000" end="00:10:10.000" style="s2">because we do think that there</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.079" end="00:10:11.519" style="s2">is a ground of being but obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.000" end="00:10:12.880" style="s2">way we describe it is not perfect</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.519" end="00:10:16.240" style="s2">because we&#39;re humans</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.880" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">so we use so we use</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:20.240" style="s2">yeah we use metaphors or analogies i</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:20.560" style="s2">guess metaphor is never perfect right</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.240" end="00:10:22.560" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.560" end="00:10:23.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s always a short form of some</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.560" end="00:10:25.279" style="s2">kind isn&#39;t it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.600" end="00:10:26.640" style="s2">because you&#39;re not you&#39;re not comparing</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.279" end="00:10:28.880" style="s2">two equivalent things</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.640" end="00:10:30.320" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s difficult i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.880" end="00:10:31.680" style="s2">trying to articulate precisely what</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.320" end="00:10:34.959" style="s2">could be the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.680" end="00:10:35.839" style="s2">let&#39;s say mere symbol or let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.959" end="00:10:37.920" style="s2">mirror metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.839" end="00:10:39.920" style="s2">and a symbol and i&#39;m not exactly clear</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.920" end="00:10:43.120" style="s2">how i would make the decision exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.920" end="00:10:44.480" style="s2">it&#39;s still it it all still seems i mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.120" end="00:10:45.680" style="s2">it&#39;s difficult on one end because</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.480" end="00:10:46.720" style="s2">different people have different ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.680" end="00:10:50.640" style="s2">what a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.720" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">is uh and i know that let&#39;s say symbols</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.640" end="00:10:53.839" style="s2">can be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:54.399" style="s2">you can get your symbolism wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.839" end="00:10:56.720" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.399" end="00:10:58.000" style="s2">it can degenerate into something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.720" end="00:10:59.760" style="s2">not quite right but that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.000" end="00:11:02.000" style="s2">people could still call a metaphor i</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.760" end="00:11:03.040" style="s2">don&#39;t know like um</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.000" end="00:11:05.360" style="s2">i&#39;ve been playing with especially</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.040" end="00:11:05.760" style="s2">because are you talking about symbols</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:07.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.760" end="00:11:09.440" style="s2">sacred symbols i think is what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.440" end="00:11:12.240" style="s2">talking about in some sense right</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.440" end="00:11:14.160" style="s2">because there&#39;s just gimbals right</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">everything is a symbol a dog is a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:18.720" style="s2">of a dog like the word dog</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.839" end="00:11:19.519" style="s2">is a symbol of a dog it&#39;s just language</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.720" end="00:11:21.200" style="s2">is symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.519" end="00:11:22.720" style="s2">right but but when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.200" end="00:11:23.519" style="s2">getting it right and wrong i think</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.720" end="00:11:25.440" style="s2">you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.519" end="00:11:28.160" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about symbol symbolism</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.440" end="00:11:29.440" style="s2">within a sacred um</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.160" end="00:11:32.000" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting proposal i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:32.480" style="s2">think that is i think it can still be</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.000" end="00:11:36.720" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.480" end="00:11:39.839" style="s2">even before we get to the level of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:41.600" style="s2">a religion um and it also yeah even the</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.839" end="00:11:43.200" style="s2">other way around because we do</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.600" end="00:11:44.399" style="s2">claim within christianity there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.200" end="00:11:45.839" style="s2">something real special even just about</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.399" end="00:11:49.120" style="s2">language about logos</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.839" end="00:11:50.880" style="s2">uh so even like even something as simple</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.120" end="00:11:52.079" style="s2">as our symbolic participation in naming</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.880" end="00:11:54.240" style="s2">the animals</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.079" end="00:11:55.839" style="s2">still like sacred to some extent so</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.240" end="00:11:57.760" style="s2">there would be a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.839" end="00:11:59.040" style="s2">between everyday symbols of even just</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.760" end="00:12:00.959" style="s2">language and</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.040" end="00:12:02.800" style="s2">symbols that create the world like like</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.959" end="00:12:03.760" style="s2">the eucharist or uh like like the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">incarnation so</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.760" end="00:12:07.279" style="s2">this so i would say it&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">continuum but you can get it wrong at</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.279" end="00:12:12.639" style="s2">all of those different layers</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:14.079" style="s2">if you think that uh let&#39;s see the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:15.680" style="s2">in a cell if you think that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.079" end="00:12:17.600" style="s2">mitochondria is the head of the cell</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.680" end="00:12:19.760" style="s2">then then you&#39;re getting it wrong</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.600" end="00:12:20.959" style="s2">it&#39;s not like the inverted symbol or</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.760" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">something you might you can&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.959" end="00:12:24.079" style="s2">upside down</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:25.440" style="s2">you might you might mistake the top the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.079" end="00:12:26.480" style="s2">top from the bottom and i think isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.440" end="00:12:28.480" style="s2">that what jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.480" end="00:12:30.160" style="s2">talks a lot about is this inversion of</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.480" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">symbolism going on in our</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.160" end="00:12:34.399" style="s2">world today yeah it can happen that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.720" end="00:12:36.639" style="s2">just just completely inverted</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.399" end="00:12:38.079" style="s2">uh when you yeah you try to put the</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.639" end="00:12:38.560" style="s2">bottom at the top sometimes it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.079" end="00:12:41.200" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.560" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">like a mismatch of things um or</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.200" end="00:12:43.839" style="s2">intuition starting out right but then</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:46.160" style="s2">that finish up wrong</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.839" end="00:12:47.519" style="s2">like i i&#39;ve been playing with conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.160" end="00:12:50.880" style="s2">theories</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.519" end="00:12:51.360" style="s2">and what conspiracy theories oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.880" end="00:12:52.399" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.360" end="00:12:54.079" style="s2">because you know when you see a</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.399" end="00:12:54.880" style="s2">phenomenon that gathers a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.079" end="00:12:56.959" style="s2">attention like</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.880" end="00:12:58.399" style="s2">a conspiracy about 5g towers or about</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.959" end="00:13:00.079" style="s2">vaccines or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.399" end="00:13:02.000" style="s2">when it gathers a lot of attention it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.079" end="00:13:04.079" style="s2">typically because there is</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.000" end="00:13:05.519" style="s2">there is some intuition there that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.079" end="00:13:07.440" style="s2">widespread enough that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.519" end="00:13:08.880" style="s2">there&#39;s likely some truth to it but then</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.440" end="00:13:13.279" style="s2">it goes up in some direction</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.880" end="00:13:16.079" style="s2">uh so i&#39;ve used cell towers</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.279" end="00:13:17.600" style="s2">uh in the past because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.079" end="00:13:18.959" style="s2">conspiracy right now people burning down</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.600" end="00:13:21.200" style="s2">some towers because they think that</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.959" end="00:13:22.399" style="s2">5g technology has either caused or is</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.200" end="00:13:26.160" style="s2">helping fuel the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.399" end="00:13:27.760" style="s2">the kobe epidemic in some way and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.160" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">this starts with a good intuition of</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.760" end="00:13:30.880" style="s2">people in tweeting that some towers have</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.519" end="00:13:34.959" style="s2">a cause a role to play</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.880" end="00:13:37.760" style="s2">in the crisis somehow that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.959" end="00:13:39.040" style="s2">and and that&#39;s true because our our</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.760" end="00:13:41.199" style="s2">ability to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.040" end="00:13:43.519" style="s2">with uh with cell phones and with social</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.199" end="00:13:45.839" style="s2">media so has has helped fuel</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.519" end="00:13:46.959" style="s2">a panic there and it has made the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.839" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">worse we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.959" end="00:13:50.720" style="s2">go into other causal factors but the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.959" end="00:13:53.120" style="s2">basic idea that there are causal</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.720" end="00:13:55.199" style="s2">patterns that exist at the social level</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.120" end="00:13:56.560" style="s2">uh that are mediated by cell phone</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.199" end="00:13:58.000" style="s2">towers is true so</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.560" end="00:13:59.920" style="s2">it&#39;s true that cell phone towers mediate</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.000" end="00:14:03.440" style="s2">between a social phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.920" end="00:14:05.600" style="s2">and our own material uh vibes</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.440" end="00:14:07.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a true that&#39;s in that sense cell</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.600" end="00:14:09.760" style="s2">towers are a symbol for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.279" end="00:14:10.800" style="s2">for for the virus but you even if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.760" end="00:14:12.320" style="s2">get like this basic</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.800" end="00:14:14.399" style="s2">intuition right it doesn&#39;t get that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.320" end="00:14:16.639" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;ll get the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.399" end="00:14:18.160" style="s2">symbolism quite right because those</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.639" end="00:14:20.000" style="s2">those people who then go on to claim</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:21.680" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.000" end="00:14:23.600" style="s2">the the towers are materially</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.680" end="00:14:26.000" style="s2">responsible for the virus at this point</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.600" end="00:14:27.519" style="s2">they they start to mess up their their</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.000" end="00:14:29.199" style="s2">symbolism they think that the way that</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.519" end="00:14:29.680" style="s2">cell towers mediate between the virus</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.199" end="00:14:33.199" style="s2">and us</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.680" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">is through like some some mysterious uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.199" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">technology in the web themselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:42.399" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s mistaking uh that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.360" end="00:14:44.880" style="s2">levels of symbolism like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.399" end="00:14:46.160" style="s2">you see the whole world as this material</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.880" end="00:14:48.639" style="s2">substance</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.160" end="00:14:49.440" style="s2">but you&#39;re not seeing the subtle root of</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.639" end="00:14:51.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.440" end="00:14:52.720" style="s2">yeah um i think that that&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.360" end="00:14:54.160" style="s2">hearing you&#39;re saying are people are not</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.720" end="00:14:57.279" style="s2">understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.160" end="00:15:00.320" style="s2">um or rather perhaps they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.279" end="00:15:04.000" style="s2">they&#39;re being governed by</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.320" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">symbols unconsciously right</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.000" end="00:15:07.519" style="s2">they&#39;re being controlled by archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:08.639" style="s2">and symbols and all kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.519" end="00:15:10.240" style="s2">that they don&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.639" end="00:15:10.959" style="s2">because they&#39;re only interpreting</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.240" end="00:15:14.720" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.959" end="00:15:17.279" style="s2">in the first degree does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.720" end="00:15:17.839" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah let&#39;s see what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.279" end="00:15:21.279" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.839" end="00:15:22.639" style="s2">and at this point maybe i could say that</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.279" end="00:15:24.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if it would degenerate in</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.639" end="00:15:25.920" style="s2">metaphor already but there are other</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.320" end="00:15:26.399" style="s2">instances of conspiracy theories like</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.920" end="00:15:29.600" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.399" end="00:15:32.720" style="s2">who blame bill gates for putting uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.600" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">microchips and vaccines to uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.720" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">to somehow track us and</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.959" end="00:15:40.160" style="s2">like this is another instance where the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.720" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">the there&#39;s a basic</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.160" end="00:15:44.079" style="s2">intuition there of you know bill gates</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:45.839" style="s2">being responsible for laptops and</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.079" end="00:15:47.440" style="s2">uh a bunch of technology that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.839" end="00:15:48.560" style="s2">actually use and that can actually be</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.440" end="00:15:50.240" style="s2">used to track us</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.560" end="00:15:51.680" style="s2">but it&#39;s something we do voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.240" end="00:15:52.639" style="s2">it&#39;s not something that gets those</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.680" end="00:15:54.639" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.639" end="00:15:56.959" style="s2">through vaccines but the basic intuition</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.639" end="00:15:58.320" style="s2">that uh bill gates is behind technology</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.959" end="00:15:59.920" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:01.759" style="s2">has allowed us to make ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.920" end="00:16:03.839" style="s2">trackable really this is a real</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.759" end="00:16:05.199" style="s2">like social little pattern but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.839" end="00:16:06.160" style="s2">excuse me i&#39;m just closing the window</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.199" end="00:16:09.759" style="s2">here because i have some</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.160" end="00:16:11.680" style="s2">construction outside yeah sure</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.759" end="00:16:13.839" style="s2">yeah but because people then cast it</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.680" end="00:16:14.480" style="s2">down try to cast it on to the material</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.839" end="00:16:16.720" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.480" end="00:16:17.519" style="s2">uh they somehow somewhere comes up with</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.720" end="00:16:19.920" style="s2">the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.519" end="00:16:20.720" style="s2">vaccines mediate between bill gates and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.920" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">us and</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.720" end="00:16:24.480" style="s2">this is wrong uh this is wrong symbolism</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.360" end="00:16:25.519" style="s2">because it&#39;s not true that the vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.480" end="00:16:27.680" style="s2">is a mediator between</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.519" end="00:16:29.680" style="s2">like technology and between bill gates&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.680" end="00:16:31.600" style="s2">technology and ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.680" end="00:16:32.720" style="s2">but maybe in that sense it&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.600" end="00:16:34.720" style="s2">metaphor where</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.720" end="00:16:35.759" style="s2">they they see a like there&#39;s a loose</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.720" end="00:16:37.440" style="s2">connection between</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.759" end="00:16:38.800" style="s2">like technology getting into our bodies</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.440" end="00:16:42.079" style="s2">through vaccines and</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.800" end="00:16:43.759" style="s2">uh it gets tracking us uh somehow but</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.079" end="00:16:45.440" style="s2">it becomes loose at this point i can</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.759" end="00:16:46.959" style="s2">still see like that there&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.440" end="00:16:49.279" style="s2">clearing of intuition there</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.959" end="00:16:51.279" style="s2">but uh maybe so maybe at the same also</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.279" end="00:16:53.360" style="s2">dangerous and powerful because</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.279" end="00:16:55.920" style="s2">uh because symbols are powerful right</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.360" end="00:16:58.079" style="s2">they they change our minds and they</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.920" end="00:16:59.120" style="s2">they uh you know cause us to behave in</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.079" end="00:17:02.880" style="s2">certain ways and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.120" end="00:17:03.279" style="s2">and uh so so if if we don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.880" end="00:17:04.799" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.279" end="00:17:06.720" style="s2">if we don&#39;t understand what&#39;s really if</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.799" end="00:17:09.839" style="s2">we don&#39;t study them deeply</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.720" end="00:17:10.319" style="s2">then we can easily get lost in in in</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.839" end="00:17:12.400" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.319" end="00:17:13.600" style="s2">you know unconscious symbolism i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.400" end="00:17:16.799" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.600" end="00:17:19.039" style="s2">and something that i think honey talks</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.799" end="00:17:19.039" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.400" end="00:17:23.120" style="s2">i&#39;m reading him at the moment too</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.679" end="00:17:24.640" style="s2">actually i&#39;ve been talking a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.120" end="00:17:26.880" style="s2">him and thinking a lot about him</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.640" end="00:17:28.400" style="s2">yeah cool yeah if we like we if you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.880" end="00:17:30.160" style="s2">like we can try to</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.400" end="00:17:32.160" style="s2">piss out some something about symbolism</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.160" end="00:17:35.200" style="s2">from him because</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.160" end="00:17:36.480" style="s2">i i talked to i talked with</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.200" end="00:17:38.160" style="s2">craig stewart i don&#39;t know if you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:39.520" style="s2">ever watched some of his videos he has</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.160" end="00:17:42.559" style="s2">talked with jonathan and with</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.520" end="00:17:45.200" style="s2">paul mcclay he has done</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.559" end="00:17:46.480" style="s2">uh he has been studying gerard for for</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.200" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">several years</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.480" end="00:17:54.000" style="s2">and he pointed out to me lately that</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:57.360" style="s2">the you can see jihad as</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.000" end="00:17:58.720" style="s2">i think maybe a richer symbolic system</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.360" end="00:18:01.760" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t like come out and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.720" end="00:18:04.799" style="s2">talk about it as his symbolic system but</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.760" end="00:18:08.160" style="s2">instead of talking right the is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.799" end="00:18:09.039" style="s2">central idea his central idea is is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.160" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.039" end="00:18:15.120" style="s2">um and and i guess the scapegoat is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.480" end="00:18:17.200" style="s2">symbol isn&#39;t it it&#39;s a symbol it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.120" end="00:18:19.520" style="s2">symbol of what&#39;s wrong and you you</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.200" end="00:18:21.600" style="s2">you you prop up a scapegoat and then you</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.520" end="00:18:23.919" style="s2">destroy it to create this</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.600" end="00:18:25.440" style="s2">um you know to create this artificial</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.919" end="00:18:27.280" style="s2">peace in the society</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.440" end="00:18:29.280" style="s2">um so that sort of you know there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.280" end="00:18:31.200" style="s2">this war at all against all</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.280" end="00:18:32.640" style="s2">and then we keep looking for scapegoats</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.200" end="00:18:33.919" style="s2">unconsciously we keep looking for</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.640" end="00:18:37.039" style="s2">symbols of what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.919" end="00:18:38.160" style="s2">right um of what&#39;s you know sick in our</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:40.080" style="s2">society i</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.160" end="00:18:41.280" style="s2">i have a friend who thinks that you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.080" end="00:18:43.440" style="s2">that idea is the most</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.280" end="00:18:44.799" style="s2">important idea you know there is right</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.440" end="00:18:48.000" style="s2">now it&#39;s absolutely so</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.799" end="00:18:49.039" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s really it&#39;s really the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.000" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">root of</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.039" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">of all conflict on some some level is</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:58.880" style="s2">the scapegoat mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:18:59.440" style="s2">yeah i think it&#39;s one part of the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.880" end="00:19:00.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.440" end="00:19:02.880" style="s2">i think gerard tries to point to</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.880" end="00:19:04.559" style="s2">something like even more fundamental and</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.880" end="00:19:07.560" style="s2">the skateboarding mechanism would be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.559" end="00:19:09.200" style="s2">consequence of it but his main thing is</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.560" end="00:19:12.000" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.200" end="00:19:13.600" style="s2">is imitation the so instead of talking</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.000" end="00:19:16.400" style="s2">about let&#39;s say head and body or</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.600" end="00:19:17.440" style="s2">center and periphery he talks about it</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.400" end="00:19:20.080" style="s2">in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.440" end="00:19:20.720" style="s2">the model and the imitator yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.080" end="00:19:24.240" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.720" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">right yeah so and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.240" end="00:19:27.679" style="s2">it&#39;s cool in in uh his book uh thinks</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:28.160" style="s2">that instance from the foundations of</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.679" end="00:19:31.440" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.160" end="00:19:33.520" style="s2">he he says that you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.440" end="00:19:34.559" style="s2">you can see it in aristotle and plato</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.520" end="00:19:37.840" style="s2">that they add</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.559" end="00:19:39.280" style="s2">some they actually add metaphysics of</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.840" end="00:19:41.440" style="s2">imitation</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.280" end="00:19:42.640" style="s2">because in plato for instance you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.440" end="00:19:45.600" style="s2">the whole idea that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.640" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">like god or the form of forms from which</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.600" end="00:19:49.120" style="s2">gemini forms</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.039" end="00:19:50.640" style="s2">and uh like you always have survey</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.120" end="00:19:52.160" style="s2">likeness between forms that</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.640" end="00:19:53.360" style="s2">trickles down to the material world</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.160" end="00:19:55.679" style="s2">ultimately but it&#39;s always of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.360" end="00:19:59.360" style="s2">limitation of forms that are that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.679" end="00:20:00.799" style="s2">ira um and apparently plato had some</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.360" end="00:20:03.120" style="s2">made some weird comments about let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.799" end="00:20:04.240" style="s2">the arts and he tried to steer people</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.120" end="00:20:05.280" style="s2">away from imitation because he could</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.240" end="00:20:08.799" style="s2">sense that there was something</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.280" end="00:20:12.240" style="s2">like dangerous about the imitation yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.799" end="00:20:14.159" style="s2">and yeah he he he was plato</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.240" end="00:20:15.520" style="s2">i think i was reading that too and he he</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.159" end="00:20:17.280" style="s2">was saying that you know he was trying</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.520" end="00:20:18.640" style="s2">he really wanted to censor the arts</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.280" end="00:20:20.240" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.640" end="00:20:22.320" style="s2">because he thought he thought it was it</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.240" end="00:20:25.760" style="s2">was it was very very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.320" end="00:20:27.840" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.760" end="00:20:30.000" style="s2">because of i guess this memetic quality</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.840" end="00:20:31.520" style="s2">is it you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.000" end="00:20:33.120" style="s2">if you have a model then people imitate</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.520" end="00:20:34.400" style="s2">that model and</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.120" end="00:20:36.159" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like you could sense that</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.400" end="00:20:38.480" style="s2">things could get out of control</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.159" end="00:20:40.320" style="s2">and yeah where is he trying to control</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.480" end="00:20:41.120" style="s2">it too much right so so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.320" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.120" end="00:20:50.159" style="s2">that would be like a mania for control</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:50.159" style="s2">yeah and gerald tried to</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:54.000" style="s2">worry where he went further than</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.320" end="00:20:55.360" style="s2">aristotle or plato is that he</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.000" end="00:20:58.799" style="s2">explained that it&#39;s not just that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.360" end="00:21:01.200" style="s2">let&#39;s say imitate what other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.799" end="00:21:02.720" style="s2">what other people do or like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.200" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">just that forms emitted what the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.720" end="00:21:05.919" style="s2">forms do about but</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.840" end="00:21:07.120" style="s2">once you reach the human level it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.919" end="00:21:08.799" style="s2">strange in that</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.120" end="00:21:10.880" style="s2">we don&#39;t just imitate the behaviors of</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.799" end="00:21:14.240" style="s2">people we make it also their desires</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.880" end="00:21:15.280" style="s2">and uh so for instance in in monkeys you</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.240" end="00:21:16.720" style="s2">can see that</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.280" end="00:21:18.720" style="s2">people will imitate whatever other</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.720" end="00:21:21.760" style="s2">monkeys do like the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.720" end="00:21:23.120" style="s2">the the chief monkey if the chief monkey</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.760" end="00:21:23.840" style="s2">does something then the other monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.120" end="00:21:26.880" style="s2">will will</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.840" end="00:21:28.240" style="s2">tend to copy him but not when it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.880" end="00:21:30.000" style="s2">about consuming some</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.240" end="00:21:32.320" style="s2">something not when it&#39;s about a desire</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.000" end="00:21:33.520" style="s2">like if the the chief monkey like grabs</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.320" end="00:21:36.000" style="s2">a woman or uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.520" end="00:21:36.960" style="s2">another one grabs another monkey uh or</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.000" end="00:21:39.679" style="s2">uh if</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.960" end="00:21:41.600" style="s2">you grab some food something this is not</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.679" end="00:21:42.799" style="s2">something that the lower monkeys will</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.600" end="00:21:44.640" style="s2">imitate</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.799" end="00:21:46.080" style="s2">because they don&#39;t like imitate desires</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.640" end="00:21:48.320" style="s2">but something that we humans do if</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.080" end="00:21:50.799" style="s2">someone wants something we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.320" end="00:21:51.600" style="s2">imitate that person as well right if if</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.799" end="00:21:54.880" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.600" end="00:21:56.559" style="s2">the object of our desire becomes</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.880" end="00:21:58.080" style="s2">exponentially more attractive if</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.559" end="00:22:01.280" style="s2">somebody else also desires</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.080" end="00:22:03.760" style="s2">that woman or iphone or you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.280" end="00:22:06.000" style="s2">whatever it is uh it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.760" end="00:22:09.840" style="s2">the secret of advertising it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.000" end="00:22:11.679" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s um imitating</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.840" end="00:22:13.600" style="s2">uh you know we imitate we want what</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.679" end="00:22:15.520" style="s2">other people want and then there&#39;s a c</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.600" end="00:22:17.919" style="s2">he talks about envy gerard doesn&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:19.600" style="s2">and then yeah the envy is this this</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.919" end="00:22:21.280" style="s2">very hidden emotion that we don&#39;t admit</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.600" end="00:22:24.000" style="s2">to ourselves you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.280" end="00:22:25.520" style="s2">it&#39;s all about wanting what our neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.000" end="00:22:27.280" style="s2">wants</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.520" end="00:22:29.120" style="s2">yeah yeah and there used to be a</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.280" end="00:22:32.000" style="s2">distinction between envy and jealousy</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.120" end="00:22:32.480" style="s2">like jealousy was when you when you want</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.000" end="00:22:34.720" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.480" end="00:22:36.320" style="s2">because someone else has it but nv goes</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.720" end="00:22:37.440" style="s2">further in that</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.320" end="00:22:39.360" style="s2">it&#39;s not only that you want something</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.440" end="00:22:40.720" style="s2">because someone else has it but that if</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:42.000" style="s2">you can&#39;t have it you would rather the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.720" end="00:22:43.360" style="s2">thing be destroyed so that the other</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.000" end="00:22:44.159" style="s2">person doesn&#39;t have it as well like it</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.360" end="00:22:46.080" style="s2">goes</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.159" end="00:22:47.600" style="s2">goes a bit further and i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.080" end="00:22:47.919" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a powerful emotion that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.600" end="00:22:51.280" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.919" end="00:22:52.960" style="s2">recognize maybe enough uh today but</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.280" end="00:22:56.559" style="s2">yeah and and then jihad used this</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.960" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">symbolism of okay so so people uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.559" end="00:23:00.559" style="s2">desire things through mediators we</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:01.760" style="s2">desire things through models</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.559" end="00:23:03.919" style="s2">that&#39;s why you talked about the triangle</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.760" end="00:23:04.720" style="s2">so we desire something through our model</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.919" end="00:23:07.840" style="s2">so we deserve</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.720" end="00:23:09.120" style="s2">something via a model we imitate other</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.840" end="00:23:10.640" style="s2">people&#39;s desires so</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.120" end="00:23:13.280" style="s2">yeah and so this will have the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.640" end="00:23:15.120" style="s2">consequence of mimetic rivalry where</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.280" end="00:23:16.640" style="s2">people will</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.120" end="00:23:17.760" style="s2">will all start to desire the same things</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.640" end="00:23:18.480" style="s2">and you will there will be tons of</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.760" end="00:23:21.760" style="s2">conflict</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.480" end="00:23:24.320" style="s2">uh so you can&#39;t get so one</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.760" end="00:23:25.679" style="s2">one consequence of jihad&#39;s symbolism is</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.320" end="00:23:29.039" style="s2">that okay there will be</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.679" end="00:23:30.400" style="s2">like wars of or there will be conflict</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.039" end="00:23:32.640" style="s2">and the other thing you can predict is</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.400" end="00:23:34.480" style="s2">that once people start crawling in</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.640" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">piling up against a scapegoat then</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.480" end="00:23:38.720" style="s2">people will also emit that desire</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:39.919" style="s2">to escape called the victim so that will</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.720" end="00:23:42.000" style="s2">so so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.919" end="00:23:43.600" style="s2">so the the two mechanisms that explain</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.000" end="00:23:44.799" style="s2">why people like fragment and then why</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.600" end="00:23:46.799" style="s2">people gather again</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.799" end="00:23:47.919" style="s2">uh against the scapegoat or explain</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.799" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">within uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.919" end="00:23:54.960" style="s2">shiraz uh imitator and model</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">model and imitator symbolism yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.960" end="00:23:58.720" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ll have to play more about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:23:59.520" style="s2">though cause it&#39;s uh it seems almost too</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.720" end="00:24:01.679" style="s2">good to be true</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.520" end="00:24:03.360" style="s2">if if you read he seems to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.679" end="00:24:05.200" style="s2">explain so much stuff we did that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.360" end="00:24:07.600" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit surprising like it&#39;s yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.200" end="00:24:11.279" style="s2">just sounds too good to be true</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.600" end="00:24:11.840" style="s2">yeah well it um i mean if you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.279" end="00:24:14.799" style="s2">christ</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.840" end="00:24:16.400" style="s2">as being the ultimate scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.799" end="00:24:19.520" style="s2">mechanism or the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.400" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">you know revelation of the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.520" end="00:24:26.640" style="s2">yeah um it makes sense uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:28.000" style="s2">um the power of christianity makes a lot</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.640" end="00:24:29.600" style="s2">more sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.000" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">you know as somebody who&#39;s never you</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.600" end="00:24:34.000" style="s2">know been a christian uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.480" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">gerard helped me really understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.000" end="00:24:37.200" style="s2">christianity i think</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:39.679" style="s2">yeah otherwise i might not have</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.200" end="00:24:42.080" style="s2">understood it um</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.679" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">because i because i very early we</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.080" end="00:24:48.559" style="s2">started working with buddhism and</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:48.559" style="s2">buddhism i think um</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:53.279" style="s2">if you&#39;re if you&#39;re a western person uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.039" end="00:24:54.960" style="s2">growing up in in you know in a christian</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.279" end="00:24:57.360" style="s2">world and you see all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.960" end="00:24:58.480" style="s2">let&#39;s say decadence of the christian or</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.360" end="00:25:00.000" style="s2">or or</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.480" end="00:25:01.760" style="s2">if you see you see a lot of dead</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:02.880" style="s2">christianity let&#39;s say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.760" end="00:25:05.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if you would agree with me</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.880" end="00:25:06.559" style="s2">but yeah yeah i&#39;m not living not living</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.440" end="00:25:08.159" style="s2">christianity</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.559" end="00:25:09.840" style="s2">yeah so that was the christianity that i</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.159" end="00:25:13.120" style="s2">was exposed to so i went to</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.840" end="00:25:14.480" style="s2">to study buddhism because buddhism you</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.120" end="00:25:16.320" style="s2">you would actually there was actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.480" end="00:25:18.799" style="s2">practices you could you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.320" end="00:25:20.480" style="s2">he could do yeah other than you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.799" end="00:25:20.799" style="s2">let&#39;s say dogma that you were supposed</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.480" end="00:25:23.679" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.799" end="00:25:24.799" style="s2">um you know you were supposed to to</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.679" end="00:25:26.480" style="s2">imitate or</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.799" end="00:25:28.559" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to you&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.480" end="00:25:30.720" style="s2">imitate all these series of dogmas</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.559" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">it didn&#39;t make sense to me um as a young</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.720" end="00:25:33.279" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:34.640" style="s2">where sitting sitting on a meditation</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.279" end="00:25:36.400" style="s2">cushion for hours and hours</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.640" end="00:25:39.200" style="s2">you know trying to understand my you</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.400" end="00:25:41.679" style="s2">know what your my mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.200" end="00:25:42.880" style="s2">and the body and the world that was much</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.679" end="00:25:46.480" style="s2">more direct for me</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.880" end="00:25:48.400" style="s2">but then later on i i i sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.480" end="00:25:49.679" style="s2">came back to wanting to understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.400" end="00:25:51.919" style="s2">christianity through</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.679" end="00:25:54.000" style="s2">you know through probably people like</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.919" end="00:25:56.080" style="s2">gerard and carl ewing and</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.000" end="00:25:58.000" style="s2">other people who are not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.080" end="00:26:00.640" style="s2">central within the church</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.000" end="00:26:01.440" style="s2">um northrop&#39;s right and people like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.640" end="00:26:04.720" style="s2">may</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.440" end="00:26:07.840" style="s2">made me interested in christianity</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:10.480" style="s2">uh again so yeah yeah that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.840" end="00:26:12.080" style="s2">and something i&#39;ve been exploring lately</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.480" end="00:26:14.080" style="s2">the idea of how it is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.080" end="00:26:15.200" style="s2">christianity itself grows through deaths</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.080" end="00:26:17.919" style="s2">and rivers so</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.200" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">it uh like in our case in the west</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.919" end="00:26:21.919" style="s2">christianity has</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.720" end="00:26:25.200" style="s2">has faded into uh atheism</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.919" end="00:26:26.000" style="s2">really yeah but and</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.200" end="00:26:27.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not the first time that</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.000" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">christianity fades and then rises again</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.600" end="00:26:30.159" style="s2">there&#39;s starting with christ and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:33.440" style="s2">the apostles</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.159" end="00:26:34.480" style="s2">uh once yeah i i i won&#39;t go through all</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.440" end="00:26:35.840" style="s2">of it because i know you listen to my</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.480" end="00:26:37.360" style="s2">conversation with jonathan you have this</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.840" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">basic idea of like christ dies and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.360" end="00:26:41.120" style="s2">apostles</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:42.480" style="s2">become him and then the apostle dies the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.120" end="00:26:43.760" style="s2">apostles die and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.480" end="00:26:46.480" style="s2">like the different churches are founded</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.760" end="00:26:49.840" style="s2">and the churches themselves die and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.480" end="00:26:53.760" style="s2">they take over uh uh empires so it like</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:57.919" style="s2">keeps growing this way and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.760" end="00:27:00.159" style="s2">some some you can get maybe at least</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.919" end="00:27:01.279" style="s2">some some hope that it&#39;s also what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.159" end="00:27:05.360" style="s2">occurring right now with</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.279" end="00:27:07.039" style="s2">jira i&#39;ve heard i don&#39;t know if it ever</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.360" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">himself say this but ever people say</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.039" end="00:27:12.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.960" end="00:27:14.240" style="s2">one of the one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.240" end="00:27:15.360" style="s2">security has made possible is for us to</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.240" end="00:27:16.799" style="s2">see how special</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.360" end="00:27:18.480" style="s2">christianity is compared to other</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.799" end="00:27:20.159" style="s2">religions but once we</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.480" end="00:27:22.559" style="s2">we get away from christianity and we try</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.159" end="00:27:24.880" style="s2">to look at it compared to other</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.559" end="00:27:27.520" style="s2">religious systems we see how weird it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.880" end="00:27:29.760" style="s2">once we can compare it with other myths</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.520" end="00:27:31.279" style="s2">we can see how it inverts the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.760" end="00:27:33.120" style="s2">scapegoating</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.279" end="00:27:34.399" style="s2">mechanism and that this is something</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.120" end="00:27:36.480" style="s2">very surprising and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.399" end="00:27:38.559" style="s2">once you know it it can explain a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.480" end="00:27:42.000" style="s2">things so general has written a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.559" end="00:27:45.919" style="s2">to explain all of that stuff um</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.000" end="00:27:47.520" style="s2">and what i wonder like i wonder within</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.919" end="00:27:50.159" style="s2">other religions you know again</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.520" end="00:27:50.880" style="s2">buddhism is what i&#39;m most familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.159" end="00:27:52.960" style="s2">because i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.880" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">practicing it since my 20s and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.960" end="00:28:00.840" style="s2">practiced in different traditions</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:28:04.960" style="s2">um i i wonder i i wonder</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.840" end="00:28:04.960" style="s2">um you know um</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.440" end="00:28:09.279" style="s2">i wonder where the scapegoat mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.760" end="00:28:12.399" style="s2">fits in into buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.279" end="00:28:14.159" style="s2">um i wonder if i wonder i wonder if if</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.399" end="00:28:16.159" style="s2">there&#39;s i wonder you know i just i</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.159" end="00:28:17.919" style="s2">wonder about that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.159" end="00:28:20.000" style="s2">yeah i was curious to ask to you about</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.919" end="00:28:22.080" style="s2">this as well because i think i i&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.000" end="00:28:23.440" style="s2">i know that i know that in buddhism for</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.080" end="00:28:24.399" style="s2">example there&#39;s different schools of</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">buddhism right</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.399" end="00:28:28.880" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s um there&#39;s um the older</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:29.520" style="s2">schools which are called indiana and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.880" end="00:28:31.440" style="s2">they&#39;re based in</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.520" end="00:28:33.440" style="s2">sutra and they&#39;re based in renunciation</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.440" end="00:28:35.520" style="s2">and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.440" end="00:28:37.520" style="s2">there&#39;s this false idea that people have</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.520" end="00:28:39.200" style="s2">the buddhism is about emptiness right</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.520" end="00:28:39.919" style="s2">that that&#39;s the whole story of buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.200" end="00:28:41.679" style="s2">it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.919" end="00:28:44.960" style="s2">becoming void or empty or becoming</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.679" end="00:28:46.399" style="s2">nothing and that sort of thing um</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.960" end="00:28:48.799" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the mahayana school</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.399" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">which which which is sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.799" end="00:28:52.640" style="s2">um the indiana school is about</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:55.440" style="s2">discipline</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.640" end="00:28:56.399" style="s2">um and practice and self-realization you</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.440" end="00:28:58.240" style="s2">could say</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.399" end="00:28:59.600" style="s2">uh but but that that was recognized to</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.240" end="00:29:02.320" style="s2">be a limited</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.600" end="00:29:03.840" style="s2">uh perspective self-realization and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.320" end="00:29:06.720" style="s2">the next stage of buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.840" end="00:29:07.679" style="s2">was mahayana buddhism which means great</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.720" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">vehicle</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.679" end="00:29:11.440" style="s2">so narrow vehicle would be like you you</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.840" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">work on yourself you discipline yourself</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.440" end="00:29:14.559" style="s2">for the next vehicle would be called</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">great vehicle</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.559" end="00:29:19.919" style="s2">um and that would be that would be your</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.559" end="00:29:19.919" style="s2">developed compassion and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.240" end="00:29:23.200" style="s2">and then there was this notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.600" end="00:29:23.679" style="s2">bodhisattva who is sort of like the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.200" end="00:29:26.480" style="s2">savior</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.679" end="00:29:28.399" style="s2">i guess he goes and he goes and um he</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.480" end="00:29:32.159" style="s2">gives up nirvana he</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.399" end="00:29:34.720" style="s2">he sacrifices you could say nirvana um</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.159" end="00:29:36.399" style="s2">to to help beings so there&#39;s this very</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.720" end="00:29:38.640" style="s2">big altruistic</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.399" end="00:29:40.480" style="s2">uh quality to that and also</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.640" end="00:29:42.000" style="s2">philosophical quality to that</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.480" end="00:29:43.760" style="s2">i mean the highest philosophy you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.000" end="00:29:44.640" style="s2">get is in the mahayana it goes up to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.760" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">mariana</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.640" end="00:29:48.640" style="s2">and then the next part is called the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.960" end="00:29:49.360" style="s2">next tradition the tradition you find in</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.640" end="00:29:52.640" style="s2">northern</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.360" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">you know in tibet and in</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.640" end="00:29:56.080" style="s2">actually there was but there was there</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:29:57.679" style="s2">was tantric buddhism all over uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.080" end="00:29:59.679" style="s2">of the world at one point and was</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.679" end="00:30:00.559" style="s2">completely destroyed by islamic fake</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.679" end="00:30:02.240" style="s2">invasions</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.559" end="00:30:04.320" style="s2">all over the east i should say not the</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.240" end="00:30:05.840" style="s2">world um</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.320" end="00:30:07.360" style="s2">but but but it but it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.840" end="00:30:10.399" style="s2">crystallized in tibet</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.360" end="00:30:12.000" style="s2">and and it has its origins in india and</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.399" end="00:30:14.960" style="s2">that would that&#39;s a tradition</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.000" end="00:30:15.919" style="s2">um which that&#39;s the tradition that</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.960" end="00:30:19.120" style="s2">interests me which</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.919" end="00:30:22.480" style="s2">which kind of it goes it goes it goes</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.120" end="00:30:25.200" style="s2">one step further than uh into</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.480" end="00:30:26.080" style="s2">let&#39;s say uh deeper into symbolism the</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.200" end="00:30:29.279" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.080" end="00:30:29.279" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s more um</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.600" end="00:30:35.440" style="s2">um rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.799" end="00:30:36.640" style="s2">it moves beyond the propositional uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.440" end="00:30:38.399" style="s2">into the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.640" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">you know because you could say and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.399" end="00:30:40.640" style="s2">work more with symbols and you work more</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.000" end="00:30:42.159" style="s2">with the</p>

<p begin="00:30:46.799" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2">with john about that and i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.080" end="00:30:51.039" style="s2">really finished my discussion with him</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.600" end="00:30:53.120" style="s2">about it because</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.039" end="00:30:54.080" style="s2">he goes into transrational you could say</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.120" end="00:30:56.159" style="s2">so it has</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.080" end="00:30:58.159" style="s2">aspects that you know i was listening to</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.159" end="00:31:00.000" style="s2">somebody say i think it was cs lewis</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.159" end="00:31:03.919" style="s2">that christianity has this</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.000" end="00:31:05.039" style="s2">connection to paganism right that um</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.919" end="00:31:08.880" style="s2">that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.039" end="00:31:11.919" style="s2">um like that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.880" end="00:31:13.919" style="s2">universal um you know so you have you</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.919" end="00:31:14.480" style="s2">can in christianity you you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.919" end="00:31:16.240" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.480" end="00:31:18.000" style="s2">high high-end philosophy but you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.240" end="00:31:20.720" style="s2">also reach common people</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.000" end="00:31:22.080" style="s2">and because because there&#39;s this whole</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.720" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:25.600" style="s2">you have the rituals which you know you</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.840" end="00:31:26.559" style="s2">eat the you know the body and the blood</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.600" end="00:31:28.640" style="s2">of christ and</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.559" end="00:31:30.399" style="s2">that kind of thing very primordial but i</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.640" end="00:31:32.960" style="s2">think that vajrayana has</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.399" end="00:31:34.880" style="s2">a bit of a quality of of that and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.960" end="00:31:36.799" style="s2">when i look back at christianity i see</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.880" end="00:31:38.159" style="s2">aspects of christianity that remind me</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.799" end="00:31:41.519" style="s2">in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.159" end="00:31:42.559" style="s2">of of adriana um even the trinity is</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.519" end="00:31:44.559" style="s2">there like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.559" end="00:31:45.760" style="s2">and they talk about the three bodies of</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.559" end="00:31:47.760" style="s2">the buddha</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.760" end="00:31:48.880" style="s2">there&#39;s dharmakayas and bogota in your</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.760" end="00:31:52.399" style="s2">monaco and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.880" end="00:31:54.960" style="s2">subtle causal non-dual or</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.399" end="00:31:55.679" style="s2">um or you could say that dermatochais</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.960" end="00:31:58.240" style="s2">i&#39;ve heard of</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.679" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">tibetan master says is love right the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.240" end="00:32:02.559" style="s2">physical body is is love right</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:04.480" style="s2">it&#39;s manifest as love which reminds me</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.559" end="00:32:08.240" style="s2">of of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.480" end="00:32:10.960" style="s2">in some way so um interesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.240" end="00:32:11.840" style="s2">so i i i um and so i think it goes a</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.960" end="00:32:14.559" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.840" end="00:32:15.919" style="s2">further than what you normally normally</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.559" end="00:32:18.880" style="s2">people think of buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.919" end="00:32:19.519" style="s2">they associate it with emptiness uh but</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.880" end="00:32:22.640" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.519" end="00:32:24.720" style="s2">a higher view is is emptiness and love</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.640" end="00:32:27.760" style="s2">and luminosity or</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.720" end="00:32:30.320" style="s2">to get those two things together yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.760" end="00:32:32.799" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting because do you have</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.320" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">an idea where this emptiness caricature</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.799" end="00:32:35.840" style="s2">came about and why it became so</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.240" end="00:32:42.480" style="s2">prevalent</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.840" end="00:32:45.039" style="s2">uh well i think that um</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.480" end="00:32:46.480" style="s2">uh i mean i don&#39;t i don&#39;t i wouldn&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.039" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t know how to analyze that</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.480" end="00:32:52.720" style="s2">historically um uh because</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:56.000" style="s2">no nothing is no thingness right so</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.720" end="00:32:57.360" style="s2">so so uh but that gets that that seems</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.000" end="00:33:00.960" style="s2">like a nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.360" end="00:33:02.720" style="s2">on some level um but who was it this</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.960" end="00:33:05.919" style="s2">this guy that john was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.720" end="00:33:07.679" style="s2">um this this eastern philosopher you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.919" end="00:33:10.799" style="s2">saying one of the reasons that nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.679" end="00:33:13.279" style="s2">has never been a problem in the east</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.799" end="00:33:15.200" style="s2">is because we have this notion they have</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.279" end="00:33:16.240" style="s2">this notion of they have a positive</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.200" end="00:33:19.039" style="s2">notion of</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.240" end="00:33:20.080" style="s2">of no thingness or shinyata or emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.039" end="00:33:22.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a positive</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.080" end="00:33:25.200" style="s2">notion of nothingness it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.960" end="00:33:26.559" style="s2">negative it&#39;s not a nihilism it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.200" end="00:33:28.240" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not just that you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.559" end="00:33:30.320" style="s2">where you you um</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.240" end="00:33:32.799" style="s2">it&#39;s not a sort of suicide like when i</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.320" end="00:33:34.640" style="s2">hear gerard talk about buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.799" end="00:33:36.880" style="s2">he always talks about it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.640" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">it&#39;s some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.880" end="00:33:40.080" style="s2">nihilism but i think that&#39;s i think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:42.960" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s using he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.080" end="00:33:45.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a western filter on on yeah on what</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.960" end="00:33:47.600" style="s2">buddhism is and i think a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.360" end="00:33:49.440" style="s2">the west people think of buddhism really</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.600" end="00:33:50.159" style="s2">in terms of a lot of western concepts</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.440" end="00:33:51.840" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.159" end="00:33:53.440" style="s2">they&#39;re in the west they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.840" end="00:33:56.480" style="s2">people what does</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.440" end="00:33:57.039" style="s2">buddhists often don&#39;t understand western</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.480" end="00:33:58.320" style="s2">buddhists</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.039" end="00:34:00.240" style="s2">don&#39;t understand that they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.320" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">christians or stoics or</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.240" end="00:34:03.440" style="s2">epicureans when they&#39;re when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:05.360" style="s2">trying to analyze</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.440" end="00:34:07.440" style="s2">they know as buddhism and you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.360" end="00:34:10.399" style="s2">this whole other richer side of buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.440" end="00:34:10.879" style="s2">which is very um i don&#39;t know it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.399" end="00:34:13.599" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.879" end="00:34:15.200" style="s2">um it has more of the emotionalism that</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.599" end="00:34:17.040" style="s2">you have in christianity</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.200" end="00:34:20.399" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna love and compact love it</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.040" end="00:34:22.399" style="s2">love and worship is more important</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.399" end="00:34:24.480" style="s2">whereas you know in the west uh in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.399" end="00:34:25.760" style="s2">west people tend to think of buddhism as</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.480" end="00:34:28.000" style="s2">sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.760" end="00:34:30.399" style="s2">sterile kind of uh you know like this</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.000" end="00:34:34.879" style="s2">kind of rational religion</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.399" end="00:34:37.119" style="s2">which uh you know i i</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.879" end="00:34:38.480" style="s2">i&#39;ve had i i i don&#39;t know if i&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.119" end="00:34:39.839" style="s2">the bottom of this with john in my</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.480" end="00:34:40.960" style="s2">discussions with him but</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.839" end="00:34:42.560" style="s2">you know because i&#39;m a practicing</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.960" end="00:34:44.320" style="s2">buddhism and he he talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.560" end="00:34:46.000" style="s2">religion that&#39;s there&#39;s no religion so</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.320" end="00:34:48.720" style="s2">yeah at one point and i said okay you</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.000" end="00:34:50.399" style="s2">know there i&#39;m gonna just say okay i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.720" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">buddhist okay because i&#39;m gonna commit</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.399" end="00:34:54.960" style="s2">to that particular</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:34:55.679" style="s2">path um where john practices a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.960" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.679" end="00:34:59.119" style="s2">things but he won&#39;t commit to that he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:35:02.480" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.119" end="00:35:05.839" style="s2">he&#39;ll he&#39;ll do neoplatonism and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.480" end="00:35:08.880" style="s2">and practice buddhist techniques and</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.839" end="00:35:09.680" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah i wanted to ask you about</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.880" end="00:35:12.000" style="s2">jihad</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.680" end="00:35:12.880" style="s2">because i&#39;ve heard him yeah from what i</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.000" end="00:35:16.320" style="s2">heard him</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.880" end="00:35:17.200" style="s2">talk about buddhism it was excited as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.320" end="00:35:19.200" style="s2">way to</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.200" end="00:35:20.320" style="s2">try to dampen let&#39;s say the skeptic</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.200" end="00:35:23.520" style="s2">mechanism by</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.320" end="00:35:25.040" style="s2">renunciating desire yeah that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.520" end="00:35:27.920" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.040" end="00:35:28.720" style="s2">sutriana buddhism is about renunciation</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.920" end="00:35:30.480" style="s2">that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.720" end="00:35:31.760" style="s2">but there&#39;s also uh the next part of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.480" end="00:35:33.760" style="s2">contract buddhism is</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.760" end="00:35:34.960" style="s2">is not about renunciation it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.760" end="00:35:39.040" style="s2">actually it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.960" end="00:35:42.240" style="s2">very it&#39;s about it&#39;s it&#39;s very um</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.040" end="00:35:43.599" style="s2">uh embodied yeah so he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.240" end="00:35:45.119" style="s2">interpreting uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.599" end="00:35:46.640" style="s2">one half of buddhism he&#39;s saying one</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.119" end="00:35:49.280" style="s2">half of buddhism but not the other</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.640" end="00:35:50.000" style="s2">other half of buddhism yeah and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.280" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.000" end="00:35:54.640" style="s2">yeah and i mean there&#39;s a pronunciation</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.720" end="00:35:55.839" style="s2">aspect of christianity too isn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.640" end="00:35:59.200" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.839" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">then there&#39;s the you know where you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.200" end="00:36:03.520" style="s2">um i think in tantriana you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.000" end="00:36:07.520" style="s2">renounce</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.520" end="00:36:10.560" style="s2">um because at the like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.520" end="00:36:12.160" style="s2">the art of the the christ&#39;s response to</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.560" end="00:36:16.560" style="s2">this computing mechanism is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.160" end="00:36:19.280" style="s2">okay so instead of us always trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.560" end="00:36:19.760" style="s2">like imitate one another and you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.280" end="00:36:22.000" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.760" end="00:36:23.359" style="s2">this mess of different people trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.000" end="00:36:24.960" style="s2">imitate different people but also</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.359" end="00:36:26.560" style="s2">wanting to somehow differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.960" end="00:36:27.040" style="s2">themselves from from the other so you</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.560" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">get this</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.040" end="00:36:30.320" style="s2">just mess of at the human level of</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:32.640" style="s2">different people with</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.320" end="00:36:33.520" style="s2">different desires and copying each</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.640" end="00:36:35.440" style="s2">other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.520" end="00:36:36.960" style="s2">it&#39;s just a wholeness and the solution</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.440" end="00:36:40.320" style="s2">will be to</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.960" end="00:36:41.839" style="s2">imitate instead of christ just tries to</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.320" end="00:36:43.440" style="s2">imitate the father just tries to muddle</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.839" end="00:36:45.200" style="s2">his desires after the</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.440" end="00:36:47.280" style="s2">desires of the of the grand being of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.200" end="00:36:49.839" style="s2">desert father and then if</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.280" end="00:36:51.520" style="s2">we we do this like christ then on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.839" end="00:36:51.839" style="s2">one hand we risk being scapegoats as</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.520" end="00:36:54.000" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.839" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">like like he was but we won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:36:57.119" style="s2">participate in</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:36:58.560" style="s2">the scapegoating mechanism just just</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.119" end="00:37:02.160" style="s2">like he didn&#39;t participate</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.560" end="00:37:04.880" style="s2">in it so i guess is is this</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.160" end="00:37:08.320" style="s2">that that seems very tender to me you</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.880" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">take a desire and you transform it</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.320" end="00:37:12.720" style="s2">rather than you repress it or push it</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:15.520" style="s2">away or or</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.720" end="00:37:16.000" style="s2">or hide from it or yeah you would rather</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.520" end="00:37:18.640" style="s2">try to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.000" end="00:37:21.040" style="s2">sort of model the desires of the buddha</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.640" end="00:37:21.040" style="s2">i guess</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.440" end="00:37:24.160" style="s2">well um</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.560" end="00:37:28.240" style="s2">it&#39;s complicated because uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.400" end="00:37:32.640" style="s2">i think the buddha is not a model i</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.040" end="00:37:33.680" style="s2">think you go beyond the buddha being a</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.640" end="00:37:35.599" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.680" end="00:37:36.960" style="s2">i think i think maybe that&#39;s where and</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.599" end="00:37:38.400" style="s2">you go beyond</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.960" end="00:37:40.079" style="s2">because perhaps that&#39;s the difference</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.400" end="00:37:42.000" style="s2">between christianity and christianity</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.079" end="00:37:44.800" style="s2">christ is the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.000" end="00:37:46.640" style="s2">model in buddhism there is no ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.800" end="00:37:48.480" style="s2">model perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.640" end="00:37:50.880" style="s2">but but you do they have something</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.480" end="00:37:53.119" style="s2">called skillful means and that&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.880" end="00:37:55.440" style="s2">which means you know you practice</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.119" end="00:37:58.560" style="s2">devotional practices</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.440" end="00:38:00.400" style="s2">until you go beyond them okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.560" end="00:38:02.079" style="s2">that makes any sense okay so but where</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.400" end="00:38:02.720" style="s2">do you get to the point where you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.079" end="00:38:04.800" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.720" end="00:38:07.280" style="s2">model your desires after other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.800" end="00:38:08.800" style="s2">desires</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.280" end="00:38:10.880" style="s2">when you don&#39;t just model your desires</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.800" end="00:38:13.760" style="s2">after</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.880" end="00:38:14.320" style="s2">um probably i guess it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.760" end="00:38:18.720" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.320" end="00:38:21.920" style="s2">you have you you assimilate um</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.720" end="00:38:24.960" style="s2">uh you know you work with the models</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.920" end="00:38:26.960" style="s2">or the master of the teacher or</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.960" end="00:38:28.400" style="s2">in buddhism that the living buddha is</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.960" end="00:38:28.880" style="s2">more important than the historical</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.400" end="00:38:31.440" style="s2">buddha</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.880" end="00:38:32.560" style="s2">you know for example yeah so so the so</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.440" end="00:38:34.480" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.560" end="00:38:36.640" style="s2">we don&#39;t even care about we care there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.480" end="00:38:38.960" style="s2">devotion towards the historical buddha</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.640" end="00:38:40.079" style="s2">but but it&#39;s not it&#39;s it&#39;s not for me i</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.960" end="00:38:42.240" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.079" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">ultimate thing because everything has</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.240" end="00:38:47.599" style="s2">but in nature</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:50.240" style="s2">so uh so um so actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.599" end="00:38:52.160" style="s2">the living buddha is the the teacher</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.240" end="00:38:55.119" style="s2">that you work with is</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.160" end="00:38:56.640" style="s2">means more it would be like saying that</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.119" end="00:38:58.720" style="s2">the pope means more than</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.640" end="00:38:59.760" style="s2">christ or something you know or</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.720" end="00:39:01.119" style="s2">something like that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.760" end="00:39:02.800" style="s2">pope was more valuable than christ</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.119" end="00:39:04.400" style="s2">because he&#39;s the living embodiment he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.800" end="00:39:06.800" style="s2">here right right right now</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.400" end="00:39:08.000" style="s2">yeah yes um and the pope is not a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.800" end="00:39:11.520" style="s2">for for god</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.000" end="00:39:13.839" style="s2">the pope is is god not god because</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.520" end="00:39:15.359" style="s2">because it&#39;s not theistic it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.839" end="00:39:17.359" style="s2">create creator</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.359" end="00:39:19.119" style="s2">but uh i guess you you would still say</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.359" end="00:39:20.960" style="s2">that not like the ground of being</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.119" end="00:39:22.240" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah yeah you would still say</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.960" end="00:39:22.880" style="s2">that the buddha is a symbol for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.240" end="00:39:24.720" style="s2">ground being</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.880" end="00:39:26.640" style="s2">in that immediate between the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.720" end="00:39:28.079" style="s2">being and the buddha is a symbol for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.640" end="00:39:30.480" style="s2">grounded being but a symbol is not an</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.079" end="00:39:34.079" style="s2">ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.480" end="00:39:36.079" style="s2">expression it&#39;s not a you know um</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.079" end="00:39:37.680" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know it&#39;s something i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.079" end="00:39:38.320" style="s2">been playing with like if you take</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.680" end="00:39:41.839" style="s2">symbols</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.320" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">seriously as i said mediators are real</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.839" end="00:39:44.320" style="s2">things like</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.400" end="00:39:45.599" style="s2">they exist like my head exists and like</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.320" end="00:39:49.200" style="s2">the nucleus in a cell exists</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.599" end="00:39:49.200" style="s2">if there are real things uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.359" end="00:39:52.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if we do we think</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.760" end="00:39:54.240" style="s2">christianity</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.720" end="00:39:56.079" style="s2">we do say that this christ is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.240" end="00:39:57.040" style="s2">perfect image of the father we do say</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.079" end="00:40:00.800" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.040" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">he also like is the word of the father</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.800" end="00:40:05.599" style="s2">so i think you you could say that</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:06.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s too far from saying</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.599" end="00:40:08.839" style="s2">from the way i&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.800" end="00:40:11.599" style="s2">symbols as mediators</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.839" end="00:40:14.160" style="s2">um i don&#39;t think it would be</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.599" end="00:40:15.119" style="s2">wrong to say that christ is a symbol of</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.160" end="00:40:17.119" style="s2">the father</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.119" end="00:40:18.800" style="s2">the way that is the image of the father</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.119" end="00:40:19.839" style="s2">and is also the word spoken by the</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.800" end="00:40:22.079" style="s2">father</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.839" end="00:40:23.599" style="s2">but like the difference and people will</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.079" end="00:40:26.319" style="s2">emphasize this when they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.599" end="00:40:28.079" style="s2">about christ in terms of of the word in</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.319" end="00:40:30.400" style="s2">terms of the logos</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.079" end="00:40:31.839" style="s2">whereas our word is distinct from us</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.400" end="00:40:33.280" style="s2">because we can&#39;t express ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.839" end="00:40:36.079" style="s2">perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.280" end="00:40:37.680" style="s2">god the ground of being can express</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.079" end="00:40:39.680" style="s2">himself perfectly so his word</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.680" end="00:40:41.359" style="s2">is not like separate from him it is like</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.680" end="00:40:42.560" style="s2">a perfect knowledge of himself it is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.359" end="00:40:44.800" style="s2">perfect expression of him</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.560" end="00:40:47.119" style="s2">so in that sense like the the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.800" end="00:40:49.359" style="s2">image of the father is christ is also</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.119" end="00:40:50.160" style="s2">is also like equal with the father and</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.359" end="00:40:52.720" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.160" end="00:40:53.599" style="s2">uh i think you would say with uh like</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.720" end="00:40:56.960" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.599" end="00:40:57.839" style="s2">the image in that that way something you</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.960" end="00:40:59.920" style="s2">will see with a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.839" end="00:41:02.640" style="s2">like christ is the perfect symbol of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.920" end="00:41:03.839" style="s2">father and whereas our earthly symbols</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.640" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">are separate from the things they</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.839" end="00:41:09.119" style="s2">symbolize it wouldn&#39;t be the case</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:10.880" style="s2">in thank you yeah so the so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.119" end="00:41:11.520" style="s2">actually it&#39;s beyond the symbol in some</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.880" end="00:41:14.160" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.520" end="00:41:15.440" style="s2">yeah um even though it&#39;s it&#39;s a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.160" end="00:41:17.040" style="s2">that&#39;s beyond the symbol because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.440" end="00:41:19.359" style="s2">perfectly unified</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.040" end="00:41:20.720" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like perfect for real with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.359" end="00:41:23.280" style="s2">real yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.720" end="00:41:24.880" style="s2">yeah yeah and i i don&#39;t think it would</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.280" end="00:41:26.079" style="s2">be too distinct from what happens within</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.880" end="00:41:28.800" style="s2">buddhism where</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.079" end="00:41:30.960" style="s2">like the let&#39;s say the buddha or the</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.800" end="00:41:32.560" style="s2">teacher</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:34.000" style="s2">well i guess you wouldn&#39;t probably see</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.560" end="00:41:35.599" style="s2">that he&#39;s a perfect symbol but at least</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.000" end="00:41:37.839" style="s2">it is it&#39;s supposed to bring you really</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.599" end="00:41:41.119" style="s2">close to the ground of being</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.839" end="00:41:42.640" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah well i i think uh what what</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.119" end="00:41:44.640" style="s2">do you mean by perfect is it</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.640" end="00:41:46.880" style="s2">you know what does perfect mean if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.640" end="00:41:50.160" style="s2">mean that he becomes sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.880" end="00:41:51.839" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah well i guess christ is</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.160" end="00:41:53.920" style="s2">the god man he&#39;s the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.839" end="00:41:55.780" style="s2">perfect man that&#39;s that&#39;s the symbol of</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.920" end="00:41:57.280" style="s2">christ in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.780" end="00:42:00.800" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.280" end="00:42:02.640" style="s2">um but it&#39;s interesting that that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.800" end="00:42:03.359" style="s2">symbol that that perfect man gets</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.640" end="00:42:05.760" style="s2">crucified</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.359" end="00:42:07.599" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting to me yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.760" end="00:42:11.040" style="s2">almost saying that</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.599" end="00:42:12.800" style="s2">um that perfection is not</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.040" end="00:42:14.319" style="s2">is not possible in this world or</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.800" end="00:42:15.599" style="s2">something something anyway i&#39;m not i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.319" end="00:42:18.960" style="s2">not a christian so</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.599" end="00:42:20.720" style="s2">i&#39;m just riffing here maybe yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.960" end="00:42:22.000" style="s2">i think it&#39;s sort of almost the other</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.720" end="00:42:24.960" style="s2">way around where</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.000" end="00:42:25.839" style="s2">the there&#39;s the idea that like christ&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:42:25.839" end="00:42:28.960" style="s2">christ obedience and to death was</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.760" end="00:42:32.160" style="s2">perfect or another</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.960" end="00:42:35.680" style="s2">to put it is that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.160" end="00:42:37.119" style="s2">yeah no man has greater love than this</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.680" end="00:42:39.280" style="s2">then to lay down his life for his</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.119" end="00:42:40.160" style="s2">friends there&#39;s this idea and i&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.280" end="00:42:42.400" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.160" end="00:42:42.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.599" end="00:42:50.720" style="s2">god created man so that</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.440" end="00:42:53.280" style="s2">he could save him uh like</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.720" end="00:42:54.400" style="s2">because it&#39;s a way to show show his</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.280" end="00:42:55.680" style="s2">glory okay so</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.400" end="00:42:56.800" style="s2">god could have just created nothing the</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.680" end="00:42:57.839" style="s2">ground being could have just created</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.800" end="00:42:59.920" style="s2">nothing and</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.839" end="00:43:01.040" style="s2">it&#39;s still like god would still have all</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.920" end="00:43:02.800" style="s2">the classical attributes it would still</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.040" end="00:43:04.480" style="s2">have been all powerful or good and so on</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.800" end="00:43:08.480" style="s2">just that you wouldn&#39;t have deployed</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.480" end="00:43:10.240" style="s2">this uh this goodness and uh and so on</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.480" end="00:43:11.920" style="s2">then you know he created angels and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.240" end="00:43:12.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a way to we say that it&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.920" end="00:43:14.640" style="s2">way to</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.480" end="00:43:16.160" style="s2">for him to show his glory to create</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.640" end="00:43:16.720" style="s2">things like it shows his omnipotent and</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.160" end="00:43:18.400" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.720" end="00:43:20.000" style="s2">to create principalities and powers you</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.400" end="00:43:23.119" style="s2">would say in more secular terms</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.000" end="00:43:24.240" style="s2">uh but then you can&#39;t like love angels</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.119" end="00:43:25.839" style="s2">in the same way that you can love humans</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.240" end="00:43:27.200" style="s2">you can&#39;t forgive angels like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.839" end="00:43:29.920" style="s2">this idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.200" end="00:43:30.880" style="s2">the forms like the patterns the the the</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.920" end="00:43:32.560" style="s2">angels are basically</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.880" end="00:43:34.079" style="s2">higher level patterns but once you</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.560" end="00:43:35.839" style="s2">create them they&#39;re because they&#39;re eye</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.079" end="00:43:37.599" style="s2">level patterns their forms they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.839" end="00:43:39.280" style="s2">they&#39;re stuck they either fall or they</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.599" end="00:43:40.560" style="s2">they they stay out so so that&#39;s it you</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.280" end="00:43:43.520" style="s2">can&#39;t really forgive them</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.560" end="00:43:43.920" style="s2">but with humans our our wills allow us</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.520" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.920" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">to fall and then to ask forgiveness oh</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:50.400" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting i can find an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.920" end="00:43:52.880" style="s2">to buddhism there too um because</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.400" end="00:43:54.720" style="s2">then there&#39;s this wheel right then all</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.880" end="00:43:56.000" style="s2">the realms are in a kind of wheel you</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.720" end="00:43:59.040" style="s2">have the human realm</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.000" end="00:44:01.280" style="s2">and you have the god realm you know uh</p>

<p begin="00:44:03.040" end="00:44:07.359" style="s2">the jealous gods and then you have the i</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.920" end="00:44:08.560" style="s2">don&#39;t know if i&#39;m getting it right here</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.359" end="00:44:10.000" style="s2">you have the animal realm and you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.560" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">the hell room and there&#39;s this kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.000" end="00:44:13.760" style="s2">wheel right</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.640" end="00:44:14.560" style="s2">yeah hungry ghosts you know at the end</p>

<p begin="00:45:20.560" end="00:45:23.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve been gone</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.839" end="00:45:25.520" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah but but the human realm</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.760" end="00:45:26.880" style="s2">is is a unique realm because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.520" end="00:45:30.839" style="s2">realm where we can become</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.880" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">uh liberated of samsara or</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.839" end="00:45:36.319" style="s2">from okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.839" end="00:45:38.480" style="s2">yeah but that reminds me of when you</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.319" end="00:45:40.640" style="s2">were saying that that you know that that</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.480" end="00:45:42.319" style="s2">in christianity the person you can love</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.640" end="00:45:44.640" style="s2">is is human</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.319" end="00:45:46.480" style="s2">right um you can&#39;t love the angels you</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.640" end="00:45:47.760" style="s2">can&#39;t love the well i mean you can but</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.480" end="00:45:49.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not in the same way like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.760" end="00:45:50.400" style="s2">express the same level of love because</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.280" end="00:45:53.440" style="s2">you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.400" end="00:45:53.839" style="s2">forgive a an angel or you can&#39;t forgive</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.440" end="00:45:57.280" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.839" end="00:45:59.680" style="s2">either because they like they they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.280" end="00:46:01.359" style="s2">what&#39;s the word they&#39;re simple like they</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.680" end="00:46:02.079" style="s2">don&#39;t they don&#39;t change they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.359" end="00:46:04.480" style="s2">unchanging</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.079" end="00:46:06.240" style="s2">so yeah they can&#39;t like try to repent</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.480" end="00:46:09.760" style="s2">and ask forgiveness one but humans can</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.240" end="00:46:12.720" style="s2">so there&#39;s the idea that god created</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.760" end="00:46:13.119" style="s2">man so that man would have like changing</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.720" end="00:46:16.319" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.119" end="00:46:17.839" style="s2">desires and so on and that man would</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.319" end="00:46:19.920" style="s2">likely fall it would have been nice if</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.839" end="00:46:20.480" style="s2">we didn&#39;t but it was quite likely that</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.920" end="00:46:23.680" style="s2">we did</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.480" end="00:46:26.160" style="s2">and then god could manifest like his</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.680" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">infinite love by for saving us and</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.160" end="00:46:30.560" style="s2">forgiving us</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:31.520" style="s2">so like the because we started talking</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.560" end="00:46:33.280" style="s2">about this because you mentioned the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.520" end="00:46:36.000" style="s2">idea that it was weird for</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.280" end="00:46:36.880" style="s2">christ being perfect that he would be be</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.000" end="00:46:39.599" style="s2">crucified like</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.880" end="00:46:41.040" style="s2">like perfection wouldn&#39;t be possible in</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.599" end="00:46:43.200" style="s2">our world but</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.040" end="00:46:44.720" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s christianity tries to even</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.200" end="00:46:45.440" style="s2">flip this to say that the the most</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.720" end="00:46:46.160" style="s2">beautiful this is the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.440" end="00:46:49.280" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.160" end="00:46:52.480" style="s2">right because yes yeah it does</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.280" end="00:46:54.079" style="s2">like the idea that even</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.480" end="00:46:55.520" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the reasons why the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.079" end="00:46:58.000" style="s2">christian story as</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.520" end="00:46:58.720" style="s2">has been doing so well in spite of</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.000" end="00:47:01.040" style="s2">everything and</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.720" end="00:47:02.880" style="s2">the fact that it is paul sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.040" end="00:47:05.200" style="s2">mentions the story i find it really cool</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.880" end="00:47:07.200" style="s2">the missionaries would go let&#39;s see in</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.200" end="00:47:10.319" style="s2">the in the jungle somewhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.200" end="00:47:12.400" style="s2">in asia and they would go live with</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.319" end="00:47:13.839" style="s2">a tribe there learn learn the language</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.400" end="00:47:15.599" style="s2">like create an alphabet for them</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.839" end="00:47:16.960" style="s2">then translate the bible for them in</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.599" end="00:47:18.560" style="s2">that alphabet and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.960" end="00:47:20.400" style="s2">try to evangelize them and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.560" end="00:47:22.559" style="s2">while the missionaries was were there</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.400" end="00:47:24.000" style="s2">like they wouldn&#39;t really get anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.559" end="00:47:25.280" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t work but at some point the</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:26.000" style="s2">missionaries would just sort of pack up</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.280" end="00:47:28.160" style="s2">and leave</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.000" end="00:47:29.280" style="s2">uh but then if you came back like a few</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.160" end="00:47:30.800" style="s2">decades later</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.280" end="00:47:33.440" style="s2">like that tribe would have taken the</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.800" end="00:47:35.119" style="s2">book and would have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.440" end="00:47:36.480" style="s2">let emerge their own version of</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.119" end="00:47:38.880" style="s2">christianity from the story</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.480" end="00:47:40.800" style="s2">and i think it goes to the fact that but</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.880" end="00:47:42.720" style="s2">if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.800" end="00:47:44.000" style="s2">if you take the story just seriously</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.720" end="00:47:48.079" style="s2">enough to let it touch you</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.000" end="00:47:51.520" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s crazy to think of god</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.079" end="00:47:54.559" style="s2">becoming a man to save humanity and to</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.520" end="00:47:57.119" style="s2">to go through all of this torture and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.559" end="00:47:58.160" style="s2">makes the so it&#39;s sort of a flip saying</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.119" end="00:48:00.559" style="s2">perfection</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.160" end="00:48:02.000" style="s2">we have to start seeing like that this</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.559" end="00:48:03.760" style="s2">like doing what</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:05.680" style="s2">christ did on the cross was actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.760" end="00:48:06.000" style="s2">perfect and it&#39;s an unviable thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.680" end="00:48:08.240" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.000" end="00:48:09.599" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a good thing to have done</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.240" end="00:48:11.359" style="s2">and we should all just</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.599" end="00:48:13.200" style="s2">aspire to it and it&#39;s why so many of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.359" end="00:48:15.839" style="s2">early christians were martyred like</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.200" end="00:48:18.160" style="s2">why they did precisely follow in those</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.839" end="00:48:20.960" style="s2">footsteps and were martyred most of them</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.160" end="00:48:23.520" style="s2">yeah gerard distinguishes between the</p>

<p begin="00:48:23.520" end="00:48:27.040" style="s2">uh which which he thinks is really</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.960" end="00:48:28.319" style="s2">really rooted to this old religion of</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.040" end="00:48:30.880" style="s2">paganism</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.319" end="00:48:32.960" style="s2">and then um and then the christianity</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.880" end="00:48:34.960" style="s2">understands the</p>

<p begin="00:48:39.920" end="00:48:44.960" style="s2">this is this this this means that this</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.119" end="00:48:46.000" style="s2">means that the scapegoat mechanism has</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.960" end="00:48:47.839" style="s2">been revealed as</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.000" end="00:48:50.559" style="s2">being being a kind of kind of alive</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.839" end="00:48:52.480" style="s2">right yeah yeah yeah and i wonder i was</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.559" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">scared to know within buddhism if</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.480" end="00:48:56.800" style="s2">there&#39;s an equivalent or</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:48:58.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t even know much about like the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.800" end="00:48:59.760" style="s2">cultures of sacrifice that occurred</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.400" end="00:49:00.880" style="s2">within asia i know that</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.760" end="00:49:02.800" style="s2">makes the claim that you know we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.880" end="00:49:04.800" style="s2">find this pretty much anywhere but</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.800" end="00:49:06.559" style="s2">well i can talk i know in the bond</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.800" end="00:49:08.000" style="s2">culture in tibet there was actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.559" end="00:49:11.520" style="s2">human sacrifice and</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.000" end="00:49:15.599" style="s2">all kinds of uh things like that um</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.520" end="00:49:19.839" style="s2">and uh you know and buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.599" end="00:49:22.720" style="s2">there is you won&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.839" end="00:49:24.480" style="s2">um you won&#39;t find you find symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.720" end="00:49:25.359" style="s2">sacrifice in buddhism but you will never</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.480" end="00:49:27.839" style="s2">find</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.359" end="00:49:29.040" style="s2">human sacrifice or animals certainly not</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.839" end="00:49:30.960" style="s2">animal sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.040" end="00:49:32.640" style="s2">and buddhism wouldn&#39;t sacrifice an</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.960" end="00:49:34.079" style="s2">animal um</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.640" end="00:49:36.240" style="s2">that would be just the worst thing in</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.079" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">the world right so i they must have had</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.240" end="00:49:38.240" style="s2">a way to deal with the scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.520" end="00:49:40.480" style="s2">mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.240" end="00:49:42.000" style="s2">in some in some sense they must have you</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.480" end="00:49:43.119" style="s2">know because they integrated in tibetan</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.000" end="00:49:46.880" style="s2">buddhism they integrated</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.119" end="00:49:49.280" style="s2">some of the shamanistic bond tradition</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.880" end="00:49:50.800" style="s2">and then the thing called tibetan</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.280" end="00:49:55.599" style="s2">buddhism came about</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.800" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">um in tibetan buddhism you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.599" end="00:49:58.880" style="s2">there it would be unthinkable to</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:00.960" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.880" end="00:50:02.960" style="s2">sacrifice a you know an animal or a</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.960" end="00:50:04.720" style="s2">person or anything anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.960" end="00:50:06.160" style="s2">i think at some point in tibet there are</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.720" end="00:50:07.680" style="s2">no even</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.160" end="00:50:10.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not a perfect culture so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.680" end="00:50:12.400" style="s2">want to romanticize it</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.400" end="00:50:14.880" style="s2">people in america romanticize tibetan</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.400" end="00:50:19.440" style="s2">culture because it was in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.880" end="00:50:22.079" style="s2">medieval but i think the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.440" end="00:50:23.520" style="s2">transcend the scapegoat mechanism is</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.079" end="00:50:26.559" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.520" end="00:50:28.160" style="s2">what&#39;s called sadness practice</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.559" end="00:50:30.480" style="s2">so you make an offering of your life</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.160" end="00:50:33.200" style="s2">energy in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.480" end="00:50:34.640" style="s2">without killing something yeah yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.200" end="00:50:37.200" style="s2">does that make any any</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.640" end="00:50:38.800" style="s2">sense yeah i think so because you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.200" end="00:50:39.760" style="s2">see this happening within christianity</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.800" end="00:50:42.960" style="s2">as well where</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.760" end="00:50:45.359" style="s2">the same way that okay instead of just</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:47.520" style="s2">trying to model his desires after what</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.359" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">people were doing around him christ</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.520" end="00:50:51.200" style="s2">did model his desires after something</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.200" end="00:50:52.880" style="s2">higher uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.200" end="00:50:54.480" style="s2">instead of talking about the father</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.880" end="00:50:56.160" style="s2">within buddhism i guess you could say he</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.480" end="00:50:59.760" style="s2">tried to model his desires after being</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.160" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">after the grand being and then in doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.760" end="00:51:03.760" style="s2">doing that was actually a form of</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.920" end="00:51:06.400" style="s2">self-sacrifice so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.760" end="00:51:07.040" style="s2">scapegoating others like everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.400" end="00:51:10.079" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.040" end="00:51:11.040" style="s2">christ like scapegoated himself or let</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.079" end="00:51:12.960" style="s2">himself be escaped</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.040" end="00:51:14.640" style="s2">so he offered like part of himself</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.960" end="00:51:17.200" style="s2">instead of sir</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.640" end="00:51:18.720" style="s2">instead of skip voting others and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.200" end="00:51:19.520" style="s2">what we should do is the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.720" end="00:51:22.640" style="s2">he did so</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.520" end="00:51:24.640" style="s2">we should parts of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.640" end="00:51:26.480" style="s2">rather than sacrificing let&#39;s say goats</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.640" end="00:51:28.559" style="s2">or participating in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.480" end="00:51:29.760" style="s2">sacrifice of other other others but in</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.559" end="00:51:31.920" style="s2">uh you know in some way</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.760" end="00:51:35.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of imagery of sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.920" end="00:51:38.640" style="s2">and dead tantric buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.280" end="00:51:40.480" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting uh um i know i know</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.640" end="00:51:43.839" style="s2">somebody who they went to see a cuban</p>

<p begin="00:51:47.200" end="00:51:51.040" style="s2">and um and they wanted him to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.079" end="00:51:53.680" style="s2">a goat</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.040" end="00:51:54.160" style="s2">or something like this uh and he refused</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.680" end="00:51:56.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.160" end="00:51:58.800" style="s2">and uh he changed it so they sacrificed</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.640" end="00:51:59.920" style="s2">you know they offered a banana and some</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.800" end="00:52:01.280" style="s2">rum instead</p>

<p begin="00:52:01.280" end="00:52:06.559" style="s2">transforming that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.359" end="00:52:10.240" style="s2">notion of sacrifice um into uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.559" end="00:52:12.160" style="s2">um into something not non-violent and uh</p>

<p begin="00:52:52.640" end="00:52:57.440" style="s2">actual sacrifices in tibet to the point</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.640" end="00:52:59.680" style="s2">where now it has become something</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.440" end="00:53:01.119" style="s2">symbolic and more like the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.680" end="00:53:03.520" style="s2">self-sacrifice that</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.119" end="00:53:04.480" style="s2">has happened within christianity where</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.520" end="00:53:06.240" style="s2">you know in</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.480" end="00:53:07.599" style="s2">gerar&#39;s claim is that well this happened</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.240" end="00:53:11.200" style="s2">in the west because of</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.599" end="00:53:12.800" style="s2">christ&#39;s influence uh you reveal the</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.200" end="00:53:13.119" style="s2">mechanism and show this a way out of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.800" end="00:53:14.880" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.119" end="00:53:16.720" style="s2">self-sacrifice rather than other</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.880" end="00:53:18.640" style="s2">sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.720" end="00:53:20.400" style="s2">and i&#39;d be curious if you know the</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.640" end="00:53:22.640" style="s2">history within</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.400" end="00:53:24.640" style="s2">uh buddhism that also went away from</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.640" end="00:53:27.680" style="s2">this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.640" end="00:53:28.240" style="s2">well i mean the history of you know the</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.680" end="00:53:32.559" style="s2">buddha</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.240" end="00:53:35.200" style="s2">um for example um</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.559" end="00:53:36.559" style="s2">he he was it was a it was a rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.200" end="00:53:39.119" style="s2">against the caste system</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.559" end="00:53:40.240" style="s2">in india and it&#39;s that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.119" end="00:53:43.280" style="s2">primitivism</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.240" end="00:53:44.880" style="s2">and um so um</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.280" end="00:53:46.720" style="s2">so you can read the the early text of</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.880" end="00:53:48.480" style="s2">the buddha and the polycon and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.720" end="00:53:50.960" style="s2">libraries full of stuff and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.480" end="00:53:53.839" style="s2">very um</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.960" end="00:53:54.480" style="s2">um progressive you could say compared to</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.839" end="00:53:57.760" style="s2">you know how</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.480" end="00:53:58.640" style="s2">you know it&#39;s very uh progressive is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.760" end="00:54:01.280" style="s2">wrong word because</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.640" end="00:54:03.040" style="s2">that&#39;s become such an ugly ugly word</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.280" end="00:54:05.040" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.040" end="00:54:07.119" style="s2">perhaps it&#39;s similar to neoplatonism or</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.040" end="00:54:07.680" style="s2">plato in aristotle or if it&#39;s praying</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.119" end="00:54:11.520" style="s2">it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.680" end="00:54:13.280" style="s2">um you know it&#39;s very rational it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.520" end="00:54:15.119" style="s2">oh yes so i don&#39;t know if i&#39;m answering</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.280" end="00:54:17.520" style="s2">your question exactly but</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.119" end="00:54:18.319" style="s2">but there&#39;s been some stepping out of</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.520" end="00:54:21.359" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.319" end="00:54:22.000" style="s2">let&#39;s say roman circus or the caste</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.359" end="00:54:25.200" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.000" end="00:54:27.920" style="s2">or or the the worldly</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.200" end="00:54:28.880" style="s2">principalities uh going off into and</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.920" end="00:54:30.720" style="s2">going off and</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.880" end="00:54:31.920" style="s2">and starting the sangha which is the</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.720" end="00:54:35.040" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.920" end="00:54:36.079" style="s2">yeah and uh so perhaps there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.040" end="00:54:39.200" style="s2">analogy to</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.079" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">the christian story in that sense you</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.200" end="00:54:41.200" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.760" end="00:54:44.480" style="s2">the desert fathers went out into the</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.200" end="00:54:47.599" style="s2">desert and left rome behind</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.480" end="00:54:50.160" style="s2">yeah just as yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.599" end="00:54:51.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s less brutal let&#39;s see rather</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.160" end="00:54:54.480" style="s2">than you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.280" end="00:54:56.160" style="s2">christ being only</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.480" end="00:54:57.760" style="s2">having a public ministry for three years</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.160" end="00:54:59.839" style="s2">until it was crucified and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.760" end="00:55:00.799" style="s2">so this setting the physical example for</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.839" end="00:55:03.839" style="s2">people to follow</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.799" end="00:55:05.599" style="s2">for the buddha i guess it was more uh it</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.839" end="00:55:07.119" style="s2">was more of a common sense thing today</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.599" end="00:55:08.720" style="s2">that we would say okay so he</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.119" end="00:55:10.079" style="s2">found something true and then he sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.720" end="00:55:10.880" style="s2">explained it to people and then this</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.079" end="00:55:13.280" style="s2">just grew</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.880" end="00:55:14.880" style="s2">rather than being crucified after three</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.280" end="00:55:19.359" style="s2">years of teaching this</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.880" end="00:55:22.480" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah i mean you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.359" end="00:55:25.760" style="s2">find some pretty wild stories about</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.480" end="00:55:27.280" style="s2">about his life um</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.760" end="00:55:29.280" style="s2">so i wouldn&#39;t want to cast it in this</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.280" end="00:55:31.599" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.280" end="00:55:34.880" style="s2">a rational sense you know yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.599" end="00:55:34.880" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t want to cast it in</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.359" end="00:55:41.119" style="s2">um but on the other hand there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.559" end="00:55:42.240" style="s2">in in the mythology in the mytho poetics</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.119" end="00:55:43.920" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of different buddhas</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.240" end="00:55:46.000" style="s2">there&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.920" end="00:55:47.680" style="s2">many buddhists right buddhas are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.000" end="00:55:49.200" style="s2">like there&#39;s been there&#39;s they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.680" end="00:55:50.880" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re future buddhas there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.200" end="00:55:53.599" style="s2">past buddhists there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.880" end="00:55:54.240" style="s2">you know uh in tibet in tibet actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.599" end="00:55:56.480" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.240" end="00:55:58.160" style="s2">the tantric buddha is is worshipped more</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.480" end="00:56:03.200" style="s2">than shakira&#39;s he&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.160" end="00:56:03.200" style="s2">and he&#39;s more uh important than chucky</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.280" end="00:56:06.880" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting yeah i&#39;d like to jump</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:08.960" style="s2">back to</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.880" end="00:56:10.400" style="s2">something we talked about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.960" end="00:56:12.160" style="s2">because yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.400" end="00:56:13.760" style="s2">seems like you had your thoughts on on</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.160" end="00:56:14.079" style="s2">the other thing when you said you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.760" end="00:56:15.760" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.079" end="00:56:17.839" style="s2">your early 20s when you didn&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.760" end="00:56:19.599" style="s2">that christianity made much much sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.839" end="00:56:22.319" style="s2">since it was just too prepositional</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.599" end="00:56:25.440" style="s2">whereas you could go to</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.319" end="00:56:28.319" style="s2">like practice buddhism and</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.440" end="00:56:29.440" style="s2">be involved in it bodily with your</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.319" end="00:56:32.079" style="s2">senses and so on</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.440" end="00:56:32.799" style="s2">so yeah well you know i i went to</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.079" end="00:56:34.640" style="s2">practice zen</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.799" end="00:56:36.240" style="s2">and you would sit and meditate for hours</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.640" end="00:56:37.680" style="s2">and end right and that would have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.240" end="00:56:39.839" style="s2">certain kind of effect so you go</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.680" end="00:56:41.280" style="s2">directly into spiritual practice</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.839" end="00:56:43.359" style="s2">whereas if you go to church you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.280" end="00:56:45.119" style="s2">supposed to believe all these things and</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.359" end="00:56:46.960" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like but just that was for</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.119" end="00:56:48.319" style="s2">me as being a you know russian investor</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.960" end="00:56:50.559" style="s2">i don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.319" end="00:56:52.240" style="s2">be dismissive of the tradition in any</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.559" end="00:56:53.680" style="s2">way i know there&#39;s living</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.240" end="00:56:55.280" style="s2">you know there&#39;s living i know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.680" end="00:56:57.680" style="s2">living in dead traditions of</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.280" end="00:56:58.640" style="s2">buddhism there&#39;s a lot of you know token</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.680" end="00:57:02.079" style="s2">buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.640" end="00:57:02.960" style="s2">as well or or you know wrong-headed</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.079" end="00:57:04.640" style="s2">buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.960" end="00:57:06.319" style="s2">as well but my impression of</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.640" end="00:57:08.720" style="s2">christianity was uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.319" end="00:57:10.559" style="s2">was i i didn&#39;t feel that the people i</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.720" end="00:57:14.400" style="s2">met in christian world and</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.559" end="00:57:16.000" style="s2">were worthy of emulation or um</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.400" end="00:57:17.920" style="s2">because i didn&#39;t meet those people i</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.000" end="00:57:20.319" style="s2">know they&#39;re there but i i didn&#39;t meet</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.920" end="00:57:22.319" style="s2">those people if i didn&#39;t meet jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.319" end="00:57:23.680" style="s2">and you and you know i didn&#39;t mean</p>

<p begin="00:57:36.160" end="00:57:39.599" style="s2">i didn&#39;t make that connection to</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.359" end="00:57:40.000" style="s2">christianity until i i didn&#39;t make a</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.599" end="00:57:42.079" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.000" end="00:57:43.440" style="s2">to christianity until i&#39;d gone through</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.079" end="00:57:45.200" style="s2">buddhism and then i could understand</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.440" end="00:57:45.520" style="s2">christianity which is interesting i</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.200" end="00:57:47.119" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.520" end="00:57:49.040" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying i understand christianity</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.119" end="00:57:51.359" style="s2">but i could have some</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.040" end="00:57:52.880" style="s2">affinity for for for christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.359" end="00:57:55.920" style="s2">christian stories and</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.880" end="00:57:58.240" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah yes make sense to you</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.920" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense um</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.240" end="00:58:03.119" style="s2">because also with</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:04.640" style="s2">you know i i reverted after i reverted</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.119" end="00:58:06.319" style="s2">to christianity just in the last few</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.640" end="00:58:09.280" style="s2">years after</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.319" end="00:58:10.799" style="s2">like doing philosophy and listening and</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.280" end="00:58:11.599" style="s2">talking to jonathan and so on so it</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.799" end="00:58:13.680" style="s2">became</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.599" end="00:58:15.040" style="s2">more viable as time went on and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.680" end="00:58:18.000" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a so</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.040" end="00:58:21.040" style="s2">strange and sad shouldn&#39;t say strange</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.000" end="00:58:22.799" style="s2">necessarily but it&#39;s a sad story that</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.040" end="00:58:24.880" style="s2">each time christianity has to die before</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.799" end="00:58:26.559" style="s2">it reborns that each time you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.880" end="00:58:29.280" style="s2">that that death is tragic and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.559" end="00:58:30.799" style="s2">saddened it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.280" end="00:58:32.559" style="s2">not it&#39;s bad for a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.799" end="00:58:34.319" style="s2">initially it started with christ</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.559" end="00:58:35.839" style="s2">and then all these apostles suffered and</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.319" end="00:58:36.880" style="s2">like all the early churches suffered and</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.839" end="00:58:38.880" style="s2">so it just like</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.880" end="00:58:40.559" style="s2">keeps escalating levels as the church</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.880" end="00:58:42.720" style="s2">grows but</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.559" end="00:58:44.160" style="s2">what i find interesting in your story is</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.720" end="00:58:47.040" style="s2">that you you could</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.160" end="00:58:47.520" style="s2">you could feel that it wasn&#39;t working</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.040" end="00:58:50.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.520" end="00:58:53.119" style="s2">um and now</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.640" end="00:58:54.240" style="s2">in the just in the last few years then</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.119" end="00:58:55.520" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.240" end="00:58:57.599" style="s2">on the one it&#39;s because of what you</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.520" end="00:58:58.240" style="s2">learned in buddhism but also because of</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.599" end="00:58:59.520" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.240" end="00:59:01.839" style="s2">like the christian figures that are</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.520" end="00:59:03.119" style="s2">emerging on this in this corner of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.839" end="00:59:05.359" style="s2">internet particularly that</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.119" end="00:59:06.880" style="s2">come up with something that is more</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.359" end="00:59:09.920" style="s2">attractive to people</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.880" end="00:59:12.160" style="s2">yeah so yeah if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.920" end="00:59:14.400" style="s2">idea of what&#39;s going to happen next it</p>

<p begin="00:59:42.400" end="00:59:46.160" style="s2">the society without that is</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.960" end="00:59:49.680" style="s2">unsustainable</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.160" end="00:59:51.520" style="s2">and uh and shallow and consumeristic and</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.680" end="00:59:53.839" style="s2">you know the result is the zombie</p>

<p begin="01:00:09.440" end="01:00:13.280" style="s2">about this but</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.319" end="01:00:15.599" style="s2">i think that religions change don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.280" end="01:00:18.480" style="s2">i mean over time they don&#39;t just remain</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.599" end="01:00:20.480" style="s2">like the traditionalists would you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.480" end="01:00:22.559" style="s2">see okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.480" end="01:00:23.520" style="s2">how people practice christianity in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.559" end="01:00:25.359" style="s2">medieval</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.520" end="01:00:28.160" style="s2">times would have to be it would have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.359" end="01:00:30.160" style="s2">be different now i mean i i think that</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.160" end="01:00:31.520" style="s2">buddhism would have to be different in</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.160" end="01:00:33.760" style="s2">in uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.520" end="01:00:36.160" style="s2">i live in france and with america than</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.760" end="01:00:39.520" style="s2">it was in china or japan</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.160" end="01:00:43.599" style="s2">and i think christianity will have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.520" end="01:00:45.280" style="s2">um uh become</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.599" end="01:00:46.960" style="s2">something else and it probably is become</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.280" end="01:00:47.599" style="s2">something else before it can be reborn</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.960" end="01:00:50.319" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.599" end="01:00:52.319" style="s2">if it remains a shallow dogma or this</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.319" end="01:00:55.359" style="s2">kind of triumphalism of</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.319" end="01:00:56.079" style="s2">uh you know where you just believe in</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.359" end="01:00:58.240" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.079" end="01:00:59.359" style="s2">and and you know people are too</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.240" end="01:01:02.400" style="s2">intelligent</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.359" end="01:01:03.200" style="s2">for that and i know there is a more</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.400" end="01:01:06.000" style="s2">intelligent</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.200" end="01:01:07.280" style="s2">kind of christianity than the kind that</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.000" end="01:01:10.720" style="s2">that you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.280" end="01:01:14.559" style="s2">the fundamentalist people are selling</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.720" end="01:01:15.040" style="s2">yeah i think it&#39;s a we can understand it</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.559" end="01:01:17.280" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.040" end="01:01:18.400" style="s2">like the symbolism of peter and john or</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.280" end="01:01:21.760" style="s2">the symbolism of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.400" end="01:01:23.599" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s a hidden part of</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.760" end="01:01:25.599" style="s2">all those traditions that&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.599" end="01:01:26.960" style="s2">change like um</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.599" end="01:01:29.520" style="s2">in the same way you can even take a</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.960" end="01:01:31.440" style="s2">person like there&#39;s a part of me</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.520" end="01:01:33.280" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t change that never changes</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.440" end="01:01:36.079" style="s2">like i can always tell that</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.280" end="01:01:37.680" style="s2">i can take gp 20 years ago who has like</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.079" end="01:01:39.119" style="s2">no no the same atoms like all of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.680" end="01:01:39.920" style="s2">particles are different like physically</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.119" end="01:01:41.839" style="s2">it&#39;s all different</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.920" end="01:01:43.359" style="s2">but it&#39;s still there&#39;s a something</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.839" end="01:01:45.440" style="s2">hidden something more abstract</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.359" end="01:01:46.640" style="s2">that was there 20 years ago that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.440" end="01:01:49.680" style="s2">still here now</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.640" end="01:01:50.880" style="s2">uh and i think it&#39;s going to be the same</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.680" end="01:01:52.160" style="s2">thing with</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.880" end="01:01:54.000" style="s2">those different traditions like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.160" end="01:01:54.880" style="s2">gonna be something in them there&#39;s a an</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.000" end="01:01:57.680" style="s2">abstract</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.880" end="01:01:59.280" style="s2">uh link that has never been lost so like</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.680" end="01:02:03.520" style="s2">christianity 2000 years ago is</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.280" end="01:02:05.280" style="s2">still like the same christianity that is</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.520" end="01:02:06.640" style="s2">at the hidden level but at the manifest</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.280" end="01:02:08.799" style="s2">level it&#39;s always different</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.640" end="01:02:10.640" style="s2">like even my body at the manifest level</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.799" end="01:02:13.760" style="s2">is always different every microsecond</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.640" end="01:02:15.440" style="s2">i&#39;m manifesting myself at different</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.760" end="01:02:18.240" style="s2">in different ways that&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.440" end="01:02:20.160" style="s2">point yeah and within christianity we</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.240" end="01:02:21.839" style="s2">like we have great symbolism for this i</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.160" end="01:02:22.960" style="s2">think it&#39;s i i find it crazy that no</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.839" end="01:02:25.280" style="s2">one&#39;s talking about this</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.960" end="01:02:26.400" style="s2">uh so i&#39;ve been like arping are thinking</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.280" end="01:02:29.039" style="s2">about it recently but</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.400" end="01:02:30.400" style="s2">there&#39;s the symbols of peter and john</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.039" end="01:02:31.839" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.400" end="01:02:33.680" style="s2">there are a lot of stories i mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.839" end="01:02:37.119" style="s2">just two when i talked with</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.680" end="01:02:39.440" style="s2">with john last time but there</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.119" end="01:02:42.000" style="s2">the idea is that it&#39;s very clear if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.440" end="01:02:44.480" style="s2">read uh john&#39;s gospel</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.000" end="01:02:45.599" style="s2">especially towards the end you have john</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.480" end="01:02:49.520" style="s2">who represents the</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.599" end="01:02:50.880" style="s2">the hidden part of the church</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.520" end="01:02:52.960" style="s2">and there are a few illustrations for</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.880" end="01:02:54.079" style="s2">this like he lays on the breast of</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.960" end="01:02:56.640" style="s2">christ at</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.079" end="01:02:58.480" style="s2">the supper also the fact that i think</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.640" end="01:03:00.079" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s very interesting and i i</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.480" end="01:03:02.400" style="s2">sort of blew my mind when my friend</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.079" end="01:03:06.640" style="s2">jacob russell told me this</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.400" end="01:03:09.520" style="s2">if you read john&#39;s gospel</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.640" end="01:03:10.400" style="s2">john is never named he&#39;s always just</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.520" end="01:03:13.039" style="s2">described as</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.400" end="01:03:13.839" style="s2">the the apostle whom jesus loved so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.039" end="01:03:17.039" style="s2">sort of hidden</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.839" end="01:03:19.920" style="s2">it is not it&#39;s not there and for peter</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.039" end="01:03:20.960" style="s2">who represents the the concrete like the</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.920" end="01:03:24.319" style="s2">the everyday</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.960" end="01:03:26.079" style="s2">the manifestation of the church uh he</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.319" end="01:03:28.960" style="s2">on the one end you can say you can tell</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.079" end="01:03:31.599" style="s2">that peter is sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.960" end="01:03:32.079" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not very reflective let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.599" end="01:03:34.079" style="s2">like he</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.079" end="01:03:35.520" style="s2">he he tends to act really quickly and he</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.079" end="01:03:38.240" style="s2">gets corrected by christ</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.520" end="01:03:39.520" style="s2">or by others he&#39;s just when uh at some</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.240" end="01:03:42.240" style="s2">point they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re in a ship</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.520" end="01:03:43.119" style="s2">uh once uh jesus as sort of a as</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.240" end="01:03:46.079" style="s2">resurrected</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.119" end="01:03:46.799" style="s2">um john of course was the the hidden the</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.079" end="01:03:49.039" style="s2">center</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.799" end="01:03:50.640" style="s2">can see that christ is on the shore uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.039" end="01:03:51.119" style="s2">through waiting for them so as soon as</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.640" end="01:03:52.559" style="s2">peter</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.119" end="01:03:54.000" style="s2">hears this he&#39;s just like i think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.559" end="01:03:55.200" style="s2">naked on the boat because people use the</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.000" end="01:03:55.839" style="s2">fish naked apparently but it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.200" end="01:03:58.000" style="s2">symbol for</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.839" end="01:03:59.440" style="s2">like being naked in the garden and and</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.000" end="01:04:00.160" style="s2">he sort of just puts on some clothes and</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.440" end="01:04:02.160" style="s2">then like</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.160" end="01:04:03.440" style="s2">runs runs through christ but you can</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.160" end="01:04:05.119" style="s2">just swim in the water like this</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.440" end="01:04:06.720" style="s2">it just gets like pacified by the other</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.119" end="01:04:10.000" style="s2">apostles anyways</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.720" end="01:04:12.720" style="s2">and then in opposition to john being</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.000" end="01:04:14.799" style="s2">hidden and not being named in his gospel</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.720" end="01:04:15.920" style="s2">peter is named all the time and christ</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.799" end="01:04:18.319" style="s2">says that</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.920" end="01:04:20.720" style="s2">peter is the name he used to be used to</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.319" end="01:04:20.720" style="s2">be called</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.799" end="01:04:26.079" style="s2">simon but his name peter when christ</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.319" end="01:04:27.440" style="s2">makes him his rock the stone upon which</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.079" end="01:04:30.079" style="s2">is going to found the church and</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.440" end="01:04:32.079" style="s2">in in several languages you can see this</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.079" end="01:04:35.440" style="s2">in the name so in in french</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.079" end="01:04:38.480" style="s2">uh peter is</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.440" end="01:04:41.039" style="s2">it&#39;s the word for stone so okay right</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.480" end="01:04:42.799" style="s2">yeah so peter becomes like the the</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.039" end="01:04:44.799" style="s2">manifestation the concrete like</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.799" end="01:04:46.000" style="s2">the stuff you can see like the the stone</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.799" end="01:04:49.280" style="s2">that marks</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.000" end="01:04:50.000" style="s2">the the the area right the salinity or</p>

<p begin="01:04:50.000" end="01:04:54.400" style="s2">of the of the church right and then i</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.720" end="01:04:57.359" style="s2">should say that this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.400" end="01:04:58.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s like the the the explicit</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.359" end="01:05:01.520" style="s2">solidity</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.240" end="01:05:03.920" style="s2">not the identity yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.520" end="01:05:05.680" style="s2">because peter will actually go on to die</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.920" end="01:05:08.640" style="s2">and you can read this at the end of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.680" end="01:05:10.160" style="s2">of his gospel where christ tells peter</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.640" end="01:05:11.760" style="s2">that peter is going to be martyred</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.160" end="01:05:14.400" style="s2">and you have this idea that the concrete</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.760" end="01:05:15.920" style="s2">manifestation has to die like that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.400" end="01:05:17.920" style="s2">christianity will expand whereas the</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.920" end="01:05:20.319" style="s2">center john will not die</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.920" end="01:05:21.440" style="s2">crisis that jungle theory until uh until</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.319" end="01:05:24.480" style="s2">peter comes back</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.440" end="01:05:25.920" style="s2">and in the church you all what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.480" end="01:05:28.960" style="s2">seen is always a</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.920" end="01:05:29.680" style="s2">sort of a an expression starting from</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.960" end="01:05:31.839" style="s2">the center</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.680" end="01:05:32.960" style="s2">that goes to the outside and dies and</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.839" end="01:05:35.200" style="s2">then each time</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.960" end="01:05:36.640" style="s2">like it makes more ground for the center</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.200" end="01:05:38.720" style="s2">to expand next time</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.640" end="01:05:40.319" style="s2">and there was this great mysterious</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.720" end="01:05:41.760" style="s2">relationship between the center</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.319" end="01:05:43.680" style="s2">and and the periphery and this with our</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.760" end="01:05:46.559" style="s2">church lots of cool examples where</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.680" end="01:05:47.599" style="s2">for instance you had um several councils</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.559" end="01:05:49.359" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.599" end="01:05:52.000" style="s2">a bunch of priests and bishops would</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.359" end="01:05:54.640" style="s2">gather for for months to draft let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.000" end="01:05:56.240" style="s2">a certain a certain trade or something</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.640" end="01:05:57.680" style="s2">to condemn some samaritans</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.240" end="01:06:00.000" style="s2">and after all of these people in</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.680" end="01:06:00.799" style="s2">explicit powers an explicit authority</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.000" end="01:06:02.240" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.799" end="01:06:04.160" style="s2">have spent all of this time doing this</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.240" end="01:06:06.559" style="s2">they would go see a site somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.160" end="01:06:08.079" style="s2">uh who has no authority and has been</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.559" end="01:06:10.319" style="s2">doing weird things like there was an</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.079" end="01:06:11.520" style="s2">uh ethic in one of the early councils</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.319" end="01:06:15.680" style="s2">they went to see</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.520" end="01:06:17.760" style="s2">uh a man named saint simeon who spent</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.680" end="01:06:19.119" style="s2">years living on it i think it spent like</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.760" end="01:06:20.960" style="s2">decades it&#39;s really living</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.119" end="01:06:22.640" style="s2">sort of on top of a tower just being an</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.960" end="01:06:24.160" style="s2">aesthetic and just standing on top of</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.640" end="01:06:25.440" style="s2">his tower just praying and never coming</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.160" end="01:06:26.880" style="s2">down so people would give him food and</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.440" end="01:06:27.280" style="s2">so on he would sometimes pray for people</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.880" end="01:06:29.119" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.280" end="01:06:30.640" style="s2">mostly was just there on his tower and</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.119" end="01:06:31.280" style="s2">it was this person with no authority</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.640" end="01:06:33.200" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.280" end="01:06:35.119" style="s2">that uh like all the bishops and priests</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.200" end="01:06:36.640" style="s2">went to see to make sure that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.119" end="01:06:38.160" style="s2">like their documents was okay so</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.640" end="01:06:40.240" style="s2">this person like the hidden part of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.160" end="01:06:43.039" style="s2">church who has no explicit authority</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.240" end="01:06:44.880" style="s2">would be that from which the the</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.039" end="01:06:47.119" style="s2">periphery can extend that from which the</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.880" end="01:06:49.359" style="s2">active uh priests and bishops</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.119" end="01:06:51.039" style="s2">could could uh that makes total sense to</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.359" end="01:06:53.119" style="s2">me yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.039" end="01:06:54.240" style="s2">so and then you know in the buddhist</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.119" end="01:06:56.160" style="s2">tradition you have</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.240" end="01:06:57.280" style="s2">the dalai lama or something you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.160" end="01:06:59.119" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.280" end="01:07:00.720" style="s2">the symbol of tibetan buddhism and</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.119" end="01:07:02.799" style="s2">everybody would revere him</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.720" end="01:07:05.039" style="s2">but but actually that the guy in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.799" end="01:07:07.920" style="s2">forest you know uh that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.039" end="01:07:08.559" style="s2">crazy man in the forest would be the guy</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.920" end="01:07:11.440" style="s2">who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.559" end="01:07:12.319" style="s2">really holding the the inner um thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.440" end="01:07:15.119" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.319" end="01:07:16.319" style="s2">yeah yeah and another really cool</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.119" end="01:07:19.599" style="s2">instantiation of this is</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.319" end="01:07:22.000" style="s2">i heard this uh very recently but during</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.599" end="01:07:23.920" style="s2">let&#39;s see medieval times it would happen</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.000" end="01:07:25.440" style="s2">that in a cathedral</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.920" end="01:07:27.440" style="s2">so you have the bishop in his cathedral</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.440" end="01:07:28.480" style="s2">and he has explicit power and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.440" end="01:07:30.079" style="s2">representing the church and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.480" end="01:07:33.119" style="s2">supposed to sort of expand the church</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.079" end="01:07:36.319" style="s2">uh you would often have like a let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.119" end="01:07:39.680" style="s2">a very pious person living as a</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.319" end="01:07:42.319" style="s2">um as a an hermit</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.680" end="01:07:43.039" style="s2">in like in the sale somewhere in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.319" end="01:07:44.480" style="s2">cathedral</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.039" end="01:07:45.839" style="s2">would it would be like let&#39;s say just</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.480" end="01:07:47.680" style="s2">the if you&#39;re pious woman who was</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.839" end="01:07:50.160" style="s2">praying that was really like all day</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.680" end="01:07:52.000" style="s2">and the bishop would go to see her like</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.160" end="01:07:53.280" style="s2">to talk to her all the time when he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.000" end="01:07:55.599" style="s2">trying to make his decisions because</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.280" end="01:07:57.119" style="s2">because she has like she&#39;s close to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.599" end="01:07:57.760" style="s2">center she&#39;s close to the art of christ</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.119" end="01:07:59.280" style="s2">like john</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.760" end="01:08:00.559" style="s2">so she like she&#39;s the part of</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.280" end="01:08:01.119" style="s2">christianity that doesn&#39;t change like</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.559" end="01:08:03.119" style="s2">the very</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.119" end="01:08:04.160" style="s2">very pious part that is invisible and</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.119" end="01:08:05.760" style="s2">close to the heart</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.160" end="01:08:08.319" style="s2">that&#39;s the part that the church that</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.760" end="01:08:11.039" style="s2">can&#39;t change but right</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.319" end="01:08:12.160" style="s2">the the hour the explicit like the part</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.039" end="01:08:14.799" style="s2">that uh will die</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.160" end="01:08:16.159" style="s2">the the bishop is the one who has to</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.799" end="01:08:17.839" style="s2">talk to the center so that we can then</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.159" end="01:08:20.880" style="s2">carry it outward</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.839" end="01:08:24.080" style="s2">yeah that makes me think a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.880" end="01:08:25.679" style="s2">uh about you know you know we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.080" end="01:08:28.880" style="s2">these kind of conversations</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.679" end="01:08:32.640" style="s2">in public in a sense but on youtube</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.880" end="01:08:34.080" style="s2">and uh and being kind of public</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.640" end="01:08:35.839" style="s2">but the people i know who are the most</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.080" end="01:08:37.440" style="s2">spiritual are probably</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.839" end="01:08:40.080" style="s2">they&#39;re not they&#39;re not me they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.440" end="01:08:42.400" style="s2">they&#39;re very humble people that nobody</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.080" end="01:08:44.080" style="s2">would ever talk to or me</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.400" end="01:08:45.600" style="s2">you know or that don&#39;t even have no</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.080" end="01:08:50.960" style="s2">interest in</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.600" end="01:08:50.960" style="s2">in uh maybe i&#39;m maybe i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.199" end="01:08:55.040" style="s2">uh maybe i&#39;m putting down this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.920" end="01:08:57.759" style="s2">activity i don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.040" end="01:08:58.799" style="s2">to do that either but but just i i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.759" end="01:09:00.719" style="s2">noticed that</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.799" end="01:09:02.400" style="s2">i&#39;ve noticed the people who are much</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.719" end="01:09:05.759" style="s2">more you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.400" end="01:09:07.359" style="s2">advanced spiritually than me are are not</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.759" end="01:09:10.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.359" end="01:09:11.839" style="s2">are not out there in the public yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.400" end="01:09:14.880" style="s2">they have to have to be on</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.839" end="01:09:16.560" style="s2">in some level um in the private but</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.880" end="01:09:20.560" style="s2">they&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.560" end="01:09:23.120" style="s2">doing more you know for the world</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.560" end="01:09:24.799" style="s2">or as much i i don&#39;t know maybe i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.120" end="01:09:25.679" style="s2">being too judgmental here and how i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.799" end="01:09:28.719" style="s2">saying it but</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.679" end="01:09:29.520" style="s2">perhaps somebody praying in in in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.719" end="01:09:34.239" style="s2">retreat</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.520" end="01:09:35.920" style="s2">uh is has as much effect as a social</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.239" end="01:09:37.359" style="s2">as somebody out there in in the middle</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.920" end="01:09:40.640" style="s2">of the politics</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.359" end="01:09:42.400" style="s2">doing stuff yeah yeah i think</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.640" end="01:09:44.560" style="s2">yeah within christianity i think</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.400" end="01:09:47.120" style="s2">different traditions will</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.560" end="01:09:48.799" style="s2">tend to emphasize one branch let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.120" end="01:09:50.880" style="s2">the active or the contemplative</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.799" end="01:09:52.640" style="s2">and i think if you go back to the first</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.880" end="01:09:53.600" style="s2">apostles i think it&#39;s a mistake to see</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.640" end="01:09:56.400" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.600" end="01:09:57.040" style="s2">in terms of a like of one era key where</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.400" end="01:09:58.719" style="s2">you could fit</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.040" end="01:10:00.880" style="s2">all of the apostles or like all of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.719" end="01:10:02.800" style="s2">different vocations i think rather it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.880" end="01:10:04.800" style="s2">supposed to be really a</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.800" end="01:10:06.880" style="s2">a body where you have different people</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.800" end="01:10:09.440" style="s2">have different kinds of authority</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.880" end="01:10:10.560" style="s2">and as long as they they work together</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.440" end="01:10:12.480" style="s2">in a body then</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.560" end="01:10:14.320" style="s2">you have then it&#39;s actually the best</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.480" end="01:10:16.880" style="s2">thing for everyone so</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.320" end="01:10:17.840" style="s2">in in what i mentioned earlier there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.880" end="01:10:21.199" style="s2">sense in which</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.840" end="01:10:22.159" style="s2">john is higher because he is closer to</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.199" end="01:10:23.520" style="s2">the art of christ because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.159" end="01:10:25.440" style="s2">contemplative because he has the part of</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.520" end="01:10:28.480" style="s2">christianity that will never die</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.440" end="01:10:30.560" style="s2">but on the other end like he</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.480" end="01:10:31.760" style="s2">he couldn&#39;t even survive without peter</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.560" end="01:10:33.520" style="s2">who is expanding the church</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.760" end="01:10:35.040" style="s2">who is like making sure that like the</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.520" end="01:10:36.800" style="s2">tradition doesn&#39;t actually die that</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.040" end="01:10:40.719" style="s2">christianity doesn&#39;t get wiped out right</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.800" end="01:10:44.080" style="s2">for instance and you can see this at a</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.719" end="01:10:45.679" style="s2">okay so you can see this in in what</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.080" end="01:10:46.320" style="s2">occurred within orthodox christianity</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.679" end="01:10:47.760" style="s2">and catholic</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.320" end="01:10:49.360" style="s2">and the catholic church so the two</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.760" end="01:10:52.000" style="s2">churches got split</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.360" end="01:10:53.600" style="s2">because partly of theological</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.000" end="01:10:56.080" style="s2">differences because of linguistic but</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.600" end="01:10:58.719" style="s2">but also because of the the because of</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.080" end="01:11:00.239" style="s2">islam that just sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.719" end="01:11:03.679" style="s2">cut the two parts of the christian</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.239" end="01:11:03.679" style="s2">empire uh and</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.640" end="01:11:08.159" style="s2">the orthodox church has been putting</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.239" end="01:11:08.480" style="s2">much more emphasis on monasticism on</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.159" end="01:11:10.560" style="s2">john</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.480" end="01:11:11.840" style="s2">you can really see them as john they</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.560" end="01:11:12.880" style="s2">don&#39;t they don&#39;t change they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.840" end="01:11:15.760" style="s2">evangelize much</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.880" end="01:11:17.280" style="s2">uh but they they have like a mystical</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.760" end="01:11:19.840" style="s2">quality to them don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.280" end="01:11:21.120" style="s2">as well perhaps they work more with with</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.840" end="01:11:23.840" style="s2">with symbols and they&#39;re less</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.120" end="01:11:23.840" style="s2">propositional</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.920" end="01:11:27.199" style="s2">and their theology is great like it</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.520" end="01:11:29.120" style="s2">hasn&#39;t changed forever but</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.199" end="01:11:30.800" style="s2">it&#39;s really great and you that&#39;s why you</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.120" end="01:11:33.040" style="s2">see people like time coming from the</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.800" end="01:11:34.800" style="s2">tradition and can like say things that</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.040" end="01:11:38.000" style="s2">are extremely impressive</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.800" end="01:11:38.960" style="s2">uh that are that are true and so</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.000" end="01:11:40.960" style="s2">you can see this from the other</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.960" end="01:11:41.760" style="s2">expedition and they put monasticism at a</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.960" end="01:11:45.199" style="s2">very high level</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.760" end="01:11:47.760" style="s2">all of their their bishops or monks</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.199" end="01:11:49.120" style="s2">right uh and like basically the best</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.760" end="01:11:49.360" style="s2">thing in terms of vocation you can do in</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.120" end="01:11:51.040" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.360" end="01:11:52.480" style="s2">lectures is to be to be a monk like the</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.040" end="01:11:53.520" style="s2">only reason not to be a monk is because</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.480" end="01:11:54.960" style="s2">you can&#39;t handle it</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.520" end="01:11:56.880" style="s2">uh if you can you should definitely be</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.960" end="01:11:58.800" style="s2">alone whereas in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.880" end="01:12:00.000" style="s2">so being married and having children is</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.800" end="01:12:02.239" style="s2">a lesser sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.000" end="01:12:04.880" style="s2">uh yeah it&#39;s good it&#39;s good but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.239" end="01:12:06.640" style="s2">as good it&#39;s not as good yeah sure</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.880" end="01:12:08.480" style="s2">and within the catholic church then we</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.640" end="01:12:11.920" style="s2">put more emphasis on peter on being</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.480" end="01:12:13.360" style="s2">like a priest um so it&#39;s and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.920" end="01:12:14.800" style="s2">there&#39;s always a tension there because i</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.360" end="01:12:15.520" style="s2">was talking to this about my spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.800" end="01:12:17.199" style="s2">director and was</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.520" end="01:12:18.719" style="s2">explaining to me that well i mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.199" end="01:12:20.560" style="s2">ultimately you have to do what</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.719" end="01:12:22.560" style="s2">like god is calling you to individually</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.560" end="01:12:23.600" style="s2">like if you&#39;re called to marriage it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.560" end="01:12:24.719" style="s2">the best thing you can do</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.600" end="01:12:26.320" style="s2">but like at the level of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.719" end="01:12:27.840" style="s2">organization then the most important</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.320" end="01:12:29.040" style="s2">thing is to be is to be a priest</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.840" end="01:12:30.960" style="s2">so there&#39;s this tension there but</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.040" end="01:12:32.880" style="s2">there&#39;s still this idea that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.960" end="01:12:34.320" style="s2">like if you can be a priest it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.880" end="01:12:36.239" style="s2">what you should do and assuming that in</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.320" end="01:12:39.600" style="s2">the orthodox church if you can be</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.239" end="01:12:41.600" style="s2">uh it&#39;s what you should do you have the</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.600" end="01:12:42.719" style="s2">the active versus the contemplative in</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.600" end="01:12:46.480" style="s2">those two traditions</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.719" end="01:12:48.800" style="s2">uh and what and what has happened</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.480" end="01:12:51.520" style="s2">historically is</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.800" end="01:12:52.000" style="s2">the orthodox church was almost wiped out</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.520" end="01:12:54.719" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.000" end="01:12:55.440" style="s2">uh by by islam and then by communism</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.719" end="01:12:58.080" style="s2">recently</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.440" end="01:12:59.120" style="s2">but it has re-emerged both times in in</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.080" end="01:13:02.320" style="s2">part i think because</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.120" end="01:13:02.960" style="s2">like the west rome peter has been able</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.320" end="01:13:06.159" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.960" end="01:13:07.920" style="s2">like stop those uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.159" end="01:13:09.840" style="s2">those agents like stop uh the spirit of</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.920" end="01:13:11.600" style="s2">islam and also it didn&#39;t get it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.840" end="01:13:14.400" style="s2">get destroyed in the same way that</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.600" end="01:13:15.520" style="s2">uh it remained yeah because it was</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.400" end="01:13:17.600" style="s2">probably more active</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.520" end="01:13:18.800" style="s2">you know and politically in that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.600" end="01:13:21.520" style="s2">thing yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.800" end="01:13:22.000" style="s2">so so the the the inner like the pious</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.520" end="01:13:23.760" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.000" end="01:13:25.199" style="s2">that are the ideal part of the church</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.760" end="01:13:26.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.199" end="01:13:28.480" style="s2">simply wiped out in part because of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.880" end="01:13:29.679" style="s2">active part of the church and the church</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.480" end="01:13:31.679" style="s2">can also extend this</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.679" end="01:13:32.880" style="s2">so like i don&#39;t think it would be fair</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.679" end="01:13:34.960" style="s2">to say that</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.880" end="01:13:36.800" style="s2">one of the two hierarchies is better</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.960" end="01:13:37.760" style="s2">like you need you need mounts and you</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.800" end="01:13:39.440" style="s2">need priests</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.760" end="01:13:41.040" style="s2">uh and you need married people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.440" end="01:13:42.719" style="s2">why i was stopping myself when i was</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.040" end="01:13:44.880" style="s2">saying oh maybe i&#39;m you know i</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.719" end="01:13:46.080" style="s2">i&#39;m saying all the person in the forest</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.880" end="01:13:47.360" style="s2">is better than the</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.080" end="01:13:49.920" style="s2">the person who&#39;s right on the front</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.360" end="01:13:51.520" style="s2">lines it&#39;s not that it&#39;s not better it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.920" end="01:13:54.159" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s more like who is fulfilling</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.520" end="01:13:57.280" style="s2">their their archetype or or who is</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.159" end="01:14:00.480" style="s2">you know who is who is who is more</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.280" end="01:14:02.239" style="s2">faithful to their essence</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.480" end="01:14:03.920" style="s2">yeah who&#39;s playing their part in the in</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.239" end="01:14:05.600" style="s2">in the body like in the community</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.920" end="01:14:07.360" style="s2">it&#39;s i think it would be like a</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.600" end="01:14:08.159" style="s2">community right yeah i think it would be</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.360" end="01:14:11.360" style="s2">like asking</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.159" end="01:14:13.120" style="s2">was was it better when christ was</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.360" end="01:14:14.480" style="s2">like praying in the garden of gethsemane</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.120" end="01:14:17.199" style="s2">before being uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.480" end="01:14:18.640" style="s2">betrayed or when he was crucified like</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.199" end="01:14:20.800" style="s2">was it better when he was</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.640" end="01:14:21.760" style="s2">uh contemplative uh playing to his</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.800" end="01:14:23.440" style="s2">father like</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.760" end="01:14:25.440" style="s2">like john or was it better when he was</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.440" end="01:14:27.120" style="s2">on the cross active being persecuted</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.440" end="01:14:28.880" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no better right yeah</p>

<p begin="01:15:27.679" end="01:15:32.000" style="s2">isn&#39;t isn&#39;t that what&#39;s missing from his</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.520" end="01:15:34.960" style="s2">his his whole perspective</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.000" end="01:15:36.080" style="s2">of things in a sense is what what he</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.960" end="01:15:38.719" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.080" end="01:15:40.000" style="s2">philosophy of communitas or community or</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.719" end="01:15:43.280" style="s2">the body of christ</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.000" end="01:15:44.480" style="s2">he talks about christ as an individual</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.280" end="01:15:46.560" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a good question because he</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.480" end="01:15:48.400" style="s2">definitely talks about family as well</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.560" end="01:15:49.920" style="s2">and yeah one of the reasons why he was</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.400" end="01:15:51.920" style="s2">able to pull through in the last year</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.920" end="01:15:53.520" style="s2">was because of his family i mean</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.920" end="01:15:55.360" style="s2">obviously that&#39;s important to him the</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.520" end="01:15:56.239" style="s2">community of the community around him</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.360" end="01:15:58.239" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.239" end="01:16:00.080" style="s2">but uh i want somebody&#39;s philosophy to</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.239" end="01:16:01.679" style="s2">be a buddhist or a christian just out</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.080" end="01:16:05.280" style="s2">there on your own</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.679" end="01:16:08.320" style="s2">you know thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.280" end="01:16:12.320" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah i think it goes to</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.320" end="01:16:14.960" style="s2">a point made by by paul bernickley uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.320" end="01:16:16.480" style="s2">he puts it in a good way i think he says</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.960" end="01:16:18.159" style="s2">without individuals</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.480" end="01:16:20.159" style="s2">nothing changes without institutions</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.159" end="01:16:21.600" style="s2">nothing lasts if people let&#39;s say are</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.159" end="01:16:25.120" style="s2">inspired by jordan</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.600" end="01:16:26.400" style="s2">but if they don&#39;t go into an institution</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.120" end="01:16:28.880" style="s2">that can foster</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.400" end="01:16:32.000" style="s2">like that that seed then it will just</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.880" end="01:16:33.600" style="s2">die like it won&#39;t actually last</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.000" end="01:16:35.679" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know jordan is a very</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.600" end="01:16:37.040" style="s2">strange role</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.679" end="01:16:38.800" style="s2">there are i mean he&#39;s bringing a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.040" end="01:16:40.159" style="s2">people back to the church at the same</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.800" end="01:16:42.640" style="s2">time isn&#39;t he he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.159" end="01:16:44.239" style="s2">waking people up to spirituality yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.640" end="01:16:45.280" style="s2">but but he&#39;s doing it on the outside and</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.239" end="01:16:47.120" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.280" end="01:16:48.640" style="s2">part of the reason for that is is</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.120" end="01:16:50.000" style="s2">because of the death of which</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.640" end="01:16:52.239" style="s2">like you&#39;re talking about the death of</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.000" end="01:16:54.560" style="s2">christianity because christianity</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.239" end="01:16:56.080" style="s2">became so impossible to people like it</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.560" end="01:17:00.000" style="s2">became so</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.080" end="01:17:03.280" style="s2">um let&#39;s say it just became not viable</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.000" end="01:17:07.600" style="s2">not viable to so many people uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.280" end="01:17:10.400" style="s2">their way into it is often through him</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.600" end="01:17:12.320" style="s2">um or or their way into just a as any</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.400" end="01:17:13.280" style="s2">kind of spiritual perspective at all</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.320" end="01:17:16.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.280" end="01:17:17.360" style="s2">um was often like oh oh there&#39;s on this</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.880" end="01:17:20.960" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.360" end="01:17:23.679" style="s2">you know thing that i you know that</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.960" end="01:17:24.640" style="s2">is is missing from my life because</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.679" end="01:17:28.159" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.640" end="01:17:30.480" style="s2">you know i i just have this narrow</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.159" end="01:17:32.159" style="s2">reductionist materialistic view of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.480" end="01:17:34.640" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.159" end="01:17:35.840" style="s2">so so uh so that&#39;s the funny thing about</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.640" end="01:17:38.960" style="s2">him is that</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.840" end="01:17:41.440" style="s2">i i feel like his philosophy is flawed</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.960" end="01:17:44.320" style="s2">on some level but i also feel that that</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.440" end="01:17:46.960" style="s2">he&#39;s doing a wonderful heroic thing yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.320" end="01:17:47.920" style="s2">and ironically i think maybe the best</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.960" end="01:17:51.440" style="s2">way for him</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.920" end="01:17:53.280" style="s2">to help bring back</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.440" end="01:17:55.040" style="s2">communities is to not talk about it</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.280" end="01:17:57.360" style="s2">directly like</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.040" end="01:17:58.800" style="s2">because i think it&#39;s the same thing as</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.360" end="01:17:59.280" style="s2">going on with him bringing people back</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.800" end="01:18:01.840" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.280" end="01:18:03.520" style="s2">to to christianity because he he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.840" end="01:18:03.840" style="s2">identify himself as a christian like he</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.520" end="01:18:07.199" style="s2">never</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.840" end="01:18:10.239" style="s2">says it and by remaining</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.199" end="01:18:13.600" style="s2">exclusively in the secular world he</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.239" end="01:18:14.800" style="s2">can help secular people see the secular</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.600" end="01:18:16.320" style="s2">aspects of christianity and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.800" end="01:18:18.560" style="s2">enough for people to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.320" end="01:18:19.440" style="s2">go over the bridge themselves and yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.560" end="01:18:20.000" style="s2">think it&#39;s the same thing for</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.440" end="01:18:22.320" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.000" end="01:18:24.000" style="s2">it never explicitly talks about building</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.320" end="01:18:26.080" style="s2">communities it only talks about it in</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.000" end="01:18:27.360" style="s2">individual terms that modern individual</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.080" end="01:18:29.520" style="s2">people are comfortable with</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.360" end="01:18:30.560" style="s2">so like the idea of using let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.520" end="01:18:33.280" style="s2">christian ideas</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.560" end="01:18:34.000" style="s2">to help yourself individually and then</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.280" end="01:18:35.840" style="s2">maybe help</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.000" end="01:18:38.000" style="s2">your family and those around you like</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.840" end="01:18:40.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s convincing</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.000" end="01:18:42.159" style="s2">emotionally to modern people and i think</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.800" end="01:18:45.520" style="s2">naturally from that point</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.159" end="01:18:47.679" style="s2">perhaps perhaps that that&#39;s christianity</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.520" end="01:18:48.719" style="s2">christianity hasn&#39;t been convincing to</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.679" end="01:18:52.400" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.719" end="01:18:54.239" style="s2">um uh emotionally um</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.400" end="01:18:56.640" style="s2">for a lot of reasons you know again this</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.239" end="01:18:57.120" style="s2">is not a chris criticism of christianity</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.640" end="01:18:58.960" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.120" end="01:19:01.199" style="s2">but it certainly wasn&#39;t convincing to me</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.960" end="01:19:02.880" style="s2">as a young person and i think it</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.199" end="01:19:04.640" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not convincing to a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.880" end="01:19:07.440" style="s2">people and so uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.640" end="01:19:09.600" style="s2">yeah and jordan made it convincing by</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.440" end="01:19:11.760" style="s2">remaining within the secular arena</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.600" end="01:19:12.960" style="s2">and i think he can make ironically he</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.760" end="01:19:16.000" style="s2">can make</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.960" end="01:19:17.679" style="s2">communities attractive to people without</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.000" end="01:19:19.440" style="s2">talking about communities directly</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.679" end="01:19:20.960" style="s2">by just like talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.440" end="01:19:24.560" style="s2">advantages of traditions</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.960" end="01:19:26.239" style="s2">within uh individu yeah within purely</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.560" end="01:19:28.400" style="s2">individualistic terms</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.239" end="01:19:30.560" style="s2">perhaps but but i also wonder if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.400" end="01:19:32.480" style="s2">a there&#39;s just something</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.560" end="01:19:34.960" style="s2">this idea of the logos being the</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.480" end="01:19:38.080" style="s2">individuals the sovereign individual</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.960" end="01:19:39.600" style="s2">is that i mean that doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.080" end="01:19:41.520" style="s2">with buddhist philosophy i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.600" end="01:19:45.360" style="s2">it works with christian philosophy the</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.520" end="01:19:48.080" style="s2">the sovereign individual is the goal um</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.360" end="01:19:49.840" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t it it doesn&#39;t you end up</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.080" end="01:19:50.880" style="s2">alone you end up to be the isolated</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.840" end="01:19:55.360" style="s2">cartesian</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.880" end="01:19:55.360" style="s2">individual you know somehow</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.600" end="01:19:59.120" style="s2">yeah i haven&#39;t thought through this very</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.800" end="01:20:03.199" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.120" end="01:20:03.199" style="s2">very deeply so i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.560" end="01:20:09.760" style="s2">and i&#39;m wondering i mean maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.520" end="01:20:12.560" style="s2">the reason why he&#39;s suffering so much or</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.760" end="01:20:15.120" style="s2">he has been suffering so much</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.560" end="01:20:15.920" style="s2">is is he hasn&#39;t found his his his</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.120" end="01:20:18.080" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.920" end="01:20:19.760" style="s2">on some level whatever that might be i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.080" end="01:20:24.080" style="s2">not saying it would be</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.760" end="01:20:26.719" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying what it would be but but</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.080" end="01:20:27.199" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m just posing that as a question</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.719" end="01:20:30.320" style="s2">because yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.199" end="01:20:31.040" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to be judgmental yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.320" end="01:20:33.920" style="s2">that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.040" end="01:20:35.520" style="s2">uh i doubt that that&#39;s the reason why</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.920" end="01:20:36.320" style="s2">he&#39;s suffering from what i heard about</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.520" end="01:20:38.639" style="s2">his story and</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.320" end="01:20:40.239" style="s2">also like the depression before that and</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.639" end="01:20:41.040" style="s2">like all of the problems in his family</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.239" end="01:20:43.840" style="s2">it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.040" end="01:20:45.520" style="s2">all the problems that he&#39;s had have come</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.840" end="01:20:48.400" style="s2">mostly from</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.520" end="01:20:51.520" style="s2">kind of physiological that&#39;s what he</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.400" end="01:20:53.040" style="s2">says yeah but i don&#39;t buy that like</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.520" end="01:20:54.800" style="s2">see i don&#39;t buy this just the</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.040" end="01:20:56.560" style="s2">physiological thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.800" end="01:20:57.920" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t think you can explain</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.560" end="01:20:59.440" style="s2">things in that way i think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.920" end="01:21:01.199" style="s2">narrow way to explain things</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.440" end="01:21:02.639" style="s2">yes it&#39;s all true i&#39;m not saying any of</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.199" end="01:21:06.000" style="s2">that stuff is not true</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.639" end="01:21:06.000" style="s2">but then what&#39;s beneath that</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.199" end="01:21:10.320" style="s2">interesting um um you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.280" end="01:21:12.320" style="s2">beneath that is</p>

<p begin="01:24:06.880" end="01:24:10.639" style="s2">and it has to be the one community that</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.080" end="01:24:13.679" style="s2">you love</p>

<p begin="01:24:20.480" end="01:24:23.520" style="s2">of all kinds of things and some of them</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.719" end="01:24:26.560" style="s2">are more</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.520" end="01:24:29.199" style="s2">authentic and um and grounded</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.560" end="01:24:30.000" style="s2">than others i would say avoid the like</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.199" end="01:24:32.639" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.000" end="01:24:35.120" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of do-it-yourself</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.639" end="01:24:35.120" style="s2">thing which</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.480" end="01:24:41.199" style="s2">the way they teach buddhism today is</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.880" end="01:24:41.920" style="s2">like it&#39;s meditation and mindfulness and</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.199" end="01:24:44.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.920" end="01:24:48.639" style="s2">so it&#39;s about becoming mindful and just</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.960" end="01:24:51.520" style="s2">it&#39;s such it&#39;s such a narrow perspective</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.639" end="01:24:52.800" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s so it&#39;s like you become</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.520" end="01:24:55.040" style="s2">mindful just</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.800" end="01:24:57.199" style="s2">so that you can become a good worker and</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.040" end="01:24:58.719" style="s2">you know it&#39;s been co-opted by a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.199" end="01:25:02.080" style="s2">corporate things and</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.719" end="01:25:05.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a new age and and all that so</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.080" end="01:25:09.440" style="s2">a lot of it is very it&#39;s very ugly um</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.360" end="01:25:11.600" style="s2">um and uh but but but if you can find a</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.440" end="01:25:13.199" style="s2">you know a good teacher whom you love</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.600" end="01:25:15.360" style="s2">that&#39;s the best thing</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.199" end="01:25:16.960" style="s2">if you can find that that&#39;s number one</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.360" end="01:25:18.719" style="s2">if you can find a good teacher</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.960" end="01:25:20.239" style="s2">that&#39;s number one and then if you can</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.719" end="01:25:21.280" style="s2">find a good community that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.239" end="01:25:23.280" style="s2">number two</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.280" end="01:25:24.639" style="s2">yeah okay yeah i think the teacher in</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.280" end="01:25:27.600" style="s2">buddhism the teacher comes</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.639" end="01:25:29.440" style="s2">first which is often we don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.600" end="01:25:30.639" style="s2">teachers in the society everybody wants</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.440" end="01:25:32.960" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.639" end="01:25:35.360" style="s2">um because because everybody wants to be</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.960" end="01:25:37.199" style="s2">an individual and just make up things</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.360" end="01:25:39.120" style="s2">for themselves but i think we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.199" end="01:25:41.679" style="s2">a mistake when we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.120" end="01:25:43.360" style="s2">observe the fact that we can we can</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.679" end="01:25:46.480" style="s2">learn from from somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.360" end="01:25:48.719" style="s2">who&#39;s more um</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.480" end="01:25:50.080" style="s2">you know who has more much more</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.719" end="01:25:52.800" style="s2">experience and</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.080" end="01:25:54.400" style="s2">and depth than we do and there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.800" end="01:25:54.880" style="s2">somebody who has more experience than us</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.400" end="01:25:58.159" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.880" end="01:26:00.080" style="s2">you know we can&#39;t ever um</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.159" end="01:26:02.000" style="s2">so i i i&#39;m against a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.080" end="01:26:04.080" style="s2">individualism</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.000" end="01:26:05.679" style="s2">and i&#39;m against the buddhism that is i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.080" end="01:26:08.639" style="s2">complaining about buddhism now here</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.679" end="01:26:10.480" style="s2">where is it supposed to be perhaps but</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.639" end="01:26:11.040" style="s2">i&#39;m against the kind of buddhism that is</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.480" end="01:26:15.040" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.040" end="01:26:18.080" style="s2">is is just uh a self-help</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.040" end="01:26:22.080" style="s2">or or a thing or a series of of</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.080" end="01:26:23.520" style="s2">esoteric techniques that people like to</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.080" end="01:26:26.560" style="s2">escape from their own</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.520" end="01:26:28.080" style="s2">identity and culture and yeah but i</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.560" end="01:26:28.560" style="s2">think yeah there&#39;s an authentic there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.080" end="01:26:31.760" style="s2">a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.560" end="01:26:33.840" style="s2">you just have to you just have to</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.760" end="01:26:35.280" style="s2">um you have to do a lot of work and</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.840" end="01:26:38.320" style="s2">research and</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.280" end="01:26:40.800" style="s2">and and to find the right one and i</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.320" end="01:26:44.880" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t want to say what that is</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.800" end="01:26:47.520" style="s2">yeah yes yes it&#39;s a sign of our</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.880" end="01:26:48.560" style="s2">strange times where we okay so we know</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.520" end="01:26:50.000" style="s2">that we need communities</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.560" end="01:26:51.679" style="s2">but because so many of our communities</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.000" end="01:26:52.880" style="s2">are broken down we can&#39;t just go like</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.679" end="01:26:54.800" style="s2">when they</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.880" end="01:26:56.719" style="s2">willingly take any community we have to</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.800" end="01:26:59.120" style="s2">so individually work</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.719" end="01:27:00.400" style="s2">to find communities where you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.120" end="01:27:02.239" style="s2">good individuals as well</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.400" end="01:27:03.679" style="s2">in in terms of finding a good teacher</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.239" end="01:27:05.120" style="s2">within a christian context</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.679" end="01:27:06.880" style="s2">finding a pair a parish with a good</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.120" end="01:27:09.600" style="s2">priest yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.880" end="01:27:11.120" style="s2">no because the priest is good then you</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.600" end="01:27:12.159" style="s2">will find a good community there as well</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.120" end="01:27:13.679" style="s2">at the same time but</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.159" end="01:27:15.360" style="s2">because we live in a strange world where</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.679" end="01:27:16.159" style="s2">it&#39;s so fragmented you know you may have</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.360" end="01:27:18.239" style="s2">to look</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.159" end="01:27:19.600" style="s2">for a while until you find something</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.239" end="01:27:21.280" style="s2">that works</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.600" end="01:27:22.880" style="s2">actually well before you find a good</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.280" end="01:27:24.239" style="s2">community yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.880" end="01:27:26.080" style="s2">i think a lot of people are going to the</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.239" end="01:27:29.920" style="s2">orthodox tradition too because</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.080" end="01:27:32.639" style="s2">yeah finding something fresh there yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.920" end="01:27:34.560" style="s2">these days because perhaps maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.639" end="01:27:37.360" style="s2">as you say if the orthodox tradition</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.560" end="01:27:38.400" style="s2">is a more clinical tradition you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.360" end="01:27:41.199" style="s2">which has more</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.400" end="01:27:43.120" style="s2">um in a way i think that&#39;s what we need</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.199" end="01:27:44.960" style="s2">today is is more of that</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.120" end="01:27:47.040" style="s2">rather than than there&#39;s too much of</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.960" end="01:27:50.400" style="s2">this political noise and</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.040" end="01:27:53.120" style="s2">you know and dogma and ideology</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.400" end="01:27:54.719" style="s2">um and we&#39;re too easily fooled by that</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.120" end="01:27:57.360" style="s2">we need to go away from the world</p>
