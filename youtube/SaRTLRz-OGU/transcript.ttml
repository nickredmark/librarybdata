<p begin="00:01:38.840" end="00:01:43.790" style="s2">making nodes that I see in the noosphere</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.960" end="00:01:45.950" style="s2">sort of like renegade intellectuals like</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.790" end="00:01:47.510" style="s2">true thinkers to invite them in this</p>

<p begin="00:03:08.330" end="00:03:14.660" style="s2">realist and a cynic as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.340" end="00:03:18.799" style="s2">stoic but um so I&#39;ll kind of like go</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.660" end="00:03:20.600" style="s2">with this as we come just to give by way</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.799" end="00:03:23.739" style="s2">of background my original degree was</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.600" end="00:03:26.569" style="s2">physics and philosophy as a joint major</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.739" end="00:03:30.489" style="s2">Matt himself was contentious I story</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.569" end="00:03:33.500" style="s2">because I was at university in the 70s</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.489" end="00:03:35.329" style="s2">and I still remember my first essay came</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.500" end="00:03:36.290" style="s2">back with this isn&#39;t philosophy this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.329" end="00:03:39.019" style="s2">metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.290" end="00:03:41.060" style="s2">please rewrite it and I send it back</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.019" end="00:03:43.100" style="s2">with metaphysics his philosophy please</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.060" end="00:03:44.900" style="s2">mark it and we carried on like that for</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.100" end="00:03:46.609" style="s2">three years yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.900" end="00:03:49.100" style="s2">this was the British analytical</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.609" end="00:03:50.870" style="s2">tradition in philosophy and I still</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.100" end="00:03:53.150" style="s2">remember proposing that we have a course</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.870" end="00:03:55.519" style="s2">on existentialism and B there was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.150" end="00:03:57.320" style="s2">student rep on the committee and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.519" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">professor in charge of the department</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.320" end="00:04:00.829" style="s2">said if I wanted to study European</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:03.019" style="s2">literature there was another college for</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.829" end="00:04:06.650" style="s2">that right so come like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.019" end="00:04:09.260" style="s2">entertaining right but what it told me</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.650" end="00:04:11.090" style="s2">is two things I got away with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.260" end="00:04:12.530" style="s2">because you know there were all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.090" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">other things going in in background in</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.530" end="00:04:16.489" style="s2">the seventies you could get away with</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:18.560" style="s2">things at university yeah if you were</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.489" end="00:04:20.269" style="s2">interesting people come like gave you</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:22.610" style="s2">aids on essays just because you woke</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.269" end="00:04:25.750" style="s2">them up because they weren&#39;t mark into a</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.610" end="00:04:28.940" style="s2">you know writing marking to Martin plan</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.750" end="00:04:31.039" style="s2">but the physics also gave me a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.940" end="00:04:32.539" style="s2">natural respect for Natural Science but</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.039" end="00:04:34.400" style="s2">physics is actually quite good on that</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.539" end="00:04:36.650" style="s2">because he carries with it in essential</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.400" end="00:04:39.110" style="s2">paradox between general relativity</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.650" end="00:04:40.970" style="s2">theory and quantum mechanics which come</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.110" end="00:04:42.569" style="s2">I both work but which contradict each</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.970" end="00:04:44.399" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.569" end="00:04:46.979" style="s2">so between that and philosophy you get</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.399" end="00:04:49.830" style="s2">very comfortable with paradox yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.979" end="00:04:51.749" style="s2">with uncertainty either way that worked</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.830" end="00:04:53.580" style="s2">I then spent three years of my life</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.749" end="00:04:57.149" style="s2">you know there is the gallivanting</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.580" end="00:04:58.860" style="s2">around Australia Africa Latin America</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.149" end="00:05:02.249" style="s2">are on the wheel Council of Churches</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.860" end="00:05:04.229" style="s2">program to combat racism which kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.249" end="00:05:06.209" style="s2">like shook me up a hell of a lot I saw</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.229" end="00:05:09.809" style="s2">the first person murdered in front of me</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.209" end="00:05:11.610" style="s2">and in Australia when a mine guard came</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.809" end="00:05:13.949" style="s2">out and literally shot an Aboriginal</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.610" end="00:05:15.029" style="s2">activist and killed him I&#39;ll never</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.949" end="00:05:16.379" style="s2">forget two of us</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.029" end="00:05:17.849" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re young all right we went to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.379" end="00:05:20.789" style="s2">the police and the police said it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.849" end="00:05:22.979" style="s2">in a bow and when we protested took us</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.789" end="00:05:25.279" style="s2">out of territory but the scary thing is</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.979" end="00:05:27.839" style="s2">nobody in geneva would listen to us and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.279" end="00:05:29.789" style="s2">kind of like my kids cannot forget that</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.839" end="00:05:32.219" style="s2">I mean in the 70s Catholics didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.789" end="00:05:34.169" style="s2">the vote in Northern Ireland and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.219" end="00:05:36.749" style="s2">never forget encounters with the Stasi</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.169" end="00:05:38.969" style="s2">in East Berlin and kind of like it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.749" end="00:05:42.179" style="s2">the world was an interesting place where</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.969" end="00:05:45.029" style="s2">we say I mean the way after that I ended</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.179" end="00:05:48.360" style="s2">up in the early days of computing and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.029" end="00:05:50.999" style="s2">became a decision support specialist I</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.360" end="00:05:52.919" style="s2">then migrated through that after - soft</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.999" end="00:05:57.300" style="s2">internal software startups into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.919" end="00:05:58.129" style="s2">strategy role and then in my 20 odd</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.300" end="00:06:02.639" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.129" end="00:06:05.519" style="s2">IBM bought the company and I got given a</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.639" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">creative role my just done a major</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.519" end="00:06:09.930" style="s2">turnaround and booked together different</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.680" end="00:06:11.639" style="s2">disciplines so I got one of those jobs</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.930" end="00:06:13.019" style="s2">which is do whatever you want as long as</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.639" end="00:06:15.959" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting and will pay you a</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.019" end="00:06:18.180" style="s2">salary so I survived seven years there</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.959" end="00:06:20.279" style="s2">right and it was 7 months for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.180" end="00:06:21.449" style="s2">Jesuits in seven years with IBM but</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.279" end="00:06:23.610" style="s2">that&#39;s a different level of maturity</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.449" end="00:06:27.930" style="s2">before I finally failed the test of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.610" end="00:06:30.569" style="s2">obedience you know in both cases and</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.930" end="00:06:32.519" style="s2">that&#39;s when I got into complexity theory</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.569" end="00:06:35.729" style="s2">and narrative because we were looking at</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.519" end="00:06:37.860" style="s2">how do people make decisions and we knew</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.729" end="00:06:39.509" style="s2">that the dominant method by which people</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.860" end="00:06:42.149" style="s2">people make decisions is something</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.509" end="00:06:44.669" style="s2">called conceptual blending so the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.149" end="00:06:46.649" style="s2">you make a decision is you scan about 5%</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.669" end="00:06:49.019" style="s2">of what&#39;s available to you on a good day</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.649" end="00:06:51.300" style="s2">if you&#39;re Chinese it doubles and there</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.019" end="00:06:53.159" style="s2">are various reasons for that and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.300" end="00:06:55.639" style="s2">you do a first fit pattern match with</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.159" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">multiple fragmented memories</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.639" end="00:06:59.360" style="s2">and you blend those to come up get</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:02.960" style="s2">together to come up with a unique form</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.360" end="00:07:05.419" style="s2">of action so kind of like that got us</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.960" end="00:07:07.189" style="s2">into gathering people&#39;s stories to find</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.419" end="00:07:10.520" style="s2">out not only when they made decisions</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.189" end="00:07:13.699" style="s2">but how they made decisions and not to</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.520" end="00:07:15.680" style="s2">do it as an expert in a workshop but to</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.699" end="00:07:17.770" style="s2">get people to keep their own Diaries and</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.680" end="00:07:20.479" style="s2">interpret their own experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.770" end="00:07:22.279" style="s2">that&#39;s translated into the modern what</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.479" end="00:07:24.830" style="s2">we do which is actually all about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.279" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">called epistemic justice which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.830" end="00:07:28.849" style="s2">allowing people to the in to be the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.960" end="00:07:30.889" style="s2">interpreters of their narrative rather</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.849" end="00:07:32.810" style="s2">than the experts then I&#39;ll come back to</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.889" end="00:07:33.379" style="s2">that towards the end and I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.810" end="00:07:37.250" style="s2">Kovac</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.379" end="00:07:38.840" style="s2">so that was critical and the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.250" end="00:07:40.400" style="s2">you started to learn them when we were</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.840" end="00:07:43.370" style="s2">dealing with knowledge and organizations</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.400" end="00:07:47.629" style="s2">inherent uncertainty that got me into</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.370" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">complexity science I spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.629" end="00:07:53.060" style="s2">on that and come like in classic mode I</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:54.949" style="s2">decided that the complexity science then</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.060" end="00:07:57.889" style="s2">was moving to entirely agent based</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.949" end="00:08:01.550" style="s2">models so the whole idea was simulation</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.889" end="00:08:03.620" style="s2">models big data I was very nervous about</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.550" end="00:08:05.479" style="s2">that because I had this fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.620" end="00:08:07.759" style="s2">belief that human beings aren&#39;t ants</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.479" end="00:08:10.339" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.759" end="00:08:12.289" style="s2">to me this is self-evident that most</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.339" end="00:08:13.969" style="s2">social scientists it isn&#39;t because their</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.289" end="00:08:16.430" style="s2">models don&#39;t work unless they make that</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.969" end="00:08:18.889" style="s2">assumption so human beings have</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.430" end="00:08:21.589" style="s2">intelligence they have flexible identity</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.889" end="00:08:23.689" style="s2">they have empathy there are all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.589" end="00:08:26.330" style="s2">factors which make human beings an extra</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.689" end="00:08:28.550" style="s2">level of complexity so that got me to</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.330" end="00:08:31.430" style="s2">where I am now which is a synthesis of</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.550" end="00:08:35.180" style="s2">the biological end of anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.430" end="00:08:36.829" style="s2">cognitive neuroscience the whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.180" end="00:08:39.320" style="s2">of delusion epistemology which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.829" end="00:08:41.000" style="s2">actually relevant to narrative and of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.320" end="00:08:43.699" style="s2">course complexity science and that feels</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.000" end="00:08:45.980" style="s2">cool down through complexity and to</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.699" end="00:08:48.470" style="s2">distinguish it and I&#39;ll give some</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.980" end="00:08:50.149" style="s2">examples and sort of projects I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.470" end="00:08:52.579" style="s2">the other things which come out of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.149" end="00:08:54.519" style="s2">and I just want to do a sort of 101 take</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.579" end="00:08:57.170" style="s2">on this from a complexity point of view</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.519" end="00:09:00.050" style="s2">in a complex adaptive system what</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.170" end="00:09:02.690" style="s2">matters isn&#39;t individuals but how</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.050" end="00:09:05.300" style="s2">they&#39;re entangled it&#39;s the connections</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.690" end="00:09:07.370" style="s2">between things which matter and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.300" end="00:09:09.320" style="s2">trouble with the northern European North</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.370" end="00:09:12.050" style="s2">American agenda for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.320" end="00:09:14.149" style="s2">what ever since the Reformation as its</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.050" end="00:09:16.699" style="s2">focused entirely on the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.149" end="00:09:18.170" style="s2">the assumption that society and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.699" end="00:09:19.850" style="s2">communities are aggregations of</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.170" end="00:09:22.579" style="s2">individual behavior and individual</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.850" end="00:09:25.130" style="s2">interest whereas if you go to Africa or</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.579" end="00:09:27.709" style="s2">Asia or the southern southern Europe or</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.130" end="00:09:29.509" style="s2">the Celtic fringe of Britain those</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.709" end="00:09:31.279" style="s2">communities are calm you terian that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.509" end="00:09:34.490" style="s2">they&#39;re defined by their interactions</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.279" end="00:09:38.240" style="s2">not by who you are and complexity is</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.490" end="00:09:40.190" style="s2">backing that up which means all of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.240" end="00:09:42.649" style="s2">Western focus on change in resilience</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.190" end="00:09:45.500" style="s2">has been about individual meditation</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.649" end="00:09:46.509" style="s2">individual resilience actually isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.500" end="00:09:49.910" style="s2">that effective</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.509" end="00:09:51.529" style="s2">it&#39;s a culturally specific thing what</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.910" end="00:09:54.230" style="s2">really matters is who and how you</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.529" end="00:09:55.699" style="s2">interact with and there&#39;s all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.230" end="00:09:57.980" style="s2">things we can draw from example the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.699" end="00:10:00.380" style="s2">Army&#39;s use of crews in that area so</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.980" end="00:10:02.839" style="s2">interactions are key and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.380" end="00:10:05.930" style="s2">entanglement concept is also vital to</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.839" end="00:10:07.970" style="s2">understand so lysse Gerardo is one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.930" end="00:10:10.160" style="s2">the best thinkers here famously</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.970" end="00:10:13.250" style="s2">described complexity is like bramble</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.160" end="00:10:15.050" style="s2">bushes in a thicket so you&#39;ve got you</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.250" end="00:10:17.389" style="s2">know it produces fruit but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.050" end="00:10:20.779" style="s2">untangle it is the entanglement has</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.389" end="00:10:22.490" style="s2">evolved over time other types of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.779" end="00:10:24.920" style="s2">entanglement is where we work on</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.490" end="00:10:27.319" style="s2">software so for example we&#39;ll take a</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.920" end="00:10:30.319" style="s2">patient&#39;s observes narratives on a</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.319" end="00:10:32.060" style="s2">continuous timeline the nurses observed</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.319" end="00:10:34.069" style="s2">narratives their relatives observed</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.060" end="00:10:36.829" style="s2">narratives and will entangle them at</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.069" end="00:10:38.449" style="s2">different levels of coherence in order</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.829" end="00:10:40.220" style="s2">to understand different patterns about</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.449" end="00:10:42.829" style="s2">what&#39;s going on within those community</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.220" end="00:10:45.709" style="s2">you know talk about more that if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.829" end="00:10:47.630" style="s2">want but entanglement is how things are</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.709" end="00:10:51.290" style="s2">linked then connecting and how you focus</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.630" end="00:10:53.000" style="s2">on that for change so support groups are</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.290" end="00:10:55.850" style="s2">key and part of the problem we got would</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.000" end="00:10:57.800" style="s2">lock them is that people are divorced</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.850" end="00:11:00.290" style="s2">from social interaction and just to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.800" end="00:11:03.889" style="s2">throw some other science in on this part</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.290" end="00:11:05.540" style="s2">of the problem you&#39;ve got with zoom one</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.889" end="00:11:08.329" style="s2">of the ways to stay healthy was zoom by</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.540" end="00:11:11.839" style="s2">the way is to switch off video for at</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.329" end="00:11:14.660" style="s2">least half of your calls because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.839" end="00:11:16.939" style="s2">got three generations of radio and</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.660" end="00:11:18.829" style="s2">telephone you know which means the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.939" end="00:11:20.839" style="s2">epigenetics is coming to play after two</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.829" end="00:11:23.060" style="s2">generations so we&#39;re comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.839" end="00:11:25.670" style="s2">abstracted voice without human contact</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.060" end="00:11:28.790" style="s2">but if we see somebody&#39;s picture we</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.670" end="00:11:30.170" style="s2">expect chemical responses as well for</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.790" end="00:11:32.930" style="s2">example their affair and then pick up</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.170" end="00:11:35.530" style="s2">sticks we trust and our body and brain</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.930" end="00:11:37.580" style="s2">don&#39;t get those so we get very confused</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.530" end="00:11:40.820" style="s2">now particularly when we see in multiple</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.580" end="00:11:43.460" style="s2">pictures so sorry that was just a little</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.820" end="00:11:45.200" style="s2">sideline on that so complexity is about</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.460" end="00:11:47.450" style="s2">entanglement it&#39;s about linking and</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.200" end="00:11:49.670" style="s2">connecting things in different ways it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.450" end="00:11:52.250" style="s2">about creating resilience which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.670" end="00:11:53.720" style="s2">robustness and this is come at this key</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.250" end="00:11:56.600" style="s2">distinction I want to make between a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.720" end="00:11:58.520" style="s2">resilient system and a robust system and</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.600" end="00:12:00.260" style="s2">I should say now that I&#39;m not using this</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.520" end="00:12:03.260" style="s2">language in the way that Nicholas Taleb</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.260" end="00:12:05.180" style="s2">works it I&#39;m part of an on a group of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.260" end="00:12:07.100" style="s2">people who&#39;ve been blocked by talent I</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.180" end="00:12:07.790" style="s2">think if you&#39;ve got any confidence</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.100" end="00:12:10.220" style="s2">you&#39;re blocked</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.790" end="00:12:11.960" style="s2">because he doesn&#39;t tolerate dissent yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.220" end="00:12:13.640" style="s2">I got there with a few Nobel Prize</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.960" end="00:12:16.610" style="s2">winners so I feel happy about it</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.640" end="00:12:18.950" style="s2">yeah so what Tyler tried to do with anti</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.610" end="00:12:20.900" style="s2">fragile is basically try and create</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.950" end="00:12:23.300" style="s2">something unique which actually isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.900" end="00:12:25.100" style="s2">unique now from my perspective the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.300" end="00:12:27.550" style="s2">system which gets stronger when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.100" end="00:12:30.470" style="s2">threatened is just a type of resilience</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.550" end="00:12:32.810" style="s2">it&#39;s a symbiosis for example is a good</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.470" end="00:12:34.640" style="s2">example of that but if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.810" end="00:12:35.960" style="s2">publish a popular management book every</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.640" end="00:12:37.670" style="s2">two years you could have claimed</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.960" end="00:12:38.930" style="s2">something highly original otherwise it</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.670" end="00:12:41.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sell says he&#39;s slightly</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.930" end="00:12:43.100" style="s2">cynically yeah so I&#39;m using language</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.720" end="00:12:46.280" style="s2">differently as the point I want to make</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.100" end="00:12:48.890" style="s2">so a resilient system is one which</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.280" end="00:12:51.320" style="s2">survives with continuity of identity</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.890" end="00:12:54.950" style="s2">over time turn back to that identity</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.320" end="00:12:57.530" style="s2">were yeah so my best metaphor for this</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.950" end="00:13:00.740" style="s2">is to think about a robust system as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.530" end="00:13:03.590" style="s2">seawall so you&#39;ve got this massive thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.740" end="00:13:05.480" style="s2">of concrete or whatever you can drain</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.590" end="00:13:08.000" style="s2">the land on the landward side you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.480" end="00:13:10.220" style="s2">plant crops it&#39;s wonderful until the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.000" end="00:13:12.800" style="s2">design conditions are exceeded and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.220" end="00:13:15.530" style="s2">seawall breaks then it would be better</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.800" end="00:13:17.900" style="s2">if it wasn&#39;t there at all so robust</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.530" end="00:13:20.200" style="s2">systems are characterized by certainty</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.900" end="00:13:22.490" style="s2">but catastrophic results when they break</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.200" end="00:13:25.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re wrong it just means</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.490" end="00:13:28.360" style="s2">you need to realize that on the other</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.010" end="00:13:31.700" style="s2">hand a resilient system is a salt marsh</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.360" end="00:13:32.450" style="s2">so basically the sea comes in it floods</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.700" end="00:13:35.180" style="s2">the land</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.450" end="00:13:36.500" style="s2">yeah the land is constantly changing to</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.180" end="00:13:39.530" style="s2">accommodate different flow</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.500" end="00:13:41.330" style="s2">patterns when the land is saturated it</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.530" end="00:13:43.250" style="s2">will still flood beyond the salt marsh</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.330" end="00:13:45.770" style="s2">but the salt marsh doesn&#39;t release the</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.250" end="00:13:48.950" style="s2">water which is already stored yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.770" end="00:13:52.670" style="s2">the changes in catastrophic so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.950" end="00:13:54.500" style="s2">really important distinction the other</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.670" end="00:13:56.510" style="s2">key aspect which thinks in with this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.500" end="00:13:58.780" style="s2">a concept of constraints in convexity</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.510" end="00:14:00.980" style="s2">theory and the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.780" end="00:14:04.160" style="s2">enabling constraints in governing</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.980" end="00:14:06.290" style="s2">constraints so governing constraints</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.160" end="00:14:07.940" style="s2">provide boundaries that you can measure</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.290" end="00:14:10.040" style="s2">in which you can know they can be</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.940" end="00:14:12.340" style="s2">permeable a non permeable but they</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.040" end="00:14:15.470" style="s2">constitute a barrier yeah a container</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.340" end="00:14:18.470" style="s2">where as enabling constraints how things</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.470" end="00:14:21.410" style="s2">connect and the connections are there to</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.470" end="00:14:24.650" style="s2">optimize energy flow so if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.410" end="00:14:27.020" style="s2">change a system you have to change the</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.650" end="00:14:29.720" style="s2">energy gradient so that the change you</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.020" end="00:14:31.610" style="s2">want is more likely you won&#39;t achieve</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.720" end="00:14:34.750" style="s2">change against the natural energy</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.610" end="00:14:38.300" style="s2">gradient and a complex system is</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.750" end="00:14:39.530" style="s2">dispositional not causal there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.300" end="00:14:42.860" style="s2">couple of minutes on this physics</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.530" end="00:14:46.720" style="s2">critical so in a complex adaptive system</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.860" end="00:14:49.310" style="s2">you have no linear material causality</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.720" end="00:14:50.960" style="s2">because there are too many changes in</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.310" end="00:14:54.440" style="s2">too many sort of things going on</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.960" end="00:14:56.240" style="s2">continuously we have things like dark</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.440" end="00:14:58.670" style="s2">constraints as a reference to dark</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.240" end="00:15:00.680" style="s2">energy in cosmology we can see the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.670" end="00:15:02.120" style="s2">impact of a constraint that we can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.680" end="00:15:05.060" style="s2">what the constraint is so we got</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.120" end="00:15:08.330" style="s2">inherent uncertainty but we can measure</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.060" end="00:15:11.870" style="s2">disposition allottee and that&#39;s the work</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.330" end="00:15:14.000" style="s2">we do with distributed ethnography but</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.870" end="00:15:17.780" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have causality you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.000" end="00:15:20.000" style="s2">actually have goals because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.780" end="00:15:21.770" style="s2">predict the future so the key is to</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.000" end="00:15:23.690" style="s2">understand about complexity and this</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.770" end="00:15:25.370" style="s2">highly contrast with systems thinking</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.690" end="00:15:27.910" style="s2">because systems thinking assumes</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.370" end="00:15:29.900" style="s2">causality it comes from cybernetics</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.910" end="00:15:32.240" style="s2">they&#39;re kinda mental thing about</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.900" end="00:15:34.640" style="s2">complexity is you start journeys with a</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.240" end="00:15:37.790" style="s2">sense of direction but you don&#39;t try and</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.640" end="00:15:39.410" style="s2">achieve goals because if you start a</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.790" end="00:15:40.970" style="s2">journey with a sense of direction you</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.410" end="00:15:43.310" style="s2">move to what&#39;s called an adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.970" end="00:15:45.050" style="s2">possible you find somewhere where you</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.310" end="00:15:48.080" style="s2">can go next which is in roughly the</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.050" end="00:15:49.700" style="s2">right direction then you reassess and</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.080" end="00:15:51.050" style="s2">now that&#39;s for that</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.700" end="00:15:53.540" style="s2">and I&#39;ll talk about how we do that</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.050" end="00:15:57.020" style="s2">that&#39;s where we get into the distributed</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.540" end="00:15:59.330" style="s2">ethnography so we worked on this for</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.020" end="00:16:02.270" style="s2">some years and yeah I&#39;ll talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.330" end="00:16:05.420" style="s2">background to this it originally came</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.270" end="00:16:07.190" style="s2">from working DARPA so we were looking at</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.420" end="00:16:09.490" style="s2">counterterrorism I it was a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.190" end="00:16:11.750" style="s2">shock I was working for IBM you know and</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.490" end="00:16:14.510" style="s2">just so the way you know of my</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.750" end="00:16:17.230" style="s2">background I come from a Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.510" end="00:16:19.970" style="s2">Marxist background so that that&#39;s my 70s</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.230" end="00:16:21.710" style="s2">so to get asked to go down to Langley</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.970" end="00:16:24.380" style="s2">was a bit of a shock right but either</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.710" end="00:16:27.500" style="s2">way it got interesting we did a huge</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.380" end="00:16:28.970" style="s2">amount of work before and after 9/11 and</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.500" end="00:16:30.950" style="s2">what we&#39;re looking for is how do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.970" end="00:16:34.100" style="s2">find weak signals so how do you find</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.950" end="00:16:36.050" style="s2">when a civilian population yet has got</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.100" end="00:16:37.880" style="s2">to a point of despair to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.050" end="00:16:40.339" style="s2">it allowed terrorists to intrude</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.880" end="00:16:43.880" style="s2">now I remember this my ownself from</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.339" end="00:16:45.230" style="s2">1970s when I was in Northern Ireland and</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.880" end="00:16:46.940" style="s2">I still remember the night when I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.230" end="00:16:49.190" style="s2">walking down the Falls Road and I got</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.940" end="00:16:50.690" style="s2">picked up by the police yeah and in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.190" end="00:16:52.970" style="s2">Catholic area I got picked up by the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.690" end="00:16:55.600" style="s2">police for a Protestant and asked which</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.970" end="00:16:58.520" style="s2">of my legs did I want shot off first and</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.600" end="00:17:00.800" style="s2">then they hit my accent and realized I</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.520" end="00:17:02.120" style="s2">was mainland Catholic not Irish Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.800" end="00:17:04.220" style="s2">because I wasn&#39;t a filthy take</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.120" end="00:17:05.449" style="s2">quote/unquote so they extremely asked</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.220" end="00:17:08.300" style="s2">the Land Rover it was hidden what the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.449" end="00:17:10.130" style="s2">trouble now if the Provisional IRA</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.300" end="00:17:14.209" style="s2">commander had come round that night I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.130" end="00:17:16.550" style="s2">have probably joined yeah luckily he</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.209" end="00:17:19.459" style="s2">didn&#39;t write you know everything is</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.550" end="00:17:21.050" style="s2">small things producing maximum facts so</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.459" end="00:17:23.000" style="s2">and if you actually what happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.050" end="00:17:24.860" style="s2">land and the Catholic population wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.000" end="00:17:26.240" style="s2">happy about British occupation but it</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.860" end="00:17:28.820" style="s2">was okay with it until Bloody Sunday</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.240" end="00:17:30.860" style="s2">then it went the other way from that</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.820" end="00:17:33.350" style="s2">point onwards nobody in the population</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.860" end="00:17:35.540" style="s2">would go into a police station he just</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.350" end="00:17:37.940" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t go in in terms of the way it</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.540" end="00:17:39.920" style="s2">worked and there was a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.940" end="00:17:41.390" style="s2">peace and reconciliation work but the</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.920" end="00:17:43.429" style="s2">most interest in the way we approached</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.390" end="00:17:45.830" style="s2">it was to actually take people from both</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.429" end="00:17:47.660" style="s2">communities and dumped them in Latin</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.830" end="00:17:51.350" style="s2">America for six months and not talk</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.660" end="00:17:53.090" style="s2">about the troubles whereas the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.350" end="00:17:54.920" style="s2">guys got everybody together in a big</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.090" end="00:17:56.420" style="s2">room and got them all to agree how they</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.920" end="00:17:57.710" style="s2">would all love each other and all would</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.420" end="00:18:00.800" style="s2">be nice and they didn&#39;t want to have</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.710" end="00:18:02.150" style="s2">conflict if anybody&#39;s seen a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.800" end="00:18:03.170" style="s2">comedy from Northern Ireland called</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.150" end="00:18:05.090" style="s2">Derry girls</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.170" end="00:18:07.730" style="s2">is satirized in the first episode of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.090" end="00:18:09.410" style="s2">second series yeah basically they all</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.730" end="00:18:10.970" style="s2">agreed not to do anything nasty but</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.410" end="00:18:12.230" style="s2">within three days they were doing nasty</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.970" end="00:18:14.150" style="s2">things to each other again</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.230" end="00:18:17.810" style="s2">because nobody had changed the social</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.150" end="00:18:19.840" style="s2">and economic context yeah what we did if</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.810" end="00:18:22.700" style="s2">you look at it we threw people away an</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.840" end="00:18:24.650" style="s2">asymmetric groups we actually meant that</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.700" end="00:18:26.870" style="s2">they interacted with each other in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.650" end="00:18:29.690" style="s2">hostile situation so they saw they had</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.870" end="00:18:32.300" style="s2">more in common than they had in DIF and</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.690" end="00:18:35.620" style="s2">that was one example but all we now do</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.300" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">is for example get children from schools</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.620" end="00:18:40.040" style="s2">to go into their community and act as</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:42.530" style="s2">ethnographers to gather stories from</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.040" end="00:18:44.600" style="s2">that community the way we normally start</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.530" end="00:18:47.840" style="s2">with that is go to adults in your</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.600" end="00:18:49.580" style="s2">community the view most respect and ask</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.840" end="00:18:51.260" style="s2">them from the story of their life that</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.580" end="00:18:52.940" style="s2">they think you should remember these are</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.260" end="00:18:56.480" style="s2">called sacred stories and anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.940" end="00:18:58.960" style="s2">and then what we basically do is to get</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.480" end="00:19:01.640" style="s2">them to self interpret their own stories</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.960" end="00:19:05.120" style="s2">now this is the epistemic justice issue</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.640" end="00:19:07.570" style="s2">it&#39;s the power issue because if you hand</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:10.670" style="s2">your stories over to a researcher</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.570" end="00:19:14.180" style="s2">paralysing who interprets a story not in</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.670" end="00:19:16.370" style="s2">the story as it was told so we transfer</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.180" end="00:19:19.400" style="s2">that power back into the community and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.370" end="00:19:21.200" style="s2">that then allows us effectively what we</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.400" end="00:19:23.240" style="s2">got is a quantitative technique in what</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.200" end="00:19:26.360" style="s2">is traditionally a qualitative domain so</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.240" end="00:19:27.950" style="s2">we can scale in real time and so we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.360" end="00:19:29.960" style="s2">draw a Fitness landscapes which look</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.950" end="00:19:34.880" style="s2">like contour maps in fact it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.960" end="00:19:36.710" style="s2">easy to show you one okay you disabled</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.880" end="00:19:42.020" style="s2">screen-sharing guys if you enable screen</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.710" end="00:19:43.430" style="s2">sharing I can show something yeah so a</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.020" end="00:19:47.420" style="s2">fitness landscape comes from</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.430" end="00:19:52.370" style="s2">evolutionary biology so what it allows</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.420" end="00:19:56.120" style="s2">so that this is an example of one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.370" end="00:19:59.660" style="s2">probably better so this is a fitness</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.120" end="00:20:04.310" style="s2">landscape yeah that&#39;s got about four or</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.660" end="00:20:06.170" style="s2">five thousand stories in it so people</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.310" end="00:20:07.700" style="s2">have interpreted their own stories into</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.170" end="00:20:10.550" style="s2">a framework this and these are not</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.700" end="00:20:13.160" style="s2">Likert scales our own gamble and this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.550" end="00:20:15.920" style="s2">a probability distribution in this</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.160" end="00:20:16.809" style="s2">particular case we presented a common</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.920" end="00:20:19.179" style="s2">problem to a</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.809" end="00:20:22.059" style="s2">large number of people we&#39;ve got them</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.179" end="00:20:23.860" style="s2">all to interpret that problem and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.059" end="00:20:27.940" style="s2">we draw a map of how different groups</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.860" end="00:20:30.070" style="s2">interpret the data in different ways so</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.940" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">you can see if you look at this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.070" end="00:20:34.960" style="s2">this sort of red group who sort of stand</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:38.259" style="s2">alone they got no overlap with the blue</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.960" end="00:20:39.929" style="s2">group yeah so there&#39;s no chance of them</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.259" end="00:20:42.460" style="s2">having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.929" end="00:20:45.549" style="s2">yeah the overlap groups can have</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.460" end="00:20:48.009" style="s2">conversations with each other and this</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.549" end="00:20:51.100" style="s2">is a key concept which we measure called</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.009" end="00:20:54.580" style="s2">coherent heterogeneity this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.100" end="00:20:56.799" style="s2">quite a healthy picture yeah you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.580" end="00:20:58.629" style="s2">overlaps between most groups but you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.799" end="00:21:01.960" style="s2">got enough difference in the system and</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.629" end="00:21:03.999" style="s2">the system can evolve but if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.960" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">change the system so for example that</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.999" end="00:21:09.909" style="s2">blue stuff at the bottom is too extreme</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:12.249" style="s2">and so let&#39;s suppose that the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.909" end="00:21:13.960" style="s2">left is where you don&#39;t want to be the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.249" end="00:21:16.629" style="s2">top right is the direction you want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.960" end="00:21:18.669" style="s2">travel what you can actually do on this</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.629" end="00:21:21.639" style="s2">is you can click on the bottom blue bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.669" end="00:21:25.119" style="s2">and you can see the stories which make</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.639" end="00:21:27.179" style="s2">up the pan and then you can say we want</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.119" end="00:21:29.860" style="s2">fewer stories like this what would we do</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.179" end="00:21:31.360" style="s2">you can click on the purple bit which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.860" end="00:21:34.059" style="s2">going in the right direction that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.360" end="00:21:35.679" style="s2">adjacent possible and you can say what</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.059" end="00:21:38.259" style="s2">could we do tomorrow to create more</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.679" end="00:21:40.990" style="s2">stories like this now that&#39;s a whole new</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.259" end="00:21:43.869" style="s2">theory of change more stories like these</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.990" end="00:21:46.809" style="s2">fewer stories like that when we work in</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.869" end="00:21:48.909" style="s2">patient safety if you say how do we make</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.809" end="00:21:52.299" style="s2">the environment safer people say but we</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.909" end="00:21:54.129" style="s2">already are safe if you actually show</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.299" end="00:21:55.929" style="s2">them patient stories and say we want</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.129" end="00:21:56.590" style="s2">more stories like this and fewer stories</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.929" end="00:21:59.409" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.590" end="00:22:02.039" style="s2">nobody is threatened by the request and</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.409" end="00:22:05.379" style="s2">you get much more interested in gaygent</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.039" end="00:22:08.470" style="s2">now I&#39;m using this because this is key</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.379" end="00:22:10.600" style="s2">to resilience a system which has</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.470" end="00:22:13.720" style="s2">difference in it but it can come here</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.600" end="00:22:15.610" style="s2">when it needs to is resilient a system</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.720" end="00:22:17.799" style="s2">where everybody believes and thinks the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.610" end="00:22:20.730" style="s2">same way is not resilient because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.799" end="00:22:23.519" style="s2">homogeneous it lacks efficient variety</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.730" end="00:22:27.159" style="s2">and the way I normally illustrate this</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.519" end="00:22:29.080" style="s2">in this lecture the other day is I know</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.159" end="00:22:30.730" style="s2">I&#39;m Welsh right you need to understand</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.080" end="00:22:32.140" style="s2">that now you understand that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.730" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">we&#39;ll largely defined by not being</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.140" end="00:22:38.590" style="s2">English right this is important so we</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.120" end="00:22:41.950" style="s2">have four rugby teams</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.590" end="00:22:43.660" style="s2">my hobby is a rugby an opera and by the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.950" end="00:22:46.270" style="s2">way we sing at rugby matches we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.660" end="00:22:48.549" style="s2">choral nation so I&#39;ve got a real problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.270" end="00:22:51.220" style="s2">with kovat because my two main hobbies</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.549" end="00:22:53.169" style="s2">aren&#39;t available to me but when I go</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.220" end="00:22:55.410" style="s2">much tardis please play rugby that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.169" end="00:23:00.160" style="s2">team there are four teams in South Wales</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.410" end="00:23:02.169" style="s2">yeah I wear my blue costume yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.160" end="00:23:03.850" style="s2">got my Sita I&#39;ve had for the last 40</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.169" end="00:23:05.470" style="s2">years I sit in it my mother had it</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.850" end="00:23:07.660" style="s2">before me</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.470" end="00:23:09.850" style="s2">Cardiff if you don&#39;t know it a really</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.660" end="00:23:12.610" style="s2">good team full of high integrity players</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.850" end="00:23:14.559" style="s2">who never treat never commit violence</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.610" end="00:23:16.710" style="s2">and I generally put upon by the other</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.559" end="00:23:18.520" style="s2">teams or a bunch of horrendous cheats</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.710" end="00:23:21.549" style="s2">particularly those bastards from</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.520" end="00:23:23.590" style="s2">fanatically here you can&#39;t trust yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.549" end="00:23:27.429" style="s2">we have a lot of rivalry on this but</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.590" end="00:23:30.460" style="s2">when the English arrived were Welsh no</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.429" end="00:23:33.160" style="s2">that&#39;s coherent heterogeneity difference</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.460" end="00:23:35.080" style="s2">in one context commonality in another</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.160" end="00:23:37.660" style="s2">context yeah so that&#39;s kind of one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.080" end="00:23:39.700" style="s2">the key things and we use these maps to</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.660" end="00:23:43.030" style="s2">actually measure resilience within a</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.700" end="00:23:47.110" style="s2">community yeah and actually identify</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.030" end="00:23:49.270" style="s2">pathways of change so that&#39;s one other</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.110" end="00:23:51.730" style="s2">aspect of the work the other is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.270" end="00:23:55.570" style="s2">currently right in the EU handbook on</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.730" end="00:23:56.950" style="s2">how to manage complexity and chaos which</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.570" end="00:23:58.000" style="s2">I&#39;ve got to get back to this evening</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.950" end="00:24:00.820" style="s2">because it needs to get out next week</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.000" end="00:24:02.770" style="s2">and there&#39;s a couple of key lapses in</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.820" end="00:24:05.710" style="s2">that I wanted to highlight on how do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.770" end="00:24:07.510" style="s2">create resilience in society and one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.710" end="00:24:09.370" style="s2">the key rules is you distribute</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.510" end="00:24:13.390" style="s2">decision-making but you centralized</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.370" end="00:24:16.510" style="s2">coordination generally organizations get</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.390" end="00:24:18.429" style="s2">that wrong and they centralized</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.510" end="00:24:21.790" style="s2">decision-making and assume the system</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.429" end="00:24:23.679" style="s2">will coordinate any can&#39;t yeah but you</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.790" end="00:24:25.620" style="s2">don&#39;t distribute decision-making them</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.679" end="00:24:28.419" style="s2">just by saying we&#39;ll trust people you</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.620" end="00:24:32.260" style="s2">create processes which naturally</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.419" end="00:24:34.830" style="s2">generate trust so the army do this for</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.260" end="00:24:38.440" style="s2">example they have what are called crews</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.830" end="00:24:40.710" style="s2">now same with firefighters so people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.440" end="00:24:44.020" style="s2">trained in roll and roll expectation</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.710" end="00:24:47.380" style="s2">entry into the cruel is ritualized we</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.020" end="00:24:49.660" style="s2">changes your identity so a crew has</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.380" end="00:24:52.630" style="s2">cognitive capacity more than the sum of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.660" end="00:24:54.760" style="s2">the parts but it will actually behave in</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.630" end="00:24:57.910" style="s2">a consistent way so you can delegate to</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.760" end="00:25:00.160" style="s2">a crew and not worry about it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.910" end="00:25:02.050" style="s2">creating temporary cruising Co vids so</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.160" end="00:25:04.780" style="s2">for example triage decisions which are</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.050" end="00:25:06.490" style="s2">really scary at the moment we can say</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.780" end="00:25:08.730" style="s2">well any doctor can make any decision</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.490" end="00:25:11.320" style="s2">where the situation is ambiguous</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.730" end="00:25:13.570" style="s2">provided it&#39;s signed off by a nurse from</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.320" end="00:25:15.610" style="s2">another ward an administrator who spends</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.570" end="00:25:17.550" style="s2">five minutes checking it you said I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.610" end="00:25:20.320" style="s2">done I&#39;ve created a threeway process</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.550" end="00:25:22.420" style="s2">which says you&#39;ll have to be transparent</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.320" end="00:25:24.580" style="s2">to a degree and you have to be validated</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.420" end="00:25:26.560" style="s2">I&#39;m not just trusting you to make the</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.580" end="00:25:28.180" style="s2">decisions but you don&#39;t have to refer</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.560" end="00:25:31.030" style="s2">upwards you know there&#39;s other methods</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.180" end="00:25:34.600" style="s2">on that so a distributed decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.030" end="00:25:37.030" style="s2">central coordination is key the other is</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.600" end="00:25:40.030" style="s2">a crisis is a major opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.030" end="00:25:42.700" style="s2">learning and innovation so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.030" end="00:25:44.650" style="s2">actually starting now to get leaders to</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.700" end="00:25:47.350" style="s2">collect and also people in across the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.650" end="00:25:49.650" style="s2">organization to capture fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.350" end="00:25:52.900" style="s2">learning in journals throughout the day</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.650" end="00:25:55.330" style="s2">the morning and evening reflection the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.900" end="00:25:57.460" style="s2">ability a missed opportunity thing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.330" end="00:25:59.950" style="s2">I&#39;ve observed of the innovation</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.460" end="00:26:02.320" style="s2">possibility and part of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.950" end="00:26:05.080" style="s2">increasing resilience within families</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.320" end="00:26:07.750" style="s2">and organizations because if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.080" end="00:26:10.810" style="s2">engaged in the tasks related to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.750" end="00:26:12.610" style="s2">problem you have a sense of purpose if</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.810" end="00:26:14.680" style="s2">you&#39;re just the recipient of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.610" end="00:26:16.180" style="s2">communication you don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.680" end="00:26:19.090" style="s2">purpose anymore you&#39;re a suffering</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.180" end="00:26:20.920" style="s2">massive socialization and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.090" end="00:26:23.500" style="s2">related project I&#39;m very proud of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.920" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">one we did in Rwanda well we got young</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.500" end="00:26:27.970" style="s2">girls who&#39;ve being genetically mutilated</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.840" end="00:26:29.980" style="s2">and raped to actually act as</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.970" end="00:26:32.040" style="s2">ethnographers to people at risk of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.980" end="00:26:34.540" style="s2">same horror in their own community and</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.040" end="00:26:36.370" style="s2">what was interesting there is that was</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.540" end="00:26:38.590" style="s2">better therapy than being counseled</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.370" end="00:26:40.860" style="s2">about the problem yeah going to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.590" end="00:26:43.840" style="s2">something human beings are action based</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.860" end="00:26:45.910" style="s2">so starting to create mechanisms by</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.840" end="00:26:47.950" style="s2">which communities engage with each other</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.910" end="00:26:50.050" style="s2">and actually see themselves as part of</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.950" end="00:26:51.520" style="s2">the solution is one of the other ways</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.050" end="00:26:56.320" style="s2">that you actually create that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.520" end="00:26:58.090" style="s2">resilience within a system and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.320" end="00:26:59.979" style="s2">like to finish off on this</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.090" end="00:27:02.679" style="s2">well if we&#39;re launching tomorrow is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.979" end="00:27:08.049" style="s2">mass narrative micro scenario generation</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.679" end="00:27:10.509" style="s2">of post pandemic futures that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.049" end="00:27:12.369" style="s2">done with the UN yeah that&#39;s a one-week</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.509" end="00:27:14.619" style="s2">trial if that works we&#39;re gonna go on a</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.369" end="00:27:17.019" style="s2">wider um you know regular course every</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.619" end="00:27:19.450" style="s2">week you know to try and find attitudes</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.019" end="00:27:21.429" style="s2">now that&#39;s important for a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.450" end="00:27:24.999" style="s2">of reasons so I&#39;m going to get political</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.429" end="00:27:27.279" style="s2">for a minute right there&#39;s a dominant</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.999" end="00:27:29.739" style="s2">trope which has been established by the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.279" end="00:27:33.460" style="s2">populist governments in the UK US and</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.739" end="00:27:35.499" style="s2">Brazil yeah which is international</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.460" end="00:27:38.049" style="s2">organizations or evil and suck our money</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.499" end="00:27:39.969" style="s2">away from us that&#39;s called a trope in</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.049" end="00:27:41.830" style="s2">narrative the I don&#39;t buy memes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.969" end="00:27:44.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a pattern of narrative which</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.830" end="00:27:46.509" style="s2">creates like a whirlpool effect anybody</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.440" end="00:27:47.830" style="s2">in Toulouse this is an assemblage if</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.509" end="00:27:50.349" style="s2">you&#39;re into complexity it&#39;s a strange</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.830" end="00:27:52.359" style="s2">attractor and so what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.349" end="00:27:54.219" style="s2">happening now and we can see it in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.359" end="00:27:57.039" style="s2">UK in the u.s. is an attempt to deflect</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.219" end="00:28:00.969" style="s2">blame for the lack of planning on to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.039" end="00:28:02.859" style="s2">wh oh yeah it&#39;s a ready victim and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.969" end="00:28:05.409" style="s2">reality is certainly and I know in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.859" end="00:28:07.570" style="s2">US and the UK we&#39;re not dealing with a</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.409" end="00:28:10.989" style="s2">Black Swan just to be nice to taro we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.570" end="00:28:12.700" style="s2">dealing with a blank elephant yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.989" end="00:28:14.529" style="s2">means it&#39;s a Black Swan it&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.700" end="00:28:16.719" style="s2">unexpected but it&#39;s the elephant in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.529" end="00:28:19.839" style="s2">room we knew it was going to happen we</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.719" end="00:28:22.089" style="s2">just wanted to ignore it yes so Britain</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.839" end="00:28:23.739" style="s2">did a major simulation two years ago on</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.089" end="00:28:25.929" style="s2">a flu pandemic which predicted</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.739" end="00:28:27.460" style="s2">everything which is happening though but</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.929" end="00:28:30.369" style="s2">the government actually haven&#39;t read the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.460" end="00:28:33.219" style="s2">report yeah didn&#39;t implement the results</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.369" end="00:28:36.070" style="s2">and sucked the money away for brexit so</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.219" end="00:28:37.899" style="s2">we got this political situation where</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.070" end="00:28:40.419" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a huge opportunity to change</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.899" end="00:28:41.769" style="s2">the way we think about society but</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.419" end="00:28:44.649" style="s2">what&#39;s actually going to happen if we</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.769" end="00:28:45.849" style="s2">don&#39;t watch it is the blame game will</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.649" end="00:28:48.190" style="s2">start to move in a different direction</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.849" end="00:28:50.769" style="s2">but it seems to me that the major</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.190" end="00:28:52.509" style="s2">opportunity provided by the crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.769" end="00:28:56.229" style="s2">the fact that we now know that money</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.509" end="00:28:58.419" style="s2">isn&#39;t a rationing device so our former</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.229" end="00:29:00.519" style="s2">prime minister in the UK once said when</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.419" end="00:29:03.700" style="s2">people wanted to properly fund health</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.519" end="00:29:05.889" style="s2">care for the Americans in the audience</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.700" end="00:29:08.139" style="s2">you have my sympathy I mean you spend</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.889" end="00:29:10.690" style="s2">more per head on public health than</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.139" end="00:29:11.860" style="s2">anybody in Europe and you still have you</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.690" end="00:29:13.179" style="s2">can&#39;t manage for you at the point</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.860" end="00:29:16.179" style="s2">of entry health care that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.179" end="00:29:19.540" style="s2">issue she said there isn&#39;t a magic money</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.179" end="00:29:21.429" style="s2">tree well at the moment governments are</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.540" end="00:29:21.929" style="s2">growing magic money forests all over the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.429" end="00:29:25.559" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.929" end="00:29:28.299" style="s2">yeah but money is not a rationing device</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.559" end="00:29:29.559" style="s2">right money was oh and I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.299" end="00:29:32.049" style="s2">the key things and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.559" end="00:29:33.750" style="s2">buy things like blockchain the problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.049" end="00:29:36.130" style="s2">is once you have a means of exchange</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.750" end="00:29:39.549" style="s2">ownership of the means of exchange is</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.130" end="00:29:40.780" style="s2">the most important thing it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.549" end="00:29:43.030" style="s2">matter that that&#39;s actually where</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.780" end="00:29:46.179" style="s2">control comes some of the work I did in</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.030" end="00:29:48.400" style="s2">cockatoo in Australia in the 70s was to</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.179" end="00:29:50.830" style="s2">look at gifting cultures because</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.400" end="00:29:53.220" style="s2">indigenous cultures gift and gifting is</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.830" end="00:29:56.320" style="s2">not an exchange it&#39;s a membership fee</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.220" end="00:29:58.540" style="s2">now we can already see gifting happening</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.320" end="00:30:00.970" style="s2">in communities around kovat it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.540" end="00:30:02.290" style="s2">barter you&#39;re not saying I&#39;ll do this</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.970" end="00:30:04.660" style="s2">and you do the equipment for me</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.290" end="00:30:06.490" style="s2">downstream you&#39;re saying we&#39;re part of</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.660" end="00:30:09.309" style="s2">this community which faces a common</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.490" end="00:30:11.290" style="s2">front we all do something and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.309" end="00:30:12.850" style="s2">part of the community but if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.290" end="00:30:15.340" style="s2">do anything you&#39;re actually excluded</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.850" end="00:30:17.850" style="s2">from it so I think there&#39;s a really big</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.340" end="00:30:20.559" style="s2">opportunity here to look at look at this</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.850" end="00:30:22.090" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s absolutely no reason why</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.559" end="00:30:24.070" style="s2">we can&#39;t give free at the point of entry</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.090" end="00:30:26.650" style="s2">health care and education to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.070" end="00:30:30.040" style="s2">worldwide it&#39;s just we choose to ration</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.650" end="00:30:32.020" style="s2">it the money and now we know that money</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.040" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">isn&#39;t necessarily a rationing device if</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.020" end="00:30:36.160" style="s2">you have the right sort of situation to</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:38.530" style="s2">deal with it the other thing I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.160" end="00:30:40.780" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to realise is that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.530" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">supply chains are actually hardly</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.780" end="00:30:46.510" style="s2">vulnerable because they lack resilience</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:48.610" style="s2">they lack they lack time we used to have</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.510" end="00:30:52.900" style="s2">four weeks supply of food in the UK</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.610" end="00:30:55.720" style="s2">we&#39;ve got currently got two weeks and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.900" end="00:30:58.540" style="s2">the process reengineering generation of</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.720" end="00:30:59.980" style="s2">the last three three decades has focused</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.540" end="00:31:03.190" style="s2">on efficiency at the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.980" end="00:31:05.620" style="s2">effectiveness so building redundancy</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.190" end="00:31:08.260" style="s2">back into our systems is also going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.620" end="00:31:11.169" style="s2">be key downstream and I think people can</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.260" end="00:31:14.230" style="s2">now see the advantage of that but the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.169" end="00:31:18.360" style="s2">third thing I think is also to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.230" end="00:31:21.070" style="s2">that we&#39;ve lost resilience as a society</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.360" end="00:31:23.169" style="s2">so I was working with CDC a few years</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.070" end="00:31:24.669" style="s2">ago and I remember one of them space</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.169" end="00:31:26.139" style="s2">that he said look if we have a really</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.669" end="00:31:29.659" style="s2">hard</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.139" end="00:31:33.219" style="s2">heart pandemic is probably the over 40&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.659" end="00:31:35.899" style="s2">who will survive not the under forties</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.219" end="00:31:38.809" style="s2">it would now be over 50s and I said why</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.899" end="00:31:42.320" style="s2">he said because your generation had all</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.809" end="00:31:44.659" style="s2">the childhood diseases and quite high</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.320" end="00:31:47.209" style="s2">infant mortality and I&#39;m going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.659" end="00:31:49.369" style="s2">bit brutal now if infant mortality falls</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.209" end="00:31:52.399" style="s2">below a certain level the species loses</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.369" end="00:31:54.379" style="s2">resilience so I have measles German</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.399" end="00:31:56.059" style="s2">measles mumps scarlet fever</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.379" end="00:31:58.700" style="s2">I had the whole bloody thing they just</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.059" end="00:32:00.979" style="s2">went through school as they happen and</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.700" end="00:32:02.629" style="s2">also we had social resilience because we</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.979" end="00:32:06.259" style="s2">had to play with the Weber&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.629" end="00:32:09.200" style="s2">street now my kids have grown up in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.259" end="00:32:10.999" style="s2">completely clean environment yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.200" end="00:32:12.859" style="s2">they&#39;ve had very few of the diseases</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.999" end="00:32:14.599" style="s2">because of university inoculation I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.859" end="00:32:15.889" style="s2">not saying we don&#39;t do that I&#39;m not one</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.599" end="00:32:18.950" style="s2">of those guys all right but they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.889" end="00:32:21.079" style="s2">never had that sort of encounter and</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.950" end="00:32:22.759" style="s2">also they&#39;ve been moved between houses</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.079" end="00:32:26.389" style="s2">in cars so they only play with safe</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.759" end="00:32:28.489" style="s2">people and this was driven home to me in</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.389" end="00:32:30.889" style="s2">Los Angeles a few years back so my son</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.489" end="00:32:33.200" style="s2">was then 11 and we had a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.889" end="00:32:34.789" style="s2">father-son trip around California for</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.200" end="00:32:35.690" style="s2">three weeks you know two nights in</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.789" end="00:32:38.779" style="s2">different motels</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.690" end="00:32:41.479" style="s2">yeah Grand Canyon the deserts majare via</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.779" end="00:32:43.459" style="s2">search we had a great time and at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.479" end="00:32:44.929" style="s2">end of it we got to Los Andes Airport at</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.459" end="00:32:47.509" style="s2">9 o&#39;clock in the morning because I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.929" end="00:32:49.009" style="s2">done it on air miles so this was a treat</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.509" end="00:32:51.589" style="s2">for him his business class but we&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.009" end="00:32:53.809" style="s2">to go to New York five hours in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.589" end="00:32:55.339" style="s2">lounge and then back to the UK and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.809" end="00:32:57.469" style="s2">American Airlines attendant said well</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.339" end="00:32:59.029" style="s2">why are you doing this there&#39;s a direct</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.469" end="00:33:02.509" style="s2">flight this evening I can put you both</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.029" end="00:33:04.159" style="s2">in first-class yeah he was charming</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.509" end="00:33:06.619" style="s2">those things he was a charming 11 year</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.159" end="00:33:08.059" style="s2">old so he&#39;s very useful right and so we</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.619" end="00:33:10.700" style="s2">had an extra day and we went to the Tar</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.059" end="00:33:12.709" style="s2">Pits and walking back from the Tar Pits</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.700" end="00:33:16.070" style="s2">I suddenly realized we got into a bad</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.709" end="00:33:18.799" style="s2">area I mean there&#39;s a fewer run the Tar</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.070" end="00:33:20.299" style="s2">Pits now because when I was growing up I</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.799" end="00:33:22.099" style="s2">knew how to walk and not be noticed</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.299" end="00:33:24.529" style="s2">because that was a survival technique</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.099" end="00:33:26.179" style="s2">when you walk to school my son has got</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.529" end="00:33:29.719" style="s2">on no idea but I&#39;m walking confidently</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.179" end="00:33:31.549" style="s2">and my son is saying dad dad we&#39;re lost</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.719" end="00:33:34.309" style="s2">can we ask for help and I&#39;m saying shut</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.549" end="00:33:37.099" style="s2">up Hugh and just walk is he housing up</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.309" end="00:33:38.179" style="s2">there&#39;s basic instincts so I think one</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.099" end="00:33:38.780" style="s2">of the things we&#39;ve got to start to look</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.179" end="00:33:42.520" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.780" end="00:33:44.929" style="s2">is how do we build resilience for threat</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.520" end="00:33:47.390" style="s2">right and this is going to be depressing</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.929" end="00:33:50.270" style="s2">end point I mean I said the other day on</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.390" end="00:33:52.159" style="s2">one call Cove it is sort of God&#39;s gift</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.270" end="00:33:55.309" style="s2">to humanity because it&#39;s a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.159" end="00:33:57.049" style="s2">sort ourselves out yeah it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.309" end="00:33:58.940" style="s2">gonna kill about 10 percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.049" end="00:34:01.610" style="s2">population over two to three years if</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.940" end="00:34:03.320" style="s2">you take all the other things but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.610" end="00:34:05.690" style="s2">only got a two to three-week gestation</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.320" end="00:34:08.179" style="s2">period it&#39;s mutating faster than we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.690" end="00:34:09.980" style="s2">like so it might be more scary but what</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.179" end="00:34:12.440" style="s2">happens if we get something with an 80%</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.980" end="00:34:16.760" style="s2">kill rate in a six week gestation period</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.440" end="00:34:18.560" style="s2">and then this global warming so the big</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.760" end="00:34:21.139" style="s2">thing for me is how do we now create</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.560" end="00:34:23.929" style="s2">resilience in the system how do we</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.139" end="00:34:25.700" style="s2">create diversity in the system so that</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.929" end="00:34:29.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the ability to actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.700" end="00:34:30.740" style="s2">survive yeah and change things and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.240" end="00:34:34.629" style="s2">I think it&#39;s about the time I was</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.740" end="00:34:34.629" style="s2">allocated so I&#39;ll stop at that point</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.260" end="00:34:40.909" style="s2">excellent thank you so if people would</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.270" end="00:34:43.159" style="s2">like to put their their questions in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.909" end="00:34:46.280" style="s2">chat and then I will call on you and you</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.159" end="00:34:50.659" style="s2">can unmute yourself and just initially</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.280" end="00:34:53.210" style="s2">Dave I was wondering so there&#39;s a term</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.659" end="00:34:55.040" style="s2">that&#39;s used often in the game be</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.210" end="00:34:57.410" style="s2">community in at large which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.040" end="00:35:01.010" style="s2">sense-making and I noticed that your</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.410" end="00:35:02.690" style="s2">software is named sense maker I was</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.010" end="00:35:05.030" style="s2">wondering if you could talk about your</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.690" end="00:35:07.130" style="s2">understanding of that word and also</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.030" end="00:35:08.900" style="s2">maybe explain a little bit about how</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.130" end="00:35:11.980" style="s2">your software works I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.900" end="00:35:13.970" style="s2">currently writing an article on that</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.980" end="00:35:15.200" style="s2">publication recently said there are five</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.970" end="00:35:18.890" style="s2">schools of sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.200" end="00:35:21.320" style="s2">now and I&#39;m one of them Mike is another</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.890" end="00:35:24.320" style="s2">Klein is another Devon is another and</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.320" end="00:35:26.180" style="s2">then there&#39;s an IT group i define</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.320" end="00:35:30.260" style="s2">sense-making which i use a hyphen on</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.180" end="00:35:31.910" style="s2">because I don&#39;t like neologisms yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.260" end="00:35:33.800" style="s2">it sounds making for me is how do I make</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.910" end="00:35:37.550" style="s2">sense of the world so that I can act in</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.800" end="00:35:39.380" style="s2">it and so it has with it a concept of</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.550" end="00:35:43.010" style="s2">sufficiency is how do I know enough to</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.380" end="00:35:46.280" style="s2">act yeah contrast fairly heavily with</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.010" end="00:35:49.070" style="s2">Karl Weick so Vikas is a classic</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.280" end="00:35:51.170" style="s2">American sociologists economists he</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.070" end="00:35:52.250" style="s2">studies cases and he derives general</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.170" end="00:35:56.390" style="s2">theory from that</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.250" end="00:35:58.670" style="s2">yeah the way I approach it is we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.390" end="00:36:01.130" style="s2">use cases because I&#39;m a physicist</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.670" end="00:36:03.320" style="s2">no social scientists is ever that have</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.130" end="00:36:06.200" style="s2">enough data to form any valid conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.320" end="00:36:08.000" style="s2">whatsoever so what we do is we say what</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.200" end="00:36:09.730" style="s2">do we know from cognitive neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.000" end="00:36:12.530" style="s2">what do we know from complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.730" end="00:36:14.300" style="s2">that acts as a constraint and we build</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.530" end="00:36:17.119" style="s2">methods and tools consistent with</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.300" end="00:36:18.460" style="s2">natural science so we don&#39;t use cases so</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.119" end="00:36:20.930" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of like a different approach</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.460" end="00:36:22.369" style="s2">the way a sense maker works is probably</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.930" end="00:36:24.380" style="s2">the easier illustration you&#39;ve all done</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.369" end="00:36:27.170" style="s2">an employee satisfaction survey at some</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.380" end="00:36:28.940" style="s2">time in your lives so you get a survey</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.170" end="00:36:31.000" style="s2">and it comes round it says don&#39;t your</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.940" end="00:36:35.810" style="s2">manager consult you on a regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.000" end="00:36:37.550" style="s2">scale of 0 not at all 10 all the time no</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.810" end="00:36:39.290" style="s2">now you know exactly what answer they</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.550" end="00:36:42.470" style="s2">want because you&#39;ve got a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.290" end="00:36:46.010" style="s2">base question and in evaluative yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.470" end="00:36:47.510" style="s2">like let&#39;s go we don&#39;t do that we say</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.010" end="00:36:49.160" style="s2">what story would you tell your best</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.510" end="00:36:52.550" style="s2">friend if they were off the job in your</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.160" end="00:36:54.590" style="s2">work group yeah or one of the ones we</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.550" end="00:36:56.390" style="s2">used in military a lot is imagine you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.590" end="00:36:58.310" style="s2">a grandparent your grandchild says they</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.390" end="00:36:58.670" style="s2">want to join the Marines won&#39;t you tell</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.310" end="00:37:01.160" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.670" end="00:37:04.190" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s an on hypothesis question</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.160" end="00:37:05.810" style="s2">and then we get people to self interpret</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.190" end="00:37:09.109" style="s2">that and there are various ways we do it</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.810" end="00:37:10.970" style="s2">but one is a series of triangles and one</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.109" end="00:37:13.880" style="s2">of the triangles for example says in</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.970" end="00:37:17.599" style="s2">this story the managers behavior was</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.880" end="00:37:21.619" style="s2">altruistic assertive analytical so those</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.599" end="00:37:23.570" style="s2">are three positive qualities no this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.619" end="00:37:24.859" style="s2">all derived from theory in the field so</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.570" end="00:37:27.589" style="s2">it&#39;s just like longitudinal research</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.859" end="00:37:29.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a theory in now what happens to</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.589" end="00:37:31.280" style="s2">the brain when it sees three positive</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.480" end="00:37:34.280" style="s2">qualities is it doesn&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.280" end="00:37:36.710" style="s2">right answer is so it switches from</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.280" end="00:37:39.589" style="s2">autumn of it to novelty receptive mode</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.710" end="00:37:41.270" style="s2">what cardamon called thinking slow not</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.589" end="00:37:44.390" style="s2">thinking fast but that&#39;s not as good as</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.270" end="00:37:46.700" style="s2">a science yeah so basically we&#39;re six</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.390" end="00:37:48.920" style="s2">triangles people will spend time</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.700" end="00:37:51.980" style="s2">positioning they&#39;re dots on the triangle</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.920" end="00:37:53.540" style="s2">because that&#39;s what this story means and</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.980" end="00:37:55.940" style="s2">of course that gives us data points</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.540" end="00:37:57.560" style="s2">where no one&#39;s were using impatient</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.940" end="00:37:59.900" style="s2">journey and actually allowing patients</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.560" end="00:38:02.900" style="s2">to tell stories is a power issue as well</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.900" end="00:38:05.870" style="s2">it&#39;s a sense of agency in their journey</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.900" end="00:38:07.850" style="s2">we have a pain empathy scale</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.870" end="00:38:09.740" style="s2">and they place markers on that to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.850" end="00:38:11.330" style="s2">this is how I see things this is how I</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.740" end="00:38:13.160" style="s2">think the nurse sees like these things</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.330" end="00:38:15.290" style="s2">this is how I think the doctor sees IV</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.160" end="00:38:20.210" style="s2">things and of course we can compare that</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.290" end="00:38:22.130" style="s2">with a nurse record so there&#39;s a medium</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.210" end="00:38:24.770" style="s2">article I can send you a link to by an</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.130" end="00:38:26.180" style="s2">anthropologist to work for Nokia it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.770" end="00:38:28.250" style="s2">basically argue in the case for</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.180" end="00:38:31.810" style="s2">anthropology so as you said you have big</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.250" end="00:38:34.730" style="s2">data which is huge volumes of data and</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.810" end="00:38:38.390" style="s2">to my mind a frequent confusion of</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.730" end="00:38:39.950" style="s2">correlation with causation I think this</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.390" end="00:38:41.630" style="s2">is part of the problem with talib at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.950" end="00:38:43.010" style="s2">moment alibies running a theme which</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.630" end="00:38:45.440" style="s2">says talib is the only one who</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.010" end="00:38:47.660" style="s2">understands Kovac he&#39;s just running</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.440" end="00:38:49.160" style="s2">mathematical models the epidemiologists</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.660" end="00:38:50.650" style="s2">are screaming because he doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.160" end="00:38:53.000" style="s2">how to build the assumptions in right</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.650" end="00:38:53.540" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s a trouble we got these</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.000" end="00:38:56.030" style="s2">kids</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.540" end="00:38:57.650" style="s2">yeah and or people who think I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.030" end="00:38:59.240" style="s2">brilliant statistician I can use</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.650" end="00:39:02.000" style="s2">algorithms on available data</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.240" end="00:39:05.840" style="s2">the reality is epidemiologists know how</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.000" end="00:39:07.160" style="s2">to build those models okay I&#39;m sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.840" end="00:39:08.510" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t get on that rant because I</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.160" end="00:39:10.430" style="s2">know again that I&#39;m losing the track</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.510" end="00:39:14.180" style="s2">where I was going on this so either way</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.430" end="00:39:16.280" style="s2">so um so basically what Big Data which</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.180" end="00:39:19.190" style="s2">is high volume the black box then you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.280" end="00:39:20.930" style="s2">got thick data which is ethnography but</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.190" end="00:39:22.640" style="s2">of course the ethnographer has to get</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.930" end="00:39:24.530" style="s2">stories they can&#39;t deal with anecdotes</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.640" end="00:39:26.630" style="s2">because they need to actually stimulate</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.530" end="00:39:30.890" style="s2">stuff they can interpret and that&#39;s low</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.630" end="00:39:32.360" style="s2">volume we can use anecdote because</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.890" end="00:39:36.260" style="s2">people self interpret their own</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.360" end="00:39:39.590" style="s2">anecdotes so we can go to high volume so</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.260" end="00:39:43.100" style="s2">typically somebody puts in a picture</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.590" end="00:39:45.110" style="s2">voice text any combination that&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.100" end="00:39:46.790" style="s2">a sense making item you can all play</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.110" end="00:39:48.680" style="s2">with this on the leadership journal next</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.790" end="00:39:50.330" style="s2">week if you want to play with it you</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.680" end="00:39:53.210" style="s2">then interpret it on to a series of</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.330" end="00:39:55.970" style="s2">triangles that means I&#39;ve got 2030 data</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.210" end="00:39:57.320" style="s2">points and from that I can draw the sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.970" end="00:40:01.010" style="s2">of probability maps I&#39;ll show you</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.320" end="00:40:02.720" style="s2">earlier and it means I can scale them I</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.010" end="00:40:04.640" style="s2">wrote a blog post on this I can send you</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.720" end="00:40:05.240" style="s2">the link um so that&#39;s how the software</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.640" end="00:40:08.240" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.240" end="00:40:09.770" style="s2">so it&#39;s either to journal to capture or</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.240" end="00:40:12.470" style="s2">what I showed you earlier which is to</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.770" end="00:40:16.070" style="s2">present data for everybody to interpret</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.470" end="00:40:17.270" style="s2">and then look at differences cool and</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.070" end="00:40:19.109" style="s2">then you said that there were five</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.270" end="00:40:30.599" style="s2">schools of sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.109" end="00:40:41.880" style="s2">you remind us what actually tied you</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.599" end="00:40:45.720" style="s2">that my study okay there&#39;s an article in</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.880" end="00:40:50.519" style="s2">epic which is the yeah ethnography an</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.720" end="00:40:53.910" style="s2">industry so it&#39;s six of April 2015 by</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.519" end="00:40:57.480" style="s2">Peter Hayward and it basically</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.910" end="00:40:59.819" style="s2">identifies it&#39;s got the nice two-by-two</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.480" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">matrix all right collective individual</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.819" end="00:41:03.269" style="s2">internal external I&#39;ve never bought that</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.440" end="00:41:05.190" style="s2">by the way I think it&#39;s false humanism</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.269" end="00:41:07.769" style="s2">but I&#39;ll live with it</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.190" end="00:41:10.799" style="s2">so basically at certainly individual is</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.769" end="00:41:11.940" style="s2">Gary Klein yeah he was a good friend</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.799" end="00:41:15.029" style="s2">I&#39;ve done a lot of work with him</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.940" end="00:41:17.460" style="s2">published with him branded Irving in</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.029" end="00:41:19.200" style="s2">internal individual if you&#39;ve never met</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.460" end="00:41:21.079" style="s2">Brenda she&#39;s just a wonderful woman I</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.200" end="00:41:24.029" style="s2">mean South cured cancer</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.079" end="00:41:27.450" style="s2">she&#39;s post modernist information science</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.029" end="00:41:30.720" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got Vikas social activity</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.450" end="00:41:33.480" style="s2">collective internal and then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.720" end="00:41:35.569" style="s2">Russell Hotel which is collective</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.480" end="00:41:37.829" style="s2">external which is data a meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.569" end="00:41:40.890" style="s2">then the pictures got me in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.829" end="00:41:43.079" style="s2">so I quite like it which it basically</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.890" end="00:41:47.039" style="s2">has understanding about yeah so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.079" end="00:41:49.829" style="s2">the cool paper great thank you so we</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.039" end="00:41:51.930" style="s2">have another question from the chat to</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.829" end="00:41:54.150" style="s2">what extent do we need to reaffirm the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.930" end="00:41:57.239" style="s2">nation-state system to move in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.150" end="00:41:58.650" style="s2">direction direction of resilience at</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.239" end="00:42:00.960" style="s2">least initially in order to change</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.650" end="00:42:03.900" style="s2">course are we looking at nation-states</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.960" end="00:42:05.430" style="s2">as part of small world networks in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.900" end="00:42:09.380" style="s2">u.s. we are talking about bio</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.430" end="00:42:13.710" style="s2">regionalism as small centers of agency</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.380" end="00:42:15.480" style="s2">than the nation in other words is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.710" end="00:42:18.809" style="s2">nation-state an appropriate boundary</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.480" end="00:42:21.230" style="s2">condition or constraint no it isn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.809" end="00:42:24.150" style="s2">I think actually if you look at Europe</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.230" end="00:42:29.400" style="s2">the dominant cultures are still 14th</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.150" end="00:42:31.259" style="s2">century cultures yeah I&#39;m well sure yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.400" end="00:42:32.990" style="s2">we support anybody who&#39;s playing against</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.259" end="00:42:35.480" style="s2">England it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.990" end="00:42:36.980" style="s2">yeah I mean yeah it&#39;s very simple as</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.480" end="00:42:38.750" style="s2">long as the English balloons were happy</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.980" end="00:42:41.890" style="s2">all right I have rugby shirts for every</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.750" end="00:42:44.480" style="s2">nation which plays against the buggers</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.890" end="00:42:46.760" style="s2">but I think if you look at your a blank</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.480" end="00:42:48.680" style="s2">Word document from Paris but there is</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.760" end="00:42:51.020" style="s2">radically different since a B and so on</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.680" end="00:42:53.060" style="s2">the argument in Europe is what we</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.020" end="00:42:55.099" style="s2">actually need is the European Union to</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.060" end="00:42:57.470" style="s2">provide financial defence and foreign</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.099" end="00:43:00.920" style="s2">policy but then you want smaller states</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.470" end="00:43:02.930" style="s2">which do culture Europe is distorted by</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.920" end="00:43:06.800" style="s2">the big states like Germany and France</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.930" end="00:43:08.960" style="s2">yeah so the idea of and there is</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.800" end="00:43:10.670" style="s2">actually a maximum size a state can get</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.960" end="00:43:12.770" style="s2">to which is about five to seven million</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.670" end="00:43:15.440" style="s2">there is a bit to come from the number</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.770" end="00:43:17.720" style="s2">of cities before it loses cultural</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.440" end="00:43:20.510" style="s2">coherence so if you look at it the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.720" end="00:43:22.460" style="s2">Scandinavian countries other than Sweden</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.510" end="00:43:24.849" style="s2">have a lot of cultural coherence Sweden</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.460" end="00:43:27.740" style="s2">doesn&#39;t because it&#39;s about 10 million</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.849" end="00:43:29.540" style="s2">u.s. is far more I&#39;m in Africa we just</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.740" end="00:43:31.130" style="s2">completely buggered up by changing the</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.540" end="00:43:33.320" style="s2">cultural boundaries with artificial</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.130" end="00:43:34.369" style="s2">lines and there&#39;s still a conflict and</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.320" end="00:43:37.910" style="s2">they need to go back to the original</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.369" end="00:43:40.670" style="s2">these are still there right the state is</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.910" end="00:43:42.619" style="s2">more problematic I mean we get a big</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.670" end="00:43:44.810" style="s2">scenario planning exercise a few years</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.619" end="00:43:47.630" style="s2">back and came out with a Handmaid&#39;s Tale</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.810" end="00:43:49.940" style="s2">scenario which basically said what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.630" end="00:43:54.349" style="s2">actually going to happen is that people</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.940" end="00:43:56.390" style="s2">who live in red states in blue cities</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.349" end="00:43:58.010" style="s2">will start to migrate to blue states</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.390" end="00:44:01.160" style="s2">because they can&#39;t survive the</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.010" end="00:44:03.140" style="s2">legislation yeah which means blue will</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.160" end="00:44:06.410" style="s2">become bluer and red will become redder</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.140" end="00:44:09.020" style="s2">and you get Gilyard and you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.410" end="00:44:11.839" style="s2">happening and I think that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.020" end="00:44:14.540" style="s2">you know accelerate yeah so you might</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.839" end="00:44:16.910" style="s2">well get California Washington you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.540" end="00:44:18.800" style="s2">you know Oregon but I mean Oregon is</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.910" end="00:44:20.830" style="s2">completely split between Portland and</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.800" end="00:44:23.839" style="s2">and the country right</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.830" end="00:44:27.710" style="s2">so America has lost its cohesiveness</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.839" end="00:44:29.150" style="s2">he&#39;s also lost its will leadership even</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.710" end="00:44:31.310" style="s2">if you get rid of Trump you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.150" end="00:44:34.460" style="s2">recover it not not for some time</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.310" end="00:44:36.200" style="s2">most European and Africa and Asia has</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.460" end="00:44:37.849" style="s2">already done this they put their second</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.200" end="00:44:40.160" style="s2">betting which I know Europe is going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.849" end="00:44:42.670" style="s2">start doing the same so we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.160" end="00:44:44.750" style="s2">face a radically different structure and</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.670" end="00:44:46.829" style="s2">China&#39;s going to come out of this better</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.750" end="00:44:50.009" style="s2">than anybody else because actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.829" end="00:44:52.109" style="s2">they can make the hard decisions we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.009" end="00:44:53.390" style="s2">now got a democratic system based on</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.109" end="00:44:56.160" style="s2">one-person one-vote</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.390" end="00:44:58.849" style="s2">which actually doesn&#39;t work one-person</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.160" end="00:45:02.130" style="s2">one-vote evolved for small populations</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.849" end="00:45:04.469" style="s2">with a highly resilient ecosystem it</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.130" end="00:45:07.650" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work for large populations where</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.469" end="00:45:08.969" style="s2">there&#39;s too much manipulation so I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.650" end="00:45:11.429" style="s2">one of the things we need to start to</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.969" end="00:45:12.900" style="s2">look at is smaller communities which</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.429" end="00:45:15.449" style="s2">actually you know the people you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.900" end="00:45:18.209" style="s2">electing and then those elect to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.449" end="00:45:19.469" style="s2">larger groups and what&#39;s interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.209" end="00:45:22.019" style="s2">if you go back to the American</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.469" end="00:45:24.179" style="s2">Constitution they basically say you</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.019" end="00:45:25.650" style="s2">can&#39;t elect some of the president by a</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.179" end="00:45:29.069" style="s2">popular vote because we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.650" end="00:45:30.809" style="s2">demagogues so they say every state</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.069" end="00:45:32.279" style="s2">should elect some intelligent people who</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.809" end="00:45:33.869" style="s2">get together and decide something</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.279" end="00:45:38.719" style="s2">newsworthy be President and that was a</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.869" end="00:45:38.719" style="s2">good idea then they mandated a delegate</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.839" end="00:45:44.069" style="s2">so into the major international groups</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.329" end="00:45:45.779" style="s2">and this is why it&#39;s so annoyed that</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.069" end="00:45:47.939" style="s2">Britain&#39;s left Europe but I think they</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.779" end="00:45:49.979" style="s2">might redeem that now actually there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.939" end="00:45:52.319" style="s2">still hope that because Europe was a</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.979" end="00:45:53.849" style="s2">democratic counter because America</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.319" end="00:45:57.209" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been a democracy for the last</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.849" end="00:45:58.739" style="s2">twenty years it&#39;s what in your British</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.209" end="00:46:01.829" style="s2">politics would be called a rotten</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.739" end="00:46:03.329" style="s2">borough yeah it&#39;s got all the</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.829" end="00:46:07.319" style="s2">characteristics of a rotten borough</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.329" end="00:46:08.849" style="s2">before the 1840 1812 reformat China</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.319" end="00:46:11.609" style="s2">definitely isn&#39;t a democracy</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.849" end="00:46:13.170" style="s2">um Africa is all over the place that in</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.609" end="00:46:14.489" style="s2">America has got a lot of hope but if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.170" end="00:46:17.309" style="s2">look at it we&#39;re now all talking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.489" end="00:46:19.319" style="s2">downloads in tracker apps so we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.309" end="00:46:20.759" style="s2">about to become Chinese I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.319" end="00:46:22.469" style="s2">download something with a centralized</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.759" end="00:46:25.229" style="s2">database and now I can how it can be</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.469" end="00:46:26.880" style="s2">misused yeah but people are starting to</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.229" end="00:46:29.069" style="s2">accept that and Western governments are</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.880" end="00:46:31.439" style="s2">leaping on the Chinese model now so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.069" end="00:46:34.499" style="s2">think our real danger here is the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.439" end="00:46:37.939" style="s2">sort of control you know people will</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.499" end="00:46:37.939" style="s2">accept lis coming out of the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.930" end="00:46:46.099" style="s2">Adam would you like to meet yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.240" end="00:46:47.839" style="s2">ask a question sure just referring to</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.099" end="00:46:50.930" style="s2">the diagram that you showed earlier the</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.839" end="00:46:53.300" style="s2">distributed ethnography topography he</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.930" end="00:46:55.970" style="s2">what would you say right now is the most</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.300" end="00:46:58.809" style="s2">important adjacent possibility for a</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.970" end="00:47:01.010" style="s2">dominant narrative needing to move into</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.809" end="00:47:04.160" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be different by different</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.010" end="00:47:05.780" style="s2">societies so America has got a real</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.160" end="00:47:08.180" style="s2">problem I mean I was watching pictures</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.780" end="00:47:10.910" style="s2">of Californians on beach beaches on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.180" end="00:47:14.540" style="s2">weekend yeah you&#39;re second wave is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.910" end="00:47:17.569" style="s2">be devastating yeah it&#39;s gonna be really</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.540" end="00:47:19.339" style="s2">devastating right whereas yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.569" end="00:47:20.630" style="s2">Europe I mean look at Germany Germany</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.339" end="00:47:23.030" style="s2">did everything right they&#39;re now getting</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.630" end="00:47:25.880" style="s2">another peak you&#39;ll be fast I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.030" end="00:47:27.349" style="s2">in Berlin just for the context I see</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.880" end="00:47:29.780" style="s2">that happening you get it so basically</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.349" end="00:47:32.030" style="s2">you&#39;ve had sixteen two weeks ago there</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.780" end="00:47:33.800" style="s2">were 16 major mutations on the coded</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.030" end="00:47:35.630" style="s2">virus and there&#39;s probably more by now</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.800" end="00:47:37.460" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.630" end="00:47:39.230" style="s2">America is all over the place in terms</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.460" end="00:47:40.280" style="s2">the way it&#39;s working so I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.230" end="00:47:42.319" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have to have different</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.280" end="00:47:45.079" style="s2">cultures the individualism of the states</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.319" end="00:47:47.510" style="s2">is so dominant remember this is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.079" end="00:47:50.299" style="s2">society where you know people take and</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.510" end="00:47:53.630" style="s2">run seriously after puberty and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.299" end="00:47:56.150" style="s2">that&#39;s really very scary right so</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.630" end="00:47:57.799" style="s2">individual freedom probably means a herd</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.150" end="00:47:59.180" style="s2">immunity thing is about the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.799" end="00:48:02.240" style="s2">which is going to work in the state you</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.180" end="00:48:03.710" style="s2">won&#39;t get enough consensus falaka which</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.240" end="00:48:06.200" style="s2">means you&#39;re not going to get trouble I</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.710" end="00:48:08.299" style="s2">mean my wife isn&#39;t allowed to leave the</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.200" end="00:48:09.980" style="s2">house until next year because she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.299" end="00:48:12.260" style="s2">highly vulnerable with you know chronic</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.980" end="00:48:13.520" style="s2">chronic immune disease problems that</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.260" end="00:48:16.700" style="s2">means I won&#39;t go to the states in</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.520" end="00:48:18.170" style="s2">November even if it&#39;s open these are the</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.700" end="00:48:21.319" style="s2">risk of an infection and carry through</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.170" end="00:48:22.730" style="s2">so I think you need each cultural group</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.319" end="00:48:25.579" style="s2">is going to have to find its own</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.730" end="00:48:27.140" style="s2">adjacent possible and that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.579" end="00:48:29.569" style="s2">the fractality I may have mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.140" end="00:48:31.460" style="s2">earlier it&#39;s the it&#39;s the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.569" end="00:48:33.559" style="s2">look at your own position from the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.460" end="00:48:36.440" style="s2">source nature of everybody else and work</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.559" end="00:48:37.910" style="s2">out where you step next because</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.440" end="00:48:39.260" style="s2">everybody&#39;s Direction is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.910" end="00:48:41.780" style="s2">slightly different but the overall</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.260" end="00:48:43.940" style="s2">system can be coherent as a result yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.780" end="00:48:45.680" style="s2">but I&#39;ll say the key things we need to</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.940" end="00:48:48.260" style="s2">investigate I think and money is</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.680" end="00:48:49.760" style="s2">rationing yeah I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.260" end="00:48:52.520" style="s2">absolutely vital because the</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.760" end="00:48:54.740" style="s2">neoliberalism agenda is dominated</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.520" end="00:48:56.500" style="s2">we need to get rid of behavioral science</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.740" end="00:48:59.510" style="s2">in favor of real science</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.500" end="00:49:03.290" style="s2">yeah behavioral science has become evil</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.510" end="00:49:05.750" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s yankin it&#39;s not logic yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.290" end="00:49:08.060" style="s2">if we can restore respect in science</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.750" end="00:49:09.440" style="s2">that will also make a difference yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.060" end="00:49:10.790" style="s2">terms of the way it works so those are</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.440" end="00:49:13.310" style="s2">kind of like two of the things I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.790" end="00:49:16.370" style="s2">worked on and also I think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.310" end="00:49:20.360" style="s2">find ways to allow communities to cohere</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.370" end="00:49:22.280" style="s2">in the crisis so at the moment people</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.360" end="00:49:24.650" style="s2">are too isolated it&#39;s not going to work</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.280" end="00:49:27.410" style="s2">so the boundaries need to become a bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.650" end="00:49:29.390" style="s2">more permeable but if a community gets</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.410" end="00:49:31.900" style="s2">infectious we need to be able to isolate</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.390" end="00:49:31.900" style="s2">them very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.750" end="00:49:43.580" style="s2">excellent Sara would you like to meet</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.190" end="00:49:46.540" style="s2">yourself and ask a question so in terms</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.580" end="00:49:49.760" style="s2">of the contact tracing or tracking apps</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.540" end="00:49:54.260" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering if you see any way to use</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.760" end="00:49:58.100" style="s2">that story and adjacent possible shifts</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.260" end="00:50:03.880" style="s2">to move toward I put an example in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.100" end="00:50:08.480" style="s2">chat of Nikki case presenting a type of</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.880" end="00:50:11.740" style="s2">app set up that does not centralize like</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.480" end="00:50:14.300" style="s2">personal info but he&#39;s was different</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.740" end="00:50:17.660" style="s2">I&#39;ve been having this fight for years I</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.300" end="00:50:19.310" style="s2">mean the biggest computing disaster in</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.660" end="00:50:21.290" style="s2">disaster in the history of government</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.310" end="00:50:24.290" style="s2">procurement worldwide and that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.290" end="00:50:27.350" style="s2">high bar was the British patient record</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.290" end="00:50:29.090" style="s2">system and the reason it was wrong is</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.350" end="00:50:30.650" style="s2">they actually created a centralized</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.090" end="00:50:32.840" style="s2">database which meant he was doomed to</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.650" end="00:50:34.850" style="s2">fail when I was on the IBM bid team for</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.840" end="00:50:37.160" style="s2">this and I recommended a non-compliant</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.850" end="00:50:39.830" style="s2">bid which meant they got thrown off the</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.160" end="00:50:41.240" style="s2">bid team that we wrote it anyway and we</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.830" end="00:50:43.750" style="s2">said what you should do is everybody</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.240" end="00:50:46.760" style="s2">should carry their record with them</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.750" end="00:50:48.530" style="s2">either on a credit card or an implanted</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.760" end="00:50:49.550" style="s2">chip or a physical record if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.530" end="00:50:51.770" style="s2">going to die in the next five years</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.550" end="00:50:54.350" style="s2">anyway why bother computerizing it and</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.770" end="00:50:57.080" style="s2">you invest in common reader technologies</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.350" end="00:50:59.060" style="s2">so you can actually your your the system</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.080" end="00:51:01.130" style="s2">is always up to date somewhere on where</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.060" end="00:51:02.630" style="s2">you are and that would have cost a small</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.130" end="00:51:05.030" style="s2">amount of money to implement and we</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.630" end="00:51:06.339" style="s2">actually did it in other countries the</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.030" end="00:51:07.930" style="s2">same I think is true here</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.339" end="00:51:10.059" style="s2">the trouble is the academics who</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.930" end="00:51:12.219" style="s2">designed this sort of stuff yeah are</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.059" end="00:51:14.319" style="s2">coming from a research perspective not a</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.219" end="00:51:16.150" style="s2">human perspective so they want</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.319" end="00:51:17.499" style="s2">everything in one place and so that they</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.150" end="00:51:19.569" style="s2">can do stuff and they&#39;re not they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.499" end="00:51:22.689" style="s2">being realistic about this because I</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.569" end="00:51:25.269" style="s2">think it needs 60 65 percent update to</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.689" end="00:51:27.039" style="s2">work and there&#39;s already a Civil</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.269" end="00:51:28.769" style="s2">Liberties campaign against it I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.039" end="00:51:31.359" style="s2">the best nudge ominous to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.769" end="00:51:34.660" style="s2">would be for Apple and Google to come</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.359" end="00:51:36.969" style="s2">together and create one because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.660" end="00:51:38.979" style="s2">both arguing for distributed stuff if</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.969" end="00:51:41.739" style="s2">Apple and Google created one and work</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.979" end="00:51:44.349" style="s2">with Facebook that would that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.739" end="00:51:46.509" style="s2">would use them and when I trust Apple on</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.349" end="00:51:48.519" style="s2">confidentiality I don&#39;t trust Google but</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.509" end="00:51:51.430" style="s2">I trust Apple all right as far as</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.519" end="00:51:53.049" style="s2">anybody can be trusted but every state</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.430" end="00:51:55.779" style="s2">is going down its own route which is</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.049" end="00:51:57.459" style="s2">coming like crazy and the states which</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.779" end="00:51:58.689" style="s2">are going down a centralized route you</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.459" end="00:52:02.339" style="s2">only have to look at some of their</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.689" end="00:52:02.339" style="s2">politics to see why they&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.670" end="00:52:07.089" style="s2">but if anybody&#39;s got contacts yet - tech</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.680" end="00:52:09.579" style="s2">giants to do it they could do it faster</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.089" end="00:52:11.079" style="s2">and better than any of the others and</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.579" end="00:52:15.039" style="s2">they could actually put social play</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.079" end="00:52:16.390" style="s2">around there as well great and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.039" end="00:52:18.279" style="s2">just gonna ask this question on behalf</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.390" end="00:52:21.069" style="s2">of Joe cuz I think it&#39;s an excellent one</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.279" end="00:52:22.809" style="s2">to end on what resource would you point</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.069" end="00:52:25.779" style="s2">to for people looking to learn about the</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.809" end="00:52:27.249" style="s2">absolute basics of complexity science do</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.779" end="00:52:31.420" style="s2">we start with math or computer science</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.249" end="00:52:33.459" style="s2">is there a textbook there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.420" end="00:52:36.009" style="s2">quite a good little box or all in going</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.459" end="00:52:37.689" style="s2">if that&#39;s a lot of rides me going you</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.009" end="00:52:42.099" style="s2">can read him if you write something in</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.689" end="00:52:46.359" style="s2">part there&#39;s a wonderful book by ELISA</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.099" end="00:52:48.459" style="s2">Guerrero but the first section is only</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.359" end="00:52:51.099" style="s2">for philosophers she solves the problem</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.459" end="00:52:52.569" style="s2">of when is a wink of not a blink which I</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.099" end="00:52:56.679" style="s2">spent the year of my life working on</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.569" end="00:52:58.890" style="s2">it&#39;s fascinating but the second part is</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.679" end="00:53:01.299" style="s2">brilliant - papers are very good I</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.890" end="00:53:03.579" style="s2">actually put a reading list up on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.299" end="00:53:06.069" style="s2">website so behind me if you can see</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.579" end="00:53:08.249" style="s2">apart from the you&#39;ll see in 20% of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.069" end="00:53:11.229" style="s2">Starbucks City my collection then</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.249" end="00:53:14.259" style="s2">there&#39;s another 10 meters of that around</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.229" end="00:53:17.219" style="s2">the other walls but that bookcase behind</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.259" end="00:53:19.539" style="s2">me has got the books I really wrote</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.219" end="00:53:20.410" style="s2">which includes some poetry and other</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.539" end="00:53:22.780" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.410" end="00:53:25.210" style="s2">so basically I got the zapper yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.780" end="00:53:27.190" style="s2">is boys with toys and I scan the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.210" end="00:53:30.370" style="s2">barcodes and everything in that bookcase</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.190" end="00:53:32.500" style="s2">and put it up on the web so there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.370" end="00:53:34.660" style="s2">a single book at the moment particularly</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.500" end="00:53:37.000" style="s2">on the yeah that&#39;s the right book bite</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.660" end="00:53:40.330" style="s2">but I wasn&#39;t going but that&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.000" end="00:53:42.430" style="s2">what we call computational complexity so</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.330" end="00:53:44.200" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a big divide at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.430" end="00:53:45.790" style="s2">moment this computational complexity</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.200" end="00:53:50.350" style="s2">which is Santa Fe and they&#39;ve gone down</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.790" end="00:53:52.680" style="s2">that route heavy yeah there&#39;s complexity</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.350" end="00:53:55.540" style="s2">as a metaphor which we all despise</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.680" end="00:53:57.760" style="s2">because that&#39;s just put in old wine into</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.540" end="00:54:00.850" style="s2">new wineskins it&#39;s the systems thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.760" end="00:54:04.000" style="s2">rebadging using our language meg weekly</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.850" end="00:54:06.310" style="s2">isn&#39;t particularly bad at that she uses</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.000" end="00:54:07.390" style="s2">the language of complexity but she still</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.310" end="00:54:09.340" style="s2">thinks she&#39;s in the cause of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.390" end="00:54:11.620" style="s2">universe right</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.340" end="00:54:13.630" style="s2">and then there&#39;s anthro complexity which</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.620" end="00:54:16.360" style="s2">basically says you know this is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.630" end="00:54:18.070" style="s2">transdisciplinary area and that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.360" end="00:54:19.720" style="s2">field and some of my colleagues and</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.070" end="00:54:21.730" style="s2">other people but the book hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.720" end="00:54:25.510" style="s2">written there yet complexity is still</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.730" end="00:54:29.410" style="s2">mainly articles yeah and when i&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.510" end="00:54:31.900" style="s2">whole bookshelf there i would say none</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.410" end="00:54:35.890" style="s2">of the popular books i&#39;ve read cause</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.900" end="00:54:38.140" style="s2">anything other than revulsion all right</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.890" end="00:54:39.940" style="s2">i mean they really are truly banned and</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.140" end="00:54:41.920" style="s2">the trouble is the academic books are</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.940" end="00:54:45.370" style="s2">really very very academic if they&#39;re any</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:47.650" style="s2">good it is possible to translate the two</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.370" end="00:54:49.420" style="s2">which I and others are working on the EU</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.650" end="00:54:51.910" style="s2">handbook on how to manage a crisis will</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.420" end="00:54:53.890" style="s2">be the first effort on that because</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.910" end="00:54:57.580" style="s2">ultimately confessed he&#39;s actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.890" end="00:55:00.070" style="s2">simple it&#39;s actually common sense the</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.580" end="00:55:03.220" style="s2">trouble is you&#39;ve got it and in three</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.070" end="00:55:05.470" style="s2">decades of uncommon sense which is</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.220" end="00:55:07.060" style="s2">polarized between what I call the New</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.470" end="00:55:09.970" style="s2">Age fluffy Bernie it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.060" end="00:55:10.870" style="s2">psychology and meditation and going um</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.970" end="00:55:15.730" style="s2">in the morning all right</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.870" end="00:55:17.800" style="s2">and the the rigid process guys yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.730" end="00:55:20.200" style="s2">everything is about process engineering</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.800" end="00:55:21.610" style="s2">definition and you can see that by</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.200" end="00:55:22.960" style="s2">cottony in business process</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.610" end="00:55:25.060" style="s2">reengineering against learning</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.960" end="00:55:28.030" style="s2">organization you know both of them own</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.060" end="00:55:30.990" style="s2">valid because both they&#39;re only looking</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.030" end="00:55:30.990" style="s2">at part of the solution</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.829" end="00:55:37.969" style="s2">excellent and we&#39;re gonna wrap up thank</p>
