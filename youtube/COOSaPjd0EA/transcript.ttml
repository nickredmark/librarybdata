<p begin="01:16:58.030" end="01:17:02.139" style="s2">now a group of psychoanalyst were going</p>

<p begin="01:18:34.840" end="01:18:38.739" style="s2">there could be a demand for status a</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.639" end="01:18:40.239" style="s2">demand for recognition there were things</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.739" end="01:18:42.429" style="s2">that people couldn&#39;t verbalize or</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.239" end="01:18:44.380" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t verbalize because they were too</p>

<p begin="01:18:44.380" end="01:18:48.250" style="s2">part of their nature and there were they</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.690" end="01:18:49.719" style="s2">would be embarrassed they would be</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.250" end="01:18:53.170" style="s2">embarrassed if they came out and said</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.719" end="01:18:57.880" style="s2">things like this he would interview</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.170" end="01:19:03.480" style="s2">people but not ask them direct questions</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.880" end="01:19:07.870" style="s2">but let them talk freely like you do in</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.480" end="01:19:11.230" style="s2">psychoanalysis and that was his</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.870" end="01:19:12.969" style="s2">background and so he said why can&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.230" end="01:19:18.130" style="s2">have a group therapy session about</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.969" end="01:19:21.040" style="s2">products all right and so Viktor built</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.130" end="01:19:22.840" style="s2">this room up above his garage and that</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.040" end="01:19:24.820" style="s2">he said we can have psychoanalysis of</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.840" end="01:19:27.400" style="s2">products they can actually act out and</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.820" end="01:19:29.770" style="s2">verbalize their wants and needs what</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.400" end="01:19:33.730" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do is try a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.770" end="01:19:36.810" style="s2">these salad dressings now let&#39;s see what</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.730" end="01:19:40.449" style="s2">happens there is our typical house why</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.810" end="01:19:42.610" style="s2">not empower the obstruction and they</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.449" end="01:19:44.409" style="s2">could be observed and watched and other</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.610" end="01:19:47.500" style="s2">people could comment and they could talk</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.409" end="01:19:49.150" style="s2">about it and everybody could join in he</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.500" end="01:19:50.710" style="s2">was the first to do this this was</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.150" end="01:19:53.290" style="s2">absolutely the first thing that was ever</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.710" end="01:19:54.840" style="s2">done and he had a movie projector up</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.290" end="01:19:56.860" style="s2">there where you could show</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.840" end="01:19:58.780" style="s2">advertisements and things like that and</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.860" end="01:20:01.060" style="s2">people could react to them and he</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.780" end="01:20:02.790" style="s2">invented the whole technique for mining</p>

<p begin="01:40:13.300" end="01:40:17.600" style="s2">the most notorious of these experiments</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.950" end="01:40:21.130" style="s2">was run by the head of the American</p>

<p begin="01:40:21.130" end="01:40:26.300" style="s2">like many psychiatrists at that time</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.720" end="01:40:28.250" style="s2">Cameron was convinced that inside human</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.300" end="01:40:31.160" style="s2">beings were dangerous forces which</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.250" end="01:40:32.840" style="s2">threatened society but he believed that</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.160" end="01:40:36.560" style="s2">it was possible not just to control</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.840" end="01:40:38.720" style="s2">these forces but actually remove them he</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.560" end="01:40:41.090" style="s2">thought that psychiatry should not just</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.720" end="01:40:43.760" style="s2">concentrate on sick people mentally ill</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.090" end="01:40:46.840" style="s2">but should actually go into government</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.760" end="01:40:49.100" style="s2">that politicians should listen to</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.840" end="01:40:51.890" style="s2">psychiatrist psychiatrist should be in</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.100" end="01:40:55.130" style="s2">every Parliament and should direct and</p>

<p begin="01:40:55.130" end="01:41:02.379" style="s2">they knew in a rational scientific way</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.660" end="01:41:04.479" style="s2">what was good for people</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.379" end="01:41:06.639" style="s2">cameron had set up a clinic in a</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.479" end="01:41:09.099" style="s2">hospital in montreal called the Alan</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.639" end="01:41:12.760" style="s2">memorial it is now long since closed</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.099" end="01:41:15.609" style="s2">down Cameron took patients who suffered</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.760" end="01:41:17.199" style="s2">a wide range of mental problems his</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.609" end="01:41:20.050" style="s2">theory was that these resulted from</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.199" end="01:41:21.550" style="s2">forgotten or repressed memories but he</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.050" end="01:41:25.059" style="s2">was impatient with the idea of using</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.550" end="01:41:26.429" style="s2">psychotherapy to uncover them instead he</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.059" end="01:41:29.769" style="s2">would simply wipe them</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.429" end="01:41:31.590" style="s2">Cameron used drugs including LSD and the</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.769" end="01:41:33.070" style="s2">technique of ECT electroconvulsive</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.590" end="01:41:35.320" style="s2">therapy</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.070" end="01:41:38.469" style="s2">it was conventionally used at that time</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.320" end="01:41:40.749" style="s2">to relieve depression but Cameron was</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.469" end="01:41:45.519" style="s2">going to use it in a new way to produce</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.749" end="01:41:51.309" style="s2">new people he was really using it to try</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.519" end="01:41:57.969" style="s2">and change the fundamental function of</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.309" end="01:42:02.679" style="s2">the individual to alter their past</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.969" end="01:42:06.159" style="s2">memories their past ways of behaving and</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.679" end="01:42:09.099" style="s2">as I think he said at one point is to</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.159" end="01:42:12.429" style="s2">just sort of erase everything from their</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.099" end="01:42:15.340" style="s2">past so that you then had a slate in</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.429" end="01:42:20.909" style="s2">which you could record new ways of</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.340" end="01:42:25.209" style="s2">behavior and so he used massive doses of</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.909" end="01:42:29.409" style="s2">shock people receiving several shots a</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.209" end="01:42:33.159" style="s2">day and over a course of course of time</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.409" end="01:42:36.489" style="s2">hundreds of ECT treatments so that they</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.159" end="01:42:41.139" style="s2">were just reduced to a sort of a very</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.489" end="01:42:43.989" style="s2">primitive vegetable state I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.139" end="01:42:45.669" style="s2">remember what happened to me I was</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.989" end="01:42:48.789" style="s2">introduced to dr. Cameron and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.669" end="01:42:51.189" style="s2">remember dr. Cameron at all I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:42:51.189" end="01:42:56.349" style="s2">to what they called the sleep room and</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.820" end="01:42:58.419" style="s2">they gave me all of these electro</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.349" end="01:43:01.749" style="s2">convulsive shock treatments and mega</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.419" end="01:43:04.379" style="s2">doses of drugs and LSD and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.749" end="01:43:08.320" style="s2">and I have no memory of any of that</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.379" end="01:43:11.379" style="s2">nothing in the of that time of the Allen</p>
