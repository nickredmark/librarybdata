<p begin="00:00:09.350" end="00:00:14.420" style="s2">that part of communicating who we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.690" end="00:00:18.890" style="s2">and who we are not is based on how we</p>

<p begin="00:02:41.549" end="00:02:45.269" style="s2">would love to hear a little bit about</p>

<p begin="00:02:45.269" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">are today and sort of how you got there</p>

<p begin="00:02:50.940" end="00:02:56.010" style="s2">online fashion style and masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.370" end="00:02:57.900" style="s2">expert cool so I&#39;ve got there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.010" end="00:02:59.400" style="s2">different threads that all kind of wove</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.900" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">together in order to make this happen</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.400" end="00:03:03.810" style="s2">and my appearance has been something</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.400" end="00:03:05.910" style="s2">that&#39;s been on my radar for a while</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.810" end="00:03:07.889" style="s2">especially when I was in the fourth</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.910" end="00:03:09.780" style="s2">grade my parents put me in my siblings</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.889" end="00:03:11.910" style="s2">into a private school we had to do like</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.780" end="00:03:13.410" style="s2">the uniforms and everything and nobody</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.910" end="00:03:14.670" style="s2">else in our neighborhood was wearing</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.410" end="00:03:17.430" style="s2">uniforms and so I remember getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.670" end="00:03:18.660" style="s2">severely picked on by my furniture in</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.430" end="00:03:21.600" style="s2">the neighborhood or anything and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.660" end="00:03:23.340" style="s2">then not only that but then it escalated</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.600" end="00:03:25.170" style="s2">when I was at a junior high level that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.340" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">was very much involved in like the BMX</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.170" end="00:03:28.900" style="s2">and the punk rock and the skate scene so</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:30.579" style="s2">like the antithesis</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.900" end="00:03:32.799" style="s2">like the the public or the private</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.579" end="00:03:34.870" style="s2">school uniform and I hated praise and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.799" end="00:03:37.060" style="s2">all this kind of stuff and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.870" end="00:03:38.980" style="s2">this crazy dissonance for me that I had</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.060" end="00:03:40.780" style="s2">to dress one way and my identity was</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.980" end="00:03:42.280" style="s2">routed entirely in a different aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.780" end="00:03:45.579" style="s2">and all these other ideals and all this</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.280" end="00:03:48.849" style="s2">kind of stuff very early on I became</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.579" end="00:03:51.159" style="s2">kind of hyper aware of the need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.849" end="00:03:52.959" style="s2">outwardly project who you are inwardly</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.159" end="00:03:55.659" style="s2">and that there needs to be some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.959" end="00:03:57.340" style="s2">consistency and congruence there well</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.659" end="00:03:59.680" style="s2">you know that&#39;s something that I see</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.340" end="00:04:01.690" style="s2">happening with my teenage daughter okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.680" end="00:04:03.579" style="s2">you know she&#39;s starting to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.690" end="00:04:05.980" style="s2">figure out who she is on the inside and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.579" end="00:04:07.780" style="s2">then she&#39;s starting to project it to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.980" end="00:04:10.060" style="s2">outside and you know she&#39;s 13 she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.780" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">thirteen and a half and up until just</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.060" end="00:04:14.980" style="s2">maybe six or eight months ago she was</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:17.440" style="s2">content wearing just like a leftover</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.980" end="00:04:20.949" style="s2">elementary school participation day</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.440" end="00:04:22.870" style="s2">t-shirt yeah some middle schools right</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.949" end="00:04:24.460" style="s2">right like she didn&#39;t she didn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.870" end="00:04:27.009" style="s2">care she&#39;s just like it&#39;s something to</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.460" end="00:04:28.780" style="s2">put on my back but right now I can see</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.009" end="00:04:30.490" style="s2">when she&#39;s starting to develop her own</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.780" end="00:04:33.970" style="s2">personal identity and she&#39;s starting to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.490" end="00:04:36.130" style="s2">see how her outward appearance also sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.970" end="00:04:38.050" style="s2">of connects to that so yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.130" end="00:04:39.970" style="s2">that&#39;s a very relatable story there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.050" end="00:04:41.110" style="s2">one especially I mean anybody can think</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.970" end="00:04:42.970" style="s2">back to where they were in high school</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.110" end="00:04:44.680" style="s2">especially as a teenager when your</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.970" end="00:04:46.000" style="s2">identity is really forming and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.680" end="00:04:47.260" style="s2">something that is finally separate from</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.000" end="00:04:48.760" style="s2">your parents and your family but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.260" end="00:04:51.520" style="s2">who you are as an individual based on</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.760" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">your peers and your friends and high</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.520" end="00:04:55.090" style="s2">school is one of those times where</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:57.130" style="s2">everybody dresses very differently</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.090" end="00:04:59.349" style="s2">because of their identity and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.130" end="00:05:01.210" style="s2">very intentionally little overlaps so</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.349" end="00:05:02.740" style="s2">that you know the stoners that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.210" end="00:05:04.659" style="s2">different from the jocks are different</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.740" end="00:05:06.669" style="s2">from the mathletes who are different</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.659" end="00:05:08.260" style="s2">from the choir kids and if they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.669" end="00:05:10.060" style="s2">different as sexes because of those very</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.260" end="00:05:12.099" style="s2">niche tribes that everybody is involved</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.060" end="00:05:14.409" style="s2">with and so on a primal level we</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.099" end="00:05:16.990" style="s2">understand that part of communicating</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.409" end="00:05:20.229" style="s2">who we are and who we are not is based</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.990" end="00:05:21.970" style="s2">on how we are we dress ourselves brave</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.229" end="00:05:23.680" style="s2">fascinating so continued Kenny Owens</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.970" end="00:05:26.169" style="s2">continue on tell me some more I were at</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.680" end="00:05:27.639" style="s2">the BMX punk rock right oh crap now</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.169" end="00:05:31.300" style="s2">obviously as I get a little bit older</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.639" end="00:05:33.430" style="s2">those though that identity stops</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.300" end="00:05:35.440" style="s2">becoming my main and primary identity</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.430" end="00:05:37.389" style="s2">you know and I was I was working at a</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.440" end="00:05:39.039" style="s2">bank doing loans and it started to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.389" end="00:05:40.840" style="s2">affect my credibility that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.039" end="00:05:42.850" style="s2">you know young early 20s kid who looks</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.840" end="00:05:45.850" style="s2">like he&#39;s you know still like long</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.850" end="00:05:47.620" style="s2">be hair and really baggy stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.850" end="00:05:49.180" style="s2">wearing my belt sideways trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.620" end="00:05:50.680" style="s2">different and unique this way and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.180" end="00:05:52.330" style="s2">affected my ability to actually make</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.680" end="00:05:54.400" style="s2">some progress and so I started to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.330" end="00:05:56.470" style="s2">realize it&#39;s like ah I got a dress like</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.400" end="00:05:58.090" style="s2">an adult you know on the way is there an</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.470" end="00:05:59.770" style="s2">interesting way to be able to do this</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.090" end="00:06:01.450" style="s2">and so I started to experiment with</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.770" end="00:06:04.330" style="s2">better suiting and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.450" end="00:06:05.710" style="s2">well ventually it turned into writing a</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.330" end="00:06:07.780" style="s2">blog especially because what I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.710" end="00:06:09.570" style="s2">studying at the time was broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.780" end="00:06:11.950" style="s2">journalism I wanted to do talk radio</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.570" end="00:06:14.830" style="s2">honestly if I kind of look back on it my</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.950" end="00:06:16.330" style="s2">aspiration was to be like the young more</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.830" end="00:06:18.340" style="s2">libertarian version of somebody like</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.330" end="00:06:19.930" style="s2">Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.340" end="00:06:22.210" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s not like old dead</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.930" end="00:06:24.130" style="s2">conservative type guy but I very much</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.210" end="00:06:25.990" style="s2">enjoy radio and communications and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.130" end="00:06:27.880" style="s2">kind of stuff and so I had written</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.990" end="00:06:29.530" style="s2">political blogs I got sick and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.880" end="00:06:31.330" style="s2">know how you do it man I got sick</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.530" end="00:06:32.710" style="s2">writing about political stuff and kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.330" end="00:06:34.150" style="s2">of the heaviness of that all the time</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.710" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">and we&#39;re here talking about fashion</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.150" end="00:06:38.920" style="s2">today right that&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:40.270" style="s2">transition that I made it&#39;s like well I</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.920" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">need to keep writing I need to keep my</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.270" end="00:06:44.860" style="s2">boy sharp and so let&#39;s let&#39;s write about</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:47.050" style="s2">something else that I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.860" end="00:06:50.520" style="s2">and masculine style the site started</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.050" end="00:06:55.990" style="s2">from that what year was that that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.520" end="00:06:57.730" style="s2">2010 I think 2009 2010 and so it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.990" end="00:06:59.110" style="s2">just a good kind of like side hobby for</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.730" end="00:07:01.810" style="s2">a little while and then it first turned</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.110" end="00:07:03.130" style="s2">into a job when I was having trouble</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.810" end="00:07:05.350" style="s2">finding something that was really good</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.130" end="00:07:07.030" style="s2">as far as a career and my wife was</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.350" end="00:07:09.400" style="s2">pregnant with our with our oldest with</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.030" end="00:07:10.630" style="s2">her daughter and we both knew that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.400" end="00:07:12.400" style="s2">wanted her to be able to stay home</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.630" end="00:07:14.110" style="s2">full-time and be a full-time mom and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.400" end="00:07:16.240" style="s2">I had to step up my game as far as being</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.110" end="00:07:17.950" style="s2">able to provide and I&#39;d recognized that</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.240" end="00:07:19.540" style="s2">I was answering emails again and again</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.950" end="00:07:21.100" style="s2">and again answering the same questions</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.540" end="00:07:22.660" style="s2">from all these readers and so I thought</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.100" end="00:07:25.060" style="s2">well maybe I could turn this into a</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.660" end="00:07:27.850" style="s2">business and a side hustle and so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.060" end="00:07:29.890" style="s2">started doing some very like low-level</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.850" end="00:07:32.110" style="s2">kind of now I look back at embarrassing</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.890" end="00:07:34.600" style="s2">types of coaching very basic stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.110" end="00:07:35.800" style="s2">it it started to turn into something and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.600" end="00:07:38.200" style="s2">then from there I was able to leverage</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.800" end="00:07:39.760" style="s2">that into a position with the custom</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.200" end="00:07:41.980" style="s2">suit company that I worked for them for</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.760" end="00:07:43.390" style="s2">four years not only in the shop doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.980" end="00:07:45.670" style="s2">measurements and getting really detailed</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.390" end="00:07:47.380" style="s2">but also overseeing their out their</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.670" end="00:07:48.880" style="s2">operations and being involved with</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.380" end="00:07:50.590" style="s2">design and stuff like that so I got a</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.880" end="00:07:52.660" style="s2">lot of kind of the technical background</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.590" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">with everything to you and then about</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.660" end="00:07:55.580" style="s2">two years ago it&#39;ll be two years in</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:58.940" style="s2">March that I finally made the job</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.580" end="00:08:01.100" style="s2">this is now full-time that&#39;s incredible</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.940" end="00:08:02.360" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of good little nuggets</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.100" end="00:08:04.430" style="s2">in there I mean the first one is just</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.360" end="00:08:06.050" style="s2">get started right right like if you if</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.430" end="00:08:07.550" style="s2">you sitting around waiting for something</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.050" end="00:08:09.500" style="s2">to be perfect all the time you&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.550" end="00:08:11.960" style="s2">gonna you never gonna take any progress</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.500" end="00:08:16.520" style="s2">no you got to do the action it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.960" end="00:08:17.750" style="s2">ready fire aim philosophy I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.520" end="00:08:20.330" style="s2">I&#39;m sort of taking that approach here</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.750" end="00:08:22.400" style="s2">with the podcast I mean like every every</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.330" end="00:08:24.140" style="s2">time I do one I try to like improve the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.400" end="00:08:25.550" style="s2">technical elements of it maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.140" end="00:08:28.010" style="s2">editing is better it may be the sound is</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.550" end="00:08:30.050" style="s2">better maybe the music intro was better</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.010" end="00:08:32.210" style="s2">you know maybe there&#39;s a cut or you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.050" end="00:08:33.520" style="s2">you know who knows like but the first</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.210" end="00:08:35.900" style="s2">one I was like I&#39;ll just get this thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.520" end="00:08:38.240" style="s2">out the door you should be able to look</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.900" end="00:08:40.070" style="s2">back in a year and kind of cringe at</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.240" end="00:08:41.600" style="s2">what you were producing now because that</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.070" end="00:08:43.190" style="s2">means that you&#39;re actually you took</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.600" end="00:08:45.440" style="s2">action at the right time and you started</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.190" end="00:08:47.840" style="s2">to make progress right right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.440" end="00:08:49.820" style="s2">and that&#39;s clearly what you did and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.840" end="00:08:52.940" style="s2">you&#39;ve parlayed that into an actual real</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.820" end="00:08:55.460" style="s2">world job and so just a curiosity like I</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.940" end="00:08:58.550" style="s2">have gotten a few custom suits made but</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.460" end="00:09:00.470" style="s2">not not was like a tailor like with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.550" end="00:09:01.850" style="s2">full measurements like I did it with one</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.470" end="00:09:04.880" style="s2">of these were you getting this like pod</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.850" end="00:09:06.230" style="s2">thing oh and it like scans your body and</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.880" end="00:09:07.430" style="s2">then they sent it off to Thailand and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.230" end="00:09:08.900" style="s2">then it comes back and it&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.430" end="00:09:10.250" style="s2">screwed up and it right really working</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.900" end="00:09:12.380" style="s2">we didn&#39;t really work out that well what</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.250" end="00:09:14.450" style="s2">just out of for curiosity&#39;s sake what</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.380" end="00:09:16.460" style="s2">kind of system was the custom suits that</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.450" end="00:09:18.680" style="s2">you were doing was that like tailor and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.460" end="00:09:20.540" style="s2">shop like live thing or what so we were</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.680" end="00:09:22.670" style="s2">doing a more advanced version of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.540" end="00:09:24.500" style="s2">made-to-measure where we would use try</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.670" end="00:09:26.030" style="s2">on garments and then we would kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.500" end="00:09:27.410" style="s2">work backwards from there so we would</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.030" end="00:09:29.810" style="s2">take full-body measurements but then</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.410" end="00:09:31.310" style="s2">we&#39;d use these these fit samples and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.810" end="00:09:33.230" style="s2">big advantage for that is something that</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.310" end="00:09:34.730" style="s2">you actually experience because if all</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.230" end="00:09:36.230" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is taking measurements</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.730" end="00:09:37.910" style="s2">measurements are great for getting</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.230" end="00:09:39.860" style="s2">lengths and forgetting circumference</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.910" end="00:09:41.810" style="s2">--is but they can&#39;t get things like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.860" end="00:09:43.250" style="s2">slope of your shoulders or the angle at</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.810" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">which your arms hang or what your</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.250" end="00:09:46.730" style="s2">posture is like or all these other</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.720" end="00:09:48.800" style="s2">variables that are really crucial in</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.730" end="00:09:50.060" style="s2">getting a solid fit on something and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.800" end="00:09:51.320" style="s2">tape measure isn&#39;t going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.060" end="00:09:53.300" style="s2">tell you that whereas if you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.320" end="00:09:55.580" style="s2">something that&#39;s either pre-built or you</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.300" end="00:09:57.410" style="s2">go the full like bespoke where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.580" end="00:09:58.910" style="s2">actually building the garment on you in</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.410" end="00:10:00.290" style="s2">there multiple for multiple fittings</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.910" end="00:10:02.000" style="s2">doing it multiple times that&#39;s when you</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.290" end="00:10:04.580" style="s2">can account for all those other details</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.000" end="00:10:07.190" style="s2">oh nice well no wonder it didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.580" end="00:10:08.330" style="s2">work they&#39;re built like yours you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.190" end="00:10:09.860" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.330" end="00:10:11.330" style="s2">you&#39;ve got definition and you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.860" end="00:10:12.680" style="s2">based on your size and all these other</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.330" end="00:10:14.690" style="s2">variables and so the measurements are</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.680" end="00:10:16.520" style="s2">only telling like a third of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.690" end="00:10:17.870" style="s2">story and so yeah it&#39;s not gonna it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.520" end="00:10:19.190" style="s2">not gonna hang on you very well it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.870" end="00:10:20.750" style="s2">gonna look as flattering as it could be</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.190" end="00:10:23.000" style="s2">when you can account for all those other</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.750" end="00:10:24.980" style="s2">details right and I was getting to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.000" end="00:10:27.680" style="s2">point where like the drop from my chest</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.980" end="00:10:29.930" style="s2">to my waist size was it was just like</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.680" end="00:10:31.130" style="s2">right at that point where like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.930" end="00:10:33.920" style="s2">jacket and the pants</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.130" end="00:10:35.180" style="s2">there was just no no way to tailor right</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.920" end="00:10:37.190" style="s2">with him I was gonna have to start doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.180" end="00:10:39.110" style="s2">like mix and matches or whatnot but</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.190" end="00:10:43.730" style="s2">luckily I&#39;ve gotten a little fatter</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.110" end="00:10:46.730" style="s2">since then so so problem solved probably</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.730" end="00:10:48.890" style="s2">good there&#39;s like a standard drop I</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.730" end="00:10:50.510" style="s2">guess between a Oh for industry standard</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.890" end="00:10:52.340" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what it wasn&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.510" end="00:10:53.900" style="s2">what it was but like it the way that</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.340" end="00:10:55.850" style="s2">they make it so that when you buy when</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.900" end="00:10:57.350" style="s2">you pick out a jacket that the pants are</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.850" end="00:10:59.510" style="s2">like somewhere with the right realm of</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.350" end="00:11:01.490" style="s2">tailor ability there&#39;s like a standard</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.510" end="00:11:03.680" style="s2">drop between your chest measurement and</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.490" end="00:11:05.300" style="s2">your waist measurement and like big</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.680" end="00:11:06.590" style="s2">bodybuilders I imagine like Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.300" end="00:11:08.300" style="s2">Cortez he&#39;s not necessarily a</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.590" end="00:11:09.680" style="s2">bodybuilder but he&#39;s got a pretty pretty</p>

<p begin="00:12:10.910" end="00:12:16.160" style="s2">sources of revenue with it</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.500" end="00:12:18.110" style="s2">the main one is I do private one-on-one</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.160" end="00:12:19.670" style="s2">coaching and I&#39;ll work with guys I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.110" end="00:12:20.490" style="s2">run them through like a seven step</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.670" end="00:12:22.500" style="s2">program</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.490" end="00:12:24.149" style="s2">and depending on how much they want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.500" end="00:12:26.010" style="s2">spend and how much help they need for me</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.149" end="00:12:27.870" style="s2">most of my guys end up doing it just</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.010" end="00:12:29.010" style="s2">virtually where we do video calls and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.870" end="00:12:30.330" style="s2">kind of help them through we come up</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.010" end="00:12:32.100" style="s2">with a game plan and do stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.330" end="00:12:34.290" style="s2">together but I do have other guys who</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.100" end="00:12:36.060" style="s2">will fly out to me or even fly I&#39;ll fly</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.290" end="00:12:37.860" style="s2">out to them and we&#39;ll go out and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.060" end="00:12:38.970" style="s2">do you know I&#39;ll go through their closet</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.860" end="00:12:40.110" style="s2">with them and then we&#39;ll go through the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.970" end="00:12:41.670" style="s2">full program and then I&#39;ll come out</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.110" end="00:12:42.750" style="s2">again and we&#39;ll do a day of shopping and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.670" end="00:12:44.100" style="s2">then I&#39;ll come out of third time and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.750" end="00:12:45.899" style="s2">we&#39;ll do another day of shopping six</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.100" end="00:12:48.360" style="s2">months later or something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.899" end="00:12:50.040" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of the main bread and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.360" end="00:12:52.230" style="s2">butter and for me that&#39;s not only the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.040" end="00:12:54.029" style="s2">most enjoyable from obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.230" end="00:12:56.160" style="s2">financial component of it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.029" end="00:12:57.480" style="s2">high ticket but the biggest thing that</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.160" end="00:12:59.190" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned over the years of doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.480" end="00:13:00.330" style="s2">this especially you know being able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.190" end="00:13:04.260" style="s2">kind of just geek out about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.330" end="00:13:06.209" style="s2">e-commerce level of it is man going high</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.260" end="00:13:08.700" style="s2">ticket just the caliber of the guys that</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.209" end="00:13:11.100" style="s2">you work with is fantastic because I</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.700" end="00:13:12.690" style="s2">have some real skin in the game and they</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.100" end="00:13:13.980" style="s2">also are usually at a point in their</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.690" end="00:13:15.990" style="s2">lives and in their careers where they</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.980" end="00:13:17.730" style="s2">actually have the mental capacity to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.990" end="00:13:21.149" style="s2">able to actually invest in making some</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.730" end="00:13:22.140" style="s2">progress and so if I bumping up from you</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.149" end="00:13:24.779" style="s2">know when I first started it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.140" end="00:13:26.700" style="s2">literally 25 bucks and ten percent of</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.779" end="00:13:29.670" style="s2">whatever you told me your budget was and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.700" end="00:13:31.290" style="s2">I would come up with like ten items for</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.670" end="00:13:32.490" style="s2">you to go bond it hated it because it</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.290" end="00:13:34.380" style="s2">was so mundane and they didn&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.490" end="00:13:36.630" style="s2">if the guys liked the stuff and and now</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.380" end="00:13:38.459" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s anywhere from four to</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.630" end="00:13:40.410" style="s2">twenty thousand dollars to work with me</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.459" end="00:13:41.700" style="s2">one-on-one with these guys and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.410" end="00:13:44.010" style="s2">caliber that I get with them is</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.700" end="00:13:45.270" style="s2">fantastic right I must be very</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.010" end="00:13:47.490" style="s2">fulfilling but at the same time I mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.270" end="00:13:49.829" style="s2">from what I understand there&#39;s also like</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.490" end="00:13:51.510" style="s2">easier access points absolute system</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.829" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2">absolutely that&#39;s the main bread and</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.510" end="00:13:54.450" style="s2">butter but I do have other ways to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:57.750" style="s2">able to get in the most basic one is I</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.450" end="00:14:00.300" style="s2">assure a book last year and what&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.750" end="00:14:01.860" style="s2">is that the book itself outlines every</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.300" end="00:14:05.130" style="s2">Sunday my book so the book is called the</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.860" end="00:14:06.570" style="s2">appearance of power and it&#39;s it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.130" end="00:14:07.920" style="s2">of a two-part thing the first thing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.570" end="00:14:10.050" style="s2">it does is they I go through and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.920" end="00:14:13.170" style="s2">demonstrate why men have always cared</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.050" end="00:14:16.050" style="s2">about how the way we look and how we use</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.170" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">our our appearance actually demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.050" end="00:14:19.890" style="s2">in communicate our masculinity so I use</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:21.450" style="s2">historic examples and we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.890" end="00:14:22.589" style="s2">things like you know I know we&#39;ll get a</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.450" end="00:14:24.420" style="s2">little bit deeper into this later we</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.589" end="00:14:25.920" style="s2">talked about archetypes and kind of all</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.420" end="00:14:28.020" style="s2">these different variables of how our</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.920" end="00:14:29.579" style="s2">appearance is actually really reflective</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.020" end="00:14:31.350" style="s2">of what I masculinity is especially if</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.579" end="00:14:32.820" style="s2">we do it right but then in the latter</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.350" end="00:14:33.990" style="s2">half of the book I actually walked the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.820" end="00:14:35.490" style="s2">reader through that if</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.990" end="00:14:37.470" style="s2">strategies that I take my one-on-one</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.490" end="00:14:39.690" style="s2">guys through or even the guys in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.470" end="00:14:41.279" style="s2">my other different courses through to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.690" end="00:14:42.990" style="s2">able to help them come up with an idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.279" end="00:14:45.180" style="s2">of what should I actually be buying</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.990" end="00:14:47.490" style="s2">because a suit is not the best option</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.180" end="00:14:49.020" style="s2">for everybody it may be the great option</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.490" end="00:14:50.459" style="s2">for some guys but if you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.020" end="00:14:52.560" style="s2">blue-collar environment or you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.459" end="00:14:53.910" style="s2">tech industry or something else like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.560" end="00:14:55.800" style="s2">suits not gonna do you any good</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.910" end="00:14:57.450" style="s2">regardless of what some fashion blogger</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.800" end="00:14:59.010" style="s2">or youtuber is gonna say that you have</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.450" end="00:15:01.740" style="s2">to have a suit in order to be stylish</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.010" end="00:15:05.459" style="s2">right right well you know for me I</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.740" end="00:15:07.709" style="s2">remember suits were aspirational in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.459" end="00:15:10.230" style="s2">sense that when I was an entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.709" end="00:15:12.570" style="s2">and I still am but I was like full-time</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.230" end="00:15:14.459" style="s2">entrepreneur real estate developer and</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.570" end="00:15:17.670" style="s2">we did all these all this work and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.459" end="00:15:19.890" style="s2">remember I put on a suit so I felt like</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.670" end="00:15:22.020" style="s2">I could fit in so that people would</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.890" end="00:15:23.580" style="s2">people would take me seriously like when</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.020" end="00:15:26.420" style="s2">I went to the bank or when I met with</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.580" end="00:15:29.070" style="s2">investors or city officials or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.420" end="00:15:32.790" style="s2">and I remember that putting on a suit</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.070" end="00:15:35.670" style="s2">was like my way of displaying a level of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.790" end="00:15:39.000" style="s2">status but then but then I realized</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.670" end="00:15:41.250" style="s2">later that I looked at I went to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.000" end="00:15:43.770" style="s2">meeting once with this guy and a guy who</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.250" end="00:15:45.570" style="s2">was my partner on a project and he was</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.770" end="00:15:48.360" style="s2">older than me and more successful than</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.570" end="00:15:50.940" style="s2">me at the time and I we were sitting</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.360" end="00:15:53.670" style="s2">around at the the boardroom table with</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.940" end="00:15:55.709" style="s2">like the bankers the lawyers the you</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.670" end="00:15:57.300" style="s2">know the accountants and the like</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.709" end="00:15:59.970" style="s2">construction professional types and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.300" end="00:16:02.459" style="s2">everybody was in his suit but him okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.970" end="00:16:04.589" style="s2">right and I looked I was looking to him</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.459" end="00:16:05.970" style="s2">and he was wearing jeans and like a polo</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.589" end="00:16:08.579" style="s2">and a jean shirt like he didn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.970" end="00:16:09.959" style="s2">good right he was totally relaxed and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.579" end="00:16:12.360" style="s2">totally calm and totally cashed out</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.959" end="00:16:14.250" style="s2">because you&#39;re there&#39;s like a spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.360" end="00:16:15.720" style="s2">too it&#39;s like you put on a suit so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.250" end="00:16:17.370" style="s2">you feel like you have status so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.720" end="00:16:19.320" style="s2">you get accepted but then once you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.370" end="00:16:21.089" style="s2">the status and then you get accomplished</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.320" end="00:16:23.250" style="s2">and then you can sort of peel start to</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.089" end="00:16:26.010" style="s2">peel yourself back to see where you were</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.250" end="00:16:27.510" style="s2">and like the in the most powerful guy in</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.010" end="00:16:29.250" style="s2">the room isn&#39;t always the guy in the</p>

<p begin="00:16:29.250" end="00:16:34.470" style="s2">wearing a pair of jeans and that opened</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.920" end="00:16:38.040" style="s2">my eyes to like all the varying levels</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.470" end="00:16:39.510" style="s2">of signaling and the reputation and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.040" end="00:16:42.120" style="s2">image and the energy that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.510" end="00:16:44.490" style="s2">put out by by your clothing and so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.120" end="00:16:46.320" style="s2">know that sort of brings us to one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.490" end="00:16:46.860" style="s2">the questions that I have for you right</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.320" end="00:16:49.320" style="s2">off the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.860" end="00:16:52.410" style="s2">which is like how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.320" end="00:16:55.470" style="s2">approach a new a new client or a new</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.410" end="00:16:58.170" style="s2">experience like and what what are those</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.470" end="00:17:00.660" style="s2">guys really looking for when they come</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.170" end="00:17:03.150" style="s2">to you because you&#39;re solving this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.660" end="00:17:05.640" style="s2">not just about finding the right belt to</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.150" end="00:17:10.320" style="s2">go with your shoes right this is about</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.640" end="00:17:12.150" style="s2">answering sort of a deep question for</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.320" end="00:17:14.460" style="s2">people right exactly answering an urge</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.150" end="00:17:15.930" style="s2">for them so so tell me what what do</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.460" end="00:17:17.910" style="s2">people come to you with and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.930" end="00:17:19.560" style="s2">get them started and how do you get them</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.910" end="00:17:21.000" style="s2">along this journey and we&#39;re gonna dig</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.560" end="00:17:22.590" style="s2">into the various elements here cuz I</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.000" end="00:17:24.360" style="s2">find this stuff really fascinating I</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.590" end="00:17:26.100" style="s2">think one of the funnest things and one</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.360" end="00:17:29.850" style="s2">of the biggest challenges for me is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.100" end="00:17:32.400" style="s2">even before a guy recognizes that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.850" end="00:17:34.770" style="s2">offer a service that he&#39;s interested in</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.400" end="00:17:37.050" style="s2">unlike a lot of businesses where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.770" end="00:17:38.340" style="s2">their potential clients or customers are</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.050" end="00:17:40.410" style="s2">kind of thirsty for what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.340" end="00:17:42.810" style="s2">offering I feel like the majority of my</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.410" end="00:17:45.630" style="s2">marketing is helping guys understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.810" end="00:17:47.550" style="s2">that this stuff even matters okay right</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.630" end="00:17:49.680" style="s2">helping them even understand that oh I</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.550" end="00:17:51.120" style="s2">should be thinking about this and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.680" end="00:17:53.190" style="s2">when they do start thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:54.450" style="s2">then it&#39;s helping them avoid a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.190" end="00:17:55.980" style="s2">the same problems kind of the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.450" end="00:17:57.690" style="s2">you experience and thankfully a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.980" end="00:17:58.890" style="s2">guys they do that whether it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.690" end="00:18:00.900" style="s2">when you make the transition from</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.890" end="00:18:02.550" style="s2">college and your first career or you</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.900" end="00:18:03.780" style="s2">make some other major change in your</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.550" end="00:18:07.260" style="s2">life you go from one industry to another</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.780" end="00:18:09.090" style="s2">and the dress code changes most of us</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.260" end="00:18:10.470" style="s2">have made that that transition and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.090" end="00:18:12.510" style="s2">kind of flounder in there for a little</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.470" end="00:18:13.740" style="s2">bit and so we kind of recognize like I</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.510" end="00:18:15.690" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to do here at this</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.740" end="00:18:17.280" style="s2">matters I hate that this matters it</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.690" end="00:18:18.660" style="s2">sucks my dad didn&#39;t teach me how to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.280" end="00:18:20.010" style="s2">this nobody else is really helping me</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.660" end="00:18:23.010" style="s2">out I&#39;m just gonna try and not embarrass</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.010" end="00:18:24.720" style="s2">myself right and that&#39;s a that&#39;s a key</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.010" end="00:18:26.280" style="s2">you brought up a key thing that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.720" end="00:18:27.780" style="s2">people are facing right now which is my</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.280" end="00:18:30.750" style="s2">dad my dad never taught me how to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.780" end="00:18:32.160" style="s2">this right especially because what the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.750" end="00:18:36.570" style="s2">thing that&#39;s so funny to me about all of</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.160" end="00:18:38.580" style="s2">this is that at any point in history men</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.570" end="00:18:40.410" style="s2">at really in any culture we have used</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.580" end="00:18:42.360" style="s2">appearance to signal things like status</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.410" end="00:18:43.770" style="s2">like mastery courage bravery honor all</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.360" end="00:18:45.900" style="s2">these other things that very much matter</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.770" end="00:18:47.460" style="s2">to us as men and particularly how we</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.900" end="00:18:49.380" style="s2">relate to each other as men that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.460" end="00:18:50.580" style="s2">another kind of fallacy as a lot of guys</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.380" end="00:18:52.770" style="s2">think that the only reason that they</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.580" end="00:18:54.720" style="s2">should be caring about their style is</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.770" end="00:18:56.580" style="s2">because of how women relate to it but</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.720" end="00:18:58.890" style="s2">that&#39;s secondary that&#39;s an easy thing to</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.580" end="00:19:00.390" style="s2">pick up on it&#39;s how we as men relate to</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.890" end="00:19:02.220" style="s2">each other because of things like</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.390" end="00:19:04.380" style="s2">and hierarchy and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.220" end="00:19:05.520" style="s2">but then the baby boomers who ruined</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.380" end="00:19:07.830" style="s2">everything anyway</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.520" end="00:19:10.260" style="s2">right now part of the the sexual</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.830" end="00:19:11.400" style="s2">revolution yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.260" end="00:19:13.830" style="s2">my parents are great they&#39;re baby</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.400" end="00:19:17.460" style="s2">boomers and they know that I knock on</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.830" end="00:19:18.960" style="s2">that generation all the time but one of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.460" end="00:19:21.390" style="s2">the things that they did is they decided</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.960" end="00:19:24.810" style="s2">that as a way to reject everything about</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.390" end="00:19:26.250" style="s2">the way the world was was that they were</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.810" end="00:19:28.770" style="s2">not going to care about the way that</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.250" end="00:19:30.990" style="s2">they looked but ironically there was a</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.770" end="00:19:32.970" style="s2">very specific aesthetic when it came</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.990" end="00:19:35.610" style="s2">right caring about the way that you look</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.970" end="00:19:38.370" style="s2">and so there&#39;s this this fault signaling</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.610" end="00:19:39.690" style="s2">of I don&#39;t care but I also look like</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.370" end="00:19:41.280" style="s2">everybody else who doesn&#39;t care which</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.690" end="00:19:43.230" style="s2">really means that I do care but the only</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.280" end="00:19:45.780" style="s2">acceptable way to care is an antipathy</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.230" end="00:19:48.030" style="s2">for style as opposed to an affinity for</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.780" end="00:19:49.770" style="s2">it or an embrace of it and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.030" end="00:19:51.630" style="s2">generationally it just gets passed down</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.770" end="00:19:53.070" style="s2">where your dad says I don&#39;t care I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.630" end="00:19:54.630" style="s2">just wear jeans and a polo because</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.070" end="00:19:55.890" style="s2">that&#39;s what I can get away with wearing</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.630" end="00:19:57.660" style="s2">at work because that&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.890" end="00:19:59.190" style="s2">comfortable you figure it out on your</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.660" end="00:20:02.090" style="s2">own right</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.190" end="00:20:06.450" style="s2">one of the more memorable Seinfeld Clips</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.090" end="00:20:09.750" style="s2">was him talking about how men older men</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.450" end="00:20:11.850" style="s2">would they wear the same clothes that</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.750" end="00:20:14.430" style="s2">they wore the last time their life was</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.850" end="00:20:15.870" style="s2">like at its peak and like that it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.430" end="00:20:17.460" style="s2">like their best time it was their best</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.870" end="00:20:18.990" style="s2">experience that&#39;s how they remember</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.460" end="00:20:20.700" style="s2">their like favorite version of</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.990" end="00:20:22.080" style="s2">themselves yes and then that&#39;s and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.700" end="00:20:24.030" style="s2">that&#39;s what they wear for the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.080" end="00:20:26.400" style="s2">their life it&#39;s aesthetic inertia you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.030" end="00:20:28.020" style="s2">you&#39;re trapped in this stage and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.400" end="00:20:29.790" style="s2">it and you could see that you could see</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.020" end="00:20:32.340" style="s2">guys who peaked in the 90s and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.790" end="00:20:36.060" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry that the best stage of your</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.340" end="00:20:38.940" style="s2">life was 25 years ago that sucks man</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.060" end="00:20:40.760" style="s2">that the 90s are almost 30 almost 30</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.940" end="00:20:44.610" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.760" end="00:20:46.140" style="s2">you know I&#39;m 42 I&#39;m a gen Xer for sure I</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.610" end="00:20:47.790" style="s2">don&#39;t know I&#39;m not sure how old you are</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.140" end="00:20:50.790" style="s2">your property for so I&#39;m the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.790" end="00:20:54.480" style="s2">earliest of the Millennials whoo yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.790" end="00:20:56.280" style="s2">all right well you don&#39;t sound like no</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.480" end="00:20:57.630" style="s2">no offense are my Millennials and</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.280" end="00:20:59.100" style="s2">millennial people out there you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.630" end="00:21:01.830" style="s2">that&#39;s basically who I&#39;m talking to you</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.100" end="00:21:05.280" style="s2">mostly but so you know you brought up an</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.830" end="00:21:07.530" style="s2">interesting thing which is coding like</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.280" end="00:21:09.330" style="s2">coding with your clothing so I&#39;m coding</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.530" end="00:21:11.750" style="s2">when you&#39;re speaking is like you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.330" end="00:21:13.760" style="s2">adopting the vernacular and</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.750" end="00:21:15.350" style="s2">the colloquialisms of the people that</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.760" end="00:21:16.820" style="s2">you&#39;re speaking to so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.350" end="00:21:18.950" style="s2">engage with them on a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.820" end="00:21:20.659" style="s2">relatable and you know working in</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.950" end="00:21:22.730" style="s2">education we talked about like code</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.659" end="00:21:24.590" style="s2">switching all the time it&#39;s like kids</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.730" end="00:21:25.940" style="s2">talk to they talk to each other at a</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.590" end="00:21:27.409" style="s2">certain level and then you talk to your</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.940" end="00:21:28.940" style="s2">teacher at a certain level and then you</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.409" end="00:21:30.980" style="s2">talk to the principal at a certain level</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.940" end="00:21:32.659" style="s2">and you talk to like an outsider talk to</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.980" end="00:21:34.789" style="s2">your parents and you have to learn how</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.659" end="00:21:37.250" style="s2">to code switch and I was just thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.789" end="00:21:39.559" style="s2">about this code that&#39;s like expression</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.250" end="00:21:40.700" style="s2">of your identity when it related to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.559" end="00:21:41.870" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.700" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">specifically talking about the hippies</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.870" end="00:21:46.250" style="s2">the the in you know in the 60s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:49.100" style="s2">the allusions but yeah yeah but you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.250" end="00:21:50.570" style="s2">the the the fact that I don&#39;t care there</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.100" end="00:21:52.640" style="s2">was like a the phrase that came to my</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.570" end="00:21:54.950" style="s2">mind was a coded rebellion it was like</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.640" end="00:21:58.909" style="s2">I&#39;m very specific it&#39;s good very puttin</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.950" end="00:22:01.190" style="s2">a targeted expression of rebellion which</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.909" end="00:22:02.840" style="s2">in it of itself is it like a totally</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.190" end="00:22:04.070" style="s2">contradictory thing is that so far</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.840" end="00:22:06.049" style="s2">that&#39;s alright that&#39;s that was the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.070" end="00:22:07.850" style="s2">recognition I came to as being part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.049" end="00:22:08.750" style="s2">the punk rock culture where it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.850" end="00:22:10.909" style="s2">all look the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.750" end="00:22:12.919" style="s2">we&#39;re also individual with our Liberty</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.909" end="00:22:15.440" style="s2">spikes and our patches on our backpacks</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.919" end="00:22:15.740" style="s2">and our combat boots and we all look the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.440" end="00:22:18.260" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.740" end="00:22:20.809" style="s2">so nonconformist we&#39;re just conforming</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.260" end="00:22:22.159" style="s2">to a counterculture right well I you</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.809" end="00:22:24.530" style="s2">know I had the same thing we&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.159" end="00:22:25.970" style="s2">the 90s I was part of the you know back</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.530" end="00:22:27.320" style="s2">then we called it the rave thit and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.970" end="00:22:28.940" style="s2">rave scene is like the underground house</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.320" end="00:22:30.860" style="s2">music and underground dance music scene</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.940" end="00:22:32.870" style="s2">and back then it was cool I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.860" end="00:22:34.580" style="s2">this toke a lot more back then we used</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.870" end="00:22:36.470" style="s2">to like break into warehouses and do</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.580" end="00:22:38.030" style="s2">parties underneath bridges and import</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.470" end="00:22:39.289" style="s2">music from all over the world and it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.030" end="00:22:43.520" style="s2">like it was the future I mean it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.289" end="00:22:47.000" style="s2">also the past is like 20 but but but</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.520" end="00:22:49.700" style="s2">there - there - we all wore the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.000" end="00:22:51.980" style="s2">vert like these giant baggy jeans and</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.700" end="00:22:55.340" style="s2">very colorful horizontally striped</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.980" end="00:22:58.700" style="s2">shirts and like you know baggy like hats</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.340" end="00:23:00.679" style="s2">and knit hats and it was all we were we</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.700" end="00:23:02.750" style="s2">were rubella we were rebels when you</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.679" end="00:23:04.549" style="s2">dropped this at the mall all right just</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.750" end="00:23:08.750" style="s2">well going to school but when we all got</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.549" end="00:23:11.570" style="s2">together into our tribe we were all very</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.750" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">much wearing the uniform right so do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.570" end="00:23:16.429" style="s2">see people sort of signaling membership</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:18.650" style="s2">in a specific tribe through the way that</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.429" end="00:23:20.299" style="s2">they they dress today like in sort of as</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.650" end="00:23:22.010" style="s2">adults and like modern cultures it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.299" end="00:23:24.140" style="s2">just like a subculture thing right no</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.010" end="00:23:26.510" style="s2">not at all especially because</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.140" end="00:23:27.830" style="s2">we don&#39;t live in a homogenized culture</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.510" end="00:23:28.940" style="s2">in the West anymore</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.830" end="00:23:31.159" style="s2">you know it used to be a hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.940" end="00:23:33.559" style="s2">ago that kind of the West was this this</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.159" end="00:23:35.059" style="s2">hegemony and and everybody wore suits</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.559" end="00:23:36.980" style="s2">when they were going into formal places</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.059" end="00:23:39.200" style="s2">and even blue-collar work all looked the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.980" end="00:23:40.490" style="s2">same but as society becomes more and</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.200" end="00:23:41.570" style="s2">more diverse and we become more</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.490" end="00:23:43.190" style="s2">tribalistic</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.570" end="00:23:44.690" style="s2">in how we see ourselves related to</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.190" end="00:23:46.850" style="s2">everybody else then our clothing becomes</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.690" end="00:23:48.950" style="s2">even more that way anyway which is why</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.850" end="00:23:50.600" style="s2">the tech industry looks different than</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.950" end="00:23:52.490" style="s2">the finance industry as far as the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.600" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">that guys dress or you&#39;ve got I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.490" end="00:23:55.669" style="s2">even look at the Jim CrossFitters</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:23:57.169" style="s2">dressed very differently from body</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.669" end="00:23:59.120" style="s2">builders who dress very differently from</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.169" end="00:24:02.750" style="s2">power lifters like talk about really</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.120" end="00:24:04.730" style="s2">ridiculous sub-tribes but they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.750" end="00:24:08.360" style="s2">trans exactly but there are very</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.730" end="00:24:09.830" style="s2">distinct aesthetics separations there so</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.360" end="00:24:11.539" style="s2">that you can signal it&#39;s like no no no</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.830" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">I&#39;m not one of those guys this is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.539" end="00:24:15.889" style="s2">way that I like to work out right</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.279" end="00:24:19.250" style="s2">exactly and I&#39;ve been guilty of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.889" end="00:24:20.870" style="s2">myself I&#39;m a I&#39;m a proud crossfitter for</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.250" end="00:24:23.330" style="s2">many many years I&#39;m sorry I have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.870" end="00:24:25.490" style="s2">leave now you didn&#39;t but you didn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.330" end="00:24:27.470" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that right because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.490" end="00:24:29.330" style="s2">like those other guys I don&#39;t cross but</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.470" end="00:24:32.059" style="s2">it&#39;s great but it&#39;s that identity right</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.330" end="00:24:34.309" style="s2">yeah exactly yeah and I and I remember</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.059" end="00:24:37.039" style="s2">the one the first day that I wore the</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.309" end="00:24:38.990" style="s2">the tall socks were done I was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.039" end="00:24:40.909" style="s2">these are pretty sweet and then I found</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.990" end="00:24:42.919" style="s2">myself wearing them like on mom deadlift</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.909" end="00:24:44.269" style="s2">days and before you know it I had like</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.919" end="00:24:46.880" style="s2">three pairs and then I had like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.269" end="00:24:50.090" style="s2">compression sock I&#39;m like like sweet</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.880" end="00:24:51.889" style="s2">like and then they&#39;re bright green</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.090" end="00:24:53.179" style="s2">because that&#39;s the way you signal even</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.889" end="00:24:54.529" style="s2">more and there there&#39;s nothing right</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.179" end="00:24:56.750" style="s2">not only is there nothing wrong with it</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.529" end="00:24:58.519" style="s2">it&#39;s a good thing to be able to because</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.750" end="00:25:01.549" style="s2">really what it does is it makes em</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.519" end="00:25:03.500" style="s2">grouper in in tribe communication easier</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.549" end="00:25:05.480" style="s2">and then it also makes it easier to</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.500" end="00:25:06.980" style="s2">identify people who are extra and we do</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.480" end="00:25:08.299" style="s2">the same thing with our etiquette we do</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.980" end="00:25:09.830" style="s2">the same thing in their language and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.299" end="00:25:11.690" style="s2">jargon they&#39;re going to use it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.830" end="00:25:14.570" style="s2">natural thing and it&#39;s it&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.690" end="00:25:15.260" style="s2">right right that&#39;s interesting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.570" end="00:25:17.299" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.260" end="00:25:19.130" style="s2">so one guys come to you and they want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.299" end="00:25:20.659" style="s2">and they want your help like I know</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.130" end="00:25:23.510" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that you need to educate</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.659" end="00:25:25.309" style="s2">them internal awareness of all these</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.510" end="00:25:27.230" style="s2">things but there&#39;s there&#39;s got to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.309" end="00:25:29.419" style="s2">something something that they feel like</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.230" end="00:25:31.279" style="s2">they want to have have help with when</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.419" end="00:25:32.840" style="s2">they when they reach out to you yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.279" end="00:25:34.180" style="s2">most of the time the pain points that</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.840" end="00:25:36.400" style="s2">they&#39;re after</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.180" end="00:25:38.800" style="s2">usually either that they want to be able</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.400" end="00:25:41.290" style="s2">to have more confidence when they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.800" end="00:25:43.300" style="s2">kind of any situation because they maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.290" end="00:25:45.460" style="s2">have their style good enough to not be</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.300" end="00:25:47.170" style="s2">embarrassing at work but they don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.460" end="00:25:49.060" style="s2">suck everywhere else or they can&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.170" end="00:25:50.830" style="s2">take it to the next level so they</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.060" end="00:25:54.190" style="s2">recognize that there&#39;s this this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.830" end="00:25:57.610" style="s2">glaring gap the other thing that I get</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.190" end="00:25:59.260" style="s2">is a lot of guys are kind of the way</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.610" end="00:26:00.640" style="s2">that I am too and I think obviously you</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.260" end="00:26:02.650" style="s2">know the way that I market or you</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.640" end="00:26:04.600" style="s2">attract people who are like you is</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.650" end="00:26:06.100" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of self optimization minded</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.600" end="00:26:08.260" style="s2">where they&#39;re interesting the best</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.100" end="00:26:09.880" style="s2">versions of themselves and what fun is</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.260" end="00:26:11.740" style="s2">with these guys it&#39;s more of an internal</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.880" end="00:26:13.750" style="s2">thing with with other guys it&#39;s just you</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.740" end="00:26:15.730" style="s2">know I want to be able to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.750" end="00:26:17.650" style="s2">social situations better whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.730" end="00:26:19.570" style="s2">with women or at work or anything else</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.650" end="00:26:20.770" style="s2">like that but with these other guys they</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.570" end="00:26:22.390" style="s2">recognize it&#39;s like okay I got my</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.770" end="00:26:24.640" style="s2">finances dialed in I&#39;ve got my fitness</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.390" end="00:26:26.920" style="s2">styled in I&#39;m good on my relationships</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.640" end="00:26:29.620" style="s2">but the guy who stares back at me in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.920" end="00:26:32.110" style="s2">mirror looks like me that he has for the</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.620" end="00:26:33.490" style="s2">last 20 years and I&#39;m not seeing visual</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.110" end="00:26:35.440" style="s2">evidence of the fact that I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.490" end="00:26:37.690" style="s2">better than I was and so it&#39;s this kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.440" end="00:26:39.580" style="s2">of nagging feeling and it&#39;s coupled with</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.690" end="00:26:41.380" style="s2">the idea that they have no idea how to</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.580" end="00:26:42.550" style="s2">do it and so they finally recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.380" end="00:26:44.920" style="s2">of all the things that they need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.550" end="00:26:46.300" style="s2">adjust this is a glaring gap and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.920" end="00:26:48.370" style="s2">one that needs to be brought up to par</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.300" end="00:26:49.840" style="s2">with everything that&#39;s right that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.370" end="00:26:51.700" style="s2">know it&#39;s interesting the way you framed</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:54.010" style="s2">it too it&#39;s not so much that they feel</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.700" end="00:26:55.510" style="s2">like it&#39;s hurting hurting them maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.010" end="00:26:57.700" style="s2">mean maybe it is right because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.510" end="00:27:00.550" style="s2">obvious benefits to getting this dialed</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.700" end="00:27:02.260" style="s2">in but it&#39;s really about self</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.550" end="00:27:03.880" style="s2">actualization and it&#39;s really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.260" end="00:27:05.410" style="s2">really about becoming the person that</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.880" end="00:27:07.330" style="s2">you want to be and I love the term that</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.410" end="00:27:09.370" style="s2">you use is self optimizing I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.330" end="00:27:11.320" style="s2">using the phrase Auto regulating cool</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.370" end="00:27:14.290" style="s2">like that that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of the</p>

<p begin="00:28:04.220" end="00:28:09.140" style="s2">like you&#39;re communicating to your</p>

<p begin="00:28:36.670" end="00:28:40.550" style="s2">focusing on masculine identities and</p>

<p begin="00:28:44.780" end="00:28:49.490" style="s2">whether they&#39;re old or young or male or</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.240" end="00:28:50.420" style="s2">female and the dynamics are all sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.490" end="00:28:53.660" style="s2">kind of the same it&#39;s not right</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.420" end="00:28:56.510" style="s2">absolutely so I see really huge evidence</p>

<p begin="00:29:35.930" end="00:29:39.860" style="s2">benefit from it but for the most part I</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.730" end="00:29:41.240" style="s2">don&#39;t care if what my wife is wearing is</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.860" end="00:29:43.070" style="s2">on trend today as long as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.240" end="00:29:45.860" style="s2">attractive and attractive has this whole</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.070" end="00:29:48.140" style="s2">spectrum but as far as that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.860" end="00:29:49.820" style="s2">signaling that&#39;s very much done between</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.140" end="00:29:51.230" style="s2">women and that&#39;s how they gauge each</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.820" end="00:29:53.450" style="s2">other right</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.230" end="00:29:54.669" style="s2">so this brothers reminded me of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.450" end="00:29:58.480" style="s2">conversation that I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.669" end="00:30:00.429" style="s2">past about status and signaling and sort</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.480" end="00:30:02.289" style="s2">of the opposite of a positive signals</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.429" end="00:30:04.899" style="s2">and negative signal and that negative</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.289" end="00:30:08.830" style="s2">signal is often sort of shame and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.899" end="00:30:13.779" style="s2">remember in the old days of danger and</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.830" end="00:30:15.700" style="s2">play few years ago there was a he did a</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.779" end="00:30:18.549" style="s2">whole series of things on overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.700" end="00:30:22.029" style="s2">shame in overcoming status and you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.549" end="00:30:24.279" style="s2">at the time it seemed it seemed really</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.029" end="00:30:26.080" style="s2">relevant and something that was useful</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.279" end="00:30:28.359" style="s2">to a lot of people which was you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.080" end="00:30:30.009" style="s2">forget about shame forget about status</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.359" end="00:30:32.379" style="s2">just do what you want to do now that</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.009" end="00:30:34.690" style="s2">that that&#39;s a certain conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.379" end="00:30:36.759" style="s2">we can have about like whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.690" end="00:30:38.980" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna spend $10,000 on a watch</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.759" end="00:30:40.749" style="s2">just to show off right and that&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.980" end="00:30:42.429" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of that&#39;s not what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.749" end="00:30:44.289" style="s2">talking about here right not talking</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.429" end="00:30:46.179" style="s2">about we&#39;re not talking about muting</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.289" end="00:30:47.950" style="s2">shame we&#39;re not talking about overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.179" end="00:30:51.159" style="s2">like shame what we&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.950" end="00:30:53.830" style="s2">is presenting the image that you have in</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.159" end="00:30:55.539" style="s2">your mind&#39;s eye and in your heart and</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.830" end="00:30:57.759" style="s2">like who you are as a person on what</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.539" end="00:30:59.830" style="s2">your story is and expressing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.759" end="00:31:02.519" style="s2">through through your appearance is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.830" end="00:31:06.340" style="s2">about this is not about like I have the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.519" end="00:31:09.159" style="s2">not the dog on women but it&#39;s not I have</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.340" end="00:31:11.830" style="s2">the fancy new bag right this race this</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.159" end="00:31:13.659" style="s2">is about my total package presentation</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.830" end="00:31:14.950" style="s2">and the expression of male archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.659" end="00:31:16.649" style="s2">and so let&#39;s move on to that one because</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.950" end="00:31:20.379" style="s2">that&#39;s next on my list here which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.649" end="00:31:22.239" style="s2">what you know your book you went very</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.379" end="00:31:24.549" style="s2">you went into detail in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.239" end="00:31:26.669" style="s2">expression of masculine archetypes and</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.549" end="00:31:30.399" style="s2">identity it&#39;s it&#39;s also in one of your</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.669" end="00:31:32.289" style="s2">courses that I have gone through so can</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.399" end="00:31:34.259" style="s2">you talk to me maybe you mentioned a few</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.289" end="00:31:36.100" style="s2">earlier in terms of expression of</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.259" end="00:31:37.779" style="s2">experience and who we are but can you</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.100" end="00:31:39.850" style="s2">talk a few about a few of the different</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.779" end="00:31:41.739" style="s2">male archetypes that you see commonly</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.850" end="00:31:43.600" style="s2">and that sort of guys you know my</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.739" end="00:31:46.239" style="s2">demographic of people that I reach is</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.600" end="00:31:48.220" style="s2">like basically like 25 to 45 mostly men</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.239" end="00:31:50.169" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot of women you know that</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.220" end="00:31:51.639" style="s2">can relate to that sort of thing so what</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.169" end="00:31:53.440" style="s2">are some of the more common ones and how</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.639" end="00:31:55.450" style="s2">do you see them manifested so the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.440" end="00:31:56.799" style="s2">that I&#39;ve broken it down both within the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.450" end="00:31:58.570" style="s2">book within the courses and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.799" end="00:32:00.129" style="s2">actually even something for for you</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.570" end="00:32:02.679" style="s2">listeners once we&#39;re done if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.129" end="00:32:04.239" style="s2">go learn about which of these three</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.679" end="00:32:05.710" style="s2">archetypes is most applicable to you</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.239" end="00:32:06.610" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a free quiz that you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.710" end="00:32:08.950" style="s2">do on my site</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.610" end="00:32:11.650" style="s2">so you just go to masculine style calm</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.950" end="00:32:13.390" style="s2">and you can take the archetype quiz the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.650" end="00:32:14.800" style="s2">three archetypes as far as the way that</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.390" end="00:32:17.050" style="s2">they&#39;re broken down especially related</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.800" end="00:32:18.700" style="s2">to aesthetics or rugged refined and</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.050" end="00:32:20.170" style="s2">rakish and I think before we even dive</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.700" end="00:32:21.940" style="s2">in and I explained what those three are</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.170" end="00:32:26.020" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s so crucial to</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.940" end="00:32:28.360" style="s2">understand about this is one it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.020" end="00:32:32.320" style="s2">who you are internally it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.360" end="00:32:34.330" style="s2">necessarily this is who I&#39;m supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.320" end="00:32:36.040" style="s2">be but it&#39;s who you actually are in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.330" end="00:32:37.690" style="s2">way that you interact with the world and</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.040" end="00:32:39.520" style="s2">then to the other thing that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.690" end="00:32:41.800" style="s2">to understand is that you may be</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.520" end="00:32:43.870" style="s2">primarily within one but you will have</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.800" end="00:32:45.940" style="s2">elements of all three and you actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.870" end="00:32:47.710" style="s2">may even shift which of your which one</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.940" end="00:32:49.390" style="s2">is primary which one is secondary based</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.710" end="00:32:51.430" style="s2">on the different stage that you&#39;re in in</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.390" end="00:32:52.570" style="s2">your life and so with that kind of as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.430" end="00:32:54.940" style="s2">background I&#39;ll tell you what the three</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.570" end="00:32:56.500" style="s2">are so rugged is you interact with the</p>

<p begin="00:33:04.210" end="00:33:08.800" style="s2">kind of adventure stuff you&#39;re somebody</p>

<p begin="00:33:13.090" end="00:33:16.810" style="s2">who are more interested in the world as</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.770" end="00:33:18.850" style="s2">far as how we interact with each other</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.810" end="00:33:20.740" style="s2">socially and especially when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.850" end="00:33:22.390" style="s2">status and hierarchies shame and</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.740" end="00:33:23.950" style="s2">aspiration all those other things but</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.390" end="00:33:25.660" style="s2">it&#39;s guys who not only enjoy the game</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.950" end="00:33:27.430" style="s2">but they&#39;re good at the game they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:33:27.430" end="00:33:31.570" style="s2">kind of stuff and for them kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.350" end="00:33:33.190" style="s2">self-actualization is trying to climb</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.570" end="00:33:35.410" style="s2">that ladder as high as they can and</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.190" end="00:33:37.360" style="s2">being able to affect as much change as</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.410" end="00:33:39.160" style="s2">they can through that and then the third</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.360" end="00:33:40.960" style="s2">one is rakish and these are the guys who</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.160" end="00:33:42.910" style="s2">they understand all those hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.960" end="00:33:45.280" style="s2">just as well as the refined guys but</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.910" end="00:33:46.930" style="s2">rather than embracing them they thrive</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.280" end="00:33:49.330" style="s2">in going against those rules so like</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.930" end="00:33:52.030" style="s2">your last guest Goldman yeah very good</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.330" end="00:33:53.890" style="s2">example of both a rakish and a rugged</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.030" end="00:33:54.970" style="s2">combination because of how we interact</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.890" end="00:33:56.230" style="s2">with other people</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.970" end="00:33:58.510" style="s2">and how he interacts with the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.230" end="00:34:00.310" style="s2">physically his love of nature how much</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.510" end="00:34:02.020" style="s2">ease and now an adventurer that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.310" end="00:34:04.720" style="s2">stuff and so a good combination of those</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.020" end="00:34:06.040" style="s2">and everyone of us has a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.720" end="00:34:07.990" style="s2">all three within there and when you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.040" end="00:34:10.840" style="s2">find out what that is and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.990" end="00:34:12.730" style="s2">incorporate different manifestations of</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.840" end="00:34:14.919" style="s2">what those archetypes are into your</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.730" end="00:34:17.020" style="s2">style then not only you become visually</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.919" end="00:34:18.790" style="s2">interesting in a way that it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.020" end="00:34:19.840" style="s2">like you know dad jeans and a polo shirt</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.790" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">because that does</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.840" end="00:34:24.310" style="s2">communicate anything but you also feel</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.000" end="00:34:25.600" style="s2">super authentic and self actualized in</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.310" end="00:34:27.220" style="s2">what you&#39;re wearing because what a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.600" end="00:34:29.710" style="s2">of men struggle with especially as they</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.220" end="00:34:31.480" style="s2">start off with some stylish Chicot</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.710" end="00:34:34.060" style="s2">Nordstrom who&#39;s 22 and says you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.480" end="00:34:35.800" style="s2">look handsome in this is they put it on</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.060" end="00:34:37.690" style="s2">and it feels like a costume and yes it</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.800" end="00:34:39.940" style="s2">may aesthetically look better or it may</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.690" end="00:34:41.530" style="s2">signal a certain thing of status but it</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.940" end="00:34:43.690" style="s2">doesn&#39;t feel congruent with who they are</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.530" end="00:34:45.640" style="s2">but when you start with those archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.690" end="00:34:47.710" style="s2">and your understanding of where you fit</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.640" end="00:34:50.080" style="s2">within them then you can create a sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.710" end="00:34:52.090" style="s2">of style that not only looks awesome but</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.080" end="00:34:53.590" style="s2">it feels like okay I finally am able to</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.090" end="00:34:55.420" style="s2">actually express Who I am it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.590" end="00:34:57.460" style="s2">learning a language when are you been</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.420" end="00:34:59.650" style="s2">able to do before is kind of give grunts</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.460" end="00:35:01.360" style="s2">right well you know as you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.650" end="00:35:06.010" style="s2">about this it got me thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.360" end="00:35:08.110" style="s2">writing and voice being congruent with</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.010" end="00:35:10.720" style="s2">who you are what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.110" end="00:35:14.040" style="s2">and the words that you&#39;re using to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.720" end="00:35:17.830" style="s2">that and and what comes out of having a</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.040" end="00:35:22.750" style="s2">congruent voice is clarity yes and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.830" end="00:35:24.490" style="s2">clarity in your writing doesn&#39;t mean you</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.750" end="00:35:27.820" style="s2">know it definitely means the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.490" end="00:35:29.560" style="s2">like using fancy words using you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.820" end="00:35:30.880" style="s2">trying to just find that although I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.560" end="00:35:33.940" style="s2">guilty or from time trying to find that</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.880" end="00:35:36.250" style="s2">exact right four syllable word and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.940" end="00:35:38.050" style="s2">everything you want to say here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.250" end="00:35:39.910" style="s2">about clarity it&#39;s about so that when</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.050" end="00:35:41.980" style="s2">the words come off the page they just</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.910" end="00:35:43.870" style="s2">flow right into the other person&#39;s brain</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.980" end="00:35:45.460" style="s2">and they just have an understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.870" end="00:35:46.060" style="s2">who you are and what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.460" end="00:35:49.120" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.060" end="00:35:51.430" style="s2">and as you&#39;re describing this congruence</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.120" end="00:35:53.350" style="s2">with your out of your outward appearance</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.430" end="00:35:55.690" style="s2">with who you are and what your</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.350" end="00:35:58.120" style="s2">experiences have been to me that it was</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.690" end="00:36:00.100" style="s2">like an expression of clarity and your</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.120" end="00:36:02.440" style="s2">of your night of your identity it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.100" end="00:36:05.170" style="s2">it&#39;s not confusing for people there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.440" end="00:36:08.440" style="s2">not like a conflict right like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.170" end="00:36:10.300" style="s2">not wearing something that tells me one</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.440" end="00:36:12.100" style="s2">story but then when I hear you speak</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.300" end="00:36:13.690" style="s2">you&#39;re telling me another story</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.100" end="00:36:15.430" style="s2">it&#39;s like Marty McFly in Back to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.690" end="00:36:17.050" style="s2">Future 3 is the example I always go back</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.430" end="00:36:18.610" style="s2">to when he wears all the cowboy stuff</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.050" end="00:36:21.220" style="s2">and it&#39;s like you clearly this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.610" end="00:36:22.030" style="s2">you are right yeah we want to avoid that</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.220" end="00:36:24.430" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.030" end="00:36:25.840" style="s2">right so that that clarity also then</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.430" end="00:36:28.930" style="s2">just kind of makes me more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.840" end="00:36:30.370" style="s2">right it&#39;s like it makes it makes the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.930" end="00:36:32.920" style="s2">conversation that you have with other</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.370" end="00:36:34.390" style="s2">people and their ability to digest who</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.920" end="00:36:36.400" style="s2">you are it makes it much simpler for</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.390" end="00:36:39.760" style="s2">them right because you&#39;re no longer just</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.400" end="00:36:40.960" style="s2">this safe neutral it&#39;s almost like but I</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.760" end="00:36:43.350" style="s2">haven&#39;t thought about it this way before</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.960" end="00:36:47.710" style="s2">but it&#39;s almost like most people</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.350" end="00:36:49.540" style="s2">aesthetically or NPCs - you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.710" end="00:36:52.120" style="s2">mean where there&#39;s nothing interesting</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.540" end="00:36:54.130" style="s2">about them because trying to actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.120" end="00:36:56.110" style="s2">engage is risky trying to actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.130" end="00:36:57.880" style="s2">communicate who you are and risky</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.110" end="00:36:59.770" style="s2">because that means that you have to say</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.880" end="00:37:01.420" style="s2">this is who I am therefore this is who</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.770" end="00:37:03.700" style="s2">I&#39;m not there&#39;s there&#39;s opposition</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.420" end="00:37:06.040" style="s2">created by any sort of identity and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.700" end="00:37:07.480" style="s2">most people would say I just I want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.040" end="00:37:08.680" style="s2">avoid not looking like an idiot so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.480" end="00:37:10.240" style="s2">just gonna play a neutral and play it</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.680" end="00:37:13.690" style="s2">safe and there&#39;s no clarity in that</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.240" end="00:37:16.630" style="s2">there is none and let&#39;s just define NPC</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.690" end="00:37:19.540" style="s2">for everybody who may not know so NPC</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.630" end="00:37:22.090" style="s2">stands for a non-player character and it</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.540" end="00:37:23.320" style="s2">comes from online gaming we&#39;re like if</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.090" end="00:37:25.060" style="s2">you&#39;re like let&#39;s say you&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.320" end="00:37:26.500" style="s2">like some sort of like Old West game and</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.060" end="00:37:28.090" style="s2">you&#39;re the you&#39;re on and horseback and</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.500" end="00:37:29.800" style="s2">you come across like a guy standing on</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.090" end="00:37:31.720" style="s2">the side of the road and you&#39;re like hey</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.800" end="00:37:33.670" style="s2">how you doing and he&#39;s like I&#39;m great I</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.720" end="00:37:35.770" style="s2">hear there&#39;s some Indians outside of</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.670" end="00:37:37.030" style="s2">town and you&#39;re like okay cool I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.770" end="00:37:38.320" style="s2">go get those Indians but then the next</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.030" end="00:37:40.720" style="s2">time you&#39;re like so what&#39;d you have for</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.320" end="00:37:42.250" style="s2">lunch and he goes I&#39;m great I hear</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.720" end="00:37:44.380" style="s2">there&#39;s some Indians outside of town</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.250" end="00:37:46.060" style="s2">right they only have so many things</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.380" end="00:37:48.370" style="s2">programmed into them and so when you</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.060" end="00:37:51.280" style="s2">engage with them on anything beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.370" end="00:37:53.710" style="s2">very most simple concepts all you get</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.280" end="00:37:56.320" style="s2">back is just this you know repeated</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.710" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">lines over and over again like orange</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.320" end="00:38:02.560" style="s2">man bad right so that&#39;s a that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:06.040" style="s2">interesting way of putting it and it it</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.560" end="00:38:08.680" style="s2">confuses your communication that we all</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.040" end="00:38:10.330" style="s2">do with our body language with the way</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.680" end="00:38:13.000" style="s2">that we walk with the wait let you wear</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.330" end="00:38:14.980" style="s2">your hair with the way that you do just</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.000" end="00:38:16.780" style="s2">move your arms and gesture and the way</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.980" end="00:38:18.100" style="s2">you stand or whether you&#39;re sitting or</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.780" end="00:38:19.360" style="s2">whether you&#39;re standing or if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.100" end="00:38:20.860" style="s2">standing in the middle of the room or</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.360" end="00:38:22.720" style="s2">the corner of the room or the front of</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.860" end="00:38:24.310" style="s2">the row or the back of the room these</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.720" end="00:38:27.460" style="s2">are all ways that we transmit</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.310" end="00:38:29.580" style="s2">information and your clothes are as much</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.460" end="00:38:32.910" style="s2">of that as anything and I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.580" end="00:38:35.670" style="s2">they&#39;re really really powerful for</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.910" end="00:38:37.410" style="s2">so could you go a little bit deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.670" end="00:38:39.480" style="s2">rakish because I think I got a really</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.410" end="00:38:41.520" style="s2">good sense of rugged like I feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.480" end="00:38:43.349" style="s2">can I could fall into the rugged</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.520" end="00:38:46.559" style="s2">category because I&#39;m very physical and</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.349" end="00:38:49.200" style="s2">I&#39;m very into you know things in nature</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.559" end="00:38:51.119" style="s2">and and and exertion and such like that</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.200" end="00:38:53.670" style="s2">but this rakish that one that one</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.119" end="00:38:55.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily you know makes too</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.670" end="00:38:56.849" style="s2">much sense to me so I got you a little</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.260" end="00:38:58.470" style="s2">bit yeah so the rakish nest is really</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.849" end="00:39:00.599" style="s2">just based on the idea of rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.470" end="00:39:02.099" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of a lot of similarity</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.599" end="00:39:03.750" style="s2">there and I would even argue you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.099" end="00:39:05.040" style="s2">from the interactions that we&#39;ve had the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.750" end="00:39:07.020" style="s2">fact that you had your nails painted</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.040" end="00:39:08.880" style="s2">when we were 21 five there&#39;s there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.020" end="00:39:11.990" style="s2">element of rakish nests in that where</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.880" end="00:39:14.369" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of challenging people to</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.990" end="00:39:15.390" style="s2">to recognize that there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.369" end="00:39:16.920" style="s2">difference there that you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.390" end="00:39:18.450" style="s2">against what something is considered to</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.920" end="00:39:20.190" style="s2">be normal or abnormal and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.450" end="00:39:22.280" style="s2">there&#39;s an element with that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.190" end="00:39:26.190" style="s2">times when guys think of rakish Nastase</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.280" end="00:39:27.599" style="s2">rock stars or Street where you know the</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.190" end="00:39:30.540" style="s2">guys or the hypebeast wearing the latest</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.599" end="00:39:31.770" style="s2">Yeezys that the Kanye&#39;s dropped or</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.540" end="00:39:34.230" style="s2">something else like that and those may</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.770" end="00:39:35.940" style="s2">be really good manifestations of it but</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.230" end="00:39:39.089" style="s2">then the irony of the rake and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.940" end="00:39:41.040" style="s2">rakish archetype is as we get into kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.089" end="00:39:44.130" style="s2">of a world of mediocrity in that that</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.040" end="00:39:46.559" style="s2">npc world even just caring about your</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.130" end="00:39:49.380" style="s2">style at all in kind of a meta context</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.559" end="00:39:51.809" style="s2">does create some element of rakish ness</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.380" end="00:39:53.280" style="s2">so yeah just by saying I&#39;m willing to</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.809" end="00:39:55.829" style="s2">care about this I&#39;m willing to have some</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.280" end="00:39:58.290" style="s2">risk is in and of itself a rejection of</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.829" end="00:39:59.400" style="s2">the modern direction in which culture is</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.290" end="00:40:01.650" style="s2">heading and so there&#39;s there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.400" end="00:40:05.309" style="s2">rakish &#39;no sin that that&#39;s fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.650" end="00:40:07.530" style="s2">and for people that don&#39;t know so i did</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.309" end="00:40:09.599" style="s2">go to the 21 convention with my</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.530" end="00:40:12.780" style="s2">fingernails pains they were they were</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.599" end="00:40:15.750" style="s2">shiny black with gold flecks in them and</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.780" end="00:40:17.880" style="s2">it kind of looked like space rocks and i</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.750" end="00:40:20.760" style="s2">had i had started doing that with my</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.880" end="00:40:22.260" style="s2">daughter i took my daughter to get i was</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.760" end="00:40:25.859" style="s2">trying to find ways to spend some time</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.260" end="00:40:27.450" style="s2">with her and i like with my son until i</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.859" end="00:40:30.180" style="s2">got banned from coaching Little League</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.450" end="00:40:32.609" style="s2">you know I really created more time with</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.180" end="00:40:34.020" style="s2">him by like going and and and coaching</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.609" end="00:40:35.940" style="s2">baseball and spending time with him and</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.020" end="00:40:38.819" style="s2">the kids and then when my daughter was</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.940" end="00:40:40.980" style="s2">harder because she wasn&#39;t into team</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.819" end="00:40:42.780" style="s2">sports we got her to try soccer she</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.980" end="00:40:44.539" style="s2">didn&#39;t like that she tried t-ball she</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.780" end="00:40:46.849" style="s2">was on my tooth</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.539" end="00:40:49.519" style="s2">my team for a couple seasons but never</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.849" end="00:40:51.109" style="s2">really never really stuck with her and</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.519" end="00:40:53.959" style="s2">then she got into like horseback riding</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.109" end="00:40:55.279" style="s2">and and chorus and singing and stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.959" end="00:40:56.660" style="s2">so that I mean I love it I go to all of</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.279" end="00:40:57.829" style="s2">our shows and whatnot but it&#39;s not or</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.660" end="00:41:00.259" style="s2">something that we can like really do</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.829" end="00:41:02.179" style="s2">together right so I was trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.259" end="00:41:04.369" style="s2">ways to do stuff together with her and</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.179" end="00:41:06.079" style="s2">one of the things that we do is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.369" end="00:41:08.269" style="s2">divorced and I don&#39;t live with her</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:11.329" style="s2">full-time and so I like try to take her</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.269" end="00:41:12.799" style="s2">out on a date one night every month or</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.329" end="00:41:14.630" style="s2">two when she&#39;s like supposed to be at</p>

<p begin="00:43:04.170" end="00:43:08.130" style="s2">you&#39;re right that is a little element of</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.790" end="00:43:10.260" style="s2">rakish this but that wouldn&#39;t be my</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.130" end="00:43:11.910" style="s2">primary mode and most people have a</p>

<p begin="00:43:22.290" end="00:43:27.180" style="s2">of rugged and I think one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.880" end="00:43:29.670" style="s2">for that is because most rugged guys are</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.180" end="00:43:31.830" style="s2">the ones most rooted in the the idea</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.670" end="00:43:33.990" style="s2">that real men don&#39;t care how they look</p>

<p begin="00:44:12.240" end="00:44:15.540" style="s2">good we threw out the window because you</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.370" end="00:44:17.520" style="s2">care about your appearance</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.540" end="00:44:19.470" style="s2">it&#39;s the ultimate disqualifier for a lot</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.520" end="00:44:21.810" style="s2">of these guys and clearly that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.470" end="00:44:24.090" style="s2">case well I think there&#39;s a little like</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.810" end="00:44:27.090" style="s2">homophobia built into that right like</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.090" end="00:44:28.800" style="s2">only gay men care about how they look</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.090" end="00:44:31.650" style="s2">yeah and whether that&#39;s homophobia or</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.800" end="00:44:34.500" style="s2">just a concern of I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.650" end="00:44:36.090" style="s2">project something that I&#39;m not know I</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.500" end="00:44:37.800" style="s2">mean like people being critical of guys</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.090" end="00:44:39.360" style="s2">that follow their or that pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.800" end="00:44:40.200" style="s2">to what they wear right that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.360" end="00:44:41.430" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.200" end="00:44:42.540" style="s2">necessarily I don&#39;t think it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.430" end="00:44:43.800" style="s2">that people have a problem with gay</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.540" end="00:44:45.090" style="s2">dudes so much as its I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.800" end="00:44:47.040" style="s2">somebody to think that I&#39;m gay</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.090" end="00:44:49.350" style="s2">right so it&#39;s they&#39;re trying to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.040" end="00:44:51.300" style="s2">any sort of like false advertising right</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.350" end="00:44:53.130" style="s2">right right so therefore because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.300" end="00:44:54.910" style="s2">straight I have to look like a bum</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.130" end="00:44:56.769" style="s2">otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.910" end="00:44:58.450" style="s2">I&#39;m advertising falsely and I&#39;m into</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.769" end="00:44:59.769" style="s2">dudes or I&#39;m effeminate and I&#39;m much</p>

<p begin="00:45:32.349" end="00:45:36.160" style="s2">had to work but so I still get women who</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.480" end="00:45:37.809" style="s2">approach me all the time and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.160" end="00:45:39.789" style="s2">where&#39;d you get those shoes or it&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.809" end="00:45:41.890" style="s2">to see somebody cool coat or something</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.789" end="00:45:42.609" style="s2">else it makes life so much easier in</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.890" end="00:45:44.829" style="s2">that regard</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.609" end="00:45:46.900" style="s2">right the shoes the shoes are definitely</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.829" end="00:45:49.569" style="s2">one that women notice like right off the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.900" end="00:45:51.220" style="s2">bat yeah so this notion that men don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.569" end="00:45:54.309" style="s2">care about what they think is just a</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.220" end="00:45:57.220" style="s2">bunch of horseshit and so so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.309" end="00:46:00.789" style="s2">missing then right and we see this so</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.220" end="00:46:02.710" style="s2">much in so many aspects like you know my</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.789" end="00:46:04.869" style="s2">dad never taught me how to workout the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.710" end="00:46:06.430" style="s2">only like exercise I ever saw my dad get</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.869" end="00:46:08.049" style="s2">would be like in fits and starts he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.430" end="00:46:09.460" style="s2">start jogging for like a week or two I</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.049" end="00:46:13.150" style="s2">thought he&#39;d be done he&#39;d be done with</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.460" end="00:46:16.029" style="s2">that you know never taught me like how</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.150" end="00:46:18.460" style="s2">to handle manage me to interact with</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.029" end="00:46:21.130" style="s2">have a successful loving relationship</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.460" end="00:46:24.220" style="s2">with another woman right they never</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.130" end="00:46:26.230" style="s2">taught me about like how to go out there</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.220" end="00:46:28.299" style="s2">and like be an autodidact and like teach</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.230" end="00:46:30.759" style="s2">myself and like learn and like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.299" end="00:46:32.680" style="s2">the way to get become expert at things</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.759" end="00:46:35.589" style="s2">and they certainly aren&#39;t teaching you</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.680" end="00:46:38.380" style="s2">like how to express yourself with your</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.589" end="00:46:41.470" style="s2">clothing and with your appearance and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.380" end="00:46:44.650" style="s2">I think that that has opened up this you</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.470" end="00:46:47.380" style="s2">know window this opportunity for you to</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.650" end="00:46:49.180" style="s2">to really sort of fill and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.380" end="00:46:51.789" style="s2">we&#39;re all doing is we&#39;re all filling</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.180" end="00:46:53.589" style="s2">that missing thing that happened in our</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.789" end="00:46:55.930" style="s2">childhood right and it&#39;s happening I</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.589" end="00:46:58.630" style="s2">should have done right and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.930" end="00:47:01.390" style="s2">gotten even worse like the guys you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.630" end="00:47:03.279" style="s2">who are in their 20s that&#39;s the main</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.390" end="00:47:05.559" style="s2">thing I hear and read all the time</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.279" end="00:47:06.680" style="s2">online it&#39;s just like my dad never</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.559" end="00:47:08.210" style="s2">taught me this</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.680" end="00:47:10.340" style="s2">no one ever taught me that society</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.210" end="00:47:12.470" style="s2">doesn&#39;t teach us this so like culturally</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.340" end="00:47:15.290" style="s2">you know you may not have the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.470" end="00:47:17.710" style="s2">this but like if men have always been</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.290" end="00:47:20.420" style="s2">concerned with the way they look and</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.710" end="00:47:23.300" style="s2">everybody is also concerned with the way</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.420" end="00:47:26.540" style="s2">you look because don&#39;t forget that for</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.300" end="00:47:28.370" style="s2">one second yeah right exactly then um</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.540" end="00:47:31.490" style="s2">you know why aren&#39;t we teaching people</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.370" end="00:47:32.930" style="s2">how to best present themselves in a way</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.490" end="00:47:35.300" style="s2">that&#39;s congruent with their personal</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.930" end="00:47:37.070" style="s2">identities I think it has a lot to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.300" end="00:47:38.900" style="s2">with a lot of the other kind of blue</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.070" end="00:47:41.240" style="s2">pill cognitive dissonance everything</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.900" end="00:47:42.800" style="s2">else that we deal with where the mantra</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.240" end="00:47:45.050" style="s2">that we have is don&#39;t judge a book by</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:47.840" style="s2">it&#39;s by its cover or people should</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.050" end="00:47:49.520" style="s2">people should treat me based on Who I am</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.840" end="00:47:52.430" style="s2">on the inside and not who I am on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.520" end="00:47:55.210" style="s2">outside and I agree with with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.430" end="00:47:59.600" style="s2">the kind of backing behind those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.210" end="00:48:02.180" style="s2">but it&#39;s also wishful thinking and so we</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.600" end="00:48:04.210" style="s2">have created an entire culture that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.180" end="00:48:07.520" style="s2">built around wishful pie-in-the-sky</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.210" end="00:48:09.020" style="s2">thinking and hoping that if we just have</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.520" end="00:48:11.060" style="s2">enough faith which is ironic because</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.020" end="00:48:13.550" style="s2">we&#39;re also becoming anti religious but</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.060" end="00:48:15.860" style="s2">we have this faith in this utopia based</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.550" end="00:48:17.300" style="s2">on human progression that if we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.860" end="00:48:18.860" style="s2">just granted to each other and love each</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.300" end="00:48:21.170" style="s2">other enough somehow that&#39;s gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.860" end="00:48:23.000" style="s2">and so it is it&#39;s based on this this</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.170" end="00:48:24.770" style="s2">idea that if we just try hard enough and</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.000" end="00:48:25.850" style="s2">we have enough faith in it then all of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.770" end="00:48:27.620" style="s2">sudden everything about the way that</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.850" end="00:48:29.390" style="s2">were wired everything about hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.620" end="00:48:30.680" style="s2">everything about human history and</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.390" end="00:48:31.880" style="s2">animal history and everything else is</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.680" end="00:48:33.650" style="s2">just gonna go out the window</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.880" end="00:48:35.570" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna and we&#39;re gonna treat</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.650" end="00:48:38.540" style="s2">everybody like a blank slate and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.570" end="00:48:41.420" style="s2">gonna care about anything exactly so you</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.540" end="00:48:44.210" style="s2">said that I learnt the point is blank</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.420" end="00:48:46.490" style="s2">slate as of me it&#39;s blank slate as a man</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.210" end="00:48:47.930" style="s2">isn&#39;t that ironic not ironic but isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.490" end="00:48:49.580" style="s2">that fascinating which is what most</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.930" end="00:48:52.570" style="s2">people mean when they say ironic yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.580" end="00:48:56.780" style="s2">fascinating that like the blank slate</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.570" end="00:49:00.680" style="s2">concepts are so pervasive in our society</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.780" end="00:49:03.470" style="s2">and the complete discrediting of our</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.680" end="00:49:05.900" style="s2">animal nature of our existence and</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.470" end="00:49:09.890" style="s2">dominance and competence hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.900" end="00:49:12.050" style="s2">like evolution and who we are as animals</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.890" end="00:49:14.060" style="s2">and today you know advanced animals</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.050" end="00:49:16.940" style="s2">obviously but still animals working in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.060" end="00:49:19.100" style="s2">system we throw all that out and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.940" end="00:49:20.059" style="s2">like it&#39;s like damaging guys all the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.100" end="00:49:21.589" style="s2">down to like</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.059" end="00:49:24.319" style="s2">the most basic level of how they present</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.589" end="00:49:27.229" style="s2">themselves well I&#39;m not some totally</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.319" end="00:49:28.969" style="s2">permeated everything yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.229" end="00:49:31.160" style="s2">that&#39;s an angle that I had not</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.969" end="00:49:33.529" style="s2">necessarily considered before which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.160" end="00:49:35.809" style="s2">why I&#39;m doing these podcasts awesome so</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.529" end="00:49:39.170" style="s2">thank you very much Tim yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.809" end="00:49:41.680" style="s2">that&#39;s really fascinating I remember</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.170" end="00:49:44.329" style="s2">very distinctly when I got divorced I</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.680" end="00:49:46.969" style="s2">you know I was coming out of that with</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.329" end="00:49:48.739" style="s2">like clothes at my my ex wife had bought</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.969" end="00:49:50.089" style="s2">for me and when she was at Costco you</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.739" end="00:49:51.799" style="s2">know she&#39;s like going grocery shopping</p>

<p begin="00:51:08.209" end="00:51:13.339" style="s2">sweater often when I think about you</p>

<p begin="00:51:17.269" end="00:51:21.890" style="s2">right it never looked right on me it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.569" end="00:51:25.040" style="s2">$250 it&#39;s a beautiful piece of clothing</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.890" end="00:51:28.580" style="s2">and I&#39;ve only worn it one time</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.040" end="00:51:32.330" style="s2">and it just smells like such a waste of</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.580" end="00:51:34.580" style="s2">money to me right and so when I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.330" end="00:51:37.369" style="s2">about you and the services that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.580" end="00:51:40.420" style="s2">offer I think to myself well man if I</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.369" end="00:51:42.920" style="s2">would have just spent that $250 on</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.420" end="00:51:44.540" style="s2">getting expert advice or going through a</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.920" end="00:51:46.580" style="s2">course to learning they learn about</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.540" end="00:51:47.810" style="s2">myself and me and what I want to say and</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.580" end="00:51:49.450" style="s2">what I want to look like what my body</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.810" end="00:51:52.580" style="s2">type is like and what&#39;s gonna fit me</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.450" end="00:51:54.830" style="s2">that would have saved me so much money</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.580" end="00:51:58.070" style="s2">down probably thousands of dollars I</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.830" end="00:52:00.410" style="s2">mean my closet is filled with stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.070" end="00:52:04.190" style="s2">mean I only wear 10% of what I got right</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.410" end="00:52:06.740" style="s2">yep yep is that is that common I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.190" end="00:52:08.270" style="s2">super common yeah in fact most of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.740" end="00:52:09.740" style="s2">time when I&#39;m starting with clients will</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.270" end="00:52:11.660" style="s2">do the first thing we do is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.740" end="00:52:14.510" style="s2">closet evaluation and we do a purge and</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.660" end="00:52:15.650" style="s2">I would say 80% of the time I say I need</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.510" end="00:52:17.270" style="s2">you to take photos of everything that</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.650" end="00:52:19.280" style="s2">you have and they say well I only wear</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.270" end="00:52:20.420" style="s2">like 15 percent of the stuff ten percent</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.280" end="00:52:22.010" style="s2">of the stuff that&#39;s in there so can we</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.420" end="00:52:24.560" style="s2">just were bringing those photos yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.010" end="00:52:27.109" style="s2">right right yeah yeah and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.560" end="00:52:29.450" style="s2">that goes to show the sort of haphazard</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.109" end="00:52:31.340" style="s2">nature that we go about acquiring our</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.450" end="00:52:32.390" style="s2">clothing and I think it becomes really</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.340" end="00:52:34.730" style="s2">important especially when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.390" end="00:52:36.890" style="s2">relatively matured and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.730" end="00:52:39.040" style="s2">growing as much and you know maybe your</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.890" end="00:52:42.619" style="s2">waist grows and shrinks a little bit but</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.040" end="00:52:44.090" style="s2">you know you can take the time to to buy</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.619" end="00:52:45.740" style="s2">a piece that&#39;s gonna last you a long</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.090" end="00:52:47.090" style="s2">time right like I&#39;m bored jacket this</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.740" end="00:52:49.730" style="s2">morning that I&#39;ve had for like a year</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.090" end="00:52:51.170" style="s2">yes you know and it&#39;s a classic it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.730" end="00:52:53.900" style="s2">classic cut it&#39;s a classic piece it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.170" end="00:52:55.430" style="s2">never gonna go out of fashion and if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.900" end="00:52:59.090" style="s2">take good care of it you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.430" end="00:53:01.910" style="s2">actually net financial positive in this</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.090" end="00:53:03.800" style="s2">one right your cost per wear is super</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.910" end="00:53:05.600" style="s2">low on something like that right and</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.800" end="00:53:07.310" style="s2">that I think that that&#39;s you know among</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.600" end="00:53:08.480" style="s2">all the other value that people can get</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.310" end="00:53:10.850" style="s2">from you I think that that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.480" end="00:53:12.140" style="s2">that really stands out to me yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.850" end="00:53:14.570" style="s2">that&#39;s one of my favorite things to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.140" end="00:53:15.859" style="s2">with these guys is to help them kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.570" end="00:53:17.210" style="s2">see the light on that and whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.859" end="00:53:18.320" style="s2">the guys should work with me one on one</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.210" end="00:53:20.150" style="s2">or the guys who go through the course</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.320" end="00:53:22.580" style="s2">that you&#39;ve gone through is it&#39;s helping</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.150" end="00:53:24.350" style="s2">them realize that okay now I&#39;m equipped</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.580" end="00:53:26.540" style="s2">to actually go into this with a game</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.350" end="00:53:28.640" style="s2">plan and I have the tools to filter the</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.540" end="00:53:30.740" style="s2">things that I do look at so that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.640" end="00:53:33.680" style="s2">just randomly in kind of in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.740" end="00:53:35.480" style="s2">reactionary way go out and buy stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.680" end="00:53:37.190" style="s2">think okay I like that shirt I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.480" end="00:53:38.180" style="s2">buy that and then you get home and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.190" end="00:53:39.170" style="s2">go well crap</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.180" end="00:53:40.580" style="s2">I don&#39;t have anything else I can wear</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.170" end="00:53:42.530" style="s2">this with because I didn&#39;t buy the pants</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.580" end="00:53:44.030" style="s2">and the shoes that worked with that and</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.530" end="00:53:45.380" style="s2">everything is just kind of random and</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.030" end="00:53:47.330" style="s2">sporadic whereas if you know yourself</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.380" end="00:53:48.650" style="s2">you know your tribes you know what</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.330" end="00:53:50.030" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to signal well enough and</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.650" end="00:53:52.160" style="s2">you know how to filter for all of that</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.030" end="00:53:52.640" style="s2">then when you go out you can go I like</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.160" end="00:53:54.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.640" end="00:53:56.330" style="s2">I can&#39;t really come up with a way that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.800" end="00:53:59.120" style="s2">would wear that so I&#39;m probably gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.330" end="00:54:00.860" style="s2">skip it or write or go the other</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.120" end="00:54:02.630" style="s2">direction and so it does it&#39;s just it</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.860" end="00:54:05.060" style="s2">saves so much energy it saves so much</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.630" end="00:54:06.290" style="s2">inner kind of frustration especially</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.060" end="00:54:07.550" style="s2">whether that&#39;s when you&#39;re shopping or</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.290" end="00:54:09.140" style="s2">when you&#39;ve got this kind of nagging</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.550" end="00:54:10.700" style="s2">feeling though it&#39;s like I should look</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.140" end="00:54:12.770" style="s2">better everybody else around me looks</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.700" end="00:54:15.110" style="s2">better and I don&#39;t look that great it</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.770" end="00:54:16.910" style="s2">saves money it&#39;s it the the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.110" end="00:54:18.230" style="s2">what I do for men and that&#39;s one of the</p>

<p begin="00:56:08.690" end="00:56:13.250" style="s2">right away and you find that even on</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.550" end="00:56:15.620" style="s2">this very small level we interact better</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.250" end="00:56:17.240" style="s2">with people that are attractive and</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.620" end="00:56:19.490" style="s2">again whether that&#39;s fair or not is</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.240" end="00:56:21.350" style="s2">irrelevant because you can&#39;t do much</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.490" end="00:56:22.700" style="s2">about your face but you can control your</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.350" end="00:56:24.620" style="s2">fitness and you can&#39;t control your</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.700" end="00:56:26.000" style="s2">grooming and your style and other things</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.620" end="00:56:28.400" style="s2">and so you can make yourself more</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.000" end="00:56:29.750" style="s2">attractive and therefore improve the way</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.400" end="00:56:30.950" style="s2">you interact with other people and</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.750" end="00:56:32.630" style="s2">improve the way that you perceive</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.950" end="00:56:34.100" style="s2">yourself because not only do you like</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.630" end="00:56:35.510" style="s2">other people who are more attractive you</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.100" end="00:56:37.880" style="s2">like yourself more when you&#39;re more</p>

<p begin="00:56:46.100" end="00:56:49.880" style="s2">closed off to the world you&#39;re open to</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.170" end="00:56:51.500" style="s2">the world yeah because you feel because</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.880" end="00:56:54.740" style="s2">you feel confident and secure but</p>

<p begin="00:57:23.060" end="00:57:28.630" style="s2">legit fight gym I&#39;ve been going for</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.650" end="00:57:30.410" style="s2">about two years and I realized that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.630" end="00:57:31.640" style="s2">one of the things that makes me</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.410" end="00:57:33.320" style="s2">uncomfortable especially cuz I never</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.640" end="00:57:34.700" style="s2">engaged I never got in a fight in high</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.320" end="00:57:36.590" style="s2">school or anything else like that and</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.700" end="00:57:39.140" style="s2">for me as a dad I mean the whole reason</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.590" end="00:57:41.420" style="s2">I even started going is I don&#39;t want the</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.140" end="00:57:43.400" style="s2">real rep of anything related to violence</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.420" end="00:57:45.320" style="s2">to be my first rep and I had no</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.400" end="00:57:47.210" style="s2">familiarity with violence whatsoever no</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.320" end="00:57:48.680" style="s2">does that mean that because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.210" end="00:57:51.650" style="s2">doing boxing that all of a sudden I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.680" end="00:57:52.820" style="s2">like some master defender of my family</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.650" end="00:57:54.860" style="s2">absolutely not</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.820" end="00:57:56.810" style="s2">but I&#39;m better prepared than I was</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.860" end="00:57:58.460" style="s2">before I started doing it and I can keep</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.810" end="00:58:00.860" style="s2">making incremental steps so that I</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.460" end="00:58:02.600" style="s2">become better with it I also think one</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.860" end="00:58:04.070" style="s2">of the other side benefits was not any</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.600" end="00:58:05.210" style="s2">things I ever expected because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.070" end="00:58:07.370" style="s2">in the gym for a few years</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.210" end="00:58:09.050" style="s2">before I started boxing but what it does</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.370" end="00:58:11.600" style="s2">for my body language what it does for my</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.050" end="00:58:14.060" style="s2">posture what it does for my my level of</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.600" end="00:58:16.340" style="s2">confidence and comfort around other</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.060" end="00:58:18.500" style="s2">people because you know I played some</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.340" end="00:58:20.750" style="s2">games with my friends where we&#39;re out in</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.500" end="00:58:21.830" style="s2">public and it&#39;s just like okay who in</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.750" end="00:58:24.890" style="s2">this restaurant you think could actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.830" end="00:58:26.780" style="s2">beat you up and now it&#39;s not that many</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.890" end="00:58:28.340" style="s2">people anymore because as the standard</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.780" end="00:58:29.630" style="s2">continues to go down if you put it in</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.340" end="00:58:31.550" style="s2">any sort of effort it goes up and it</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.630" end="00:58:33.080" style="s2">does a lot for your confidence but</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.550" end="00:58:34.790" style="s2">anyway I realized that just training</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.080" end="00:58:36.950" style="s2">mitts and doing some like half hazard</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.790" end="00:58:39.620" style="s2">20% sparring it wasn&#39;t good enough and</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.950" end="00:58:42.020" style="s2">so one of my one of my challenges for</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.620" end="00:58:45.200" style="s2">myself in 2018 was to take an actual</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.020" end="00:58:47.210" style="s2">fight was to have a real fight so we did</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.200" end="00:58:50.000" style="s2">it man that&#39;s awesome what was it like</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.210" end="00:58:52.550" style="s2">getting hit in the face oh my gosh so</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.000" end="00:58:54.440" style="s2">when I was doing it sparring I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.550" end="00:58:55.940" style="s2">surprised by how much it didn&#39;t hurt it</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.440" end="00:58:57.980" style="s2">felt like getting hit in the head with a</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.940" end="00:58:59.720" style="s2">basketball you know like you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.980" end="00:59:01.370" style="s2">like oh that sucks I certainly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.720" end="00:59:04.400" style="s2">want that to happen again but I can keep</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.370" end="00:59:06.980" style="s2">going yeah we&#39;re using like a 16 ounce</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.400" end="00:59:08.630" style="s2">gloves gloves to spark yeah and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.980" end="00:59:11.420" style="s2">even with the guys most of the guys in</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.630" end="00:59:13.010" style="s2">my gym so I&#39;m in the 175 pound weight</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.420" end="00:59:15.320" style="s2">class and most of the guys in my gym are</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.010" end="00:59:18.590" style="s2">220 plus and so they hit hard you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.320" end="00:59:19.940" style="s2">yeah but even then you know it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.590" end="00:59:21.890" style="s2">just like that sucks you know I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.940" end="00:59:23.180" style="s2">one of them like mess up my jaw one time</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.890" end="00:59:24.560" style="s2">after we were going a little bit harder</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.180" end="00:59:26.810" style="s2">than we should have been because that</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.560" end="00:59:28.670" style="s2">happens but anyway you&#39;re just like I</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.810" end="00:59:30.410" style="s2">can I can deal with this and so I go</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.670" end="00:59:32.840" style="s2">into my bout feeling really confident</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.410" end="00:59:34.640" style="s2">and the guy was he was younger than I</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.840" end="00:59:36.050" style="s2">was he was faster than iOS he had two</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.640" end="00:59:37.430" style="s2">inches on me and height he probably had</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.050" end="00:59:38.780" style="s2">three inches on me and reached like he</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.430" end="00:59:41.600" style="s2">was just a better fighter all-around</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.780" end="00:59:43.490" style="s2">and about 30 seconds in he comes across</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.600" end="00:59:45.290" style="s2">with this with this right cross and just</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.490" end="00:59:47.990" style="s2">hits me square in between the eyes and</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.290" end="00:59:52.970" style="s2">the first thing I thought was wow that</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.990" end="00:59:54.590" style="s2">really really hurts anything I</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.970" end="00:59:56.150" style="s2">experienced sparring or anything that I</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.590" end="00:59:56.720" style="s2">expected it was bad enough that it made</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.150" end="00:59:58.370" style="s2">me dizzy</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.720" end="01:00:00.380" style="s2">and so I was dizzy throughout the the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.370" end="01:00:02.420" style="s2">duration of the bout and for amateurs</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.380" end="01:00:05.060" style="s2">it&#39;s only 3 1 minute rounds especially</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.420" end="01:00:07.760" style="s2">when it&#39;s like your first fight and so I</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.060" end="01:00:10.250" style="s2">mean it sucks I was tired I couldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.760" end="01:00:12.320" style="s2">in and out you know all of my strategies</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.250" end="01:00:14.780" style="s2">about head movement and pivots not it</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.320" end="01:00:16.560" style="s2">just it all went to crap but man it was</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.780" end="01:00:18.600" style="s2">so cool and so I&#39;m gonna do it</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.560" end="01:00:20.460" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna do it again in a few months</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.600" end="01:00:23.520" style="s2">here yeah that&#39;s awesome that&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.460" end="01:00:26.760" style="s2">I I too have some rare experience but my</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.520" end="01:00:28.290" style="s2">game was more sweet yeah yeah so I did</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.760" end="01:00:30.690" style="s2">I trained more time for a number of</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.290" end="01:00:32.190" style="s2">years and I finally made it on to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.690" end="01:00:35.010" style="s2">fight team and then finally made it into</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.190" end="01:00:37.260" style="s2">the ring and I got four fights four</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.010" end="01:00:39.720" style="s2">fights undefeated never lost and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.260" end="01:00:41.790" style="s2">realized you know what after sort of in</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.720" end="01:00:43.590" style="s2">the amateur ranks like you have the or</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.790" end="01:00:44.760" style="s2">like the novice levels and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.590" end="01:00:46.170" style="s2">like I don&#39;t I don&#39;t remember what they</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.760" end="01:00:47.490" style="s2">called after that but it&#39;s like zero to</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.170" end="01:00:49.320" style="s2">like three fights or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.490" end="01:00:51.150" style="s2">and then after that you have to move up</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.320" end="01:00:53.520" style="s2">into like the next one right you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.150" end="01:00:54.390" style="s2">an open fighter er yeah yeah Oh open</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.520" end="01:00:56.430" style="s2">right exactly</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.390" end="01:01:00.030" style="s2">so I was like after after I&#39;d won all my</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.430" end="01:01:01.830" style="s2">novice fights and the future in front of</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.030" end="01:01:03.600" style="s2">me like the guy that will not open in</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.830" end="01:01:05.340" style="s2">the super-heavy anyway it was like 35</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.600" end="01:01:08.790" style="s2">and two or something I think that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.340" end="01:01:10.470" style="s2">record so I was like okay so so alright</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.790" end="01:01:14.160" style="s2">I&#39;ve made it I&#39;ve made it sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.470" end="01:01:16.230" style="s2">up to like you know the the the 2/3 up</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.160" end="01:01:17.880" style="s2">the pyramid and my cart that&#39;s uh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.230" end="01:01:20.610" style="s2">that&#39;s probably that&#39;s probably good but</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.880" end="01:01:23.460" style="s2">yeah it was funny about it is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.610" end="01:01:25.410" style="s2">there&#39;s no I mean I&#39;m Owen one and a lot</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.460" end="01:01:28.230" style="s2">of people especially because I got I had</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.410" end="01:01:30.240" style="s2">to crap kicked out of me I mean nobody</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.230" end="01:01:32.220" style="s2">else that night was nearly as bloody as</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.240" end="01:01:33.660" style="s2">I was my face bruising and everything</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.220" end="01:01:36.210" style="s2">after the guys in the gym were laughing</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.660" end="01:01:38.220" style="s2">at me there cuz I just I got I got</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.210" end="01:01:41.610" style="s2">worked and I&#39;m really glad that I did</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.220" end="01:01:43.650" style="s2">because anything after that will be now</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.610" end="01:01:45.450" style="s2">I kind of know what especially cuz</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.650" end="01:01:47.340" style="s2">knockouts don&#39;t happen very often in</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.450" end="01:01:49.860" style="s2">novice fights and so right now I know</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.340" end="01:01:52.530" style="s2">kind of what worst-case scenario is but</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.860" end="01:01:54.000" style="s2">it&#39;s funny because I if I were if I had</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.530" end="01:01:57.330" style="s2">won that one then it&#39;s like well I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.000" end="01:01:59.640" style="s2">stop there because is this a fluke or</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.330" end="01:02:00.720" style="s2">can I win more but if I lose that one</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.640" end="01:02:02.250" style="s2">it&#39;s like well I can&#39;t stop there</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.720" end="01:02:03.780" style="s2">because you can&#39;t go out Owen won like</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.250" end="01:02:04.980" style="s2">you have to do more than that and so the</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.780" end="01:02:07.350" style="s2">vacuum you actually found a good</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.980" end="01:02:08.880" style="s2">stopping point is actually pretty crazy</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.350" end="01:02:10.680" style="s2">because I think most of the time there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.880" end="01:02:12.330" style="s2">this balance of like well I&#39;m on this</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.680" end="01:02:14.730" style="s2">winning streak can I keep it going or</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.330" end="01:02:16.860" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh I&#39;m so even I have to shift</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.730" end="01:02:18.840" style="s2">the balance in my favor yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.860" end="01:02:21.240" style="s2">there&#39;s an interesting psychology with</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.840" end="01:02:22.950" style="s2">all of those combat sports yeah well I</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.240" end="01:02:24.800" style="s2">was I was a couple years older than you</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.950" end="01:02:26.780" style="s2">and I when I was doing that so</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.800" end="01:02:28.010" style="s2">the writing was on the wall the guys I</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.780" end="01:02:30.620" style="s2">was fighting we&#39;re like you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.010" end="01:02:37.250" style="s2">24 years old but right yeah I was never</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.620" end="01:02:40.280" style="s2">the quickest and but I want to just</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.250" end="01:02:43.430" style="s2">emphasize for everybody that like one of</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.280" end="01:02:45.380" style="s2">the number-one benefits to participating</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.430" end="01:02:47.240" style="s2">in the amateur combat sport and you</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.380" end="01:02:49.850" style="s2">don&#39;t even have to get in the ring for</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.240" end="01:02:52.430" style="s2">this is just knowing that you can get</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.850" end="01:02:54.140" style="s2">hit in the head hit in the face and like</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.430" end="01:02:55.850" style="s2">your whole world isn&#39;t gonna end you</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.140" end="01:02:59.650" style="s2">were not as fragile as you think you are</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.850" end="01:03:02.090" style="s2">right right and that&#39;s a message that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.650" end="01:03:04.070" style="s2">we&#39;re sending like the exact opposite</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.090" end="01:03:05.780" style="s2">message to everybody these days right</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.070" end="01:03:08.210" style="s2">you see there was an article the other</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.780" end="01:03:10.160" style="s2">day about an increase in parents going</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.210" end="01:03:11.420" style="s2">to have lunch with their kids at school</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.160" end="01:03:13.160" style="s2">because that&#39;s the only way they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.420" end="01:03:16.490" style="s2">really just gonna literally just gonna</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.160" end="01:03:18.920" style="s2">bring that up oh my gosh oh my gosh that</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.490" end="01:03:21.920" style="s2">is terrible parenting I can&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.920" end="01:03:23.900" style="s2">doing that like enabling that well he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.920" end="01:03:25.490" style="s2">not gonna eat if I&#39;m not there okay see</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.900" end="01:03:27.920" style="s2">what happens if he does that for three</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.490" end="01:03:29.720" style="s2">days just do three days of a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.920" end="01:03:33.920" style="s2">of discomfort and see what happens</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.720" end="01:03:36.680" style="s2">oh my gosh I know it&#39;s crazy when when</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.920" end="01:03:38.540" style="s2">when like the very rare is this is in</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.680" end="01:03:40.220" style="s2">which like we didn&#39;t like somehow we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.540" end="01:03:42.350" style="s2">out late or we didn&#39;t eat dinner I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.220" end="01:03:45.440" style="s2">know like you know one time a year right</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.350" end="01:03:52.130" style="s2">we don&#39;t feed the kids dinner and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.440" end="01:03:55.070" style="s2">like as you allow them to be and there</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.130" end="01:03:58.340" style="s2">is gradual as you force them to be right</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.070" end="01:03:59.810" style="s2">right and I think that you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.340" end="01:04:02.510" style="s2">message that we&#39;re getting in culture</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.810" end="01:04:04.880" style="s2">today is that everybody&#39;s fragile and</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.510" end="01:04:06.320" style="s2">everybody everybody needs as much so not</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.880" end="01:04:08.270" style="s2">only do they need as much support as</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.320" end="01:04:10.460" style="s2">they can get but they also need every</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.270" end="01:04:12.880" style="s2">obstacle in front of them cleared out</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.460" end="01:04:15.470" style="s2">totally removed and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.880" end="01:04:17.720" style="s2">opportunity to let your children or</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.470" end="01:04:22.550" style="s2">other people sort of just fall down in</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.720" end="01:04:27.530" style="s2">the dirt and combat sports are a way for</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.550" end="01:04:29.270" style="s2">us to like to combat to fight against to</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.530" end="01:04:31.730" style="s2">fight against you know what we</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.270" end="01:04:34.850" style="s2">experienced in that growing up which was</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.730" end="01:04:37.020" style="s2">was far far far less prevalent than it</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.850" end="01:04:38.940" style="s2">is today and far less severe</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.020" end="01:04:41.310" style="s2">you know I was a latchkey kid so like I</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.940" end="01:04:44.490" style="s2">was like the original sort of free-range</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.310" end="01:04:45.869" style="s2">child and so I learned some independence</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.490" end="01:04:47.460" style="s2">very early on when it comes to that but</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.869" end="01:04:49.020" style="s2">these days man you know there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.460" end="01:04:50.849" style="s2">none of that if you if you&#39;re not there</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.020" end="01:04:53.490" style="s2">when your kids get home from school year</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.849" end="01:04:56.160" style="s2">somehow like a bad person in and if your</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.490" end="01:04:58.740" style="s2">kids reach an obstacle that they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.160" end="01:05:00.599" style="s2">surmount on their own and somehow you</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.740" end="01:05:04.320" style="s2">feel as a parent and you&#39;ve got to do it</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.599" end="01:05:05.880" style="s2">yourself and when I saw that article and</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.320" end="01:05:07.170" style="s2">of course the picture that they eat the</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.880" end="01:05:09.839" style="s2">picture that they use speaking of</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.170" end="01:05:11.310" style="s2">masculine identity is right the picture</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.839" end="01:05:15.720" style="s2">that they use like you and I both have</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.310" end="01:05:17.220" style="s2">beers but like it&#39;s I don&#39;t feel very I</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.720" end="01:05:18.599" style="s2">feel very strong and this is saying</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.220" end="01:05:20.580" style="s2">they&#39;re like our beards are basking in</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.599" end="01:05:22.619" style="s2">and look good and project strength but</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.580" end="01:05:24.270" style="s2">like this dude you know you know what it</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.619" end="01:05:26.790" style="s2">is this dude with the beard was just bad</p>

<p begin="01:05:26.790" end="01:05:33.030" style="s2">ponytail and he had like a frumpy shirt</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.790" end="01:05:36.960" style="s2">and suspenders on and look like it was</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.030" end="01:05:39.960" style="s2">just it was like the epitome of the sort</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.960" end="01:05:42.270" style="s2">of SOI weak man generation and there he</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.960" end="01:05:45.150" style="s2">was at his kids school elementary school</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.270" end="01:05:47.250" style="s2">basically like helping his you know what</p>

<p begin="01:05:47.250" end="01:05:51.540" style="s2">because he hadn&#39;t well prepared his own</p>

<p begin="01:09:12.890" end="01:09:15.950" style="s2">finally inflated them all the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.450" end="01:09:17.870" style="s2">not the engine it&#39;s not the steering</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.950" end="01:09:19.700" style="s2">it&#39;s not this like major component of</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.870" end="01:09:21.740" style="s2">the vehicle but if your tires are</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.700" end="01:09:24.260" style="s2">sluggish you&#39;re not going to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.740" end="01:09:26.420" style="s2">optimize and maximize all of those other</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.260" end="01:09:28.280" style="s2">finely tuned pieces of machinery that go</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.420" end="01:09:31.250" style="s2">into that being the vehicle that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.280" end="01:09:33.980" style="s2">supposed to be right and then that that</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.250" end="01:09:37.040" style="s2">translates into happier relationships</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.980" end="01:09:40.310" style="s2">better work opportunities more more</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.040" end="01:09:44.270" style="s2">business success better friendships</p>

<p begin="01:09:46.010" end="01:09:49.340" style="s2">this because I&#39;ve actually I&#39;ve lived</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.990" end="01:09:51.170" style="s2">all this myself</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.340" end="01:09:53.090" style="s2">right exactly when when I figured out</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.170" end="01:09:54.880" style="s2">what kind of jeans look good on me and</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.090" end="01:09:57.500" style="s2">what kind of sweaters like for example I</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.880" end="01:09:59.210" style="s2">don&#39;t like sweaters that have elastic</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.500" end="01:10:01.400" style="s2">bands at the bottoms and so I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.210" end="01:10:03.680" style="s2">that like sweaters that like hang loose</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.400" end="01:10:05.570" style="s2">on me look way better and I can these</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.680" end="01:10:07.670" style="s2">are just small little things and then it</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.570" end="01:10:10.310" style="s2">just doubles into your confidence and</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.670" end="01:10:11.510" style="s2">your eye contact and your presence and</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.310" end="01:10:13.730" style="s2">then all of a sudden you&#39;re just sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.510" end="01:10:14.930" style="s2">like I&#39;m necessarily a different person</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.730" end="01:10:17.420" style="s2">but the person that you were meant to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.930" end="01:10:20.120" style="s2">along the way turned up to 11 instead of</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.420" end="01:10:22.250" style="s2">being a lower version of where where you</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.120" end="01:10:23.630" style="s2">were yep right and then people treat you</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.250" end="01:10:25.760" style="s2">that way and you&#39;re good at being able</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.630" end="01:10:27.770" style="s2">to take it to level 12 in the level 13</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.760" end="01:10:28.880" style="s2">because it&#39;s that that virtuous cycle</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.770" end="01:10:31.160" style="s2">that you were talking about earlier</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.880" end="01:10:32.960" style="s2">because all that momentum now starts to</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.160" end="01:10:36.320" style="s2">feed for you instead of against you</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.960" end="01:10:37.970" style="s2">right that&#39;s awesome man I you know I</p>
