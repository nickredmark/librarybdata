<p begin="00:01:43.950" end="00:01:50.689" style="s2">easy to contribute to we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.570" end="00:01:52.710" style="s2">have more people joining them leaving</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.689" end="00:01:54.030" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna want their friends and</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.710" end="00:01:56.219" style="s2">family to come on board and the more we</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.030" end="00:01:57.299" style="s2">create it so it&#39;s Omni win so the more</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.219" end="00:01:58.920" style="s2">people that come on board and bring</p>
