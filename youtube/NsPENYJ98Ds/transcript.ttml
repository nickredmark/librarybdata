<p begin="00:00:12.809" end="00:00:18.000" style="s2">this easy to today&#39;s question has a bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.230" end="00:00:20.189" style="s2">of like a pre which is like we&#39;ve made</p>

<p begin="00:00:20.189" end="00:00:25.680" style="s2">those Omni win anti rivalry most</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.020" end="00:00:27.119" style="s2">solutions whatever time period you think</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.680" end="00:00:29.250" style="s2">that happens and hopefully within your</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.119" end="00:00:31.650" style="s2">lifetime because we&#39;re asking what does</p>

<p begin="00:00:31.650" end="00:00:34.890" style="s2">pretty quick five minute share if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.450" end="00:00:37.200" style="s2">like oh I&#39;m gonna coffin because it took</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.890" end="00:00:38.969" style="s2">us two years but maybe your next</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.200" end="00:00:40.230" style="s2">lifetime then maybe what your next life</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.969" end="00:00:43.980" style="s2">side looks like if you believe in</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.230" end="00:00:46.950" style="s2">reincarnation so who would like to start</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.980" end="00:00:49.110" style="s2">I can be really really really quick I</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.950" end="00:00:51.090" style="s2">can be super quick here I&#39;m joining</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.110" end="00:00:54.629" style="s2">Starfleet I think that Star Trek world</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.090" end="00:00:57.000" style="s2">is a pretty good picture of what game be</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.629" end="00:00:58.530" style="s2">world looks like right you know we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.000" end="00:01:00.480" style="s2">use money we work to better ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.530" end="00:01:01.949" style="s2">and to expand the knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.480" end="00:01:04.110" style="s2">awareness of humanity know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.949" end="00:01:06.000" style="s2">that and so that&#39;s what I would do I</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.110" end="00:01:07.740" style="s2">would join Starfleet I&#39;ve always wanted</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.000" end="00:01:10.140" style="s2">to go into space if indeed space does</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.740" end="00:01:13.189" style="s2">exist I&#39;ve always wanted to go there so</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.140" end="00:01:13.189" style="s2">that&#39;s me</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.780" end="00:01:22.920" style="s2">because actually mines mines pretty</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.729" end="00:01:24.570" style="s2">similar except that I think that it</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.920" end="00:01:27.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t communicate as deeply as I as I</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.570" end="00:01:31.140" style="s2">want to do and I would say just to add</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.000" end="00:01:33.240" style="s2">some layers to that the relational</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.140" end="00:01:37.320" style="s2">technology psycho technology and digital</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.240" end="00:01:39.299" style="s2">technology work together but the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.320" end="00:01:42.689" style="s2">sense of what it is that we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.299" end="00:01:45.869" style="s2">to accomplish towards a true collective</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.689" end="00:01:47.549" style="s2">intelligence and I and I say that and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.869" end="00:01:49.829" style="s2">sounds still sounds a little bit sci-fi</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.549" end="00:01:52.860" style="s2">II I have us I have a specific</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.829" end="00:01:56.729" style="s2">interpretation of what that means which</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.860" end="00:01:58.350" style="s2">is kind of holographic intelligence my</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.729" end="00:02:00.299" style="s2">own individual intelligence make sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.350" end="00:02:03.060" style="s2">the collective intelligence makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.299" end="00:02:06.049" style="s2">and I work between those and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.060" end="00:02:08.580" style="s2">find ways to express myself and to</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.049" end="00:02:11.370" style="s2">connect to deeper desires of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.580" end="00:02:12.060" style="s2">wanted to be done right now that this</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.370" end="00:02:13.200" style="s2">sense of collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.060" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">I&#39;ll just looks a little bit too much</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:18.810" style="s2">like the board where I have to give up</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:22.470" style="s2">my own sovereignty in order to align</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.810" end="00:02:24.599" style="s2">with mega sovereignty and and and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.470" end="00:02:30.780" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessary but so in</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.599" end="00:02:33.450" style="s2">the game be world that that the portals</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.780" end="00:02:36.630" style="s2">between individual peer to peer and peer</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.450" end="00:02:37.980" style="s2">to collective make much more sense and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.630" end="00:02:40.019" style="s2">we have communication strategies and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.980" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">practices for dealing with that more</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.019" end="00:02:48.180" style="s2">effectively thank you do you want to go</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:51.750" style="s2">branch you want me to go I can go mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.180" end="00:02:54.299" style="s2">just to build off Eric&#39;s point ie I said</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.750" end="00:02:56.489" style="s2">to somebody yesterday what we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.299" end="00:02:59.060" style="s2">to do is build Starfleet not Skynet</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.489" end="00:03:01.230" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.060" end="00:03:02.910" style="s2">distinction and you know you could say</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.230" end="00:03:05.519" style="s2">you could put the Borg in there to to</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.910" end="00:03:08.040" style="s2">David&#39;s point like it&#39;s um it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.519" end="00:03:13.500" style="s2">principle right it&#39;s technology turned</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.040" end="00:03:15.269" style="s2">against us mm-hmm and I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.500" end="00:03:18.180" style="s2">oversimplifying but that&#39;s what it comes</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.269" end="00:03:20.190" style="s2">down to right and and and when I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.180" end="00:03:22.829" style="s2">talking about that I highlighted the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.190" end="00:03:25.230" style="s2">next generation to as the kind of stent</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.829" end="00:03:26.730" style="s2">standout Star Trek series because it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.230" end="00:03:31.140" style="s2">so much more about peace and diplomacy</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.730" end="00:03:33.840" style="s2">and what what social relations look like</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.140" end="00:03:38.400" style="s2">in a post-scarcity world right so there</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.840" end="00:03:41.609" style="s2">wasn&#39;t so much violence and and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.400" end="00:03:44.639" style="s2">violence was was was not repressed but</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.609" end="00:03:46.620" style="s2">but transmuted into conflicts that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.639" end="00:03:48.569" style="s2">could solve in courtrooms or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.620" end="00:03:50.459" style="s2">right and then occasionally it would</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.569" end="00:03:57.780" style="s2">still come to violence because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.459" end="00:04:01.650" style="s2">just the nature of entertainment and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.780" end="00:04:03.720" style="s2">addiction and and and in reality to some</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.650" end="00:04:05.970" style="s2">extent</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.720" end="00:04:08.900" style="s2">other than that though my game be world</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.970" end="00:04:11.880" style="s2">looks like you know somewhat like</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.900" end="00:04:14.430" style="s2">University just but despite its current</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.880" end="00:04:18.979" style="s2">flaws you know everyone has access to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.430" end="00:04:21.180" style="s2">education and free speech and hmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.979" end="00:04:24.500" style="s2">you know there&#39;s sort of higher purpose</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.180" end="00:04:25.690" style="s2">you&#39;re driving towards and so obviously</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.500" end="00:04:28.360" style="s2">universe</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.690" end="00:04:30.220" style="s2">in a tough place and we need to um you</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.360" end="00:04:34.570" style="s2">know challenge how that&#39;s being eroded</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.220" end="00:04:36.190" style="s2">by neoliberalism but but generally you</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.570" end="00:04:40.060" style="s2">know you want it you want to expand out</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.190" end="00:04:41.950" style="s2">that&#39;s that kind of template rather than</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.060" end="00:04:44.860" style="s2">constrict it and have it be a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.950" end="00:04:47.250" style="s2">exclusive place and a place where free</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.860" end="00:04:51.000" style="s2">speech is actually weaponize is to</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.250" end="00:04:55.990" style="s2">further you know anti progressive goals</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.000" end="00:04:57.670" style="s2">um I think I think the you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.990" end="00:04:59.950" style="s2">game be is in the future it looks very</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.670" end="00:05:02.440" style="s2">different from how it is today as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.950" end="00:05:05.860" style="s2">when there&#39;s a lot of internal tension</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.440" end="00:05:08.500" style="s2">and and hypocrisy and a silencing and</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.860" end="00:05:12.810" style="s2">and blocking and alliances and all these</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.500" end="00:05:12.810" style="s2">sorts of things at the expense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.900" end="00:05:18.850" style="s2">converging on some truly higher</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.970" end="00:05:24.340" style="s2">principles I&#39;ll just leave it there for</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.850" end="00:05:26.380" style="s2">in it intro right let&#39;s see if I can get</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.340" end="00:05:28.920" style="s2">through mine without coffee or that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.380" end="00:05:28.920" style="s2">probably not gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.520" end="00:05:38.470" style="s2">alright so I living within the game be</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.700" end="00:05:39.880" style="s2">space where we&#39;ve actually gotten to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.470" end="00:05:45.070" style="s2">point where we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.880" end="00:05:47.140" style="s2">Omni win and ante rival risk I think we</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.070" end="00:05:48.700" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.140" end="00:05:52.180" style="s2">like what you said about Star Trek The</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.700" end="00:05:53.620" style="s2">Next Generation being peaceful and based</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.180" end="00:05:55.270" style="s2">on peace and then a lot of the other</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.620" end="00:05:56.710" style="s2">ones are based on war mainly for</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.270" end="00:05:59.250" style="s2">entertainment because that&#39;s what we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.710" end="00:06:02.080" style="s2">that&#39;s the drama that drives our society</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.250" end="00:06:04.810" style="s2">that our lack of imagination in that</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.080" end="00:06:07.270" style="s2">area like it&#39;s almost like we think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.810" end="00:06:09.010" style="s2">going to be boring it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.270" end="00:06:10.900" style="s2">boring to live in a world where we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.010" end="00:06:12.850" style="s2">eliminated poverty and we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.900" end="00:06:15.070" style="s2">connected in this collective</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.850" end="00:06:18.100" style="s2">intelligence or we maintain our personal</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.070" end="00:06:19.990" style="s2">autonomy where I get to be my unique</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.100" end="00:06:21.700" style="s2">individual self whatever that means</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.990" end="00:06:24.520" style="s2">meaning I have to accept everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.700" end="00:06:26.530" style="s2">also where they are with of course a few</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.520" end="00:06:28.300" style="s2">caveats no you know that&#39;s murder you</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.530" end="00:06:30.790" style="s2">know like they are murder at all zero</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.300" end="00:06:33.910" style="s2">murder you I don&#39;t think you ever get to</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.790" end="00:06:38.890" style="s2">but we get to the vast vast vast</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.910" end="00:06:41.530" style="s2">reduction and then new drama emerges</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.890" end="00:06:43.180" style="s2">like the the your interpret your inter</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.530" end="00:06:47.560" style="s2">and intra personal drama doesn&#39;t go away</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.180" end="00:06:50.110" style="s2">we figure out how to how to be in how to</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.560" end="00:06:52.900" style="s2">be whole individuals and how to be in</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.110" end="00:06:57.520" style="s2">small groups and this big big meta group</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.900" end="00:06:59.770" style="s2">that I don&#39;t think so within that space</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.520" end="00:07:03.250" style="s2">when we&#39;re actually in game be my life</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.770" end="00:07:06.400" style="s2">looks like living in a smaller village</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.250" end="00:07:08.050" style="s2">where we&#39;re growing food together where</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.400" end="00:07:10.360" style="s2">I don&#39;t have to do all the labor but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.050" end="00:07:12.010" style="s2">get to experience being with the animals</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.360" end="00:07:13.840" style="s2">being with the plants eating that food</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.010" end="00:07:14.980" style="s2">and working on projects are important to</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.840" end="00:07:16.960" style="s2">me that actually have nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.980" end="00:07:19.780" style="s2">that I just really want that to be the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.960" end="00:07:21.940" style="s2">foundation of the community that I live</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.780" end="00:07:24.370" style="s2">in I want to spend my days riding horses</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.940" end="00:07:27.100" style="s2">and being in nature and having</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.370" end="00:07:29.620" style="s2">conversations that help me advance and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.100" end="00:07:33.150" style="s2">help whatever projects I am I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.620" end="00:07:35.350" style="s2">on with other people advance as well and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.150" end="00:07:36.610" style="s2">even within this space like when I ask</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.350" end="00:07:39.220" style="s2">people what they would do if they won</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.610" end="00:07:42.040" style="s2">the lottery or what they would do if</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.220" end="00:07:44.110" style="s2">game becomes about a lot of what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.040" end="00:07:46.090" style="s2">in is still rival race and antivirus</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.110" end="00:07:48.070" style="s2">both in a in a in a like negative way</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.090" end="00:07:50.050" style="s2">and in a positive way like oh I would</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.070" end="00:07:51.400" style="s2">help the poor there aren&#39;t a core to</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.050" end="00:07:53.500" style="s2">help what are you gonna spend your time</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.400" end="00:07:56.500" style="s2">doing oh that doesn&#39;t exist anymore</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.500" end="00:07:59.550" style="s2">right like because I do think when we</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.500" end="00:08:03.220" style="s2">find the way to work together we cure</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.550" end="00:08:05.470" style="s2">99% of cancer we stop and cure 99% of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.220" end="00:08:08.950" style="s2">cancer we stop Alzheimer&#39;s we stop these</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.470" end="00:08:13.420" style="s2">things that we can&#39;t do by ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.950" end="00:08:15.940" style="s2">and so when we figure out how to work</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.420" end="00:08:18.580" style="s2">together without getting along we then</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.940" end="00:08:21.610" style="s2">are able to create game be very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.580" end="00:08:23.950" style="s2">and that part of that is accepting like</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.610" end="00:08:25.180" style="s2">I me and I have to accept other people</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.950" end="00:08:28.330" style="s2">where they are and where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.180" end="00:08:30.340" style="s2">conflict do we work it out and grow or</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.330" end="00:08:32.979" style="s2">do we separate each other and I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.340" end="00:08:34.510" style="s2">there&#39;s room for both in that space and</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.979" end="00:08:38.470" style="s2">now I&#39;m getting into other other topics</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.510" end="00:08:41.560" style="s2">but that is I guess my answer today of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.470" end="00:08:44.380" style="s2">where I would be in in game B so thank</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.560" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">you know we have hey all four of us</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.380" end="00:08:50.020" style="s2">shared under 10 minutes that&#39;s I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.760" end="00:08:52.690" style="s2">really like to just jump in here and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.020" end="00:08:54.460" style="s2">pick up on from where</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.690" end="00:08:56.110" style="s2">Jubilee has just left off and tie it</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.460" end="00:08:58.750" style="s2">together with the whole Star Trek next</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.110" end="00:09:00.130" style="s2">generation thing as well I&#39;m reminded of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.750" end="00:09:02.530" style="s2">an episode I think there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.130" end="00:09:05.050" style="s2">connection also nicely I&#39;m reminded of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.530" end="00:09:06.550" style="s2">an episode where I comment what his name</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.050" end="00:09:11.290" style="s2">was it was the guy that played Murdock</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.550" end="00:09:13.960" style="s2">in the a-team I can&#39;t remember Berkeley</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.290" end="00:09:18.520" style="s2">that&#39;s hit Berkeley he gets an addiction</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.960" end="00:09:21.310" style="s2">to the holiday right and but the point I</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.520" end="00:09:24.640" style="s2">want to make is that at no moment in</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.310" end="00:09:27.580" style="s2">their episode was there any kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.640" end="00:09:30.070" style="s2">know condemnation or vilification or</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.580" end="00:09:31.930" style="s2">exclusion of him straight away the thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.070" end="00:09:33.820" style="s2">was how can we help him right what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.930" end="00:09:36.550" style="s2">gone wrong how can we help him be the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.820" end="00:09:38.740" style="s2">deep assumption is this is a good guy he</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.550" end="00:09:40.510" style="s2">signed up at the st. to Starfleet that</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.740" end="00:09:42.970" style="s2">we all did right and so you know there</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.510" end="00:09:44.860" style="s2">there was never even a question of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.970" end="00:09:46.210" style="s2">there&#39;s something wrong with him right</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.860" end="00:09:47.590" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s how can we all</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.210" end="00:09:49.750" style="s2">fundamentally wrong with him right but</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.590" end="00:09:52.690" style="s2">that something has gone wrong how can we</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.750" end="00:09:54.550" style="s2">help and I like that that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.690" end="00:09:56.740" style="s2">happens a lot in the Star Trek universe</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.550" end="00:09:58.120" style="s2">they are in the next-generation universe</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.740" end="00:09:59.800" style="s2">anyway as you correctly pointed out it</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.120" end="00:10:03.400" style="s2">is by far and away the best of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.800" end="00:10:04.780" style="s2">iterations of Star Trek and yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.400" end="00:10:06.220" style="s2">just think it fits really nicely with</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.780" end="00:10:07.900" style="s2">what Jubilee was saying as well about</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.220" end="00:10:09.700" style="s2">meeting everyone where they are right</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.900" end="00:10:11.710" style="s2">you are you and you have every right to</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.700" end="00:10:13.720" style="s2">be all of you that you can be but so the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.710" end="00:10:16.630" style="s2">fuck does everybody else right and this</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.720" end="00:10:18.130" style="s2">is I like what was it you said figuring</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.630" end="00:10:20.290" style="s2">out ways to work together without</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.130" end="00:10:22.300" style="s2">getting along I really I really like</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.290" end="00:10:26.850" style="s2">that that&#39;s exactly that that captures</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.300" end="00:10:31.450" style="s2">it really nicely mm-hmm yeah beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.850" end="00:10:34.540" style="s2">example Eric what the very last thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.450" end="00:10:37.750" style="s2">you said though it makes me think of you</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.540" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">know politicians who who really stretch</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.750" end="00:10:42.010" style="s2">to reach both sides of the aisle you</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:43.510" style="s2">know that that that that are proud of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.010" end="00:10:47.920" style="s2">how they work with both sides and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.510" end="00:10:50.650" style="s2">think of Joe Biden you know for exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.920" end="00:10:53.710" style="s2">that because he&#39;s just a friendly hand</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.650" end="00:10:55.540" style="s2">shaker he&#39;ll he&#39;ll he&#39;ll you know build</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.710" end="00:10:56.970" style="s2">all these bridges or whatever but but</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.540" end="00:11:01.000" style="s2">there are some of them are really toxic</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.970" end="00:11:05.220" style="s2">relationships right like like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.000" end="00:11:05.220" style="s2">we&#39;re in this reactionary age and</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.670" end="00:11:10.260" style="s2">you know there&#39;s that there&#39;s the kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.410" end="00:11:12.180" style="s2">of controversy that&#39;s recent of like</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.260" end="00:11:14.730" style="s2">Ellen being friends with George Bush</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.180" end="00:11:16.530" style="s2">right that&#39;s one thing we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.730" end="00:11:19.140" style="s2">come from come from compartmentalize</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.530" end="00:11:21.930" style="s2">that but then what about you know people</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.140" end="00:11:23.670" style="s2">in people liberals being friends with</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.930" end="00:11:25.740" style="s2">people in the Trump administration you</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.670" end="00:11:28.740" style="s2">know like how how far do we stretch it</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.740" end="00:11:32.820" style="s2">and how how absurd do we twist the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.740" end="00:11:39.150" style="s2">reality to like the story rather to mask</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.820" end="00:11:40.500" style="s2">the reality right um so but yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.150" end="00:11:42.360" style="s2">just sort of a paradox that I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.500" end="00:11:45.560" style="s2">pick up on you know we need to support</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.360" end="00:11:51.540" style="s2">people like Berkeley but uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.560" end="00:11:54.420" style="s2">yeah you know try not to compromise or</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.540" end="00:11:56.640" style="s2">work with double-crossers those types of</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.420" end="00:11:59.130" style="s2">things right because Berkeley was a good</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.640" end="00:12:02.850" style="s2">guy but some other people have deeper</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.130" end="00:12:05.550" style="s2">flaws or ulterior motives so I hope that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.850" end="00:12:09.360" style="s2">makes sense just in the in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.550" end="00:12:14.820" style="s2">centrist politics and I think like where</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.360" end="00:12:16.380" style="s2">you take the diversity even like the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.820" end="00:12:19.800" style="s2">binary of the left and the right and</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.380" end="00:12:23.400" style="s2">instead of honoring the different pieces</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.800" end="00:12:25.080" style="s2">they both bring you kind of like average</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.400" end="00:12:26.730" style="s2">them out you don&#39;t get anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.080" end="00:12:28.590" style="s2">not diversity right like when you&#39;re and</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.730" end="00:12:29.850" style="s2">yet we need we need centralize when you</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.590" end="00:12:32.850" style="s2">bright when you&#39;ve left we need all of</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.850" end="00:12:35.610" style="s2">the diversity that exists and so in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.850" end="00:12:37.290" style="s2">case of like Ellen and George Bush yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.610" end="00:12:39.060" style="s2">they get to be friends cuz George Bush</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.290" end="00:12:40.500" style="s2">gets to be George Bush and Ellen gets to</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.060" end="00:12:42.540" style="s2">be Ellen and they get to decide if</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.500" end="00:12:45.540" style="s2">they&#39;re friends but there&#39;s a larger</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.540" end="00:12:47.190" style="s2">question of the you know LGBT like</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.540" end="00:12:49.080" style="s2">people who are anti LGBT and are like</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.190" end="00:12:51.480" style="s2">well you can&#39;t exist and people who are</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.080" end="00:12:53.130" style="s2">LGBT like there&#39;s conversations to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.480" end="00:12:55.440" style="s2">had on the individual level where are</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.130" end="00:12:59.280" style="s2">like yeah I have conservative family and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.440" end="00:13:01.140" style="s2">friends that I love and yet calling them</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.280" end="00:13:03.180" style="s2">out on their shit isn&#39;t actually helping</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.140" end="00:13:04.740" style="s2">them advance and it took me 20 years to</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.180" end="00:13:06.990" style="s2">figure that out right I&#39;m like oh</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.740" end="00:13:08.730" style="s2">there&#39;s ways I can engage in this with</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.990" end="00:13:10.950" style="s2">love and understanding that actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.730" end="00:13:12.600" style="s2">gets you to see it and there&#39;s ways that</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.950" end="00:13:14.010" style="s2">are just confrontational that are just</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.600" end="00:13:16.620" style="s2">gonna make you dig your heels in deeper</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.010" end="00:13:19.080" style="s2">and I&#39;m not honoring you</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.620" end="00:13:21.780" style="s2">I&#39;m not seeing who you are what does</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.080" end="00:13:24.150" style="s2">George Bush bring right what into the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.780" end="00:13:25.560" style="s2">world and yet there is a power structure</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.150" end="00:13:27.810" style="s2">that needs to be looked at right</p>

<p begin="00:13:27.810" end="00:13:32.070" style="s2">problem it&#39;s that George Bush gets to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.150" end="00:13:34.650" style="s2">President and and inflict those</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.070" end="00:13:37.470" style="s2">throughout right like it&#39;s the power of</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.650" end="00:13:38.940" style="s2">who&#39;s there yet everyone who voted for</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.470" end="00:13:40.500" style="s2">him is exactly where they&#39;re supposed to</p>

<p begin="00:13:46.890" end="00:13:51.000" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna go for him like there</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:53.100" style="s2">needs to be a way of honoring the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.000" end="00:13:54.840" style="s2">individual and asking like why did you</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.100" end="00:13:55.920" style="s2">vote for George but like when we figure</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.840" end="00:13:57.450" style="s2">out that met a piece of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.920" end="00:13:58.980" style="s2">where we can actually understand what</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.450" end="00:14:00.930" style="s2">politicians stand for and it&#39;s not all</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.980" end="00:14:03.150" style="s2">spin and it&#39;s not all sociopaths in</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.930" end="00:14:05.640" style="s2">charge then we can kind of allow</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.150" end="00:14:08.250" style="s2">sociopaths to exist right like when</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.640" end="00:14:09.750" style="s2">you&#39;re not our CEOs and presidents they</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.250" end="00:14:11.160" style="s2">can exist there&#39;s a space for them</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.750" end="00:14:12.600" style="s2">they&#39;re actually a really important</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.160" end="00:14:13.890" style="s2">piece of society I don&#39;t know what cuz</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.600" end="00:14:15.570" style="s2">I&#39;m not like I don&#39;t know actually what</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.890" end="00:14:18.240" style="s2">that piece is but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.570" end="00:14:19.470" style="s2">there or they wouldn&#39;t exist but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.240" end="00:14:21.360" style="s2">not supposed to be in charge of</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.470" end="00:14:23.160" style="s2">countries and corporations and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.360" end="00:14:27.240" style="s2">supposed to like prop that up to this</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.160" end="00:14:30.690" style="s2">degree it&#39;s a so like you just pop in</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.240" end="00:14:33.300" style="s2">and say it&#39;s it&#39;s tricky right and one</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.690" end="00:14:36.000" style="s2">way because you know love him or hate</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.300" end="00:14:39.900" style="s2">him and both right Steve Jobs is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.000" end="00:14:41.610" style="s2">one of those sociopaths that did move he</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.900" end="00:14:43.050" style="s2">did did the universe for better or worse</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.610" end="00:14:44.310" style="s2">you know there are there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.050" end="00:14:47.940" style="s2">good things and bad things so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.310" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.940" end="00:14:52.680" style="s2">gutsiness</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:54.750" style="s2">that allows somebody to say I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.680" end="00:14:57.240" style="s2">do something impossible you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.750" end="00:14:58.800" style="s2">Elon Musk&#39;s and and Bill Gates in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.240" end="00:15:01.050" style="s2">you know the the people of the world who</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.800" end="00:15:02.460" style="s2">do say you know I&#39;m going to do this and</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.050" end="00:15:04.230" style="s2">it and then they pull together the</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.460" end="00:15:08.160" style="s2">resources and the coordinating people in</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.230" end="00:15:10.380" style="s2">order to get things then I think what I</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.160" end="00:15:14.550" style="s2">think what I see in a game would be</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.380" end="00:15:17.130" style="s2">world is the the discrepancy between how</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.550" end="00:15:19.860" style="s2">much influence individuals at the top</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.130" end="00:15:22.860" style="s2">end of the pyramid and the bottom end</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.860" end="00:15:25.560" style="s2">have that it actually doesn&#39;t flatten to</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.860" end="00:15:26.770" style="s2">level that&#39;s not the point but that it</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.560" end="00:15:29.500" style="s2">has with</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.770" end="00:15:32.529" style="s2">domains you know the recognition is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.500" end="00:15:35.410" style="s2">you you are an expert in some field and</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.529" end="00:15:36.850" style="s2">so that it really does that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.410" end="00:15:38.589" style="s2">what I mean by holographic there is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.850" end="00:15:41.170" style="s2">way in which we don&#39;t have to view it</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.589" end="00:15:43.839" style="s2">through one common lens of this is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.170" end="00:15:46.839" style="s2">one true truth of the whole world right</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.839" end="00:15:48.190" style="s2">and my in this community we operate a</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.839" end="00:15:50.290" style="s2">little bit differently than we do in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.190" end="00:15:53.080" style="s2">larger world and in some way it feels</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.290" end="00:15:55.450" style="s2">refreshing because we have found tribe</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.080" end="00:15:57.370" style="s2">members who feel who think of things</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.450" end="00:15:58.899" style="s2">similarly and it&#39;s like I could not have</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.370" end="00:16:00.940" style="s2">these kinds of conversations and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.899" end="00:16:02.500" style="s2">in the bigger world and I wouldn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.940" end="00:16:03.970" style="s2">to have a world where everybody should</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.500" end="00:16:07.660" style="s2">be having the conversation same way we</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.970" end="00:16:09.750" style="s2">are but we find each other and and find</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.660" end="00:16:12.870" style="s2">a way to have those conversations so</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.750" end="00:16:15.910" style="s2">there&#39;s so it&#39;s an interesting kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.870" end="00:16:17.800" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting notion and I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.910" end="00:16:19.690" style="s2">what you said Julie we can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.800" end="00:16:24.600" style="s2">envision what that looks like in its</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.690" end="00:16:26.890" style="s2">full expression so it also becomes less</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.600" end="00:16:28.810" style="s2">possible you know I I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.890" end="00:16:30.760" style="s2">many of you are familiar with the like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.810" end="00:16:33.459" style="s2">meeting technology called them open</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.760" end="00:16:35.589" style="s2">space technology but it&#39;s you know you</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.459" end="00:16:39.790" style="s2">can move from place to place so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.589" end="00:16:41.320" style="s2">can&#39;t like Bogart a room and say okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.790" end="00:16:43.120" style="s2">this is I&#39;m going to take us all in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.320" end="00:16:44.410" style="s2">direction if you don&#39;t like the way the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.120" end="00:16:46.660" style="s2">conversations going go somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.410" end="00:16:50.140" style="s2">you know and so I think that there are</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.660" end="00:16:53.560" style="s2">ways that things like that can work and</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.140" end="00:16:55.329" style="s2">less hijacking and and when when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.560" end="00:16:57.160" style="s2">not the ability to hijack there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.329" end="00:17:01.779" style="s2">not the ability there&#39;s not not the need</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.160" end="00:17:02.980" style="s2">to police I think I talked about that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.779" end="00:17:04.540" style="s2">don&#39;t know if it was that exact same</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.980" end="00:17:06.730" style="s2">technology but when I talked to Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.540" end="00:17:08.410" style="s2">Hall he had mentioned that what I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.730" end="00:17:09.550" style="s2">doing the idea cafe and we was like well</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.410" end="00:17:12.790" style="s2">there&#39;s this one where you walk in and</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.550" end="00:17:15.550" style="s2">out of rooms and I love that concept I</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.790" end="00:17:17.620" style="s2">think there is a piece of it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.550" end="00:17:20.020" style="s2">like that I think we can deal with in</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.620" end="00:17:21.640" style="s2">the overall picture which is like if I</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.020" end="00:17:25.329" style="s2">don&#39;t if I&#39;m not getting along with</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.640" end="00:17:27.790" style="s2">friends if if like we have a diabolical</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.329" end="00:17:29.350" style="s2">opposition that we&#39;re just really I can</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.790" end="00:17:31.120" style="s2">choose to not be at a table with him and</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.350" end="00:17:32.950" style="s2">not have a conversation and that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.120" end="00:17:35.800" style="s2">there&#39;s no neither of us can do it all</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.950" end="00:17:37.540" style="s2">so we can work on that and grow as human</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.800" end="00:17:39.310" style="s2">beings but it has to be consensual by</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.540" end="00:17:41.950" style="s2">both parties but</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.310" end="00:17:43.480" style="s2">if I then go Eric you&#39;re not allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.950" end="00:17:45.850" style="s2">work with Brent and David you&#39;re not -</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.480" end="00:17:47.380" style="s2">or just through peer pressure you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.850" end="00:17:50.320" style="s2">what I mean I&#39;m like I&#39;m leaving who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.380" end="00:17:52.330" style="s2">with me there&#39;s a difference in like if</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.320" end="00:17:54.070" style="s2">I&#39;m offended or upset or whatever I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.330" end="00:17:56.860" style="s2">going through myself and I can honor</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.070" end="00:17:58.630" style="s2">that that&#39;s my shit right even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.860" end="00:18:01.540" style="s2">if it&#39;s currently manifesting as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.630" end="00:18:03.370" style="s2">relationship with Brent what like that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.540" end="00:18:05.200" style="s2">can pull myself back without me and</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.370" end="00:18:07.510" style="s2">everyone else to join me and not making</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.200" end="00:18:08.980" style="s2">you if I&#39;m capable in that space in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.510" end="00:18:11.380" style="s2">moment not making Brent wrong about it</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.980" end="00:18:13.510" style="s2">either right like he&#39;s who he is</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.380" end="00:18:15.310" style="s2">we are just diabolically opposed at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.510" end="00:18:22.180" style="s2">moment and I&#39;m sorry for picking you</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.310" end="00:18:24.100" style="s2">brand sorry but I think there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.180" end="00:18:25.540" style="s2">really important part to this I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.100" end="00:18:27.070" style="s2">with this game fact this came up in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.540" end="00:18:29.410" style="s2">conversation we had about rural Omega</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.070" end="00:18:31.840" style="s2">Jubilee and I heard Bonita Roy talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.410" end="00:18:34.320" style="s2">about this as well that the clash of</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.840" end="00:18:36.190" style="s2">difference is an opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.320" end="00:18:38.500" style="s2">originality you know what I mean for</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.190" end="00:18:41.290" style="s2">something truly original and creative to</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.500" end="00:18:42.490" style="s2">be to be found and so you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.290" end="00:18:44.080" style="s2">example that you&#39;ve given where you and</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.490" end="00:18:45.250" style="s2">Brent simply can&#39;t find a way to get on</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.080" end="00:18:46.750" style="s2">you know it comes up room after room</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.250" end="00:18:48.370" style="s2">after room with the two of you are in</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.750" end="00:18:49.360" style="s2">there the argument between you dominated</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.370" end="00:18:50.950" style="s2">conversation right</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.360" end="00:18:52.240" style="s2">I would suggest rather than avoiding</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.950" end="00:18:53.650" style="s2">each other the two of you should get</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.240" end="00:18:55.510" style="s2">into a room and figure out what it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.650" end="00:18:59.350" style="s2">you know I mean because there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.510" end="00:19:02.260" style="s2">I feel like there&#39;s rich potential for</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.350" end="00:19:05.050" style="s2">discovery in in a dynamic such as that</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.260" end="00:19:06.640" style="s2">right if you can unpick the the negative</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.050" end="00:19:08.110" style="s2">aspects which are blocking the ability</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:09.610" style="s2">to communicate then and then I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.110" end="00:19:11.880" style="s2">that there could be real fruit to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.610" end="00:19:16.660" style="s2">found underneath that you know I agree</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.880" end="00:19:18.640" style="s2">both agreed to that right that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.660" end="00:19:21.070" style="s2">it&#39;s like if we need time apart we need</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.640" end="00:19:23.380" style="s2">time apart if we like what we probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.070" end="00:19:24.940" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t and can&#39;t do is keep showing</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.380" end="00:19:27.100" style="s2">up in rooms and dominating the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.940" end="00:19:28.810" style="s2">conversation with that conflict right</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.100" end="00:19:30.130" style="s2">then neither of us are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.810" end="00:19:31.600" style="s2">invited to the room you know and like</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.130" end="00:19:33.340" style="s2">everyone&#39;s gonna leave the room every</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.600" end="00:19:36.520" style="s2">time and literally leave us there by</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.340" end="00:19:38.440" style="s2">ourselves which is like oh I guess we</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.520" end="00:19:40.390" style="s2">did that right I guess we created the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.440" end="00:19:45.670" style="s2">space to deal with the conflict between</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.390" end="00:19:47.560" style="s2">us somehow I think you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.670" end="00:19:50.260" style="s2">important to point out that that often</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.560" end="00:19:53.090" style="s2">the the the whatever the conflict is it</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.260" end="00:19:54.860" style="s2">just gets repressed or sublimated and</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.090" end="00:19:56.600" style="s2">pushed somewhere else if you don&#39;t deal</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.860" end="00:19:59.420" style="s2">with it appropriately right that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.600" end="00:20:01.880" style="s2">things like terrorism you know or or</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.420" end="00:20:03.710" style="s2">white supremacy II come up and erupt</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.880" end="00:20:07.070" style="s2">because they&#39;re under the surface all</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.710" end="00:20:10.430" style="s2">the time and you know if we&#39;re fighting</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.070" end="00:20:14.030" style="s2">for like a post-conflict sort of society</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.430" end="00:20:17.360" style="s2">and and protocol mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.030" end="00:20:19.670" style="s2">you know we&#39;re not gonna get there if if</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.360" end="00:20:22.070" style="s2">we&#39;re not handling conflict properly</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.670" end="00:20:24.490" style="s2">right now you know and and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.070" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">I&#39;ve been like really critical of</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.490" end="00:20:29.690" style="s2">intellectual dark web types and and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:31.970" style="s2">their and their interlocutors because</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.690" end="00:20:33.500" style="s2">there&#39;s not a lot of conflict conflict</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.970" end="00:20:35.150" style="s2">resolution there&#39;s a lot of patting each</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.500" end="00:20:38.300" style="s2">other on the back there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.150" end="00:20:41.690" style="s2">saying controversial things that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.300" end="00:20:43.460" style="s2">that could totally be mediated by some</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.690" end="00:20:44.780" style="s2">other information or another another</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.460" end="00:20:47.170" style="s2">person you know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.780" end="00:20:50.570" style="s2">sensationalism there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.170" end="00:20:52.640" style="s2">attacking and I try not to attack people</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.570" end="00:20:55.250" style="s2">like critique right and then I get</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.640" end="00:20:56.960" style="s2">attacked because people don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.250" end="00:21:00.350" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.960" end="00:21:01.940" style="s2">but uh but but you know I agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.350" end="00:21:03.950" style="s2">your guys&#39;s sentiments that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.940" end="00:21:06.230" style="s2">find ways to go through you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.950" end="00:21:08.930" style="s2">to go through and and if it is a stark</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.230" end="00:21:11.210" style="s2">situation like if you have two racist</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.930" end="00:21:13.820" style="s2">really rate one racist person and one</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.210" end="00:21:16.850" style="s2">really progressive person if you could</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.820" end="00:21:18.560" style="s2">just you know bring them together mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.850" end="00:21:21.640" style="s2">and in with what their what their</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.560" end="00:21:23.960" style="s2">consent and in the right sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.640" end="00:21:25.910" style="s2">environment then then it would resolve</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.960" end="00:21:29.300" style="s2">it can resolve itself you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.910" end="00:21:30.530" style="s2">plenty of examples of this so I have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.300" end="00:21:32.270" style="s2">question for you bright because you had</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.530" end="00:21:34.280" style="s2">mentioned you&#39;d alluded to the in</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.270" end="00:21:35.720" style="s2">terrestrial dark web and that they I</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.280" end="00:21:37.070" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you called it you said</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.720" end="00:21:40.100" style="s2">that you critique and what was the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.070" end="00:21:41.450" style="s2">word that they attack attack what is</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.100" end="00:21:45.040" style="s2">because you said they don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.450" end="00:21:47.810" style="s2">difference what is the difference um so</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.040" end="00:21:50.990" style="s2">you know critique isn&#39;t is in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.810" end="00:21:53.540" style="s2">academic sense means you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.990" end="00:21:55.490" style="s2">you&#39;re carrying out a process which you</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.540" end="00:21:59.900" style="s2">know deconstruction is one part of it</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.490" end="00:22:01.670" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to UM like you know uh you</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.900" end="00:22:04.430" style="s2">know read between the lines and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.670" end="00:22:07.670" style="s2">interpolate what the author means and</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.430" end="00:22:09.770" style="s2">what the context is and all these things</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.670" end="00:22:12.020" style="s2">but but you know critique in that in</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.770" end="00:22:14.960" style="s2">this sense is part of a broader</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.020" end="00:22:20.120" style="s2">tradition right of of truth-seeking a</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.960" end="00:22:21.679" style="s2">free-thinking but but by and large what</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.120" end="00:22:23.120" style="s2">you&#39;re doing when you critique is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.679" end="00:22:26.720" style="s2">pointing out something that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.120" end="00:22:29.210" style="s2">untrue or wrong and that and that can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.720" end="00:22:33.830" style="s2">identified clearly and isolated you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.210" end="00:22:35.809" style="s2">and a lot of academic work you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.830" end="00:22:38.090" style="s2">especially what we call postmodern like</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.809" end="00:22:41.330" style="s2">it&#39;s very critical and it kind of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.090" end="00:22:43.070" style="s2">often stops at critique you know it</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.330" end="00:22:45.020" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t necessarily have the</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.070" end="00:22:47.000" style="s2">solution for the given problem but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.020" end="00:22:48.800" style="s2">but it&#39;s done everything they can to</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.000" end="00:22:51.440" style="s2">deconstruct you know hundreds of years</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.800" end="00:22:53.900" style="s2">of history and discourse and distill it</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.440" end="00:22:58.030" style="s2">into a salient observation that can move</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.900" end="00:23:00.679" style="s2">that critical discourse forward attack</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.030" end="00:23:02.809" style="s2">couldn&#39;t look very similar but it but it</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.679" end="00:23:05.200" style="s2">would be motivated for different reasons</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.809" end="00:23:07.910" style="s2">it would have different tactics it would</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.200" end="00:23:11.929" style="s2">you know could often include a lot of ad</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.910" end="00:23:14.420" style="s2">hominem type stuff and the ad hominem</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.929" end="00:23:17.600" style="s2">fallacy can go both ways to like you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.420" end="00:23:19.760" style="s2">you can uh you know make a comment about</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.600" end="00:23:21.890" style="s2">someone&#39;s character and it can it can</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.760" end="00:23:23.630" style="s2">totally undermine your own your own</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.890" end="00:23:25.429" style="s2">thesis you know you could be committing</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.630" end="00:23:27.020" style="s2">a fallacy but you can also make a</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.429" end="00:23:30.050" style="s2">comment about someone&#39;s character that</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.020" end="00:23:32.000" style="s2">is that is legitimately tied to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.050" end="00:23:35.390" style="s2">question right so if I make a remark</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:37.730" style="s2">about Trump that is that seems nasty or</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.390" end="00:23:40.910" style="s2">derogatory like there&#39;s a context there</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.730" end="00:23:43.010" style="s2">in which that personal attack is coupled</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.910" end="00:23:45.620" style="s2">with my with my greater critique right</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.010" end="00:23:48.170" style="s2">so it&#39;s not always clear that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.620" end="00:23:51.950" style="s2">fallacy if you if you insult or label</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.170" end="00:23:53.360" style="s2">somebody um but that&#39;s I I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.950" end="00:23:54.820" style="s2">hope that helps clarify the people I</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.360" end="00:23:58.280" style="s2">think there&#39;s there&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.820" end="00:23:59.720" style="s2">something there like I know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.280" end="00:24:02.809" style="s2">trying to do and get out into the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.720" end="00:24:04.400" style="s2">I recently had someone like critique me</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.809" end="00:24:06.440" style="s2">on my on my youtube channel I was like</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.400" end="00:24:09.470" style="s2">oh thanks for helping me clarify this I</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.440" end="00:24:11.300" style="s2">don&#39;t give it what you think about me as</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.470" end="00:24:13.280" style="s2">a human being I don&#39;t need your opinion</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.300" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">on me I don&#39;t need you to tell me to</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.280" end="00:24:16.890" style="s2">show up in a different way or what to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:19.650" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.890" end="00:24:21.059" style="s2">but the idea critique the idea I&#39;m down</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.650" end="00:24:22.470" style="s2">with critiquing the idea all day and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.059" end="00:24:24.510" style="s2">can critique me I&#39;m just not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.470" end="00:24:26.190" style="s2">listen I don&#39;t care I don&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.510" end="00:24:28.020" style="s2">unless you&#39;re someone who&#39;s put in time</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.190" end="00:24:32.610" style="s2">and put in even then probably like it</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.020" end="00:24:35.429" style="s2">has to come from within I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.610" end="00:24:37.920" style="s2">whether it&#39;s critique like what people</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.429" end="00:24:39.960" style="s2">say about Trump I just like Trump I</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.920" end="00:24:42.690" style="s2">think he&#39;s a horrible president I also</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.400" end="00:26:14.520" style="s2">I don&#39;t have access but see those people</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.570" end="00:26:16.530" style="s2">are engaging with the substance of my</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.520" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">work at all they&#39;re offended because</p>

<p begin="00:26:20.280" end="00:26:25.320" style="s2">basically surveyed the landscape of</p>

<p begin="00:26:27.690" end="00:26:31.920" style="s2">have over 60 citations</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.360" end="00:26:34.290" style="s2">many people have critiqued integral like</p>

<p begin="00:26:45.420" end="00:26:48.900" style="s2">know they just want Wilbur to weigh in</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.250" end="00:26:52.710" style="s2">on on the intellectual dark web or on</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.900" end="00:26:54.660" style="s2">politics and it&#39;s just empty a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.710" end="00:26:55.950" style="s2">conversation at that point like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.660" end="00:26:58.050" style="s2">not we&#39;re not getting anywhere because</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.950" end="00:27:00.000" style="s2">the critiques haven&#39;t been processed and</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.050" end="00:27:00.720" style="s2">in response people are just attacking</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.000" end="00:27:07.230" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.720" end="00:27:08.510" style="s2">can we ever protest for tips though no</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.230" end="00:27:11.160" style="s2">just in terms of the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.510" end="00:27:12.540" style="s2">attack and critique because I&#39;m not for</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.160" end="00:27:14.700" style="s2">me anywhere I don&#39;t think either of you</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.540" end="00:27:16.350" style="s2">have quite honed in on it i Brent you</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.700" end="00:27:19.800" style="s2">sort of alluded to it but I think a</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.350" end="00:27:22.080" style="s2">critique seeks to be constructive right</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.800" end="00:27:25.110" style="s2">it seeks to point out the flaws in</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.080" end="00:27:26.850" style="s2">something so that a deeper level of</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.110" end="00:27:28.650" style="s2">understanding can occur right this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.850" end="00:27:30.690" style="s2">where you&#39;ve gone wrong and maybe I have</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.650" end="00:27:32.370" style="s2">some solutions or maybe I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.690" end="00:27:34.650" style="s2">think offering solutions is necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.370" end="00:27:37.440" style="s2">a critique so long as the point is to</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.650" end="00:27:40.650" style="s2">constructively point out failings right</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.440" end="00:27:42.630" style="s2">whereas an attack constructive or not is</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.650" end="00:27:44.760" style="s2">irrelevant right the purpose of an</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.630" end="00:27:47.820" style="s2">attack is to bring the person down yet</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.760" end="00:27:50.430" style="s2">to make the person smaller or to make</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.820" end="00:27:53.280" style="s2">the idea smaller not for reasons of</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.430" end="00:27:55.110" style="s2">improving it but for reasons of seeking</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.280" end="00:27:57.150" style="s2">victory over it right but in some other</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.110" end="00:27:58.890" style="s2">way I think I think this is the it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.150" end="00:28:02.700" style="s2">this is the crucial difference between a</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.890" end="00:28:05.820" style="s2">critique and an attack in my view yeah a</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.700" end="00:28:07.580" style="s2">lot of I&#39;ll let you go but a lot of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.820" end="00:28:10.020" style="s2">lot of this academic critique is</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.580" end="00:28:12.030" style="s2">constructive in the sense and academics</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.020" end="00:28:13.980" style="s2">if they parse it correctly they</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.030" end="00:28:16.620" style="s2">appreciate it and they and it moves the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.980" end="00:28:17.730" style="s2">discourse forward but it doesn&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.620" end="00:28:19.680" style="s2">go that way go ahead David</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.730" end="00:28:22.080" style="s2">well it&#39;s interesting I noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.680" end="00:28:23.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple of I&#39;ve participated in</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.080" end="00:28:26.420" style="s2">early days of knowledge management</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.880" end="00:28:28.530" style="s2">knowledge of knowledge science</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.420" end="00:28:31.710" style="s2">discussions there were primarily</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.530" end="00:28:36.210" style="s2">academic in the tone there was did feel</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.710" end="00:28:38.850" style="s2">very much critical at a point of like</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.210" end="00:28:41.160" style="s2">walking right up to the line of ad</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.850" end="00:28:42.980" style="s2">hominem you know just almost calling you</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.160" end="00:28:46.610" style="s2">an idiot for believing something so</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.980" end="00:28:49.730" style="s2">inane has this right but it&#39;s an in it</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.610" end="00:28:51.200" style="s2">in it was it was difficult to read but</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.730" end="00:28:54.350" style="s2">you know then that could notice that</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.200" end="00:28:56.510" style="s2">actually they&#39;re not taking offense at</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.350" end="00:28:58.789" style="s2">each other when they do that that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.510" end="00:29:00.169" style="s2">of the environment that&#39;s the way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.789" end="00:29:01.760" style="s2">the culture that they have with each</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.169" end="00:29:04.070" style="s2">other so there&#39;s something in that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.760" end="00:29:06.200" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of understood and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.070" end="00:29:08.960" style="s2">in the broader audience so that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.200" end="00:29:14.000" style="s2">difference between critique and attack</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.960" end="00:29:15.440" style="s2">can be more difficult to discern but but</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.000" end="00:29:18.649" style="s2">I&#39;ll say there&#39;s something else that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.440" end="00:29:20.570" style="s2">really kind of intriguing here I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.649" end="00:29:22.100" style="s2">reading the book by Donald Hoffman</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.570" end="00:29:23.750" style="s2">called the case against reality and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.100" end="00:29:25.669" style="s2">there&#39;s an interview that he did that</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.750" end="00:29:30.250" style="s2">was a very fascinating interview which</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.669" end="00:29:32.600" style="s2">he said we like to think that reason is</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.250" end="00:29:35.659" style="s2">useful because it helps us get to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.600" end="00:29:37.970" style="s2">truth and he said I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.659" end="00:29:39.950" style="s2">actually the purpose of reason the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.970" end="00:29:42.139" style="s2">purpose of reason is to get larger</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.950" end="00:29:45.139" style="s2">numbers of a group of people to agree</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.139" end="00:29:47.210" style="s2">with each other in the way of it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.139" end="00:29:49.580" style="s2">evolutionary benefit because we need to</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.210" end="00:29:53.000" style="s2">coordinate our actions and so if someone</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.580" end="00:29:57.260" style="s2">is persuasive they align collectives</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.000" end="00:30:00.260" style="s2">more and that&#39;s effective and we respond</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.260" end="00:30:03.679" style="s2">positively to that and in a way this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.260" end="00:30:07.760" style="s2">it&#39;s to confuse that with truth gets</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.679" end="00:30:09.679" style="s2">into the place where if I disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.760" end="00:30:12.919" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying it feels like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.679" end="00:30:14.720" style="s2">attacking my truth and that starts to</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.919" end="00:30:16.760" style="s2">feel personal even if it&#39;s a critique</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.720" end="00:30:18.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s an interesting thing to notice</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.760" end="00:30:20.120" style="s2">it&#39;s like when I look at it one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.440" end="00:30:22.580" style="s2">other examples that he gives in that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.120" end="00:30:24.919" style="s2">the jewel beetle in Australia that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.580" end="00:30:26.210" style="s2">attracted to beer bottles and almost</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.919" end="00:30:28.340" style="s2">went extinct because the beer bottles</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.210" end="00:30:29.360" style="s2">look like the female and the beetles</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.340" end="00:30:32.570" style="s2">preferred to mate with beer bottles</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.360" end="00:30:34.789" style="s2">rather than the natural females so in</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.570" end="00:30:37.460" style="s2">some way you could say the same thing of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.789" end="00:30:40.669" style="s2">a human beings we are attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.460" end="00:30:43.039" style="s2">debate even when it doesn&#39;t actually get</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.669" end="00:30:45.620" style="s2">us closer to truth and so we end up</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.039" end="00:30:47.779" style="s2">trying to make with this with this</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.620" end="00:30:49.100" style="s2">ideology it&#39;s like and that&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.779" end="00:30:52.250" style="s2">actually produce anything that&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.100" end="00:30:53.629" style="s2">that&#39;s only doing something to our brain</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.250" end="00:30:54.520" style="s2">chemicals but it&#39;s actually not moving</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.629" end="00:30:56.200" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.520" end="00:30:58.930" style="s2">important so this this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.200" end="00:31:01.210" style="s2">reasons I like John drove a key and his</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.930" end="00:31:03.370" style="s2">view of wisdom cultivation and looking</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.210" end="00:31:04.420" style="s2">at how do we avoid bullshit and</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.370" end="00:31:06.310" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.420" end="00:31:08.290" style="s2">on an individual level in a collective</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.310" end="00:31:10.240" style="s2">level and it&#39;s a very challenging thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.290" end="00:31:13.380" style="s2">to do especially given that that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.240" end="00:31:16.810" style="s2">perspective yeah I love that David</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.380" end="00:31:19.660" style="s2">because there&#39;s there&#39;s a piece of I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.810" end="00:31:22.360" style="s2">loved debate debates I enjoy being in</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.660" end="00:31:24.670" style="s2">one or at least I did and it was very</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.360" end="00:31:26.560" style="s2">much that it was like getting my truth</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.670" end="00:31:28.450" style="s2">right like like convincing you of my</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.560" end="00:31:29.740" style="s2">siding quite frankly when I was good at</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.450" end="00:31:31.660" style="s2">it I could do I could convince you of</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.740" end="00:31:33.310" style="s2">either side and it&#39;s like well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.660" end="00:31:35.200" style="s2">not actually looking for the truth and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.310" end="00:31:36.310" style="s2">think that what I was I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.200" end="00:31:38.530" style="s2">what Brent had said I was like well how</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.310" end="00:31:40.330" style="s2">do we actually do that like like moving</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.530" end="00:31:41.980" style="s2">the discourse forward I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.330" end="00:31:46.750" style="s2">ever moved the discourse forward all</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.980" end="00:31:48.280" style="s2">because there is no like we can have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.750" end="00:31:50.410" style="s2">debate on climate change and no matter</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.280" end="00:31:52.450" style="s2">what we came to it&#39;s not actually gonna</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.410" end="00:31:53.890" style="s2">move the climate forward right like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.450" end="00:31:56.680" style="s2">not actually gonna move that it&#39;ll move</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.890" end="00:31:58.780" style="s2">us forward as individuals you know what</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.680" end="00:31:59.920" style="s2">I mean like we might change our idea but</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.780" end="00:32:01.780" style="s2">it&#39;s like people who are like do your</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.920" end="00:32:03.490" style="s2">research I&#39;m like what is the freaking</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.780" end="00:32:06.370" style="s2">point you could spend thousands of hours</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.490" end="00:32:08.200" style="s2">doing your research and you still the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.370" end="00:32:09.420" style="s2">other person didn&#39;t do that research and</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.200" end="00:32:13.060" style="s2">they don&#39;t trust you like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.420" end="00:32:14.980" style="s2">seeking the truth and finding ways to</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.060" end="00:32:16.480" style="s2">look at what is true and how much</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.980" end="00:32:19.180" style="s2">evidence is there for this side how much</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.480" end="00:32:21.250" style="s2">evidence is for this side including the</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.180" end="00:32:22.750" style="s2">very beautiful gray space of right</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.250" end="00:32:25.390" style="s2">there&#39;s always evidence for both sides</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.750" end="00:32:27.580" style="s2">even the here&#39;s what that evidence is</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.390" end="00:32:32.560" style="s2">and then like then that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.580" end="00:32:34.150" style="s2">helpful this is kinda the whole problem</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.560" end="00:32:36.130" style="s2">with debate though isn&#39;t it is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.150" end="00:32:37.660" style="s2">there are only ever two propositions on</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.130" end="00:32:40.000" style="s2">the table in opposition to each other</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.660" end="00:32:41.260" style="s2">there is no room for new propositions to</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.000" end="00:32:43.060" style="s2">emerge during the course of the debate</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.260" end="00:32:44.860" style="s2">and for both sides oh you know what</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.060" end="00:32:48.190" style="s2">that&#39;s a fucking much better idea than</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.860" end="00:32:50.260" style="s2">either of them you know this this is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.190" end="00:32:51.700" style="s2">fundamental restrictive nature of debate</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.260" end="00:32:54.540" style="s2">as opposed to discussion I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.700" end="00:32:56.740" style="s2">good-faith discussion between</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.540" end="00:32:59.230" style="s2">knowledgeable open-minded people</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.740" end="00:33:00.370" style="s2">actually willing to change their view</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.230" end="00:33:02.680" style="s2">during the course of the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.370" end="00:33:05.410" style="s2">you&#39;re in this this is how you get</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.680" end="00:33:07.390" style="s2">closer to truth debates are exactly as</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.410" end="00:33:08.600" style="s2">David said they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re its</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.390" end="00:33:10.190" style="s2">masturbation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.600" end="00:33:12.890" style="s2">intellectual masturbation is all it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.190" end="00:33:15.410" style="s2">really there there is no striving for</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.890" end="00:33:17.540" style="s2">truth in that format in my opinion yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.410" end="00:33:20.270" style="s2">I can add to this and it&#39;s especially if</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.540" end="00:33:22.250" style="s2">you take debate just by itself right</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.270" end="00:33:24.380" style="s2">that it&#39;s that it&#39;s dysfunctional and</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.250" end="00:33:26.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s largely what we&#39;ve done in</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.380" end="00:33:31.040" style="s2">society and there&#39;s this model of debate</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.720" end="00:33:33.800" style="s2">dialogue and deliberation which sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.040" end="00:33:35.750" style="s2">takes the three together you know and</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.800" end="00:33:37.220" style="s2">then there then the flaws of you cancel</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.750" end="00:33:39.320" style="s2">each other out like like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.220" end="00:33:41.330" style="s2">problems with direct democracy to where</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.320" end="00:33:44.360" style="s2">people just vote on everything and have</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.330" end="00:33:46.910" style="s2">a direct say-so you know you need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.360" end="00:33:49.480" style="s2">have debates but also deliberation and</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.910" end="00:33:55.580" style="s2">dialogue right and it creates this more</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.480" end="00:33:57.740" style="s2">complex kind of methodology to foster</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.580" end="00:34:00.110" style="s2">and generate higher truths right and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.740" end="00:34:03.560" style="s2">like you&#39;re saying I think debates by</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.110" end="00:34:06.980" style="s2">themselves uh might take us backwards in</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.560" end="00:34:08.540" style="s2">many cases something there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.980" end="00:34:12.860" style="s2">here that&#39;s really kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.540" end="00:34:15.440" style="s2">and brynn want to challenge you a little</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.860" end="00:34:16.880" style="s2">bit and in generally like I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.440" end="00:34:18.500" style="s2">there&#39;s that there&#39;s something about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.880" end="00:34:22.670" style="s2">quality of the interaction between us</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.500" end="00:34:24.440" style="s2">for this different imagine if David</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.670" end="00:34:27.250" style="s2">fuller had dialed in and was part of</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.440" end="00:34:31.700" style="s2">this conversation when he spoke your</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.250" end="00:34:34.220" style="s2">response to him would I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.700" end="00:34:36.950" style="s2">don&#39;t know this but my guess is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.220" end="00:34:38.270" style="s2">there would be something of the previous</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.950" end="00:34:40.100" style="s2">interaction that you&#39;ve had that would</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.270" end="00:34:41.720" style="s2">come into this conversation for sure</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.100" end="00:34:43.850" style="s2">first it would be and it would be</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.720" end="00:34:45.890" style="s2">challenging to actually meet the merit</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.850" end="00:34:47.780" style="s2">of the discussion on the table because</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.890" end="00:34:48.950" style="s2">wait a minute I don&#39;t care what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.780" end="00:34:51.080" style="s2">saying now what you said of the past</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.950" end="00:34:54.500" style="s2">invalidates that and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.080" end="00:34:57.050" style="s2">about that which seems to challenge the</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.500" end="00:34:59.300" style="s2">clear distinction between attacking and</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.050" end="00:35:02.990" style="s2">critiquing so there&#39;s something in that</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.300" end="00:35:04.940" style="s2">that that so I mentioned that as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.990" end="00:35:08.030" style="s2">a as a point that is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.940" end="00:35:09.410" style="s2">thing to notice and then also that</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.030" end="00:35:11.570" style="s2">there&#39;s something that I have imagined</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.410" end="00:35:14.300" style="s2">happening in a game be world I have an</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.570" end="00:35:15.620" style="s2">internal model that we&#39;re moving to kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.300" end="00:35:19.910" style="s2">of an adult space</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.620" end="00:35:22.339" style="s2">I say adult I mean mature that in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.910" end="00:35:24.920" style="s2">kind of a growing space there is</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.339" end="00:35:30.319" style="s2">more attacking debating kind of a model</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.920" end="00:35:32.779" style="s2">we are we do respond like mating beetles</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.319" end="00:35:35.029" style="s2">when debate happens and get confused</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.779" end="00:35:36.650" style="s2">whereas if you get to a level of</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.029" end="00:35:37.940" style="s2">maturation where it&#39;s like okay it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.650" end="00:35:40.609" style="s2">all about sex it&#39;s I&#39;m not gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.940" end="00:35:42.109" style="s2">distracted by the debate tactics I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.609" end="00:35:45.049" style="s2">actually gonna see what are the issues</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.109" end="00:35:46.999" style="s2">are we moving anything is there a new</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.049" end="00:35:49.999" style="s2">idea of emerging out of this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.999" end="00:35:52.160" style="s2">and there&#39;s something that I feel that</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.999" end="00:35:54.019" style="s2">is possible with that it&#39;s a challenge</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.160" end="00:35:57.229" style="s2">we&#39;re in it we feels like we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.019" end="00:35:59.180" style="s2">transitionary period and so even in like</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.229" end="00:36:01.099" style="s2">the game be Facebook group where it</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.180" end="00:36:04.130" style="s2">blows up all kinds of stuff happened it</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.099" end="00:36:05.989" style="s2">looks to me on the surface just like</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.130" end="00:36:08.059" style="s2">something that happened in the past with</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.989" end="00:36:10.789" style="s2">flame wars in the early days but it</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.059" end="00:36:13.880" style="s2">actually has it looks like we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.789" end="00:36:15.769" style="s2">developing a kind of collective immune</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.880" end="00:36:18.589" style="s2">system for how to deal with this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.769" end="00:36:20.479" style="s2">early days so it still has flaws but it</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.589" end="00:36:21.979" style="s2">starts to move towards trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.479" end="00:36:25.219" style="s2">out how do we actually do this without</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.979" end="00:36:29.960" style="s2">getting off into other shape yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.219" end="00:36:32.630" style="s2">think I think that&#39;s right part of my</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.960" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">problem and this is gonna make me sound</p>

<p begin="00:36:35.200" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">hmm kind of like a snob or whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.319" end="00:36:44.779" style="s2">I don&#39;t I don&#39;t care it&#39;s that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.079" end="00:36:47.029" style="s2">people in these groups I kind of expect</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.779" end="00:36:49.969" style="s2">more from them and that&#39;s a compliment</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.029" end="00:36:52.670" style="s2">you know like like in one sense what you</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.969" end="00:36:54.529" style="s2">said is absolutely true like we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.670" end="00:36:57.049" style="s2">just figuring this out like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.529" end="00:36:58.999" style="s2">emerging like you know we have we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.049" end="00:37:00.440" style="s2">to kind of trust the process but on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.999" end="00:37:03.410" style="s2">other hand like a lot of this stuff goes</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.440" end="00:37:05.269" style="s2">back 10 years and it&#39;s like it wasn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:37:05.269" end="00:37:11.479" style="s2">like 50 years before I was even born um</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.759" end="00:37:13.609" style="s2">you know and and it comes to these these</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.479" end="00:37:16.400" style="s2">uh mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.609" end="00:37:20.029" style="s2">not intersections but kind of um kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.400" end="00:37:22.099" style="s2">you know collisions where things in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.029" end="00:37:23.989" style="s2">past just weren&#39;t adequately addressed</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.099" end="00:37:25.789" style="s2">and it&#39;s like well I I told you so like</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.989" end="00:37:27.170" style="s2">this this was a ticking time bomb you</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.789" end="00:37:28.609" style="s2">know and I think I think right now</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.170" end="00:37:31.279" style="s2">what&#39;s going on race is one of those</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.609" end="00:37:34.039" style="s2">issues and it ties directly into the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.279" end="00:37:36.020" style="s2">intellectual dark web stuff because they</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.039" end="00:37:39.230" style="s2">bought into the</p>

<p begin="00:37:46.430" end="00:37:50.930" style="s2">justice right from within sociology and</p>

<p begin="00:39:26.390" end="00:39:30.859" style="s2">but when you try to share that with</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.500" end="00:39:32.810" style="s2">people they get defensive right and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.859" end="00:39:34.840" style="s2">it&#39;s like we&#39;re for white people here</p>

<p begin="00:41:44.090" end="00:41:50.270" style="s2">we all have moments of whether there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.660" end="00:41:51.950" style="s2">love there or not we have moments where</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.270" end="00:41:55.070" style="s2">we show up poorly and moments where we</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.950" end="00:41:56.330" style="s2">show up well and just like the Star Trek</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.070" end="00:41:57.830" style="s2">or you know the guy was a dick to the</p>

<p begin="00:41:57.830" end="00:42:02.000" style="s2">bringing that back in repeatedly like</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.990" end="00:42:04.099" style="s2">just cuz someone did one thing wrong</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.000" end="00:42:06.440" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean ignore it it but like</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.099" end="00:42:08.030" style="s2">keep bringing it back to that same point</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.440" end="00:42:09.710" style="s2">again and again keeps bringing that back</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.030" end="00:42:13.040" style="s2">in as opposed to like where can we find</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.710" end="00:42:14.420" style="s2">the common ground here and I also the Ln</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.040" end="00:42:16.190" style="s2">George Bush thing I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.420" end="00:42:17.270" style="s2">really big difference cuz I don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="00:42:20.930" end="00:42:26.320" style="s2">in the face it&#39;s very different in</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.930" end="00:42:27.590" style="s2">person and on video to come off</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.320" end="00:42:29.930" style="s2">confrontational</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.590" end="00:42:31.430" style="s2">then in type or one you&#39;re reading into</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.930" end="00:42:34.550" style="s2">every like we can get much more</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.430" end="00:42:36.920" style="s2">information by tone of voice and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.550" end="00:42:38.990" style="s2">know then we can in written word and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.920" end="00:42:41.030" style="s2">you like someone type something we make</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.990" end="00:42:44.900" style="s2">it mean something and it goes you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.030" end="00:42:48.470" style="s2">it goes back and forth and risk there</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.900" end="00:42:50.720" style="s2">was something about the risk that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.470" end="00:42:53.359" style="s2">would mention the Occupy movement and</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.720" end="00:42:55.160" style="s2">how with social justice back during that</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.359" end="00:42:57.170" style="s2">time period it was a risk to take that</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.160" end="00:42:59.450" style="s2">on and now that everyone&#39;s kind of come</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.170" end="00:43:02.150" style="s2">on board and it becomes the like meta</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.450" end="00:43:04.280" style="s2">society it&#39;s actually risky to not be</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.150" end="00:43:05.900" style="s2">right not not to go back to racism</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.280" end="00:43:08.300" style="s2">because that&#39;s risky to for sure like to</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.900" end="00:43:12.260" style="s2">go back to pre social justice is risky</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.300" end="00:43:15.140" style="s2">but so is to go beyond it to say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.260" end="00:43:17.119" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t quite get to it like police</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.140" end="00:43:18.770" style="s2">in everyone&#39;s language isn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.119" end="00:43:20.810" style="s2">helping us evolve it&#39;s not helping</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.770" end="00:43:23.060" style="s2">people be less racist less homophobic</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.810" end="00:43:27.260" style="s2">it&#39;s just covering it up and it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.060" end="00:43:29.300" style="s2">out in every other way and so all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.260" end="00:43:31.490" style="s2">those people are right like if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.300" end="00:43:33.230" style="s2">racism you truly can&#39;t see that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.490" end="00:43:34.880" style="s2">social justice piece and when you&#39;re in</p>

<p begin="00:43:36.320" end="00:43:41.900" style="s2">all his faults has given me is that pre</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.869" end="00:43:44.300" style="s2">trans policy of like when you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.900" end="00:43:46.520" style="s2">middle the for the this looks the same</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.300" end="00:43:49.580" style="s2">right these people who&#39;ve gone beyond</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.520" end="00:43:52.760" style="s2">social justice look like the Ku Klux</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.580" end="00:43:54.530" style="s2">Klan right and they&#39;re not they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.760" end="00:43:55.970" style="s2">wait there&#39;s more nuance here there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.530" end="00:43:57.589" style="s2">more and yet we do need to have those</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.970" end="00:44:00.170" style="s2">conversations that work for white people</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.589" end="00:44:01.790" style="s2">talking about game B needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.170" end="00:44:04.280" style="s2">discussed and discussed more option and</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.790" end="00:44:06.920" style="s2">the gender and the ability and like all</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.280" end="00:44:09.260" style="s2">of that but also are the four of us</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.920" end="00:44:12.050" style="s2">gonna solve racism we have other things</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.260" end="00:44:13.880" style="s2">to solve like not the racism doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.050" end="00:44:15.810" style="s2">need to be solved that&#39;s huge but like</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.880" end="00:44:17.760" style="s2">we&#39;re can&#39;t even see it</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.810" end="00:44:20.430" style="s2">in it so like those people those people</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.760" end="00:44:22.230" style="s2">do need to solve it and ask for help</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.430" end="00:44:22.830" style="s2">instead of just like it&#39;s wrong do</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.230" end="00:44:25.190" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.830" end="00:44:27.480" style="s2">what does better look like because how</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.190" end="00:44:29.150" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna butcher is name if I say</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.480" end="00:44:33.000" style="s2">it showed up in the game beast face</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.150" end="00:44:34.770" style="s2">wasn&#39;t great I am all for like we need</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.000" end="00:44:36.510" style="s2">to keep having these conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.770" end="00:44:39.690" style="s2">like yes people are dying in the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.510" end="00:44:42.150" style="s2">is burning its poor and people of color</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.690" end="00:44:45.060" style="s2">who are getting the vast majority of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.150" end="00:44:47.730" style="s2">outcome but then let&#39;s empower them</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.060" end="00:44:49.320" style="s2">because he&#39;s also rich right he actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.730" end="00:44:51.030" style="s2">has more power than I do he could</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.320" end="00:44:53.130" style="s2">actually create the thing that I have in</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.030" end="00:44:55.590" style="s2">my head he&#39;s creating his own thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.130" end="00:44:57.630" style="s2">like it isn&#39;t you don&#39;t get to like</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.590" end="00:44:59.520" style="s2">stamp your social justice thing on</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.630" end="00:45:01.050" style="s2">everything right like Ray says I&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.520" end="00:45:03.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like you do because that&#39;s you as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.050" end="00:45:04.740" style="s2">human being but also like what about</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.180" end="00:45:07.200" style="s2">ableism it&#39;s everywhere what about</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.740" end="00:45:08.880" style="s2">classism right like all this like well</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.200" end="00:45:10.230" style="s2">it has to you first need to succeed a</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.880" end="00:45:12.900" style="s2">game a before you can participate in</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.230" end="00:45:14.850" style="s2">game B or suck so badly at it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.900" end="00:45:18.120" style="s2">kind of on disability right like or you</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.850" end="00:45:20.400" style="s2">know like that that level and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.120" end="00:45:23.070" style="s2">be working in all areas all of them</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.400" end="00:45:24.630" style="s2">which means my job maybe isn&#39;t racism</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.070" end="00:45:26.700" style="s2">but I can&#39;t stand in the way of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.630" end="00:45:30.810" style="s2">people who are doing it I&#39;m sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.700" end="00:45:32.870" style="s2">think I&#39;ve talked for a long time yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.810" end="00:45:36.900" style="s2">think those are really good points and</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.870" end="00:45:38.670" style="s2">it&#39;s again it&#39;s nuanced and complex in</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.900" end="00:45:40.680" style="s2">the way that we deal with this in some</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.670" end="00:45:42.690" style="s2">way you know I want to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.680" end="00:45:44.190" style="s2">earlier and looking at I loved Brett</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.690" end="00:45:46.920" style="s2">when you mentioned about education needs</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.190" end="00:45:50.240" style="s2">to change and again you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.920" end="00:45:52.740" style="s2">something that my my view is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.240" end="00:45:54.750" style="s2">everything that we see from our</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.740" end="00:45:56.490" style="s2">perspective right now colors the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.750" end="00:45:58.860" style="s2">potential that we see in the future in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.490" end="00:46:00.600" style="s2">way that minimizes it way beyond what an</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.860" end="00:46:03.240" style="s2">actual what the actual potential is so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.600" end="00:46:06.240" style="s2">see education as being more specialized</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.240" end="00:46:08.790" style="s2">to people&#39;s interests and abilities very</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.240" end="00:46:11.580" style="s2">very hyper focused on on certain things</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.790" end="00:46:15.030" style="s2">while maintaining you know a general</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.580" end="00:46:17.250" style="s2">competency but we have so much so much</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.030" end="00:46:20.490" style="s2">that&#39;s included that general sameness in</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.250" end="00:46:23.490" style="s2">a standardized way that we miss the</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.490" end="00:46:25.350" style="s2">brilliance and genius of the potential</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.490" end="00:46:28.140" style="s2">that could be developing in individuals</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.350" end="00:46:28.839" style="s2">and it&#39;s a I think the the waste of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.140" end="00:46:31.839" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.839" end="00:46:34.809" style="s2">huge and clearly now it seems like you</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.839" end="00:46:36.130" style="s2">are outweighing you know the scales have</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.809" end="00:46:37.479" style="s2">tipped in me and the balance in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.130" end="00:46:39.249" style="s2">opposite direction that we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.479" end="00:46:42.130" style="s2">harming ourselves rather than benefiting</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.249" end="00:46:44.019" style="s2">ourselves and technology allows us to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.130" end="00:46:46.210" style="s2">something like that but it&#39;s tricky as</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.019" end="00:46:47.920" style="s2">well because as you start to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.210" end="00:46:50.380" style="s2">differentiate different educational</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.920" end="00:46:52.119" style="s2">modalities and groups and things like</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.380" end="00:46:53.589" style="s2">that you may get kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.119" end="00:46:56.920" style="s2">specialization which doesn&#39;t include</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.589" end="00:46:58.539" style="s2">other parts of it so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a I</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.920" end="00:47:02.049" style="s2">think we&#39;re in that fascinating place</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.539" end="00:47:04.569" style="s2">where we can&#39;t police I like what you</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.049" end="00:47:07.180" style="s2">said - and the somewhere that if we get</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.569" end="00:47:08.739" style="s2">to try and complete please tone too much</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.180" end="00:47:11.200" style="s2">then we&#39;re missing something you need to</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.739" end="00:47:15.069" style="s2">look at the content but tone does matter</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.200" end="00:47:17.200" style="s2">and so does the ability to differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.069" end="00:47:18.819" style="s2">so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.200" end="00:47:20.259" style="s2">thing I think this is what you said you</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.819" end="00:47:22.660" style="s2">believe that we can&#39;t really say too</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.259" end="00:47:24.009" style="s2">much about what somebody else can or</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.660" end="00:47:25.509" style="s2">can&#39;t talk about what they should or</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.009" end="00:47:27.849" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t talk about you can say that</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.509" end="00:47:32.200" style="s2">but we can&#39;t police the content of other</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.849" end="00:47:34.690" style="s2">people&#39;s conversations yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.200" end="00:47:36.880" style="s2">can I can I just pick up on the notion</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.690" end="00:47:37.930" style="s2">of tone because I mean I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.880" end="00:47:39.130" style="s2">absolutely right we shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.930" end="00:47:43.719" style="s2">policing time you should be policing</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.130" end="00:47:46.680" style="s2">content but tone is it&#39;s not just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.719" end="00:47:49.299" style="s2">not just tone if someone is unable to</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.680" end="00:47:52.509" style="s2">moderate their tone to keep their</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.299" end="00:47:56.579" style="s2">discourse within and I&#39;m not just</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.509" end="00:47:56.579" style="s2">talking about narrow you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.059" end="00:48:03.099" style="s2">fundamentalist parameters but I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.079" end="00:48:05.589" style="s2">broadest you know social parameters of</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.099" end="00:48:07.539" style="s2">polite discourse kind of thing if people</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.589" end="00:48:09.579" style="s2">are unable to moderate their tone to</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.539" end="00:48:12.789" style="s2">stay within those boundaries it</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.579" end="00:48:14.619" style="s2">undermines something about their</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.789" end="00:48:17.079" style="s2">character do you see what I mean it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.619" end="00:48:19.359" style="s2">it isn&#39;t just the tone itself that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.079" end="00:48:26.950" style="s2">it&#39;s the inability to moderate tone</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.359" end="00:48:28.420" style="s2">points to a weakness in character my</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.950" end="00:48:30.549" style="s2">willingness to listen to what they have</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.420" end="00:48:31.989" style="s2">to say do you see what I mean oh it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.549" end="00:48:33.729" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting notion</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.989" end="00:48:36.519" style="s2">I&#39;ll just modify it slightly not so much</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.729" end="00:48:38.440" style="s2">character but development so yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.519" end="00:48:40.089" style="s2">yes I agree I prefer that yes I prefer</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.440" end="00:48:42.080" style="s2">that to this it kind of goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.089" end="00:48:46.040" style="s2">Berkeley and the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.080" end="00:48:48.410" style="s2">ah they&#39;re not able to see how to</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.040" end="00:48:49.850" style="s2">moderate town or whatever in this month</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.410" end="00:48:52.490" style="s2">they&#39;re not able to moderate and see</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.850" end="00:48:55.370" style="s2">what see another perspective it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.490" end="00:48:57.230" style="s2">a challenge that is like okay so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.370" end="00:48:59.510" style="s2">they just development into there maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.230" end="00:49:02.200" style="s2">the baby can maybe we can find some way</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.510" end="00:49:05.300" style="s2">to to bridge that gap between them and</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.200" end="00:49:06.580" style="s2">maybe we can&#39;t you know I think Chris is</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.300" end="00:49:09.080" style="s2">know the Berkeley thing again is</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.580" end="00:49:10.040" style="s2">thinking about that if everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.080" end="00:49:11.960" style="s2">trying to help Marc play in Berkeley</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.040" end="00:49:13.910" style="s2">just says you know what screw you</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.960" end="00:49:17.090" style="s2">I like this leave me alone I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.910" end="00:49:18.040" style="s2">a problem then then it&#39;s like okay what</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.090" end="00:49:20.720" style="s2">do we do about that</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.040" end="00:49:23.420" style="s2">is there something for us as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.720" end="00:49:25.700" style="s2">collective to to intervene and try to</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.420" end="00:49:28.220" style="s2">say something else needs to be done it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.700" end="00:49:31.310" style="s2">a it&#39;s an interesting again nuance here</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.220" end="00:49:33.890" style="s2">about the way that things fall out and</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.310" end="00:49:37.100" style="s2">in collective and individual rights</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.890" end="00:49:38.420" style="s2">right and I think that is the back to</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.100" end="00:49:39.890" style="s2">the Berkeley like I have an actually I</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.420" end="00:49:43.430" style="s2">can&#39;t remember the recall at that</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.890" end="00:49:46.850" style="s2">episode but I think addiction in our</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.430" end="00:49:48.620" style="s2">society is such a hot point because</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.850" end="00:49:50.870" style="s2">we&#39;re all addicted to something we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.620" end="00:49:53.720" style="s2">see more addicted to game a right like I</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.870" end="00:49:55.250" style="s2">mean we don&#39;t so then we reflected on</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.720" end="00:49:56.660" style="s2">like well that&#39;s a heroin user and how</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.250" end="00:49:58.220" style="s2">dare they and how like they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.660" end="00:49:59.570" style="s2">picking that over their kids well there</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.220" end="00:50:00.980" style="s2">you are you picking it you&#39;re picking</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.570" end="00:50:02.990" style="s2">your job you don&#39;t I mean like your job</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.980" end="00:50:05.690" style="s2">over your kid you&#39;re picking like we</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.990" end="00:50:07.370" style="s2">were being in in my addiction and I own</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.690" end="00:50:10.750" style="s2">my addictions at least the ones I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.370" end="00:50:13.250" style="s2">blind to its needy on pot and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.750" end="00:50:15.740" style="s2">and yet they&#39;re there for a reason they</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.250" end="00:50:17.750" style="s2">are like they&#39;ll not in Star Trek time</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.740" end="00:50:19.130" style="s2">right if I&#39;m in game B and I still have</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.750" end="00:50:20.930" style="s2">that that I need to even look deeper</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.130" end="00:50:23.870" style="s2">because it&#39;s like it&#39;s covering up pain</p>

<p begin="00:50:55.940" end="00:51:00.079" style="s2">what the actual effect is on them</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.039" end="00:51:01.549" style="s2">instead of just like you&#39;re not allowed</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.079" end="00:51:04.010" style="s2">to have addictions you&#39;re not allowed to</p>

<p begin="00:51:04.010" end="00:51:08.630" style="s2">and then letting the person be empowered</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.049" end="00:51:10.190" style="s2">to come out of it to be like okay that</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.630" end="00:51:12.650" style="s2">was a fun three months on the holodeck</p>

<p begin="00:51:12.650" end="00:51:17.450" style="s2">it&#39;s costing me something and then they</p>

<p begin="00:51:17.450" end="00:51:21.410" style="s2">because if what&#39;s costing you is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.819" end="00:51:25.099" style="s2">love and affection of your family and</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.410" end="00:51:26.930" style="s2">friends it&#39;s the cost in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.099" end="00:51:28.579" style="s2">is the reason to have more of it right</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.930" end="00:51:30.200" style="s2">as opposed to listen we love you we</p>

<p begin="00:51:41.750" end="00:51:45.890" style="s2">all that we need people not to be</p>

<p begin="00:51:45.890" end="00:51:50.299" style="s2">and so how can we be present for them in</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.440" end="00:51:53.420" style="s2">that in the most empowering way for them</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.299" end="00:51:55.369" style="s2">without putting our you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.420" end="00:51:56.900" style="s2">really interesting point here which is I</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.369" end="00:51:58.910" style="s2">thought about it in the past and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.900" end="00:52:01.369" style="s2">just coming up now is that what I</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.910" end="00:52:05.020" style="s2">imagine game B is going to be better at</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.369" end="00:52:07.339" style="s2">is actually being aware of our</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.020" end="00:52:09.349" style="s2">externalities and minimizing the</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.339" end="00:52:12.260" style="s2">externalities and this way there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.349" end="00:52:14.390" style="s2">some relational externalities I say I</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.260" end="00:52:15.559" style="s2">say my addictions are fine but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.390" end="00:52:18.470" style="s2">paying attention to the impact on my</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.559" end="00:52:19.970" style="s2">family organizationally we say plastic</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.470" end="00:52:21.349" style="s2">fine but we&#39;re not paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.970" end="00:52:22.880" style="s2">the extreme elegies on the environment</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.349" end="00:52:25.220" style="s2">you know there are lots of things that</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.880" end="00:52:26.329" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to say well it&#39;s fine but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.220" end="00:52:29.480" style="s2">not really paying attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.329" end="00:52:30.740" style="s2">larger cost of it it seems like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.480" end="00:52:33.079" style="s2">see the problem so it&#39;s not my problem</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.740" end="00:52:34.309" style="s2">to deal with but if there is a way that</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.079" end="00:52:36.470" style="s2">we can actually collectively</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.309" end="00:52:39.529" style="s2">reflectively see the impact that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.470" end="00:52:42.260" style="s2">having and notice that this behavior is</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.529" end="00:52:44.690" style="s2">tied to this thing and there&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.260" end="00:52:49.130" style="s2">a way to manage that you know how are</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.690" end="00:52:51.260" style="s2">you responding to that impact if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.130" end="00:52:53.240" style="s2">not then we need to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.260" end="00:52:55.579" style="s2">have do something we need in it at some</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.240" end="00:52:57.950" style="s2">point intervene perhaps but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.579" end="00:52:59.779" style="s2">something that is based on the actual</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.950" end="00:53:02.779" style="s2">aspect of that I think it&#39;s over I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.779" end="00:53:04.460" style="s2">it&#39;s some it is sci-fi and kind of too</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.779" end="00:53:07.130" style="s2">optimistic to believe that we can</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.460" end="00:53:08.230" style="s2">monitor monitor everything and have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.130" end="00:53:09.520" style="s2">real good</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.230" end="00:53:11.140" style="s2">objective view on what the impacts that</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.520" end="00:53:12.640" style="s2">we&#39;re having us but I think we can start</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.140" end="00:53:15.010" style="s2">to move in that direction and we have</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.640" end="00:53:17.890" style="s2">the capacity to do that today to much</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.010" end="00:53:19.780" style="s2">bigger degree and that kind of honest</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.890" end="00:53:22.300" style="s2">feedback is what&#39;s essential if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.780" end="00:53:24.040" style="s2">going to not fall into self-deception at</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.300" end="00:53:25.630" style="s2">an individual or collective level so I</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.040" end="00:53:28.119" style="s2">think there&#39;s something of just being</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.630" end="00:53:32.800" style="s2">much more aware of what what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.119" end="00:53:34.930" style="s2">when I&#39;m back I&#39;m having and being being</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.800" end="00:53:44.800" style="s2">able to face that to being able to</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.930" end="00:53:46.750" style="s2">integrate that feedback hmm of this - so</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.800" end="00:53:48.850" style="s2">you did allude to this but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.750" end="00:53:50.770" style="s2">very limited degree I think to which we</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.850" end="00:53:52.270" style="s2">can be fully cognizant of the impact of</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.770" end="00:53:53.320" style="s2">the impact of the impact of the impact</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.270" end="00:53:55.030" style="s2">of the impact you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.320" end="00:53:56.740" style="s2">certainly not personalized I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.030" end="00:53:59.050" style="s2">terms of pollution into the environment</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.740" end="00:54:00.700" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s much clearer but</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.050" end="00:54:02.560" style="s2">you know in certainly in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.700" end="00:54:05.140" style="s2">actions taken choices made in our</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.560" end="00:54:09.670" style="s2">personal lives and how those ripple out</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.140" end="00:54:10.810" style="s2">I think it&#39;s dangerous is the word that</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.670" end="00:54:14.020" style="s2">came to mind but that sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.810" end="00:54:17.680" style="s2">overstating it but it I think to try and</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.020" end="00:54:18.730" style="s2">take all of those consequences of all of</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.680" end="00:54:20.050" style="s2">those consequences of all of those</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.730" end="00:54:21.850" style="s2">consequences into account could drive</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.050" end="00:54:23.200" style="s2">you absolutely insane and paralyze you</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.850" end="00:54:26.050" style="s2">never actually do anything in the world</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.200" end="00:54:29.320" style="s2">you know what I mean for fear of desert</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.050" end="00:54:30.820" style="s2">does that make sense it doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.320" end="00:54:32.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s an interesting notion</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.820" end="00:54:34.930" style="s2">of this I think that that&#39;s right that</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.680" end="00:54:37.480" style="s2">carrying out too far is dangerous and</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.930" end="00:54:39.580" style="s2">counterproductive but I don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.480" end="00:54:41.260" style="s2">actually need to go out very far to</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.580" end="00:54:43.630" style="s2">start seeing the benefit of that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.260" end="00:54:45.369" style="s2">know and I think about this again</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.630" end="00:54:47.200" style="s2">John Berwick ian is a notion of</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.369" end="00:54:48.520" style="s2">relevance realization the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.200" end="00:54:50.650" style="s2">focus on what is important to pay</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.520" end="00:54:52.359" style="s2">attention to so for instance a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.650" end="00:54:54.100" style="s2">people are scared to fly but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.359" end="00:54:55.270" style="s2">scared to drive but if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.100" end="00:54:56.859" style="s2">statistics I mean that&#39;s irrational</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.270" end="00:54:58.780" style="s2">that&#39;s an irrational thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.859" end="00:55:01.630" style="s2">that&#39;s you know you don&#39;t recognize the</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.780" end="00:55:04.090" style="s2">data and you&#39;re sort of blind - they</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.630" end="00:55:05.590" style="s2">seem they seem woefully different or</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.090" end="00:55:07.720" style="s2">tragically different and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.590" end="00:55:10.000" style="s2">there you know that the bias there is</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.720" end="00:55:11.680" style="s2">because of a blindness to the impact so</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.000" end="00:55:13.390" style="s2">it&#39;s just one layer that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.680" end="00:55:14.920" style="s2">look at and then once that gate becomes</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.390" end="00:55:16.690" style="s2">integrated do you become more complex</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.920" end="00:55:19.770" style="s2">and dealing with that and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.690" end="00:55:21.550" style="s2">we navigate the world does that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.770" end="00:55:23.140" style="s2">filter</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.550" end="00:55:25.780" style="s2">attention to you but we filter with a</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.140" end="00:55:27.310" style="s2">kind of bias and blindness that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.780" end="00:55:29.760" style="s2">include all of that all that potential</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.310" end="00:55:32.410" style="s2">feedback that we could be getting I</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.760" end="00:55:35.890" style="s2">think both sides like if if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.410" end="00:55:38.080" style="s2">scared of plane travel and I manage to</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.890" end="00:55:40.630" style="s2">give you the data that shows well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.080" end="00:55:42.790" style="s2">safer compared to driving in your car my</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.630" end="00:55:45.610" style="s2">intention is that you stop being scared</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.790" end="00:55:47.200" style="s2">of planes but the actual impact could</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.610" end="00:55:52.630" style="s2">very much be like aw crap but never</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.200" end="00:55:54.700" style="s2">getting in a vehicle right like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.630" end="00:55:56.440" style="s2">still over like you no doubt it doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:59:14.109" end="00:59:18.849" style="s2">in a way it&#39;s the same debate tactic</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.770" end="00:59:20.470" style="s2">something&#39;s convincing us we could we</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.849" end="00:59:22.270" style="s2">swing wildly from one end to the other</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.470" end="00:59:24.250" style="s2">and I&#39;d like to I&#39;d like to get myself</p>
