<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:19.289" style="s2">I mean communicated by text a week or</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.910" end="00:00:21.390" style="s2">two ago you said that you thought you</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.289" end="00:00:24.330" style="s2">might have a genuine chance of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.390" end="00:00:27.720" style="s2">the mayor of Greymouth so that&#39;s why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.330" end="00:00:29.849" style="s2">crying everything at it yeah yeah you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.720" end="00:00:31.800" style="s2">got to balance two things haven&#39;t you in</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.849" end="00:00:36.270" style="s2">your candidacy for mayor on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.800" end="00:00:38.309" style="s2">you&#39;ve got actual responsibilities to</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.270" end="00:00:40.950" style="s2">the actual people living there right now</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.309" end="00:00:44.070" style="s2">today right that the other and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.950" end="00:00:46.800" style="s2">also got a larger responsibility to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.070" end="00:00:49.620" style="s2">RBE movement because this is a stepping</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.800" end="00:00:51.920" style="s2">stone this is a springboard to greater</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.620" end="00:00:54.860" style="s2">publicity greater notoriety greater</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.920" end="00:00:57.449" style="s2">ability to speak about it in public</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.860" end="00:01:01.890" style="s2">right yeah and so you&#39;ve gotta balance</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.449" end="00:01:03.329" style="s2">these two things so to what extent no</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.890" end="00:01:06.960" style="s2">let me slightly rephrase that how</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.329" end="00:01:09.119" style="s2">seriously are you taking the first part</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.960" end="00:01:13.200" style="s2">of that you know your mayoral duties to</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.119" end="00:01:17.580" style="s2">the citizens of your town yeah okay I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.200" end="00:01:19.290" style="s2">known quite a few mayors and we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.580" end="00:01:21.960" style="s2">greatest respect to a large degree is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.290" end="00:01:23.729" style="s2">ceremonial role right they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.960" end="00:01:26.159" style="s2">actually have that much executive</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.729" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">authority then another segment of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.159" end="00:01:30.450" style="s2">board of the council kind of thing yes</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:32.549" style="s2">you are but you&#39;re only the chairman and</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.450" end="00:01:34.920" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a special casting vote</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.549" end="00:01:36.360" style="s2">you have the same valid validity vote as</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.920" end="00:01:38.700" style="s2">the other councillors who are all</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.360" end="00:01:40.619" style="s2">elected who are most definitely well</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.700" end="00:01:42.990" style="s2">embedded locals and you don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.619" end="00:01:46.009" style="s2">influence at tabeling the contents of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.990" end="00:01:46.009" style="s2">what&#39;s being discussed</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.070" end="00:01:51.060" style="s2">especially here it&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.570" end="00:01:53.399" style="s2">transparent people are very interested</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.060" end="00:01:56.219" style="s2">in council activities here I&#39;d say much</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.399" end="00:01:58.770" style="s2">more so in UK again everybody knows</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.219" end="00:02:04.829" style="s2">everybody it&#39;s all much more local much</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.770" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">more familiar with everybody and so the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.829" end="00:02:09.780" style="s2">mayoral role there&#39;s not an American</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:11.340" style="s2">mayor where you know you&#39;re allocating</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.780" end="00:02:12.330" style="s2">the resources to your Police Department</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.340" end="00:02:15.720" style="s2">and school</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.330" end="00:02:18.150" style="s2">and so on you know at all</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.720" end="00:02:20.880" style="s2">so should you win you would actually be</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.150" end="00:02:22.080" style="s2">able to concentrate primarily on role</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.880" end="00:02:24.750" style="s2">number two then ie</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.080" end="00:02:26.490" style="s2">using it as a platform to publicize RBE</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.750" end="00:02:28.980" style="s2">to a wider audience</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.490" end="00:02:31.590" style="s2">yeah well of course we&#39;ve got the money</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.980" end="00:02:38.100" style="s2">free party and we&#39;ve got general</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.590" end="00:02:41.010" style="s2">elections in 2020 so that may be a point</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.100" end="00:02:43.080" style="s2">of contention for me if I am mayor do I</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.010" end="00:02:45.600" style="s2">drop the mayoralty to become a member of</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.080" end="00:02:47.010" style="s2">parliament well only if you win all</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.600" end="00:02:48.510" style="s2">right you wouldn&#39;t have to drop it just</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.010" end="00:02:50.310" style="s2">to run would you or would you would you</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.510" end="00:02:51.660" style="s2">have to drop it just to run no you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.310" end="00:02:53.970" style="s2">have to drop it to run but if you win</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.660" end="00:02:55.650" style="s2">you do and by then they&#39;d have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.970" end="00:02:57.990" style="s2">by-election which are expensive and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.650" end="00:02:59.730" style="s2">time-consuming and just annoying and of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.990" end="00:03:01.410" style="s2">course there is a it&#39;s happened quite a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.730" end="00:03:05.400" style="s2">few times</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.410" end="00:03:07.080" style="s2">the locals well in instances that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.400" end="00:03:09.030" style="s2">seen in the past and I guess everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.080" end="00:03:11.580" style="s2">different the locals have been really</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.030" end="00:03:13.740" style="s2">pissed off at being abandoned yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.580" end="00:03:15.690" style="s2">person might within three understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.740" end="00:03:20.010" style="s2">that yeah Hobbs</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.690" end="00:03:23.250" style="s2">so he&#39;s pursuing his own and yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.010" end="00:03:25.050" style="s2">get that on the other hand if you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.250" end="00:03:29.340" style="s2">the people behind you then it might be</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.050" end="00:03:31.200" style="s2">say go on go for it it&#39;s only ceremonial</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.340" end="00:03:34.440" style="s2">we&#39;ll get we can just get another mere</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:36.030" style="s2">you go on in all the way son you know so</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.440" end="00:03:39.570" style="s2">it probably depends on how things are</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.030" end="00:03:41.850" style="s2">going at the time just to finish off the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.570" end="00:03:43.920" style="s2">question yeah there are plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.850" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">mayoral duties cutting ribbons kissing</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.920" end="00:03:49.980" style="s2">babies that kind of thing but what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:51.810" style="s2">way I see it because I do like to keep</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.980" end="00:03:56.790" style="s2">things succinct if possible believe it</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.810" end="00:03:59.820" style="s2">or not the the council machine is a big</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.790" end="00:04:03.510" style="s2">cumbersome one of many wheels turning</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.820" end="00:04:06.330" style="s2">very slowly and the position of Mayor</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.510" end="00:04:09.360" style="s2">really is just part of that machine what</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.330" end="00:04:12.810" style="s2">you do have is the ability to direct</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.360" end="00:04:14.940" style="s2">that machine so with the right vision</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.810" end="00:04:16.470" style="s2">one can point the machine in the right</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.940" end="00:04:19.290" style="s2">direction but we&#39;re not going to become</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.470" end="00:04:21.989" style="s2">a money free town overnight yeah but you</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.290" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">do by bringing people along with you</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.989" end="00:04:25.469" style="s2">right not by telling you this is what</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:28.090" style="s2">we&#39;re doing but by convincing</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.469" end="00:04:29.469" style="s2">which is how it should be the general</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.090" end="00:04:30.969" style="s2">infrastructure in greymouth is all</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.469" end="00:04:32.800" style="s2">struggling as well I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.969" end="00:04:34.750" style="s2">nationwide and I think in the UK to</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.800" end="00:04:42.460" style="s2">actually you know under water pipes</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.750" end="00:04:44.710" style="s2">sewage tubes etc hope to do about this</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.460" end="00:04:48.460" style="s2">crumbling infrastructure I mean what</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.710" end="00:04:50.710" style="s2">would you as mayor as well because slash</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.460" end="00:04:54.039" style="s2">mayor be able to bring to the table to</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.710" end="00:04:56.560" style="s2">solve these problems okay yeah two</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.039" end="00:04:58.930" style="s2">answers and this is where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.560" end="00:05:00.969" style="s2">absolutely imperative to have the people</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.930" end="00:05:03.250" style="s2">on board and depending on how on board</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.969" end="00:05:04.990" style="s2">they are depends on which which Road</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.250" end="00:05:06.460" style="s2">will travel and I guess it&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.990" end="00:05:09.159" style="s2">end up being a combination of both but</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.460" end="00:05:11.259" style="s2">one is if the people are really behind</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.159" end="00:05:14.830" style="s2">me and if we&#39;ve had the RBE conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.259" end="00:05:16.479" style="s2">within FP there are two things we could</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.830" end="00:05:18.849" style="s2">do we can either go money-free straight</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.479" end="00:05:20.590" style="s2">away and fuck it and then because the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.849" end="00:05:22.150" style="s2">revolutionaries are not just the hippies</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.590" end="00:05:23.500" style="s2">in the woods and we won&#39;t wait for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.150" end="00:05:24.969" style="s2">central government to provide the money</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.500" end="00:05:26.830" style="s2">we&#39;ll just go and fucking do it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.969" end="00:05:28.900" style="s2">there&#39;s already a history of there Amer</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.830" end="00:05:31.419" style="s2">there are three mayor&#39;s on the coast -</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.900" end="00:05:34.330" style="s2">by far the biggest one but the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.419" end="00:05:36.270" style="s2">southern one Bruce Smith is a under</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.330" end="00:05:40.419" style="s2">sensor at the moment by the council</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.270" end="00:05:43.180" style="s2">overseers because he and a mate when</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.419" end="00:05:45.129" style="s2">there&#39;s some flood remedial work needed</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.180" end="00:05:46.990" style="s2">to be done the hurry they just went out</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.129" end="00:05:49.270" style="s2">with their diggers and they&#39;re fucking</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.990" end="00:05:51.159" style="s2">great big trucks his mate is like 80 and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.270" end="00:05:52.719" style="s2">he owns a big construction company and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.159" end="00:05:53.490" style="s2">they just went out and they just fucking</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.719" end="00:05:56.199" style="s2">did it</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.490" end="00:05:58.360" style="s2">of course subsequently there was a bill</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.199" end="00:05:59.860" style="s2">over 1/2 million dollars for the council</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.360" end="00:06:01.089" style="s2">which they then freaked out about</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.860" end="00:06:05.680" style="s2">because they hadn&#39;t gone through the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.089" end="00:06:09.009" style="s2">transparency but this is the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.680" end="00:06:10.930" style="s2">these Peter no and because again you</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.009" end="00:06:13.229" style="s2">know I said everybody throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.930" end="00:06:15.879" style="s2">food chain has been touched by tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.229" end="00:06:17.529" style="s2">these but they&#39;re not of a mind to just</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.879" end="00:06:20.349" style="s2">wait for central government to come up</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.529" end="00:06:21.550" style="s2">with some funding so from this to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.349" end="00:06:23.439" style="s2">forward and we have a lot of meetings</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.550" end="00:06:26.819" style="s2">first but from this day forward we just</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.439" end="00:06:30.189" style="s2">will not pay our mortgages rent rates</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.819" end="00:06:32.800" style="s2">electricity etc and what are they what</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.189" end="00:06:34.810" style="s2">are they actually gonna do because all</p>

<p begin="00:06:34.810" end="00:06:38.360" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.620" end="00:06:42.680" style="s2">is the Australian Savings Bank gonna</p>

<p begin="00:07:51.260" end="00:07:53.660" style="s2">to lose your motivation it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.090" end="00:08:00.110" style="s2">impressive</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.660" end="00:08:03.320" style="s2">I often I say this but you know one</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.110" end="00:08:06.020" style="s2">catches up with lots of different people</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.320" end="00:08:08.990" style="s2">not that often and every time I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.020" end="00:08:11.150" style="s2">fascinated by the rhetoric that comes</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.990" end="00:08:15.280" style="s2">from conversation rather than from</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.150" end="00:08:17.900" style="s2">deliberate study or sort of methodical</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.280" end="00:08:19.669" style="s2">development just because most of my work</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.900" end="00:08:22.850" style="s2">is talking to people I know I&#39;m amazed</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.669" end="00:08:25.729" style="s2">at what comes out and so I love sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.850" end="00:08:27.530" style="s2">unscripted conversations where we just</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.729" end="00:08:30.410" style="s2">kind of see how we get on and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.530" end="00:08:32.479" style="s2">when the good stuff comes out and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.410" end="00:08:34.610" style="s2">fortunately much of my work in greymouth</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.479" end="00:08:36.349" style="s2">is based around having conversations on</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.610" end="00:08:40.130" style="s2">the street with ordinary people it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.349" end="00:08:43.400" style="s2">high-tech it&#39;s not high leverage it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.130" end="00:08:46.940" style="s2">just sort of face to face one or one or</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.400" end="00:08:48.830" style="s2">one on a small group of very organic</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.940" end="00:08:50.430" style="s2">conversation and I think that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.830" end="00:08:53.070" style="s2">the good stuff is you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.430" end="00:08:54.690" style="s2">planned it&#39;s not intended it&#39;s just see</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.070" end="00:08:57.180" style="s2">what comes out and I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.690" end="00:09:01.230" style="s2">subconscious element to that you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.180" end="00:09:03.510" style="s2">where your subconscious brain is 90</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.230" end="00:09:07.950" style="s2">percent of your brain capacity or</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.510" end="00:09:09.779" style="s2">something isn&#39;t it yeah it&#39;s crazy and</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.950" end="00:09:11.430" style="s2">if you couldn&#39;t access that material</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.779" end="00:09:13.950" style="s2">then you&#39;ll do a much better job I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.430" end="00:09:15.510" style="s2">well the things we do access that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.950" end="00:09:17.790" style="s2">material all the time but because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.510" end="00:09:19.020" style="s2">so convinced of all there is to us is</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.790" end="00:09:20.910" style="s2">our conscious you know our waking</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.020" end="00:09:22.110" style="s2">consciousness army you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.910" end="00:09:24.270" style="s2">because we&#39;re convinced that&#39;s all there</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.110" end="00:09:26.040" style="s2">is we don&#39;t pay attention to our</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.270" end="00:09:28.020" style="s2">intuitions and our feelings and our gun</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.040" end="00:09:29.370" style="s2">reactions stuff like that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.020" end="00:09:31.140" style="s2">what those things are that&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.370" end="00:09:33.180" style="s2">subconscious which has access to all of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.140" end="00:09:42.000" style="s2">that additional data it&#39;s sending you a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.180" end="00:09:44.310" style="s2">message they don&#39;t do that yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.000" end="00:09:46.290" style="s2">absolutely yeah I watched a great gavel</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.310" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">mat a lecture the other day where he</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.290" end="00:09:51.810" style="s2">said exactly that and how frequently</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.720" end="00:09:52.980" style="s2">they are in conflict and he our audience</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.810" end="00:09:55.620" style="s2">you know raise your hand if you&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.980" end="00:10:03.660" style="s2">had a gut feeling and gone against it</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.620" end="00:10:05.220" style="s2">and later regretted it and conversely</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.660" end="00:10:07.440" style="s2">how many people have got a gut feeling</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.220" end="00:10:09.450" style="s2">gone with it and regretted it and now</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.440" end="00:10:11.160" style="s2">hardly any hands what I frequently find</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.450" end="00:10:12.750" style="s2">myself saying to people is how is it</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.160" end="00:10:16.290" style="s2">going haven&#39;t seen you for ages Richard</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.750" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">and with utter sincerity I frequently</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.290" end="00:10:21.930" style="s2">say do you know what I think it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:23.310" style="s2">better than ever more positive sorry</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.930" end="00:10:25.589" style="s2">because in answer to question you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.310" end="00:10:30.089" style="s2">you keep you seem to keep going but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.589" end="00:10:32.520" style="s2">I&#39;m constantly refreshed and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.089" end="00:10:34.890" style="s2">goaded on by the positive results that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.520" end="00:10:36.990" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing and and so it just it gets</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.890" end="00:10:39.209" style="s2">better and better actually and I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.990" end="00:10:42.720" style="s2">positive and more optimistic now than</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.209" end="00:10:44.550" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever been you know in the last ten</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.720" end="00:10:46.649" style="s2">years and I&#39;ve been up there plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.550" end="00:10:49.170" style="s2">times but I&#39;m it&#39;s it&#39;s an ever</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.649" end="00:10:51.959" style="s2">ascending pathway you know we just seem</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.170" end="00:10:54.270" style="s2">to get closer and closer to what we all</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.959" end="00:10:56.329" style="s2">what we all aspire to what&#39;s the poor</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.270" end="00:10:59.310" style="s2">politicians etcetera so they have this</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.329" end="00:11:01.020" style="s2">ridiculous balancing act that in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.310" end="00:11:02.520" style="s2">resource-based economy world we do not</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.020" end="00:11:04.350" style="s2">have to play anymore</p>

<p begin="00:11:04.350" end="00:11:08.370" style="s2">and the science will guide us to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:10.710" style="s2">correct response yeah it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.370" end="00:11:14.400" style="s2">difficult and I was astounded the very</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.710" end="00:11:16.410" style="s2">first public outing I made at a mayoral</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.400" end="00:11:21.150" style="s2">level when I was contesting their Nelson</p>

<p begin="00:11:21.150" end="00:11:25.500" style="s2">prepared speech and the mayor candidates</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.070" end="00:11:26.850" style="s2">got five minutes amount of 450 people in</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.500" end="00:11:28.710" style="s2">the audience I mean I was shitting</p>

<p begin="00:11:28.710" end="00:11:31.920" style="s2">to talk about spaceship earth but how</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.930" end="00:11:34.620" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna work in a resource-based</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.920" end="00:11:36.300" style="s2">economy and I discovered I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.620" end="00:11:39.330" style="s2">amazing how you can lose and win in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.300" end="00:11:41.760" style="s2">same few minutes but I discovered that</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.330" end="00:11:44.220" style="s2">scripted speeches with this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.760" end="00:11:45.480" style="s2">material do not work we&#39;re not teaching</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.220" end="00:11:48.000" style="s2">people anything new</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.480" end="00:11:49.380" style="s2">we&#39;re d-brane washing them and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.000" end="00:11:50.820" style="s2">everyone&#39;s got their own customs</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.380" end="00:11:52.710" style="s2">brainwash and you&#39;ve got to look them in</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.820" end="00:11:55.680" style="s2">the eye and have a conversation of some</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.710" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">sort and figure out where are you stuck</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.680" end="00:12:00.480" style="s2">with this what&#39;s your personal hang-up</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:03.360" style="s2">with what i&#39;m proposing because</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.480" end="00:12:05.940" style="s2">everyone&#39;s got a different version so my</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.360" end="00:12:10.020" style="s2">scripted speech was rubbish but when it</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.940" end="00:12:11.520" style="s2">came to the questions and answers this</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.020" end="00:12:13.890" style="s2">big audience had a lot of questions</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.520" end="00:12:17.160" style="s2">about health care about violence about</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.890" end="00:12:21.030" style="s2">alcohol in society about jobs pollution</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.160" end="00:12:23.460" style="s2">I realized that I had the easiest job of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.030" end="00:12:25.590" style="s2">all and authorized them by far the least</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.460" end="00:12:27.840" style="s2">experienced of the four candidates for</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.590" end="00:12:30.240" style="s2">the mayoralty I was able to genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.840" end="00:12:33.090" style="s2">put my hand up for every single question</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.240" end="00:12:35.790" style="s2">from the audience immediately without</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.090" end="00:12:37.950" style="s2">even having to think yeah maybe start</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.790" end="00:12:40.470" style="s2">thinking in money-free terms suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.950" end="00:12:41.850" style="s2">every problem we&#39;ve got becomes easily</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.470" end="00:12:44.280" style="s2">soluble yeah</p>

<p begin="00:13:05.550" end="00:13:12.810" style="s2">that gone gone advocates of money</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.970" end="00:13:16.460" style="s2">however would say that the necessity to</p>

<p begin="00:13:22.480" end="00:13:26.890" style="s2">you&#39;re right into a degree in that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.310" end="00:13:28.480" style="s2">money filters out the crap projects</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.890" end="00:13:32.110" style="s2">makes money in which case shit will</p>

<p begin="00:13:38.829" end="00:13:43.589" style="s2">that&#39;s the beauty of the resource-based</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.970" end="00:13:45.790" style="s2">economy because now you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.589" end="00:13:50.110" style="s2">self-referencing automated process</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.790" end="00:13:52.480" style="s2">whereby a the technology assists in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.110" end="00:13:54.399" style="s2">project so no one has to mix concrete by</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.480" end="00:13:56.500" style="s2">hand no one has to dig holes no one has</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.399" end="00:13:58.329" style="s2">to hammer nails in anymore I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.500" end="00:14:00.040" style="s2">amazing technology to do that so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.329" end="00:14:02.170" style="s2">all easy if we want to do something too</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.040" end="00:14:04.360" style="s2">easily but you&#39;re still gonna need the</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.170" end="00:14:06.390" style="s2">well since they buy in I have to look</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.360" end="00:14:11.410" style="s2">for a better better worth the investment</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.390" end="00:14:13.420" style="s2">still need a better word the money this</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.410" end="00:14:16.180" style="s2">might anything goes deep you still need</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.420" end="00:14:18.339" style="s2">the involvement of the humans to make it</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.180" end="00:14:19.360" style="s2">actually operation you still need the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.339" end="00:14:21.370" style="s2">ability for people to collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.360" end="00:14:23.560" style="s2">collaborate and cooperate on a large</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.370" end="00:14:26.399" style="s2">scale I mean no still gonna need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.560" end="00:14:29.709" style="s2">build things like bridges and tunnels</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.399" end="00:14:34.810" style="s2">absolutely hospitals and well maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.709" end="00:14:35.860" style="s2">airports but you know whatever whatever</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.810" end="00:14:37.570" style="s2">it might be you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.860" end="00:14:40.810" style="s2">large-scale projects which still need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.570" end="00:14:43.149" style="s2">be undertaken and which affect people</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.810" end="00:14:45.279" style="s2">over a large area you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.149" end="00:14:47.020" style="s2">and benefit people over a large area but</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.279" end="00:14:49.540" style="s2">then there are also people it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.020" end="00:14:51.579" style="s2">affect and doesn&#39;t benefit and so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.540" end="00:14:53.160" style="s2">this is this is where I get a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.579" end="00:14:55.060" style="s2">confused and this is where I have</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.160" end="00:14:57.730" style="s2">personally maybe I&#39;m just smart enough</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.060" end="00:15:00.910" style="s2">not smart enough to see it I personally</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.730" end="00:15:03.910" style="s2">have a problem with detailed transition</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.910" end="00:15:07.079" style="s2">plans because from my knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.910" end="00:15:09.399" style="s2">physics particularly chaotic systems</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.079" end="00:15:11.140" style="s2">transition from one equilibrium state to</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.399" end="00:15:14.949" style="s2">a different equilibrium state is not</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.140" end="00:15:18.730" style="s2">possible without a highly chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.949" end="00:15:22.990" style="s2">turbulent in-between phase and so I kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.730" end="00:15:25.390" style="s2">of feel that the path to RBE or</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.990" end="00:15:30.259" style="s2">something similar to it something that</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.390" end="00:15:32.839" style="s2">embraces those philosophies is most</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.259" end="00:15:34.669" style="s2">likely going to end up not being</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.839" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">anything that anyone has thought of yet</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.669" end="00:15:38.419" style="s2">you know what I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:41.569" style="s2">that will emerge from the collective</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.419" end="00:15:43.220" style="s2">when there are enough people working on</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.569" end="00:15:44.509" style="s2">the various problems that are that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.220" end="00:15:45.829" style="s2">going to encounter and you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.509" end="00:15:48.470" style="s2">mean something will emerge that has</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.829" end="00:15:51.079" style="s2">killed yet we don&#39;t we do we have no</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.470" end="00:15:55.189" style="s2">idea what it looks like now it does take</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.079" end="00:15:57.019" style="s2">some Imagineering doesn&#39;t it and as</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.189" end="00:15:59.629" style="s2">Collinwood put actually Colin Turner</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.019" end="00:16:02.239" style="s2">from free world charter who I know I saw</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.629" end="00:16:04.429" style="s2">your interview he as he beautifully so</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.239" end="00:16:07.339" style="s2">eloquently put to really get this you</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.429" end="00:16:10.369" style="s2">have to suspend your disbelief on</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.339" end="00:16:13.009" style="s2">several levels at the same time and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.369" end="00:16:16.189" style="s2">takes quite a lot of mental well</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.009" end="00:16:21.579" style="s2">certainly energy to bring that about but</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.189" end="00:16:24.439" style="s2">I would say have faith so I&#39;ll backtrack</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.579" end="00:16:26.779" style="s2">slightly to an interview I did here</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.439" end="00:16:33.229" style="s2">actually in 2012 or my birthday</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.779" end="00:16:37.039" style="s2">bizarrely with a raya wise reporter from</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.229" end="00:16:40.609" style="s2">a newspaper and we they did a big</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.039" end="00:16:43.699" style="s2">article and on the money free proposal</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.609" end="00:16:44.809" style="s2">and she really liked it me I was really</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.699" end="00:16:46.129" style="s2">thrilled you know to get that much</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.809" end="00:16:47.079" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a big chunk of the newspaper</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.129" end="00:16:49.819" style="s2">it was fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.079" end="00:16:53.209" style="s2">my first decent outing in the press</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.819" end="00:16:55.069" style="s2">really um but and she liked the idea but</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.209" end="00:16:57.529" style="s2">she said I think it&#39;s gonna take a</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.069" end="00:16:58.100" style="s2">massive catastrophe Richard but to bring</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.529" end="00:17:01.220" style="s2">this about</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.100" end="00:17:02.839" style="s2">and that bugged me I mean this is seven</p>

<p begin="00:17:16.909" end="00:17:22.250" style="s2">right had to go through to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.789" end="00:17:24.470" style="s2">something&#39;s really got a change and it</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.250" end="00:17:26.750" style="s2">may be us that has to change it that</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.470" end="00:17:28.370" style="s2">major catastrophe actually doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:18:10.730" end="00:18:19.100" style="s2">we had a horrific mining accident eight</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.610" end="00:18:20.870" style="s2">years ago 29 guys died in 2010 and you</p>

<p begin="00:18:40.730" end="00:18:46.429" style="s2">said this before don&#39;t you think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.320" end="00:18:50.929" style="s2">that chaos because we are precipitating</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.429" end="00:18:53.270" style="s2">a change of mentality nothing else we</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.929" end="00:18:56.330" style="s2">just have to change our perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.270" end="00:18:58.429" style="s2">that chaotic period is actually where</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.330" end="00:18:59.990" style="s2">many people are now and some of us have</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.429" end="00:19:03.260" style="s2">been through earlier than others with</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.990" end="00:19:04.820" style="s2">our midlife crisis we could be in that</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.260" end="00:19:06.020" style="s2">chaotic period right now and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.820" end="00:19:07.730" style="s2">think actually you make a very good</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.020" end="00:19:09.200" style="s2">point that could be exactly what the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.730" end="00:19:13.549" style="s2">explanation is that we are in that right</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.200" end="00:19:15.110" style="s2">now and which is what that&#39;s Trump</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.549" end="00:19:19.970" style="s2">that&#39;s brexit that&#39;s the rise of the</p>

<p begin="00:19:28.280" end="00:19:35.240" style="s2">the moment if say that the breadwinner</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.230" end="00:19:38.270" style="s2">in a household drives a truck for</p>

<p begin="00:19:49.040" end="00:19:54.200" style="s2">drinks aren&#39;t very good for us but</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.710" end="00:19:55.880" style="s2">because of the money thing everybody</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.200" end="00:19:58.240" style="s2">write down the food chain you know in</p>

<p begin="00:34:06.500" end="00:34:11.750" style="s2">the transformation will be unopposed and</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.600" end="00:34:13.970" style="s2">it will be almost effortless actually</p>

<p begin="00:34:25.129" end="00:34:30.530" style="s2">I think if Jack fresco said a revolution</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.980" end="00:34:32.179" style="s2">of consciousness but if that happens</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.530" end="00:34:34.669" style="s2">then Australia</p>

<p begin="00:36:30.970" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">change and we don&#39;t even need to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.530" end="00:36:38.290" style="s2">not really relevant at this stage you</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.200" end="00:36:39.910" style="s2">know did man cause this etc the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.290" end="00:36:42.340" style="s2">other day you know just if you&#39;re in a</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.290" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">really matters there&#39;s plenty of other</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.510" end="00:36:57.190" style="s2">reasons not to do things that may or may</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">not claw caused climate harm and and</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.190" end="00:37:00.910" style="s2">they&#39;re all driven by money at the end</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:02.410" style="s2">of the day and I always feel these</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.910" end="00:37:06.190" style="s2">arguments you know we immediately kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.410" end="00:37:09.340" style="s2">of get onto a Anti poisons or</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.190" end="00:37:13.600" style="s2">anti-abortion or climate change argument</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.340" end="00:37:15.550" style="s2">and we we&#39;ve already lost the point and</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.600" end="00:37:17.110" style="s2">we can argue and fall out about it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.550" end="00:37:18.490" style="s2">send each other emails and build</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.110" end="00:37:22.040" style="s2">websites about it</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.490" end="00:37:24.590" style="s2">go on protests already miss the point</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.040" end="00:37:25.850" style="s2">Jacinda and KO are all in paris patting</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.590" end="00:37:27.200" style="s2">each other on the back about what</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.850" end="00:37:29.570" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna do about the evils in</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.200" end="00:37:32.270" style="s2">facebook yeah and they&#39;ve already missed</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.570" end="00:37:35.660" style="s2">the point you know and all that energy</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.270" end="00:37:37.700" style="s2">all that angst and dedication will go</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.660" end="00:37:40.580" style="s2">into something that&#39;s actually a symptom</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.700" end="00:37:42.410" style="s2">and not a fuse exactly that word is</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.580" end="00:37:44.180" style="s2">attacking symptom enough causes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.410" end="00:37:45.680" style="s2">exactly right that&#39;s exactly right all</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.180" end="00:37:47.090" style="s2">of it and yeah I mean climate change is</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.680" end="00:37:49.700" style="s2">just the latest one I tend to agree with</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.090" end="00:37:51.140" style="s2">you if we didn&#39;t do so fucking stupid</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.700" end="00:37:52.490" style="s2">Lee and wastefully then we wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.140" end="00:37:55.010" style="s2">having to worry about these things you</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.490" end="00:37:56.690" style="s2">know what I&#39;ve really been up against in</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.010" end="00:37:58.550" style="s2">the last 10 years is the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.690" end="00:38:00.890" style="s2">naysayers who have got this position</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.550" end="00:38:05.060" style="s2">that oh it&#39;s all fine you just need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.890" end="00:38:06.830" style="s2">work harder you know and the anomalies</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.060" end="00:38:08.720" style="s2">that we witness overseas aren&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.830" end="00:38:10.490" style="s2">real that&#39;s just something that happens</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.720" end="00:38:12.500" style="s2">in these funny places where they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.490" end="00:38:14.360" style="s2">fucked up yeah but it doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.500" end="00:38:16.550" style="s2">here and when these things start to</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.360" end="00:38:21.220" style="s2">happen here then the few and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.550" end="00:38:23.540" style="s2">amazing I said whew the remaining</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.220" end="00:38:25.610" style="s2">naysayers who think that it&#39;s all going</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.540" end="00:38:28.100" style="s2">to be fine and we if you start exporting</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.610" end="00:38:29.660" style="s2">coal again and we can still expand dairy</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.100" end="00:38:31.880" style="s2">and sell more wine and we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.660" end="00:38:34.310" style="s2">create jobs and we&#39;re gonna have green</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.880" end="00:38:37.840" style="s2">technologies and green tourism and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.310" end="00:38:40.460" style="s2">know it&#39;s everything&#39;s ok those that</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.840" end="00:38:42.650" style="s2">relatively small now proportion of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.460" end="00:38:45.070" style="s2">population is feeling increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.650" end="00:38:48.500" style="s2">isolated now that there&#39;s been you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.070" end="00:38:50.920" style="s2">50 people shot in one incidentally its</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.500" end="00:38:54.050" style="s2">television is in and it gets quite easy</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.920" end="00:38:55.640" style="s2">to back up you know we need to get</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.050" end="00:38:59.740" style="s2">people to think beyond the superficial</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.640" end="00:39:03.170" style="s2">ah there&#39;s been a shooting ban guns</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.740" end="00:39:05.120" style="s2">reaction yeah and ask you know okay just</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.170" end="00:39:07.010" style="s2">stop a minute back up I don&#39;t think well</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.120" end="00:39:09.770" style="s2">why did the guy want to shoot anyone in</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.010" end="00:39:12.260" style="s2">the first place why do we have threats</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.770" end="00:39:15.790" style="s2">to our climate why do people hunt whales</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.260" end="00:39:18.350" style="s2">why do people beat their wives you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.790" end="00:39:20.660" style="s2">don&#39;t just have better surveillance in</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.350" end="00:39:22.310" style="s2">houses to prevent you know to catch them</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.660" end="00:39:24.800" style="s2">when they do be their wives it&#39;s we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.310" end="00:39:26.910" style="s2">so reactive it&#39;s almost child it&#39;s worse</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.800" end="00:39:28.860" style="s2">than child like actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.910" end="00:39:30.530" style="s2">but here it&#39;s very very obvious because</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.860" end="00:39:33.210" style="s2">there&#39;s so few people and they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.530" end="00:39:35.280" style="s2">intimately connected especially on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.210" end="00:39:38.790" style="s2">west coast where you know my campaign is</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.280" end="00:39:42.360" style="s2">going on and I think there&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.790" end="00:39:44.580" style="s2">shorter link between the cause and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.360" end="00:39:46.530" style="s2">effect of what people are doing whereas</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.580" end="00:39:48.480" style="s2">I daresay in Britain or Spain or</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.530" end="00:39:53.390" style="s2">something you know bigger more developed</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.480" end="00:39:56.010" style="s2">a deeper civilization shall we say</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.390" end="00:39:58.500" style="s2">people are much more disconnected from</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.010" end="00:40:00.300" style="s2">the root causes of the problems that</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.500" end="00:40:03.690" style="s2">they experienced was here they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.300" end="00:40:05.730" style="s2">direct so here we see dairy farming</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.690" end="00:40:08.760" style="s2">which is our biggest export and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.730" end="00:40:12.540" style="s2">crops everything up basically the sale</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.760" end="00:40:15.450" style="s2">of basically milk powder overseas that</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.540" end="00:40:18.930" style="s2">pays for basically everything you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.450" end="00:40:21.210" style="s2">that&#39;s the short version but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.930" end="00:40:23.400" style="s2">disastrous for the animals for the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.210" end="00:40:28.560" style="s2">farmers and for the environment and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.400" end="00:40:30.960" style="s2">water and people know people see that</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.560" end="00:40:33.690" style="s2">very clearly and so if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.960" end="00:40:35.310" style="s2">address that those harm things that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.690" end="00:40:40.860" style="s2">see that you can&#39;t eat the food in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.310" end="00:40:41.910" style="s2">in in the water you can&#39;t access farms</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.860" end="00:40:43.890" style="s2">anymore because they&#39;re all like</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.910" end="00:40:45.810" style="s2">electrified prisons you know because a</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.890" end="00:40:47.700" style="s2">huge corporate owned now most of these</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.810" end="00:40:51.570" style="s2">dairy farms they&#39;re not family-friendly</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.700" end="00:40:53.580" style="s2">farms that there used to be and it and</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.570" end="00:40:55.350" style="s2">the depression and the isolation of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.580" end="00:40:57.060" style="s2">farmers and their staff is horrific</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.350" end="00:41:01.350" style="s2">you know the suicide rate among farmers</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.060" end="00:41:03.740" style="s2">is amongst the worst in the country and</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.350" end="00:41:06.030" style="s2">they&#39;re all going into debt horrific Lee</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.740" end="00:41:08.460" style="s2">and of course the product that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.030" end="00:41:10.170" style="s2">produces isn&#39;t even really intended you</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.460" end="00:41:13.080" style="s2">know in natural terms for human</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.170" end="00:41:14.820" style="s2">consumption anyway so the whole thing is</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.080" end="00:41:17.610" style="s2">flawed from start to finish but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.820" end="00:41:20.130" style="s2">very easy to point it out here because</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.610" end="00:41:23.700" style="s2">we&#39;re a relatively shallow civilization</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.130" end="00:41:27.750" style="s2">no in that regard that dairy actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.700" end="00:41:31.860" style="s2">serves no intrinsic purpose except to</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.750" end="00:41:33.810" style="s2">get money yeah absolutely and if we it</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.860" end="00:41:36.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actually contribute towards the</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.810" end="00:41:41.370" style="s2">manufacture of computers or electricity</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.720" end="00:41:43.560" style="s2">or food or dog leads you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.370" end="00:41:46.950" style="s2">they&#39;re completely separate and if we</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.560" end="00:41:48.360" style="s2">didn&#39;t do dairy that the land and of</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.950" end="00:41:51.420" style="s2">course it&#39;s all the best land in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.360" end="00:41:53.910" style="s2">country could basically refer back to</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.420" end="00:41:55.500" style="s2">wilderness because we don&#39;t need it the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.910" end="00:41:58.020" style="s2">food that New Zealand exports is</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.500" end="00:42:00.270" style="s2">extremely expensive I mean even Kiwis</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.020" end="00:42:02.570" style="s2">can&#39;t afford it so the Bangladeshis</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.270" end="00:42:06.270" style="s2">definitely don&#39;t get any of it it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.570" end="00:42:09.930" style="s2">high high-end very high margin niche</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.270" end="00:42:12.750" style="s2">products for rich people not for hungry</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.930" end="00:42:14.340" style="s2">people and so that the actual and it and</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.750" end="00:42:17.910" style="s2">this is difficult for Kiwis sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.340" end="00:42:20.490" style="s2">the actual produce of New Zealand serves</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.910" end="00:42:23.070" style="s2">no genuine purpose on the world table</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.490" end="00:42:24.450" style="s2">it&#39;s only for rich people it&#39;s just to</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.070" end="00:42:25.950" style="s2">bring money into it&#39;s just to bring</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.450" end="00:42:27.990" style="s2">money and just just playing devil&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.950" end="00:42:29.520" style="s2">advocate here I mean obviously I&#39;m on</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.990" end="00:42:31.050" style="s2">the same team as you right but just just</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.520" end="00:42:34.340" style="s2">for the sake of playing devil&#39;s advocate</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.050" end="00:42:36.720" style="s2">so what extent does the money that these</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.340" end="00:42:39.600" style="s2">that these trades generate and bring</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.720" end="00:42:41.280" style="s2">into the country allow New Zealanders to</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.600" end="00:42:43.280" style="s2">buy goods from overseas that they might</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:46.740" style="s2">not otherwise be able to acquire</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.280" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">entirely yeah that&#39;s the only way we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.740" end="00:42:53.010" style="s2">do that and that&#39;s once people get to</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:54.300" style="s2">that stage I tend to especially on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.010" end="00:42:56.310" style="s2">first conversation I tend to leave them</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.300" end="00:42:59.070" style="s2">alone because it&#39;s a great if you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.310" end="00:43:00.930" style="s2">that far then you&#39;re well on the work</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.070" end="00:43:01.950" style="s2">well on the road road to seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.930" end="00:43:06.510" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be better off without</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.950" end="00:43:08.430" style="s2">this money thing so and it&#39;s a funny</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.510" end="00:43:10.440" style="s2">question actually I really always enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.430" end="00:43:13.530" style="s2">it what about our imports and exports</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.440" end="00:43:15.330" style="s2">and there&#39;s actually about eight</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.530" end="00:43:16.700" style="s2">different answers to that question and</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.330" end="00:43:21.000" style="s2">this is where the face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.700" end="00:43:22.860" style="s2">conversation is so important because if</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.000" end="00:43:25.020" style="s2">you&#39;re talking to an older person will</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.860" end="00:43:27.330" style="s2">say well look in the 1950s when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.020" end="00:43:28.950" style="s2">when you came over or when you know when</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.330" end="00:43:30.060" style="s2">you were growing up we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.950" end="00:43:32.070" style="s2">imports at all</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.060" end="00:43:34.140" style="s2">we had Morris miners came on a boat</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.070" end="00:43:36.210" style="s2">every eight weeks and if you were very</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.140" end="00:43:37.830" style="s2">well you could afford one but in fact we</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.210" end="00:43:39.960" style="s2">made everything that we need here how</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.830" end="00:43:41.880" style="s2">bad was it but it&#39;s funny when you</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.960" end="00:43:44.790" style="s2">really talk to people they&#39;re not even</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.880" end="00:43:47.580" style="s2">that sure if we want it anyway again</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.790" end="00:43:51.660" style="s2">especially on the west coast where well</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.580" end="00:43:53.019" style="s2">they do their laptops well there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.660" end="00:43:54.789" style="s2">of pushback</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.019" end="00:43:56.679" style="s2">it&#39;s not brought anything it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.789" end="00:43:58.749" style="s2">boring anything tangible and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.679" end="00:44:00.489" style="s2">brought anything good and most people</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.749" end="00:44:02.409" style="s2">think of or frequently I get it was</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.489" end="00:44:03.939" style="s2">better off before we had them lose you</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.409" end="00:44:05.469" style="s2">could talk to people looking down at</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.939" end="00:44:07.659" style="s2">they scream yeah I&#39;m not sure I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.469" end="00:44:09.429" style="s2">not you know I I have some sympathy for</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.659" end="00:44:13.449" style="s2">that view but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.429" end="00:44:17.669" style="s2">fly on a global scale I&#39;m full pretty</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.449" end="00:44:20.619" style="s2">attached you know laptops and phones</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.669" end="00:44:22.179" style="s2">much as there&#39;s many awful things about</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.619" end="00:44:24.849" style="s2">in particularly in the social media</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.179" end="00:44:27.969" style="s2">sphere I mean these things also have the</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.849" end="00:44:29.709" style="s2">capacity to be incredibly powerful tools</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.969" end="00:44:32.469" style="s2">for good right for education for</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.709" end="00:44:34.149" style="s2">information for activity I mean they</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.469" end="00:44:37.179" style="s2">they they they can be incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.149" end="00:44:39.069" style="s2">powerful tools for the elevation of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.179" end="00:44:40.929" style="s2">of the spirit man they don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.069" end="00:44:43.599" style="s2">destructive I mean I agree they largely</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.929" end="00:44:45.669" style="s2">are right now but that&#39;s a force of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.599" end="00:44:48.519" style="s2">way we use them not of their not of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.669" end="00:44:50.499" style="s2">technology itself yeah yes then I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.519" end="00:44:54.069" style="s2">a leveraging of the negative aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.499" end="00:44:56.049" style="s2">our current system yeah exactly it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.069" end="00:44:57.639" style="s2">their interest exactly to have us to</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.049" end="00:44:59.130" style="s2">have us jump every time a little message</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.639" end="00:45:03.269" style="s2">comes through because it might you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.130" end="00:45:05.529" style="s2">might be selling us something we want</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.269" end="00:45:12.819" style="s2">something that they can convince us that</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.529" end="00:45:14.409" style="s2">we won yeah so okay so that has to two</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.819" end="00:45:20.880" style="s2">ways of thinking about that a third way</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.409" end="00:45:24.519" style="s2">is back in 1803 when New Zealand adopted</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.880" end="00:45:27.549" style="s2">enfranchisement voting for women they</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.519" end="00:45:30.939" style="s2">didn&#39;t worry about what the Saudis would</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.549" end="00:45:33.039" style="s2">make of it yeah they thought it was the</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.939" end="00:45:35.789" style="s2">right thing to do this probably is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.039" end="00:45:41.229" style="s2">leading edge of human civilization here</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.789" end="00:45:43.689" style="s2">this place and so what we do may seem a</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.229" end="00:45:47.499" style="s2">bit out there to house we say less</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.689" end="00:45:49.689" style="s2">civilized countries but it may well be</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.499" end="00:45:53.099" style="s2">the right thing but we shouldn&#39;t wait</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.689" end="00:45:57.579" style="s2">for their approval before we do it and</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.099" end="00:46:00.309" style="s2">so this is like a spearhead of progress</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.579" end="00:46:03.880" style="s2">and there will be unanswered questions</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.309" end="00:46:05.859" style="s2">but in the short term we can manage</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.880" end="00:46:06.970" style="s2">without brand new iPhones</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.859" end="00:46:10.800" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the things that makes</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.970" end="00:46:13.450" style="s2">country excuse me sort of great and</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.800" end="00:46:15.160" style="s2">pivotal actually in what we&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.450" end="00:46:18.880" style="s2">why I think we&#39;re gonna succeed in</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.160" end="00:46:22.210" style="s2">becoming the first 93 country because of</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.880" end="00:46:24.250" style="s2">the original aspirations of the first</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.210" end="00:46:27.609" style="s2">settlers and I don&#39;t mean the Whalers</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.250" end="00:46:31.690" style="s2">and the seal hunters I mean the wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.609" end="00:46:35.040" style="s2">educated and aspirational British mostly</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.690" end="00:46:37.690" style="s2">that came in so the late 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.040" end="00:46:39.670" style="s2">they weren&#39;t economic refugees they</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.690" end="00:46:42.130" style="s2">weren&#39;t fleeing terror or persecution</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.670" end="00:46:45.730" style="s2">they were looking for a better life in</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.130" end="00:46:47.790" style="s2">the nation yeah they were starting to</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.730" end="00:46:51.819" style="s2">have second thoughts about the colonial</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.790" end="00:46:53.230" style="s2">Imperial March of British aspirations</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.819" end="00:46:54.730" style="s2">across the world you know at gunpoint</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.230" end="00:46:56.050" style="s2">but they were it was definitely</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.730" end="00:47:00.010" style="s2">different when they came to New Zealand</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.050" end="00:47:02.890" style="s2">and much of it was to escape the</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.010" end="00:47:06.010" style="s2">hierarchy and the class divisions that</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.890" end="00:47:09.700" style="s2">were prevalent in you know 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.010" end="00:47:12.069" style="s2">England so we have a few things like the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.700" end="00:47:13.869" style="s2">quarter acre plots no one could build a</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.069" end="00:47:15.880" style="s2">house on a site that was smaller than a</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.869" end="00:47:18.220" style="s2">quarter of an acre which is enough to</p>
