<p begin="00:02:17.650" end="00:02:21.850" style="s2">to straighten out your life then I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.570" end="00:02:23.080" style="s2">recommend the self authoring program and</p>

<p begin="00:02:23.080" end="00:02:27.849" style="s2">better or someone that you know then you</p>

<p begin="00:02:35.409" end="00:02:40.209" style="s2">now about sixty five cities with Tammy</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.900" end="00:02:42.010" style="s2">somebody asked how she manages this</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.209" end="00:02:44.560" style="s2">she&#39;s exceptionally good at traveling</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.010" end="00:02:46.959" style="s2">and very low in neuroticism thank God</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.560" end="00:02:49.719" style="s2">for that because it&#39;s been a stressful</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.959" end="00:02:52.420" style="s2">time with lots of opportunity obviously</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.719" end="00:02:54.239" style="s2">and she likes to travel and so she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.420" end="00:02:57.400" style="s2">very good at helping me manage this</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.239" end="00:02:59.230" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna hit about 40 more cities 40</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.400" end="00:03:01.450" style="s2">or 50 more cities between now and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.230" end="00:03:02.889" style="s2">end of April next year which is when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.450" end="00:03:06.510" style="s2">going to bring all this touring to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.889" end="00:03:09.519" style="s2">close in September and early October</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.510" end="00:03:12.040" style="s2">we&#39;re doing 20 cities on the eastern</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.519" end="00:03:16.090" style="s2">seaboard of the United States and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.040" end="00:03:18.790" style="s2">in October near the end of October about</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.090" end="00:03:22.030" style="s2">15 cities in the UK and northern Europe</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.790" end="00:03:25.569" style="s2">and then in February Australia and New</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.030" end="00:03:28.989" style="s2">Zealand and then in April March and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.569" end="00:03:30.699" style="s2">April then the rest of Europe that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.989" end="00:03:33.729" style="s2">plan anyways and perhaps there&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.699" end="00:03:35.560" style="s2">some side trips during those times to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.729" end="00:03:38.040" style="s2">other places and so you can find out</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.560" end="00:03:41.139" style="s2">about that at Jordan B Peterson com</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.040" end="00:03:42.909" style="s2">forward slash events you&#39;re more than</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.139" end="00:03:46.620" style="s2">welcome to come to the talks they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.909" end="00:03:49.299" style="s2">been very good events in my estimation</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.620" end="00:03:51.609" style="s2">I&#39;ve really enjoyed them I can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.299" end="00:03:54.549" style="s2">I enjoy doing those talks and I find</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.609" end="00:03:57.669" style="s2">them a lot less stressful than talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.549" end="00:03:59.519" style="s2">to journalists the crowds are there the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.669" end="00:04:02.859" style="s2">individuals in the crowds are there to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.519" end="00:04:05.310" style="s2">come and listen to a serious discussion</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.859" end="00:04:07.720" style="s2">about how life might be improved and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.310" end="00:04:09.909" style="s2">they&#39;re very very positive events so</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.720" end="00:04:12.040" style="s2">I&#39;ve been very happy to do them the Sam</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.909" end="00:04:15.310" style="s2">Harris videos I did for talks with Sam</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.040" end="00:04:17.620" style="s2">Harris those are in preparation we hope</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.310" end="00:04:18.789" style="s2">we&#39;ll have them out in August</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.620" end="00:04:20.019" style="s2">everybody&#39;s trying to come to an</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.789" end="00:04:22.090" style="s2">agreement about how they should be</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.019" end="00:04:24.250" style="s2">released it&#39;s rather complicated affair</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.090" end="00:04:26.789" style="s2">given how many people are involved but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.250" end="00:04:29.889" style="s2">think we&#39;re close to figuring that out</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.789" end="00:04:31.780" style="s2">there&#39;ll be ten hours of taped talks for</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.889" end="00:04:33.400" style="s2">or sessions two and a half hours each I</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.780" end="00:04:36.219" style="s2">think the talks were very very</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.400" end="00:04:39.669" style="s2">productive we&#39;ll see the audience&#39;s seem</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.219" end="00:04:41.750" style="s2">to react positively to them and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.669" end="00:04:45.560" style="s2">were very well attended we had 8,500</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.750" end="00:04:47.330" style="s2">people in Dublin so and about 6500 in</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.560" end="00:04:49.070" style="s2">London so those were very large crowds</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.330" end="00:04:52.310" style="s2">so that&#39;s very cool</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.070" end="00:04:54.350" style="s2">mmm 12 rules for life has sold about 2</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.310" end="00:04:56.960" style="s2">million copies now and for those of you</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.350" end="00:05:00.050" style="s2">who are mathematically geek inclined</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.960" end="00:05:03.170" style="s2">that&#39;s 57 miles of bookshelf if the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.050" end="00:05:05.570" style="s2">books are stacked you know as you would</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.170" end="00:05:08.420" style="s2">put books on a bookshelf so that&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.570" end="00:05:11.330" style="s2">of books and maps of meaning I released</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.420" end="00:05:13.880" style="s2">the audio version of that June 12 2008</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.330" end="00:05:16.220" style="s2">een and it didn&#39;t it hit the New York</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.880" end="00:05:17.330" style="s2">Times bestseller list for audiobooks in</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.220" end="00:05:19.820" style="s2">July and August</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.330" end="00:05:22.670" style="s2">so that was rather comical given that 12</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.820" end="00:05:25.820" style="s2">rules for life was never put on the New</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.670" end="00:05:27.470" style="s2">York Times bestseller list so I thought</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.820" end="00:05:29.420" style="s2">that was an ironic little touch of fate</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.470" end="00:05:31.550" style="s2">and I&#39;m quite pleased to see how the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.420" end="00:05:33.080" style="s2">audiobook is doing if you like 12 rules</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.550" end="00:05:35.240" style="s2">for life and you&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.080" end="00:05:38.090" style="s2">something that delves more deeply into</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.240" end="00:05:39.710" style="s2">the same themes then you could try maps</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.090" end="00:05:41.660" style="s2">of meaning and I think the audiobook</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.710" end="00:05:44.180" style="s2">which I read is more accessible than the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.660" end="00:05:46.610" style="s2">written book people seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.180" end="00:05:48.980" style="s2">responding to it that way so I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.610" end="00:05:55.310" style="s2">happy about all the positive things that</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.980" end="00:05:58.670" style="s2">are happening so okay how am i that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.310" end="00:06:01.550" style="s2">the first question how am i well pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.670" end="00:06:03.440" style="s2">good actually my health seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.550" end="00:06:05.270" style="s2">stabilized substantially I&#39;m feeling</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.440" end="00:06:08.990" style="s2">pretty sharp</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.270" end="00:06:12.200" style="s2">I have periods of some negative mood</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.990" end="00:06:15.440" style="s2">although they&#39;re short and sweet so to</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.200" end="00:06:17.150" style="s2">speak but I&#39;m seemed to be sharp</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.440" end="00:06:18.680" style="s2">cognitively and I can concentrate for</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.150" end="00:06:20.330" style="s2">long periods of time and get lots done</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.680" end="00:06:21.740" style="s2">I&#39;ve been able to do quite a bit of</p>

<p begin="00:06:21.740" end="00:06:28.600" style="s2">partly blog posts partly also I had the</p>

<p begin="00:06:40.340" end="00:06:46.430" style="s2">write about 3,500 words if I remember</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.300" end="00:06:49.090" style="s2">correctly it was a daunting task to</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.430" end="00:06:52.960" style="s2">write an introduction to a book as</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.090" end="00:06:54.690" style="s2">tremendously influential and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.960" end="00:06:58.500" style="s2">important and</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.690" end="00:07:00.750" style="s2">and also of exceedingly high literary</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.500" end="00:07:02.730" style="s2">quality so it was a daunting task to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.750" end="00:07:04.680" style="s2">write that introduction and I really</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.730" end="00:07:08.040" style="s2">wanted to get it right and I hope I did</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.680" end="00:07:09.870" style="s2">I spoke by email with Solzhenitsyn&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.040" end="00:07:11.370" style="s2">family and they seemed pleased with it</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.870" end="00:07:13.860" style="s2">and so did the editor and I&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.370" end="00:07:18.360" style="s2">couple of editors including Greg Hurwitz</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.860" end="00:07:20.130" style="s2">my novelist friend from LA who&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.360" end="00:07:23.100" style="s2">absolutely vicious editor and extremely</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.130" end="00:07:27.810" style="s2">good at it so they were happy with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.100" end="00:07:29.250" style="s2">final cut so to speak so was I so I seem</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.810" end="00:07:31.890" style="s2">to be sharp enough to do the work that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.250" end="00:07:33.720" style="s2">necessary to do I&#39;ve been working hard</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.890" end="00:07:35.610" style="s2">on the online university I&#39;ve got three</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.720" end="00:07:39.810" style="s2">people hired they&#39;re all very smart</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.610" end="00:07:41.400" style="s2">young guys and we&#39;re about a year ahead</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.810" end="00:07:43.200" style="s2">of where I thought we&#39;d be at this point</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.400" end="00:07:46.110" style="s2">we hope to have a minimally Viable</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.200" end="00:07:48.570" style="s2">Product sometime in the late fall I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.110" end="00:07:51.450" style="s2">funding that entirely at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.570" end="00:07:53.130" style="s2">courtesy primarily of my patreon support</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.450" end="00:07:54.720" style="s2">so thank you to all my patreon</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.130" end="00:07:55.950" style="s2">supporters for that hopefully your</p>

<p begin="00:07:55.950" end="00:08:00.660" style="s2">we&#39;ll probably crowdfund in November see</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.980" end="00:08:03.150" style="s2">if we can set up enough capital for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.660" end="00:08:04.860" style="s2">next three or four years I could raise</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.150" end="00:08:07.290" style="s2">money privately there&#39;s lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.860" end="00:08:09.710" style="s2">are interested in investing but I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.290" end="00:08:12.030" style="s2">that I&#39;m gonna try crowdfunding because</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.710" end="00:08:13.650" style="s2">well because I&#39;d like this to be a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.030" end="00:08:15.570" style="s2">public enterprise from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.650" end="00:08:17.040" style="s2">Danah have lots of people involved and</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.570" end="00:08:19.290" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking of all sorts of ways of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.040" end="00:08:19.950" style="s2">getting people involved how am i other</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.290" end="00:08:24.150" style="s2">than that</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.950" end="00:08:28.230" style="s2">well nonplussed and still feeling rather</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.150" end="00:08:29.880" style="s2">surreal about my life I would say my</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.230" end="00:08:32.580" style="s2">family&#39;s in good shape my daughter who</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.880" end="00:08:35.340" style="s2">is very ill is doing extremely well</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.580" end="00:08:37.169" style="s2">so that&#39;s miraculous as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.340" end="00:08:40.110" style="s2">concerned my son&#39;s getting married in</p>

<p begin="00:08:51.330" end="00:08:56.280" style="s2">exception of one week last year and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.330" end="00:08:57.840" style="s2">going to a family reunion in Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.280" end="00:08:59.670" style="s2">Island and then to Saskatchewan to see</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.840" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">my family I&#39;m gonna do two talks in</p>

<p begin="00:09:08.670" end="00:09:13.040" style="s2">after that so that should be cool so</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.130" end="00:09:18.000" style="s2">that&#39;s how I am and I&#39;m thinking hard</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.380" end="00:09:21.240" style="s2">about the next book I have a new book</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.000" end="00:09:23.370" style="s2">contract about to be finalized I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.240" end="00:09:25.800" style="s2">in the next week I&#39;m hoping to release</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.370" end="00:09:30.660" style="s2">the next book which will be twelve more</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.800" end="00:09:33.090" style="s2">rules probably and beyond mere order is</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.660" end="00:09:36.930" style="s2">the tentative subtitle I&#39;m hoping that</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.090" end="00:09:40.590" style="s2">I&#39;ll have it done by spring early early</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.930" end="00:09:43.200" style="s2">spring perhaps January of 2020 if not</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.590" end="00:09:46.590" style="s2">one year later but I&#39;m going to try hard</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.200" end="00:09:48.660" style="s2">to hit it so that I&#39;m done by next</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.590" end="00:09:50.400" style="s2">September I&#39;m gonna write non-stop from</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.660" end="00:09:52.140" style="s2">May to September and then I plan to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.400" end="00:09:54.950" style="s2">biblical lectures from September through</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.140" end="00:10:01.110" style="s2">December so the plan is to tour from</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.950" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">January through May essentially then to</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.110" end="00:10:05.760" style="s2">write for four months then to lecture to</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:07.380" style="s2">prepare the biblical lectures and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.760" end="00:10:11.150" style="s2">forth for four months and so that should</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.380" end="00:10:15.770" style="s2">be next year so that&#39;s an update</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.150" end="00:10:18.600" style="s2">hopefully that&#39;s all useful information</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.770" end="00:10:22.140" style="s2">I&#39;m very pleased about all the support</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.600" end="00:10:24.810" style="s2">it&#39;s quite remarkable all this interest</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.140" end="00:10:27.090" style="s2">in these complicated matters and</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.810" end="00:10:29.160" style="s2">complicated discussions and it&#39;s so nice</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.090" end="00:10:30.990" style="s2">to see people concentrating on</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.160" end="00:10:32.790" style="s2">psychological and philosophical issues</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.990" end="00:10:35.100" style="s2">and leaving the idiot</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.790" end="00:10:38.010" style="s2">politics as far behind as possible</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.100" end="00:10:40.830" style="s2">because it&#39;s certainly uh what would you</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.010" end="00:10:44.100" style="s2">call it a distraction and a dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.830" end="00:10:46.620" style="s2">one at that so it&#39;s so funny talking to</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.100" end="00:10:49.380" style="s2">the mainstream media types because</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.620" end="00:10:50.850" style="s2">everything they talk about has to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.380" end="00:10:54.090" style="s2">viewed through a political lens and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.850" end="00:10:56.820" style="s2">although I continue to insist I did BBC</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.090" end="00:10:59.130" style="s2">hard talk which was aired today and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.820" end="00:11:01.110" style="s2">was a classic example of an interviewer</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.130" end="00:11:02.940" style="s2">being entirely scripted and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.110" end="00:11:04.230" style="s2">push everything that&#39;s happening around</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.940" end="00:11:06.720" style="s2">me I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.230" end="00:11:08.670" style="s2">into a political narrative and it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.720" end="00:11:10.560" style="s2">political as far as I&#39;m concerned not</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.670" end="00:11:13.440" style="s2">everything is political despite the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.560" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">insistence of people who feel that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.440" end="00:11:18.180" style="s2">personal is always political it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:20.280" style="s2">no there&#39;s philosophical domain a</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.180" end="00:11:22.259" style="s2">theological domain and a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.280" end="00:11:26.129" style="s2">domain those should be kept the hell</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.259" end="00:11:29.249" style="s2">Shepard from politics all right what can</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.129" end="00:11:31.350" style="s2">a two agreeable young woman do to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.249" end="00:11:33.089" style="s2">more disagreeable and assertive if that</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.350" end="00:11:35.489" style="s2">isn&#39;t how she is temper mentally</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.089" end="00:11:36.959" style="s2">inclined oh that&#39;s a good question and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.489" end="00:11:40.470" style="s2">would say first of all that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.959" end="00:11:42.629" style="s2">common question that people who go into</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.470" end="00:11:46.379" style="s2">psychotherapy ask I think the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.629" end="00:11:48.119" style="s2">common problem that psychotherapists</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.379" end="00:11:50.309" style="s2">deal with apart from anxiety and</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.119" end="00:11:53.970" style="s2">depression is probably assertiveness</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.309" end="00:11:55.889" style="s2">training so the first thing I would say</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.970" end="00:11:59.249" style="s2">is you really need to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.889" end="00:12:00.809" style="s2">you want and I would recommend doing the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.249" end="00:12:02.339" style="s2">self authoring program the future</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.809" end="00:12:04.499" style="s2">authoring program in particular because</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.339" end="00:12:07.499" style="s2">if you want to stand up for yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.499" end="00:12:10.049" style="s2">have to have your goals and your vision</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.499" end="00:12:13.709" style="s2">well laid out and well defined and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.049" end="00:12:16.579" style="s2">you have to have a strategy that that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.709" end="00:12:19.049" style="s2">matched to those goals so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.579" end="00:12:20.720" style="s2">so that you know what you want so that</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.049" end="00:12:23.369" style="s2">you know when you&#39;re not getting it</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.720" end="00:12:25.439" style="s2">otherwise you&#39;re left with a vague sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.369" end="00:12:26.819" style="s2">of dissatisfaction and resentment and</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.439" end="00:12:29.009" style="s2">that&#39;s very very difficult thing to</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.819" end="00:12:31.439" style="s2">articulate and if you can&#39;t articulate</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.009" end="00:12:33.539" style="s2">it then you can&#39;t negotiate if you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.439" end="00:12:34.949" style="s2">what you want and you know why then you</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.539" end="00:12:36.869" style="s2">can make a case for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.949" end="00:12:39.299" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s assume now that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.869" end="00:12:40.859" style="s2">laid out a vision and a counter vision</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.299" end="00:12:42.449" style="s2">which the future authoring program also</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.859" end="00:12:44.549" style="s2">helps you do so you know what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.449" end="00:12:46.470" style="s2">hell you want to avoid that you might</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.549" end="00:12:48.089" style="s2">drift into if you were to agreeable for</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.470" end="00:12:50.129" style="s2">the rest of your life that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.089" end="00:12:51.720" style="s2">hell that consisted mostly of people</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.129" end="00:12:53.339" style="s2">taking advantage of you all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.720" end="00:12:56.639" style="s2">you feeling resentful and bitter about</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.339" end="00:12:59.970" style="s2">it not something I would recommend see I</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.639" end="00:13:02.429" style="s2">think that women are agreeable because</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.970" end="00:13:05.519" style="s2">it helps them deal with infants but it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:13:10.079" end="00:13:14.699" style="s2">the adult world so I think it&#39;s a price</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.059" end="00:13:16.559" style="s2">that women pay for also being adapted to</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.699" end="00:13:18.959" style="s2">have plenty of patience for very young</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.559" end="00:13:21.689" style="s2">children and then you have to overcome</p>

<p begin="00:13:21.689" end="00:13:27.479" style="s2">forward properly in more complex</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.609" end="00:13:28.799" style="s2">hierarchies of accomplishment so I would</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.479" end="00:13:30.689" style="s2">say once you have your vision</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.799" end="00:13:32.519" style="s2">established your vision for the future</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.689" end="00:13:33.989" style="s2">and your counter vision so you&#39;re afraid</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.519" end="00:13:35.520" style="s2">of what will happen if you don&#39;t stand</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.989" end="00:13:37.860" style="s2">up for yourself then</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.520" end="00:13:39.210" style="s2">need to consult your resentment fit</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.860" end="00:13:40.950" style="s2">because if you&#39;re resentful about</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.210" end="00:13:43.650" style="s2">something as far as I can tell there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.950" end="00:13:45.570" style="s2">generally only two reasons one is you</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.650" end="00:13:47.250" style="s2">should grow the hell up and quit whining</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.570" end="00:13:49.320" style="s2">so you got to find out first if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.250" end="00:13:51.270" style="s2">just feeling sorry for yourself and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.320" end="00:13:52.860" style="s2">can think that through make a pro and</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.270" end="00:13:54.750" style="s2">con case and you can talk to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.860" end="00:13:56.700" style="s2">that you care about about that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.750" end="00:13:58.650" style="s2">assuming that that&#39;s the reason but</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.700" end="00:14:00.900" style="s2">that&#39;s one potential reason if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.650" end="00:14:02.550" style="s2">not merely feeling sorry for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.900" end="00:14:04.830" style="s2">then you probably have something to say</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.550" end="00:14:06.090" style="s2">and something that you need and you need</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.830" end="00:14:08.400" style="s2">to figure out what that is and then you</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.090" end="00:14:10.890" style="s2">have to develop a strategy to to put</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.400" end="00:14:13.560" style="s2">that forward I&#39;ve seen lots of people in</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.890" end="00:14:15.900" style="s2">my personal life and in my private</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.560" end="00:14:18.270" style="s2">practice not get what they want because</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.900" end="00:14:20.460" style="s2">well a they don&#39;t specify it and B they</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.270" end="00:14:22.920" style="s2">don&#39;t ask for it and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.460" end="00:14:24.810" style="s2">negotiating save for a raise or for a</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.920" end="00:14:26.820" style="s2">promotion and so forth you have to put</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.810" end="00:14:29.610" style="s2">yourself forward you need to tell your</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.820" end="00:14:30.860" style="s2">the person you&#39;re working for why you</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.610" end="00:14:33.630" style="s2">should be treated with more</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.860" end="00:14:35.250" style="s2">consideration or respect or have more</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.630" end="00:14:36.600" style="s2">resources devoted to you or more</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.250" end="00:14:39.420" style="s2">authority</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.600" end="00:14:41.400" style="s2">what&#39;s shifted to you and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.420" end="00:14:43.710" style="s2">make a case for that a compelling case</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.400" end="00:14:46.110" style="s2">so that they have a reason to attend to</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.710" end="00:14:48.240" style="s2">you and that&#39;s not good they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.110" end="00:14:50.220" style="s2">going to notice because most managerial</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.240" end="00:14:51.840" style="s2">types are so overloaded with work that</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.220" end="00:14:52.440" style="s2">they never notice when anything&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.840" end="00:14:54.510" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.440" end="00:14:56.810" style="s2">they just notice the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.510" end="00:14:59.040" style="s2">going wrong so you need to make a plan</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.810" end="00:15:00.930" style="s2">you have to have a strategy that goes</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.040" end="00:15:04.260" style="s2">along with that plan you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.930" end="00:15:06.660" style="s2">articulated arguments for why certain a</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.260" end="00:15:08.850" style="s2">certain form of treatment is appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.660" end="00:15:11.880" style="s2">to you and then you have to have the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.850" end="00:15:13.170" style="s2">courage to put that forward and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.880" end="00:15:16.320" style="s2">you have to remember that you owe</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.170" end="00:15:17.910" style="s2">yourself as much as you owe other people</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.320" end="00:15:20.220" style="s2">you have to take care of yourself like</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.910" end="00:15:22.560" style="s2">you take care of other people and and</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.220" end="00:15:24.660" style="s2">that&#39;s a moral duty and if you practice</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.560" end="00:15:26.460" style="s2">that you can do it and a lot of that a</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.660" end="00:15:27.450" style="s2">lot of that&#39;s also associated with</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.460" end="00:15:28.830" style="s2">telling the truth</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.450" end="00:15:30.150" style="s2">you know you don&#39;t have a better friend</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.830" end="00:15:33.000" style="s2">than the truth even though it can be</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.150" end="00:15:34.530" style="s2">very harsh in the short term and so if</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.000" end="00:15:36.120" style="s2">you&#39;re unhappy at work because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.530" end="00:15:37.710" style="s2">being taken advantage of then you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.120" end="00:15:40.080" style="s2">to strategize yourself out of that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.710" end="00:15:41.520" style="s2">have to learn to negotiate and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.080" end="00:15:43.800" style="s2">that also means that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.520" end="00:15:45.660" style="s2">overcome your hesitancy to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.800" end="00:15:49.230" style="s2">conflict and you got to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.660" end="00:15:51.420" style="s2">this way negotiation</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.230" end="00:15:54.030" style="s2">and conflict are somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.420" end="00:15:56.220" style="s2">indistinguishable and it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.030" end="00:15:57.690" style="s2">moment-to-moment to avoid negotiation</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.220" end="00:15:59.670" style="s2">conflict but you pay a terrible price</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.690" end="00:16:02.250" style="s2">for it in the medium to long term it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.670" end="00:16:05.580" style="s2">better to face the conflict forthrightly</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.250" end="00:16:07.440" style="s2">in the present and make peace for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.580" end="00:16:09.330" style="s2">medium to long term and there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.440" end="00:16:11.820" style="s2">courage in that so that&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.330" end="00:16:16.740" style="s2">thing I would say is gird up your loins</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.820" end="00:16:19.020" style="s2">and and and and allow yourself to act</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.740" end="00:16:21.210" style="s2">courageously courageously and truthfully</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.020" end="00:16:23.610" style="s2">truth is your best bet if you&#39;re too</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.210" end="00:16:24.570" style="s2">agreeable so you know you also might</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.610" end="00:16:26.460" style="s2">find that you have a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.570" end="00:16:28.470" style="s2">critical intelligence but that you think</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.460" end="00:16:30.300" style="s2">it&#39;s mean and so that you keep it hidden</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.470" end="00:16:31.830" style="s2">some of the smartest women I knew who</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.300" end="00:16:34.050" style="s2">were very very agreeable had</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.830" end="00:16:36.270" style="s2">unbelievably good instincts with regards</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.050" end="00:16:38.280" style="s2">to figuring out what other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.270" end="00:16:40.590" style="s2">motives were but they were ashamed of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.280" end="00:16:42.480" style="s2">their suspicions and really what that</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.590" end="00:16:44.130" style="s2">meant was they ended up being ashamed of</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.480" end="00:16:47.220" style="s2">their critical intelligence because they</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.130" end="00:16:48.990" style="s2">were so agreeable so it may be that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.220" end="00:16:50.700" style="s2">darker part of you the shadow part of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.990" end="00:16:52.020" style="s2">you knows things that you could know if</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.700" end="00:16:54.570" style="s2">you were willing to admit that they were</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.020" end="00:16:57.600" style="s2">true and so you have to give some</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.570" end="00:17:00.140" style="s2">credence to your to your darker element</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.600" end="00:17:00.140" style="s2">I would say</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.680" end="00:17:17.450" style="s2">how do you know if you&#39;re communicating</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.540" end="00:17:19.370" style="s2">with the actual person or a mask I</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.450" end="00:17:22.670" style="s2">sometimes wonder if I can ever really</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.370" end="00:17:24.680" style="s2">know someone well you can&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.670" end="00:17:26.240" style="s2">thoroughly know someone because people</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.680" end="00:17:28.340" style="s2">are too complicated you can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.240" end="00:17:29.690" style="s2">really know yourself how do you know if</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.340" end="00:17:31.850" style="s2">you&#39;re communicating with the actual</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.690" end="00:17:33.740" style="s2">person or a mask well if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.850" end="00:17:34.700" style="s2">communicating with an actual person then</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.740" end="00:17:37.910" style="s2">you&#39;re actually having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.700" end="00:17:39.680" style="s2">you know when the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.910" end="00:17:41.420" style="s2">transforms as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.680" end="00:17:43.970" style="s2">participating in it and it tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.420" end="00:17:46.330" style="s2">engaging and meaningful if what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.970" end="00:17:49.520" style="s2">happening is an exchange of ideological</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.330" end="00:17:51.050" style="s2">platitudes or just platitudes themselves</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.520" end="00:17:54.140" style="s2">for that matter then you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.050" end="00:17:55.550" style="s2">engaging with the mask so if the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.140" end="00:17:57.800" style="s2">conversation is compelling and</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.550" end="00:18:00.590" style="s2">meaningful and it transforms as it as it</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.800" end="00:18:02.540" style="s2">progresses and and you can see that give</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.590" end="00:18:04.580" style="s2">and take that dance like give and take</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.540" end="00:18:06.590" style="s2">then you&#39;re communicating with an actual</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.580" end="00:18:08.660" style="s2">person the other thing I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.590" end="00:18:11.180" style="s2">that when you&#39;re communicating with an</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.660" end="00:18:12.830" style="s2">actual person rather than a mask the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.180" end="00:18:15.380" style="s2">person that you&#39;re communicating with</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.830" end="00:18:17.150" style="s2">tends to be quite interesting you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.380" end="00:18:18.770" style="s2">if people talk about what they know</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.150" end="00:18:20.750" style="s2">which means you&#39;re really communicating</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.770" end="00:18:24.050" style="s2">with them if they talk about their own</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.750" end="00:18:26.030" style="s2">personal experience instead of wandering</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.050" end="00:18:28.970" style="s2">off into the domain of cliches and</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.030" end="00:18:31.490" style="s2">ideological platitudes then people tend</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.970" end="00:18:35.150" style="s2">to be extraordinarily interesting and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.490" end="00:18:36.860" style="s2">that&#39;s another good tactic and a good</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.150" end="00:18:38.810" style="s2">hint that you&#39;re that you&#39;re where you</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.860" end="00:18:40.970" style="s2">should be when you&#39;re conversing one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.810" end="00:18:44.060" style="s2">the rules I had when I was seeing</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.970" end="00:18:45.770" style="s2">clients actively was that if the</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.060" end="00:18:48.050" style="s2">conversation I was having wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.770" end="00:18:49.630" style="s2">interesting and if my attention started</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.050" end="00:18:52.100" style="s2">to wander then we weren&#39;t discussing</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.630" end="00:18:54.260" style="s2">issues that were sufficiently vital</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.100" end="00:18:56.870" style="s2">because if we were discussing vital</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.260" end="00:18:59.480" style="s2">issues then the conversation basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.870" end="00:19:02.770" style="s2">flew by and so I think that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.480" end="00:19:02.770" style="s2">that&#39;s a good marker</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.070" end="00:19:10.129" style="s2">what new wisdom have you acquired in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.690" end="00:19:12.409" style="s2">past few months that you want to share</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.129" end="00:19:14.419" style="s2">with us well I&#39;ve got one I think I</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.409" end="00:19:17.200" style="s2">thought thought up a bunch of new things</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.419" end="00:19:21.289" style="s2">but this one I&#39;m really happy with I</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.200" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">figured out why you know some of you</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.289" end="00:19:26.509" style="s2">know that there&#39;s a mythological trope</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:28.399" style="s2">that I discussed fairly frequently about</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.509" end="00:19:30.619" style="s2">rescuing your father from the belly of</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.399" end="00:19:33.379" style="s2">the Dragon or the belly of the beast</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.619" end="00:19:36.139" style="s2">it&#39;s a motif that you see when you see</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.379" end="00:19:39.230" style="s2">it in the Lion King you see it when</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.139" end="00:19:41.450" style="s2">Simba is being initiated by the baboon</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.230" end="00:19:42.710" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember fitnah feekiee I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.450" end="00:19:45.710" style="s2">his name is</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.710" end="00:19:49.220" style="s2">after nella humiliates him because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.710" end="00:19:51.590" style="s2">still a pathetic adolescent he follows</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.220" end="00:19:55.789" style="s2">the baboon I think it&#39;s a mandrill</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.590" end="00:19:57.409" style="s2">actually down underground essentially</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.789" end="00:19:59.059" style="s2">through a long tunnel there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.409" end="00:20:01.519" style="s2">kind of scary music in the background</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.059" end="00:20:03.799" style="s2">and he ends up contemplating himself in</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.519" end="00:20:07.009" style="s2">a dark pool and then his father appears</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.799" end="00:20:10.509" style="s2">in the sky and so that&#39;s one example of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.009" end="00:20:12.710" style="s2">the reconstruction of the mythology of</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.509" end="00:20:14.480" style="s2">encountering your father in the abyss</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.710" end="00:20:17.629" style="s2">you look into the abyss and you see your</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.480" end="00:20:19.249" style="s2">father and then in the Pinocchio story</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.629" end="00:20:21.889" style="s2">Pinocchio of course when he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.249" end="00:20:23.720" style="s2">become a genuine human being instead of</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.889" end="00:20:27.169" style="s2">a marionette pulled by other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.720" end="00:20:29.389" style="s2">strings or an erotic or or a liar or a</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.169" end="00:20:32.419" style="s2">jackass caz those are his alternate</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.389" end="00:20:34.279" style="s2">destinies he goes down to the darkest</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.419" end="00:20:36.110" style="s2">place he could find the bottom of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.279" end="00:20:37.700" style="s2">ocean and finds the biggest monster he</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.110" end="00:20:41.509" style="s2">can look at and inside he finds his</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.700" end="00:20:43.909" style="s2">father and then rescues him the question</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.509" end="00:20:46.940" style="s2">is why do you find your father when you</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.909" end="00:20:48.529" style="s2">look into the abyss and I really did do</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.940" end="00:20:50.809" style="s2">think I figured this out and it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.529" end="00:20:54.409" style="s2">exciting to me it&#39;s such a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.809" end="00:20:56.360" style="s2">image so we know as clinicians and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.409" end="00:20:58.070" style="s2">also I would say as sensible people but</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.360" end="00:21:00.559" style="s2">there&#39;s good clinical documentation of</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.070" end="00:21:03.350" style="s2">this that if you find out imagine</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.559" end="00:21:05.629" style="s2">someone&#39;s pursuing a goal and some of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.350" end="00:21:08.110" style="s2">the things they have to accomplish or</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.629" end="00:21:10.519" style="s2">confront on the way to that goal</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.110" end="00:21:12.470" style="s2">frighten them and they start to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.519" end="00:21:15.139" style="s2">and then they get more afraid and of</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.470" end="00:21:16.639" style="s2">course their ability to pursue their</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.139" end="00:21:18.470" style="s2">goal or to accomplish the goal</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.639" end="00:21:19.730" style="s2">deteriorates because they&#39;re avoiding if</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.470" end="00:21:23.000" style="s2">you&#39;re a psycho</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.730" end="00:21:25.220" style="s2">Pistor even a friend or or a supportive</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.000" end="00:21:27.500" style="s2">loved one let&#39;s say you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.220" end="00:21:29.060" style="s2">encourage the person to face the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.500" end="00:21:32.450" style="s2">challenges that are making them afraid</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.060" end="00:21:34.340" style="s2">to face them voluntarily and what</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.450" end="00:21:37.130" style="s2">happens as a consequence of that is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.340" end="00:21:39.020" style="s2">the person usually is able to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.130" end="00:21:43.010" style="s2">those fears and develop the necessary</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.020" end="00:21:45.500" style="s2">skills and and to prevail and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.010" end="00:21:47.690" style="s2">partly because not so much because they</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.500" end="00:21:50.030" style="s2">get less afraid but because they get</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.690" end="00:21:53.900" style="s2">more skilled and more courageous and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.030" end="00:21:55.670" style="s2">imagine that if you bite off a little</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.900" end="00:21:58.490" style="s2">more than you can chew you get stronger</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.670" end="00:22:00.440" style="s2">as a consequence and you do that in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.490" end="00:22:01.520" style="s2">gym for example when you go lift weights</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.440" end="00:22:03.290" style="s2">you lift weights that are a little</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.520" end="00:22:04.610" style="s2">heavier all the time and as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.290" end="00:22:06.860" style="s2">consequence you develop yourself</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.610" end="00:22:09.100" style="s2">physically and you turn into who you</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.860" end="00:22:12.950" style="s2">could be you turn into more than you are</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.100" end="00:22:14.930" style="s2">okay so if you face fears a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.950" end="00:22:17.120" style="s2">at a time fears and challenges and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.930" end="00:22:18.680" style="s2">do that voluntarily then you become more</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.120" end="00:22:21.950" style="s2">than who you are</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.680" end="00:22:23.420" style="s2">okay now let&#39;s recast that in archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.950" end="00:22:26.540" style="s2">language and make it into a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.420" end="00:22:28.940" style="s2">ultimate so so if you want to become</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.540" end="00:22:31.040" style="s2">everything that you could be then you</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.940" end="00:22:32.420" style="s2">look into the abyss itself which is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.040" end="00:22:34.640" style="s2">darkest place that you can possibly</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.420" end="00:22:36.890" style="s2">contemplate and that would be the terror</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.640" end="00:22:39.620" style="s2">of more mortality and insanity and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.890" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">of suffering and of malevolence all of</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.620" end="00:22:45.020" style="s2">those it would be like looking into hell</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.120" end="00:22:47.390" style="s2">I suppose to some degree and then by</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.020" end="00:22:49.310" style="s2">voluntarily doing that then you call</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.390" end="00:22:51.890" style="s2">upon the strongest part of yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.310" end="00:22:53.990" style="s2">respond and the strongest part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.890" end="00:22:57.160" style="s2">yourself is symbolized as the sleeping</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.990" end="00:23:00.200" style="s2">farther nested inside the beast and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.160" end="00:23:02.090" style="s2">the fundamental truth when you look into</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.200" end="00:23:03.560" style="s2">an abyss is that you don&#39;t see the abyss</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.090" end="00:23:05.720" style="s2">if you look long enough it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.560" end="00:23:07.370" style="s2">announcer to Nietzsche&#39;s conundrum if</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.720" end="00:23:09.500" style="s2">you look long enough into abyss and</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.370" end="00:23:11.390" style="s2">abyss then the abyss looks into you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.500" end="00:23:14.150" style="s2">like well if you look long enough into</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.390" end="00:23:16.760" style="s2">an abyss past when the abyss looks into</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.150" end="00:23:18.980" style="s2">you you see who you could become in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.760" end="00:23:22.400" style="s2">form of your of the great ancestral</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.980" end="00:23:25.280" style="s2">figures nested inside the catastrophe of</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.400" end="00:23:27.170" style="s2">life and then you can join them so to</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.280" end="00:23:29.450" style="s2">speak you can incorporate that and</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.170" end="00:23:31.520" style="s2">become stronger and you do that partly</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.450" end="00:23:33.380" style="s2">by taking on the challenge voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.520" end="00:23:34.820" style="s2">and that informs you</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.380" end="00:23:37.130" style="s2">because you learn when you take on</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.820" end="00:23:38.240" style="s2">challenges voluntarily but you also do</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.130" end="00:23:40.340" style="s2">that as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.240" end="00:23:41.990" style="s2">psychophysiological transformation</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.340" end="00:23:44.090" style="s2">because when you place yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.990" end="00:23:46.550" style="s2">challenging situations let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.090" end="00:23:49.100" style="s2">abyss is the archetype of the ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.550" end="00:23:51.470" style="s2">challenging situation then you turn on</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.100" end="00:23:53.510" style="s2">new genes in your nervous system and in</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.470" end="00:23:56.000" style="s2">your body that code for new proteins and</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.510" end="00:23:57.890" style="s2">you build new structures inside of you</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.000" end="00:24:00.440" style="s2">and none of that&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.890" end="00:24:02.690" style="s2">without the demand that&#39;s placed on you</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.440" end="00:24:05.180" style="s2">by willing to confront the full terror</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.690" end="00:24:07.160" style="s2">of life and so then I would say the full</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.180" end="00:24:09.410" style="s2">terror of life is something like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.160" end="00:24:12.140" style="s2">reality of suffering and death and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.410" end="00:24:14.000" style="s2">ever-present and the the ever looming</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.140" end="00:24:15.590" style="s2">presence of malevolence in your own</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.000" end="00:24:17.690" style="s2">heart and in the heart of other people</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.590" end="00:24:20.510" style="s2">so it&#39;s evil and suffering and to</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.690" end="00:24:22.280" style="s2">confront that is really well you risk</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.510" end="00:24:24.380" style="s2">blindness by confronting that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.280" end="00:24:26.570" style="s2">also a very old story you risk damaging</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.380" end="00:24:29.570" style="s2">your vision but if you do it</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.570" end="00:24:31.850" style="s2">forthrightly then you discover who you</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.570" end="00:24:34.850" style="s2">could be as a consequence and who you</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.850" end="00:24:37.310" style="s2">could be is the solution to malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.850" end="00:24:38.660" style="s2">and suffering and so that just blew me</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.310" end="00:24:42.080" style="s2">away when I figured that out it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.660" end="00:24:44.000" style="s2">partly a consequence of having lengthy</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.080" end="00:24:45.590" style="s2">discussions with Sam Harris and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.000" end="00:24:47.570" style="s2">this through more and more been pushed</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.590" end="00:24:51.770" style="s2">to think it through but I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.570" end="00:24:53.350" style="s2">an absolutely staggering what would you</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.770" end="00:24:56.270" style="s2">call it</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.350" end="00:24:58.910" style="s2">articulating that articulating that</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.270" end="00:25:01.100" style="s2">image fully for me I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.910" end="00:25:02.750" style="s2">articulated it fully but articulating it</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.100" end="00:25:04.730" style="s2">more fully really had a profound effect</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.750" end="00:25:07.820" style="s2">on me I think that&#39;s it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.730" end="00:25:11.570" style="s2">brilliant conceptualization that inside</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.820" end="00:25:14.410" style="s2">the darkest place is the heroic ancestor</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.570" end="00:25:17.870" style="s2">that whose identity you could</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.410" end="00:25:19.130" style="s2">incorporate perfect it&#39;s perfect and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.870" end="00:25:21.470" style="s2">really believe it&#39;s true and what it</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.130" end="00:25:23.990" style="s2">does is it says that a human being is</p>

<p begin="00:25:31.670" end="00:25:35.450" style="s2">other thing that&#39;s so interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.990" end="00:25:37.130" style="s2">that is that it it transforms pessimism</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.450" end="00:25:38.660" style="s2">into optimism it&#39;s like well the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.130" end="00:25:40.130" style="s2">is a very dark place it&#39;s full of</p>

<p begin="00:25:40.130" end="00:25:43.430" style="s2">and it might even be so full of</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.050" end="00:25:46.640" style="s2">suffering and malevolence that a</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.430" end="00:25:49.580" style="s2">reasonable person could question the</p>

<p begin="00:25:53.960" end="00:25:59.660" style="s2">absolutely great book Dostoevsky but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.650" end="00:26:02.210" style="s2">the truth of the matter seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.660" end="00:26:06.200" style="s2">if you face the pessimism full-frontal</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.210" end="00:26:08.990" style="s2">so to speak then you find something in</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.200" end="00:26:11.690" style="s2">you that can that&#39;s strong enough to</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.990" end="00:26:13.910" style="s2">take it on and that&#39;s really says</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.690" end="00:26:15.470" style="s2">something about what would you say the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.910" end="00:26:17.920" style="s2">relationship between human beings and</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.470" end="00:26:21.950" style="s2">divinity I would say because it takes</p>

<p begin="00:26:21.950" end="00:26:27.080" style="s2">power to be able to rise above the</p>

<p begin="00:26:27.080" end="00:26:31.070" style="s2">life and I do think that we have that</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.760" end="00:26:35.210" style="s2">within us if we don&#39;t shy away from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.070" end="00:26:37.840" style="s2">challenge so you know there&#39;s in in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.210" end="00:26:40.820" style="s2">story of King Arthur and the Holy Grail</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.840" end="00:26:43.160" style="s2">so the Holy Grail is one of two things</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.820" end="00:26:45.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a cup that either held the wine</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.160" end="00:26:48.200" style="s2">that Christ drank at the Last Supper or</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.800" end="00:26:51.620" style="s2">that was used to catch his blood when he</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.200" end="00:26:54.500" style="s2">was speared on the cross either one but</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.620" end="00:26:57.350" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s the reservoir let&#39;s say of</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.500" end="00:27:00.710" style="s2">the fluid that eternally nourishes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.350" end="00:27:02.150" style="s2">something like that and when you go to</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.710" end="00:27:03.500" style="s2">look for the Holy Grail you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.150" end="00:27:05.720" style="s2">where to look because you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.500" end="00:27:07.490" style="s2">where the Holy Grail is and so King</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.720" end="00:27:09.350" style="s2">Arthur and his knights who all sit at a</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.490" end="00:27:11.480" style="s2">round table because there is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.350" end="00:27:13.670" style="s2">equals each go off to find the Holy</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.480" end="00:27:16.790" style="s2">Grail and each of them enters the forest</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.670" end="00:27:20.090" style="s2">to begin the quest at the place that</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.790" end="00:27:22.760" style="s2">looks darkest to him and that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.090" end="00:27:25.070" style="s2">example of the same idea is that what</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.760" end="00:27:26.960" style="s2">you and another it&#39;s another example of</p>

<p begin="00:27:50.620" end="00:27:54.770" style="s2">unbelievably optimistic message because</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.000" end="00:27:57.050" style="s2">it suggests that if you&#39;re willing to</p>

<p begin="00:28:09.410" end="00:28:16.280" style="s2">deepest of ideas because who knows what</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.049" end="00:28:18.470" style="s2">the limit of a human being is so well</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.280" end="00:28:19.850" style="s2">that&#39;s some of the wisdom so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.470" end="00:28:21.320" style="s2">that I&#39;ve acquired in the last few</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.850" end="00:28:23.179" style="s2">months and there&#39;s quite a bit more to</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.320" end="00:28:25.580" style="s2">and but I&#39;m gonna write all this down</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.179" end="00:28:26.900" style="s2">and hopefully publish a bunch of it my</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.580" end="00:28:29.210" style="s2">next book I figured out a bunch about</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.900" end="00:28:32.390" style="s2">hierarchies too and how they function</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.210" end="00:28:35.480" style="s2">and a whole I&#39;ve developed a whole new</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.390" end="00:28:37.970" style="s2">way of conceptualizing one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.480" end="00:28:41.179" style="s2">I was arguing with about Sam are you</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.970" end="00:28:42.620" style="s2">with about with Sam Harris was the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.179" end="00:28:46.400" style="s2">relationship between facts and values</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.620" end="00:28:47.990" style="s2">because Sam and he has his reasons would</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.400" end="00:28:50.150" style="s2">like to propose that we can derive</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.990" end="00:28:52.309" style="s2">values directly from facts and he wants</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.150" end="00:28:54.710" style="s2">to do that because he wants to nail the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.309" end="00:28:57.410" style="s2">world of values to something solid so it</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.710" end="00:29:01.070" style="s2">doesn&#39;t float in air and and and and get</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.410" end="00:29:04.090" style="s2">let&#39;s say what would you call it</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.070" end="00:29:06.890" style="s2">hijacked by the fundamentalists or</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.090" end="00:29:08.720" style="s2">dissolve into nihilism and and both of</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.890" end="00:29:10.220" style="s2">those are terrible ends for a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.720" end="00:29:15.980" style="s2">of values so he wants to nail it to</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.220" end="00:29:20.480" style="s2">something more objective and and less</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.980" end="00:29:23.540" style="s2">relativistic and less less grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.480" end="00:29:25.100" style="s2">revealed truth that removes it from the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.540" end="00:29:27.500" style="s2">domain of fundamentalism and so I can</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.100" end="00:29:29.450" style="s2">understand his point and why he wants to</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.500" end="00:29:31.370" style="s2">do that but the problem is is that it</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.450" end="00:29:32.780" style="s2">isn&#39;t easy to derive values from facts</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.370" end="00:29:36.380" style="s2">because there&#39;s an infinite number of</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.780" end="00:29:38.630" style="s2">facts and by necessity a very finite</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.380" end="00:29:39.799" style="s2">number of values in fact most of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.630" end="00:29:41.480" style="s2">time when you&#39;re doing something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.799" end="00:29:44.360" style="s2">reducing the whole world to one value</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.480" end="00:29:46.250" style="s2">and that value is encapsulated in</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.360" end="00:29:47.690" style="s2">whatever goal you happen to be pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.250" end="00:29:49.400" style="s2">at the moment or whatever you&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.690" end="00:29:51.559" style="s2">attention to which is also a form of</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.400" end="00:29:54.049" style="s2">goal directed pursuit and so we&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.559" end="00:29:55.549" style="s2">figured out that and I kind of knew this</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.049" end="00:29:57.980" style="s2">but I could articulate it better now</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.549" end="00:29:59.900" style="s2">that you look at the world of facts</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.980" end="00:30:01.820" style="s2">through a hierarchy of values and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.900" end="00:30:04.610" style="s2">hierarchy of values is instantiated in</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.820" end="00:30:07.309" style="s2">your nervous system and simultaneously a</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.610" end="00:30:09.230" style="s2">social construct because you pay</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.309" end="00:30:12.470" style="s2">attention to things of value that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.230" end="00:30:13.760" style="s2">and everyone else have established as</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.470" end="00:30:16.040" style="s2">valuable through a process</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:17.810" style="s2">of social negotiation and you need to</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.040" end="00:30:19.610" style="s2">pay attention to what you think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.810" end="00:30:21.230" style="s2">valuable that everyone else thinks is</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.610" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">valuable because otherwise you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.230" end="00:30:25.490" style="s2">have any basis for shared attention and</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:27.440" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t have any basis for trade</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.490" end="00:30:29.240" style="s2">with other people so that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.440" end="00:30:31.700" style="s2">thing so that&#39;s really been helpful</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.240" end="00:30:34.820" style="s2">because so now I figured out that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.700" end="00:30:37.910" style="s2">reduce the infinite world of facts to</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.820" end="00:30:39.710" style="s2">the finite world of values by viewing</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.910" end="00:30:41.840" style="s2">the world of facts through what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.710" end="00:30:45.200" style="s2">essentially a dominance hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.840" end="00:30:46.780" style="s2">value and that&#39;s and that that exists</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.200" end="00:30:49.430" style="s2">both out in the social world and</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.780" end="00:30:51.380" style="s2">neurologically at the same time and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.430" end="00:30:54.530" style="s2">that&#39;s been unbelievably useful to</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.380" end="00:30:56.000" style="s2">figure out - and part of a mystery that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.530" end="00:31:00.740" style="s2">I&#39;d been trying to untangle for about</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.000" end="00:31:03.650" style="s2">three decades so that&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.740" end="00:31:06.830" style="s2">helpful and I&#39;ve also spent some more</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.650" end="00:31:08.420" style="s2">time thinking about the proper place of</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.830" end="00:31:11.900" style="s2">the right and the left wing so the right</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.420" end="00:31:18.170" style="s2">wing basically stands for the what would</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.900" end="00:31:21.470" style="s2">you call the the right wing serves as an</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.170" end="00:31:24.620" style="s2">advocate for hierarchy and the left wing</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.470" end="00:31:26.330" style="s2">serves as a critic of hierarchy and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.620" end="00:31:28.160" style="s2">right says well we need hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.330" end="00:31:30.110" style="s2">they&#39;re often hierarchies of competence</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.160" end="00:31:31.670" style="s2">they&#39;re necessary to organize people and</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.110" end="00:31:33.830" style="s2">society and they&#39;re necessary to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.670" end="00:31:36.230" style="s2">things done all of which is true and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.830" end="00:31:37.610" style="s2">left says yes but hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.230" end="00:31:39.260" style="s2">dispossessed and you have to pay</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.610" end="00:31:42.200" style="s2">attention to the widows and the orphans</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.260" end="00:31:44.200" style="s2">which is also true and so then the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.200" end="00:31:47.240" style="s2">political discussion is about how to</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.200" end="00:31:50.090" style="s2">ensure that hierarchies are maintained</p>

<p begin="00:31:50.090" end="00:31:54.590" style="s2">sufficient mercy within them to take</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.370" end="00:31:57.110" style="s2">care of the people who for one reason or</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.590" end="00:31:59.090" style="s2">another are struggling to find their</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.110" end="00:32:02.720" style="s2">place even in a hierarchy of competence</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.090" end="00:32:05.360" style="s2">and then the necessity for free speech</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.720" end="00:32:07.630" style="s2">emerges out of that because the left and</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.360" end="00:32:12.020" style="s2">the right have to communicate so that</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.630" end="00:32:14.800" style="s2">the proper balance between the the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.020" end="00:32:17.660" style="s2">current structure of the hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.800" end="00:32:19.820" style="s2">its transformation and mercy can be</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.660" end="00:32:21.200" style="s2">established on an ongoing basis so</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.820" end="00:32:22.520" style="s2">anyways there are three things that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.200" end="00:32:24.110" style="s2">really learned over the last few months</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.520" end="00:32:26.470" style="s2">and there&#39;s a bunch more but those will</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.110" end="00:32:26.470" style="s2">do for now</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.570" end="00:32:50.639" style="s2">if too much masculine masculinity is</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.479" end="00:32:54.179" style="s2">tyranny but the right amount is order</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.639" end="00:32:55.739" style="s2">and too much femininity is chaos what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.179" end="00:32:57.690" style="s2">the word for the right amount of</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.739" end="00:32:59.700" style="s2">femininity hmm that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.690" end="00:33:01.100" style="s2">question I read that a bit earlier and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.700" end="00:33:04.320" style="s2">couldn&#39;t come up with something</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.100" end="00:33:08.759" style="s2">immediate but the only thing I can think</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.320" end="00:33:12.859" style="s2">of is that often femininity has been</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.759" end="00:33:18.570" style="s2">characterized as wisdom and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.859" end="00:33:20.039" style="s2">so so the wisdom that God in in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.570" end="00:33:22.139" style="s2">judeo-christian tradition that God</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.039" end="00:33:25.289" style="s2">consults is feminine</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.139" end="00:33:28.679" style="s2">that&#39;s an old tradition and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.289" end="00:33:31.169" style="s2">because order needs to be leavened with</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.679" end="00:33:34.320" style="s2">the right amount of chaos in order for</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.169" end="00:33:37.769" style="s2">wisdom to emerge the order it can be</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.320" end="00:33:40.369" style="s2">blinded tyrannical and dead and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.769" end="00:33:43.440" style="s2">it&#39;s the mixture of the right amount of</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.369" end="00:33:45.389" style="s2">chaos that turns that order into wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.440" end="00:33:47.129" style="s2">and then that wisdom is often</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.389" end="00:33:49.109" style="s2">personified as feminine now that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.129" end="00:33:51.389" style="s2">exactly answer your question because it</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.109" end="00:33:55.859" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make the right balance you still</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.389" end="00:33:59.820" style="s2">don&#39;t have tyranny order you still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.859" end="00:34:02.279" style="s2">have order tyranny chaos you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.820" end="00:34:06.269" style="s2">missing the proper word there</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.279" end="00:34:08.399" style="s2">I don&#39;t it&#39;s a good question and and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.269" end="00:34:09.210" style="s2">wisdom idea is the best I can make of it</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.399" end="00:34:11.909" style="s2">for now</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.210" end="00:34:14.359" style="s2">is it better to marry someone with your</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.909" end="00:34:17.639" style="s2">temperament or a contrasting</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.359" end="00:34:19.980" style="s2">complementary temperament well there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.639" end="00:34:22.200" style="s2">evidence on this and basically you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.980" end="00:34:24.990" style="s2">want to marry someone with whom your two</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.200" end="00:34:28.020" style="s2">mismatched now the only possible</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.990" end="00:34:30.419" style="s2">exception to that is neuroticism you</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.020" end="00:34:32.129" style="s2">know neuroticism is a good predictor of</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.419" end="00:34:33.929" style="s2">marital trouble and it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.129" end="00:34:36.450" style="s2">predictor of troubled period or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.929" end="00:34:39.599" style="s2">sensitivity to trouble which is in some</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.450" end="00:34:42.030" style="s2">sense the same thing it&#39;s varied and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.599" end="00:34:45.659" style="s2">don&#39;t know of any research specifically</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.030" end="00:34:47.250" style="s2">pertaining to this now I know that</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.659" end="00:34:49.829" style="s2">people who are high in neuroticism are</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.250" end="00:34:53.460" style="s2">more likely to miss work and to visit</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.829" end="00:34:55.649" style="s2">the doctor and to and and to be unhappy</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.460" end="00:34:59.040" style="s2">in their marriages and so forth and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.649" end="00:35:02.100" style="s2">may also account for why 75% of divorces</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.040" end="00:35:03.930" style="s2">are initiated by women and I think women</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.100" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">are more sensitive to negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.930" end="00:35:07.140" style="s2">partly because they have to take care of</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:10.350" style="s2">infants and need to be more sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.140" end="00:35:12.930" style="s2">threat and perhaps because sexuality is</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.350" end="00:35:15.540" style="s2">more dangerous to women and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.930" end="00:35:17.390" style="s2">because women are physically smaller and</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.540" end="00:35:20.010" style="s2">all of this seems to kick in at puberty</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.390" end="00:35:22.410" style="s2">anyways it isn&#39;t obvious to me that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.010" end="00:35:23.970" style="s2">want to match someone with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.410" end="00:35:25.560" style="s2">neuroticism if you&#39;re high in</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.970" end="00:35:27.090" style="s2">neuroticism I think if you&#39;re high in</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.560" end="00:35:30.240" style="s2">neuroticism you need to find someone</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.090" end="00:35:31.890" style="s2">who&#39;s low in neuroticism because then</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.240" end="00:35:35.550" style="s2">you have someone around to calm you down</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.890" end="00:35:38.040" style="s2">now apart from that the research</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.550" end="00:35:41.130" style="s2">literature does indicate that match is</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.040" end="00:35:43.110" style="s2">better and you can see why it&#39;s hard for</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.130" end="00:35:45.000" style="s2">extroverts and introverts to get along</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.110" end="00:35:46.440" style="s2">if they&#39;re especially if they&#39;re extreme</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.000" end="00:35:48.240" style="s2">extroverts and extreme introverts</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.440" end="00:35:51.090" style="s2">because an extreme extrovert always</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.240" end="00:35:53.730" style="s2">wants to be with other people and in</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.090" end="00:35:55.830" style="s2">groups and an extreme introvert hardly</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.730" end="00:35:58.260" style="s2">ever wants that and that&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.830" end="00:36:00.960" style="s2">difficult thing to negotiate and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.260" end="00:36:02.460" style="s2">with conscientiousness same thing if</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.960" end="00:36:04.290" style="s2">you&#39;re really high and orderliness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.460" end="00:36:06.090" style="s2">very hard to be married to someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.290" end="00:36:07.800" style="s2">very low in orderliness you&#39;re gonna end</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.090" end="00:36:09.180" style="s2">up doing all the cleaning for example</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.800" end="00:36:12.060" style="s2">that will drive you crazy and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.180" end="00:36:14.070" style="s2">high in industriousness same thing if</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.060" end="00:36:16.380" style="s2">you&#39;re super high in industriousness and</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.070" end="00:36:18.720" style="s2">orderliness you might want someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.380" end="00:36:20.550" style="s2">maybe moderate in both to kind of temper</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.720" end="00:36:21.990" style="s2">you a bit because one of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.550" end="00:36:24.330" style="s2">with being too high in conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.990" end="00:36:25.800" style="s2">is that you can&#39;t stop working and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.330" end="00:36:29.070" style="s2">should probably stop working from time</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.800" end="00:36:30.870" style="s2">to time agreeableness same thing hard</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.070" end="00:36:32.700" style="s2">for an agreeable and disagreeable person</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.870" end="00:36:37.500" style="s2">to get along you know the agreeable</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.700" end="00:36:40.980" style="s2">person will always be the disagreeable</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.500" end="00:36:43.110" style="s2">person who won&#39;t shy away from conflict</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.980" end="00:36:45.750" style="s2">is likely to dominate the agreeable</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.110" end="00:36:49.170" style="s2">person quite badly so that&#39;s a tough</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.750" end="00:36:51.770" style="s2">bridge to - that&#39;s a tough chasm to</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.170" end="00:36:56.910" style="s2">bridge as well so you look for</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.770" end="00:36:58.230" style="s2">temperamental similarity now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.910" end="00:36:59.970" style="s2">complicated because like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.230" end="00:37:01.380" style="s2">really really low in industriousness and</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.970" end="00:37:02.820" style="s2">you marry someone else who&#39;s really low</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.380" end="00:37:04.620" style="s2">in industriousness well that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.820" end="00:37:06.180" style="s2">be trouble for both of you because there</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.620" end="00:37:09.450" style="s2">isn&#39;t going to be anyone around who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.180" end="00:37:11.370" style="s2">going to do the work so you might</p>

<p begin="00:37:11.370" end="00:37:17.080" style="s2">long-term strategy it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.760" end="00:37:19.320" style="s2">very good one so it seems like your</p>

<p begin="00:37:28.330" end="00:37:32.440" style="s2">think that&#39;s true I I think that might</p>

<p begin="00:37:40.510" end="00:37:47.850" style="s2">there about the danger of an excess of</p>

<p begin="00:38:05.650" end="00:38:12.360" style="s2">complicated in part because the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.530" end="00:38:16.420" style="s2">classically speaking is associated with</p>

<p begin="00:38:35.040" end="00:38:40.350" style="s2">understand the role of the feminine and</p>

<p begin="00:39:01.650" end="00:39:07.020" style="s2">some degree because women haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.740" end="00:39:11.070" style="s2">able to do that except in the last</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.020" end="00:39:14.520" style="s2">hundred years so I don&#39;t know what what</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.070" end="00:39:17.550" style="s2">the positive feminine on a large scale</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.520" end="00:39:20.120" style="s2">would look like and we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.550" end="00:39:24.270" style="s2">guiding stories for that this is partly</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.120" end="00:39:26.970" style="s2">to underline the absolutely radical</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.270" end="00:39:31.010" style="s2">nature of the birth control pill and not</p>

<p begin="00:39:37.110" end="00:39:40.950" style="s2">with their monthly menstrual cycle which</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.940" end="00:39:44.880" style="s2">was also a huge impediment to women and</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.950" end="00:39:47.130" style="s2">in terms of interacting in the let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.880" end="00:39:49.230" style="s2">the patriarchal world so now women can</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.130" end="00:39:51.510" style="s2">take their place in the broader cultural</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.230" end="00:39:54.660" style="s2">world and we don&#39;t know what the model</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.510" end="00:39:56.910" style="s2">for that is so you know you might say</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.660" end="00:39:59.130" style="s2">well they should adopt the heroic</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.910" end="00:40:02.640" style="s2">masculine perspective and certainly to</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.130" end="00:40:07.710" style="s2">some degree that&#39;s true but that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.640" end="00:40:11.280" style="s2">particularly fruitful archetype when it</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.710" end="00:40:12.450" style="s2">comes to having a family and having a</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.280" end="00:40:14.250" style="s2">family is actually extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.450" end="00:40:16.710" style="s2">important and it&#39;s certainly the thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.250" end="00:40:18.480" style="s2">that dominates the thoughts of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.710" end="00:40:22.280" style="s2">majority of women as they approach their</p>

<p begin="00:40:22.280" end="00:40:27.210" style="s2">so it&#39;s something we&#39;re still puzzling</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.110" end="00:40:30.150" style="s2">out and I suppose I&#39;m still puzzling it</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.210" end="00:40:34.200" style="s2">out too I mean with my daughter I tried</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.150" end="00:40:36.240" style="s2">to encourage her to be as sharp and is</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.200" end="00:40:38.520" style="s2">intelligent and critically minded and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.240" end="00:40:41.730" style="s2">ambitious as she could be</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.520" end="00:40:43.740" style="s2">but also letter to let her know that if</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.730" end="00:40:46.920" style="s2">she and she she she was always</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.740" end="00:40:48.810" style="s2">interested in having kids but to also</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.920" end="00:40:52.140" style="s2">let her know that having a family is an</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.810" end="00:40:54.240" style="s2">extremely important thing how to balance</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.140" end="00:40:56.150" style="s2">that well that is the modern conundrum</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.240" end="00:40:59.580" style="s2">isn&#39;t it we want to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.150" end="00:41:02.040" style="s2">maximize our access to the talents of</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.580" end="00:41:04.890" style="s2">women but also to set up a situation</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.040" end="00:41:07.380" style="s2">where it&#39;s possible for talented women</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.890" end="00:41:09.480" style="s2">and and women of all talents let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.380" end="00:41:11.910" style="s2">as well but talented women who have</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.480" end="00:41:13.710" style="s2">options in the workplace to also have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.910" end="00:41:15.780" style="s2">family and this is a tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.710" end="00:41:19.620" style="s2">complex problem and it isn&#39;t clear how</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.780" end="00:41:21.510" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be solved you know there</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.620" end="00:41:23.220" style="s2">is data showing you know we say well men</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.510" end="00:41:25.950" style="s2">should pick up more of the feminine role</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.220" end="00:41:28.110" style="s2">and I suppose that&#39;s possible but there</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.950" end="00:41:31.110" style="s2">is good data showing for example that if</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.110" end="00:41:33.630" style="s2">you show women pictures of men engaged</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.110" end="00:41:35.340" style="s2">in classically masculine endeavors you</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.630" end="00:41:38.670" style="s2">know fixing a roof or fixing the</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.340" end="00:41:40.770" style="s2">plumbing or so forth or in feminine</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.670" end="00:41:43.230" style="s2">endeavors doing the dishes and and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.770" end="00:41:45.210" style="s2">and vacuuming that the women rate the</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.230" end="00:41:48.330" style="s2">men who are doing the female tasks as</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.210" end="00:41:51.210" style="s2">less sexually attractive and so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.330" end="00:41:52.920" style="s2">all on the men with regards to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.210" end="00:41:55.170" style="s2">utility of them picking up a more</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.920" end="00:41:57.930" style="s2">feminine role you know and it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.170" end="00:42:01.800" style="s2">necessarily the case that women will</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.930" end="00:42:03.780" style="s2">find men who are more domestic also</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.800" end="00:42:05.580" style="s2">maximally sexually attractive and those</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.780" end="00:42:13.320" style="s2">things don&#39;t necessarily go together so</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.580" end="00:42:16.410" style="s2">this is very very complicated so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.320" end="00:42:18.630" style="s2">quite shy and when asked questions in</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.410" end="00:42:20.520" style="s2">public I find it hard to articulate a</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.630" end="00:42:23.130" style="s2">good answer but will come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.520" end="00:42:25.470" style="s2">strong response hours or days later any</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.130" end="00:42:27.870" style="s2">advice yeah I have some advice</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.470" end="00:42:29.910" style="s2">one is that or you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.870" end="00:42:31.890" style="s2">introverted a so you&#39;re not as verbally</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.910" end="00:42:33.840" style="s2">fluent as an extrovert would be and not</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.890" end="00:42:35.550" style="s2">quite as fast on the draw verbally but</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.840" end="00:42:37.710" style="s2">you know that means you need some more</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.550" end="00:42:40.410" style="s2">time to contemplate and maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.710" end="00:42:41.910" style="s2">high in negative emotion too because</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.410" end="00:42:43.680" style="s2">shyness can be a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.910" end="00:42:46.770" style="s2">introversion and high negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.680" end="00:42:51.320" style="s2">it can be one or the other but but</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.770" end="00:42:53.270" style="s2">technically shy is introverted anyways</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.320" end="00:42:56.120" style="s2">what I would certainly recommend for you</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.270" end="00:42:58.340" style="s2">is that if you&#39;re faced with a</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.120" end="00:43:00.350" style="s2">complicated question especially one that</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.340" end="00:43:03.410" style="s2">has to do with an important decision in</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.350" end="00:43:06.830" style="s2">your life that you say I need to sleep</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.410" end="00:43:11.120" style="s2">on it or I need a couple of days and not</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.830" end="00:43:13.760" style="s2">to answer on the draw I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.120" end="00:43:16.940" style="s2">that&#39;s true even for extroverts I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.760" end="00:43:18.560" style="s2">if you&#39;re at called upon to offer your</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.940" end="00:43:20.450" style="s2">opinion about something complex then</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.560" end="00:43:22.790" style="s2">it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to say look</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.450" end="00:43:24.710" style="s2">that&#39;s a really hard question I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.790" end="00:43:26.690" style="s2">gonna give you a casual answer I need to</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.710" end="00:43:29.360" style="s2">think about it for a couple of days so</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.690" end="00:43:31.070" style="s2">the advice would be because you find it</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.360" end="00:43:33.470" style="s2">hard to articulate a good answer don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.070" end="00:43:35.000" style="s2">allow yourself to be rushed and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.470" end="00:43:36.560" style="s2">second is to understand that this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.000" end="00:43:39.140" style="s2">part of your temperament there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.560" end="00:43:43.490" style="s2">anything wrong with it it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.140" end="00:43:45.890" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s how you&#39;re wired so what</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.490" end="00:43:48.380" style="s2">causes a person to hoard is it due to</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.890" end="00:43:51.320" style="s2">low conscientiousness what is generally</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.380" end="00:43:54.620" style="s2">the best course of treatment it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.320" end="00:43:58.610" style="s2">usually a consequence of relatively high</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.620" end="00:44:02.630" style="s2">neuroticism and it&#39;s tangled in with</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.610" end="00:44:06.710" style="s2">disgust sensitivity as well people who</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.630" end="00:44:08.630" style="s2">hoard have a hard time they feel guilty</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.710" end="00:44:11.150" style="s2">if they throw things away because the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.630" end="00:44:14.690" style="s2">things still have some residual utility</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.150" end="00:44:16.520" style="s2">the best course of treatment is well</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.690" end="00:44:18.940" style="s2">behavioral therapy is probably the best</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.520" end="00:44:18.940" style="s2">course of treatment</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.340" end="00:44:28.830" style="s2">and to plan what needs to be thrown away</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.530" end="00:44:31.730" style="s2">and to work with a person that can help</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.830" end="00:44:38.580" style="s2">you make the hard decisions that that</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.730" end="00:44:42.350" style="s2">need to be made if you&#39;re hoarding all</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.580" end="00:44:45.900" style="s2">that all that hoarded material is on its</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.350" end="00:44:49.320" style="s2">decisions that have been put off so a</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.900" end="00:44:50.640" style="s2">lot of that is high neuroticism some of</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.320" end="00:44:54.240" style="s2">that can be a consequence of low</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.640" end="00:44:55.590" style="s2">conscientiousness as well so the best</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.240" end="00:44:59.460" style="s2">course of treatment is to find someone</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.590" end="00:45:05.900" style="s2">to help you plan how to approach the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.460" end="00:45:05.900" style="s2">hoard very complicated so all right</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.319" end="00:45:18.449" style="s2">which Hogwarts house would you be in</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.479" end="00:45:26.410" style="s2">well I think I&#39;d have the same issue as</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.099" end="00:45:28.209" style="s2">Harry Potter when the Hat was first put</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.410" end="00:45:31.679" style="s2">on it would think that I might make a</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.209" end="00:45:34.119" style="s2">perfectly good Denison of Slytherin so</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.679" end="00:45:37.919" style="s2">although that probably wouldn&#39;t be where</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.119" end="00:45:37.919" style="s2">I would end up so</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.170" end="00:45:48.490" style="s2">what is your take on an astrological</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.540" end="00:45:50.859" style="s2">basis for significant dates and</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.490" end="00:45:52.750" style="s2">religious stories example Christian</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.859" end="00:45:54.819" style="s2">religion is a parody on the worship of</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.750" end="00:45:59.109" style="s2">the Sun well it&#39;s certainly not a parody</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.819" end="00:46:02.589" style="s2">religion religious systems as they</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.109" end="00:46:04.660" style="s2">expand tend to incorporate everything</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.589" end="00:46:06.640" style="s2">that&#39;s quasi religious in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.660" end="00:46:09.609" style="s2">and there&#39;s certainly no shortage of</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.640" end="00:46:12.369" style="s2">solar symbolism in Christianity I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.609" end="00:46:15.670" style="s2">it&#39;s not Floop that that Christ is the</p>

<p begin="00:46:15.670" end="00:46:21.640" style="s2">there are 12 astrological houses and</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.589" end="00:46:24.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not fluke that the birth of Christ</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.640" end="00:46:27.010" style="s2">takes place essentially at the same time</p>

<p begin="00:47:41.930" end="00:47:46.670" style="s2">broadly make an appointment with three</p>

<p begin="00:47:46.670" end="00:47:50.119" style="s2">and if he likes one of them and he finds</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.739" end="00:47:51.619" style="s2">one who listens then he can go back a</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.119" end="00:47:54.430" style="s2">couple more times but it isn&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.619" end="00:47:57.049" style="s2">hurt him to go once at least to go talk</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.430" end="00:47:59.410" style="s2">it&#39;s also possible that he needs someone</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.049" end="00:48:01.930" style="s2">to talk to him about medication you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.410" end="00:48:03.979" style="s2">antidepressants if he&#39;s in real trouble</p>

<p begin="00:48:05.779" end="00:48:10.670" style="s2">that is a lot better taking an</p>

<p begin="00:48:19.789" end="00:48:24.819" style="s2">sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.049" end="00:48:27.049" style="s2">I would also recommend that he tried the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.819" end="00:48:29.420" style="s2">self authoring program if he&#39;s at home</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.049" end="00:48:30.859" style="s2">he can write about his past he could</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.420" end="00:48:32.719" style="s2">write about his present he can write</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.859" end="00:48:35.179" style="s2">about his future he can do a bad job he</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.719" end="00:48:36.829" style="s2">can do it over days I think that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.179" end="00:48:38.329" style="s2">we have evidence that the program is</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.829" end="00:48:40.069" style="s2">extremely helpful to people and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.329" end="00:48:42.439" style="s2">evidence from other researchers that</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.069" end="00:48:44.749" style="s2">such programs really help so that would</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.439" end="00:48:46.609" style="s2">that would be something that he could do</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.749" end="00:48:48.099" style="s2">while he&#39;s sitting at home and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.609" end="00:48:50.390" style="s2">gonna hurt him</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.099" end="00:48:52.069" style="s2">going over some of the more complex</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.390" end="00:48:53.569" style="s2">material might make him feel slightly</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.069" end="00:48:57.939" style="s2">worse in the short term but the</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.569" end="00:48:57.939" style="s2">long-term payoff is very very high so</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.929" end="00:49:03.739" style="s2">that&#39;s what I would recommend encourage</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.579" end="00:49:05.209" style="s2">him to go talk to somebody he and he</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.739" end="00:49:06.829" style="s2">needs to make the plan he needs to come</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.209" end="00:49:08.779" style="s2">to terms with what&#39;s happened to him and</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.829" end="00:49:10.519" style="s2">he needs to make a plan and he might</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.779" end="00:49:11.989" style="s2">need to talk to somebody for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.519" end="00:49:14.479" style="s2">to figure out what the hell&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.989" end="00:49:16.189" style="s2">you know and we also don&#39;t want to rule</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.479" end="00:49:18.199" style="s2">out neither does he the possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.189" end="00:49:19.640" style="s2">there&#39;s something physical wrong you</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.199" end="00:49:22.309" style="s2">know because there&#39;s increasing evidence</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.640" end="00:49:24.829" style="s2">that the depressive disorders and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.309" end="00:49:27.229" style="s2">would include anxiety are a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.829" end="00:49:29.089" style="s2">of such conditions as as generalized</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.229" end="00:49:31.249" style="s2">inflammation and that&#39;s really worth</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.089" end="00:49:32.929" style="s2">looking into so I think a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.249" end="00:49:36.969" style="s2">things that we think are psychological</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.929" end="00:49:39.969" style="s2">have a more pronounced physical basis so</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.969" end="00:49:39.969" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.780" end="00:49:51.110" style="s2">how do you dress so well any tips well</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.230" end="00:49:54.650" style="s2">you know thank you I started buying nice</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.110" end="00:49:57.620" style="s2">clothes let&#39;s say this year really I had</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.650" end="00:49:59.270" style="s2">some decent suits before that I did some</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.620" end="00:50:00.950" style="s2">research online to find out who good</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.270" end="00:50:04.550" style="s2">suit manufacturers where you can look</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.950" end="00:50:07.100" style="s2">that up but in before this tour I went</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.550" end="00:50:09.320" style="s2">and talked to a good tailor expensive</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.100" end="00:50:12.950" style="s2">place I felt terrible spending so much</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.320" end="00:50:14.690" style="s2">money on clothing but I felt that if I</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.950" end="00:50:17.030" style="s2">was going to go talk to it&#39;s been 200</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.690" end="00:50:19.190" style="s2">thousand people that I was going to do</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.030" end="00:50:21.020" style="s2">it right and and I was going to invest</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.190" end="00:50:25.010" style="s2">in some decent clothes and even though</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.020" end="00:50:28.250" style="s2">it it hurt my cheap northern Alberta</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.010" end="00:50:31.100" style="s2">soul to do it it was definitely worth it</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.250" end="00:50:32.240" style="s2">so you go talk to someone who knows what</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.100" end="00:50:34.970" style="s2">they&#39;re doing go talk to an actual</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.240" end="00:50:36.470" style="s2">tailor and and and you can do some</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.970" end="00:50:41.720" style="s2">research online there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.470" end="00:50:44.180" style="s2">resources online that are devoted</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.720" end="00:50:46.100" style="s2">towards devoted to helping them figure</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.180" end="00:50:51.080" style="s2">out how to dress three-piece suits look</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.100" end="00:50:53.330" style="s2">really good I&#39;ve got them tailored and</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.080" end="00:50:55.520" style="s2">fitted so they&#39;re not bespoke suits</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.330" end="00:50:57.650" style="s2">they&#39;re off the rack but they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.520" end="00:50:59.600" style="s2">tailored and that makes a big difference</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.650" end="00:51:01.820" style="s2">all these subtle things that tailors do</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.600" end="00:51:03.710" style="s2">they tuck it in around the waist they</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.820" end="00:51:05.060" style="s2">cut it to your body all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.710" end="00:51:07.400" style="s2">help it&#39;s really good to have a good</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.060" end="00:51:09.110" style="s2">pair of shoes a couple of nice ties I</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.400" end="00:51:11.750" style="s2">learned how to tie our full wins or not</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.110" end="00:51:14.180" style="s2">recently and that actually helps don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.750" end="00:51:15.440" style="s2">want your tie to look too skinny lots of</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.180" end="00:51:17.510" style="s2">people have been dressing up to come to</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.440" end="00:51:19.910" style="s2">my talk so it&#39;s nice to see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.510" end="00:51:21.500" style="s2">young men come well-dressed often in</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.910" end="00:51:22.880" style="s2">three-piece suits but not always and</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.500" end="00:51:24.500" style="s2">it&#39;s really good to see them dressed</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.880" end="00:51:28.580" style="s2">like grown-ups I think that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.500" end="00:51:30.260" style="s2">plus I had a rule that I didn&#39;t write in</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.580" end="00:51:33.200" style="s2">12 rules which was dressed like the</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.260" end="00:51:35.150" style="s2">person you want to be that&#39;s I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.200" end="00:51:38.210" style="s2">took that from Carl from from Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.150" end="00:51:40.820" style="s2">because Nietzsche said every great man</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.210" end="00:51:42.770" style="s2">is an actor of his own ideal so very</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.820" end="00:51:45.200" style="s2">nice aphorism and basically what it</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.770" end="00:51:47.960" style="s2">meant was that sometimes you have to act</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.200" end="00:51:50.180" style="s2">out what you want to be before you</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.960" end="00:51:52.280" style="s2">become it you have to pretend it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.180" end="00:51:54.410" style="s2">lie it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.280" end="00:51:56.270" style="s2">pretense like children pretend to be a</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.410" end="00:51:59.020" style="s2">father before they grow up and become a</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.270" end="00:52:03.020" style="s2">father it&#39;s a form of practice and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.020" end="00:52:05.690" style="s2">tip one might be figure out who you want</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.020" end="00:52:07.730" style="s2">to be tip two might be well then dressed</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.690" end="00:52:10.010" style="s2">like that person that&#39;s a good start and</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.730" end="00:52:12.710" style="s2">because I think if you want to become</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.010" end="00:52:15.650" style="s2">who you want to be then no detail is too</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.710" end="00:52:17.480" style="s2">small to overlook and certainly it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.650" end="00:52:19.490" style="s2">exactly that people judge you by their</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.480" end="00:52:23.930" style="s2">clothes by your clothes although they do</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.490" end="00:52:25.730" style="s2">to some degree it&#39;s that if whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.930" end="00:52:27.680" style="s2">can have going for you you might as well</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.730" end="00:52:30.020" style="s2">have going for you that&#39;s how it looks</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.680" end="00:52:32.930" style="s2">to me and certainly my experience has</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.020" end="00:52:35.560" style="s2">been that the response to my improved</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.930" end="00:52:38.110" style="s2">wardrobe has indicated that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.560" end="00:52:40.130" style="s2">investment was clearly worth it</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.110" end="00:52:43.220" style="s2">indisputably and clearly worth it and</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.130" end="00:52:44.840" style="s2">it&#39;s nice to be dressed sharply to go in</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.220" end="00:52:46.700" style="s2">front of an audience it&#39;s a sign of</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.840" end="00:52:48.230" style="s2">respect to the audience there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.700" end="00:52:50.300" style="s2">ways of showing respect to an audience</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.230" end="00:52:52.160" style="s2">but that&#39;s certainly one and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.300" end="00:52:54.320" style="s2">been extraordinarily worthwhile I would</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.160" end="00:52:57.260" style="s2">say if you&#39;re going for a job interview</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.320" end="00:52:59.330" style="s2">if you&#39;re out any critical point in your</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.260" end="00:53:00.680" style="s2">life then you should dress the part</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.330" end="00:53:03.530" style="s2">because you want to do everything you</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.680" end="00:53:05.540" style="s2">can to tip the scales in not in your</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.530" end="00:53:09.800" style="s2">favor exactly but in favor of having the</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.540" end="00:53:11.690" style="s2">right thing happen so you have written</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.800" end="00:53:15.500" style="s2">an article on how to write can you do</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.690" end="00:53:17.450" style="s2">the same on how to speak well I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.500" end="00:53:23.090" style="s2">I could I could tell you a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.450" end="00:53:25.640" style="s2">about it if you&#39;re gonna speak about</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.090" end="00:53:27.860" style="s2">something you need to know a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.640" end="00:53:29.870" style="s2">it you need to know three or four times</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.860" end="00:53:31.520" style="s2">as much as you&#39;re gonna speak about at</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.870" end="00:53:33.950" style="s2">minimum so first of all you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.520" end="00:53:37.580" style="s2">your background research you have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.950" end="00:53:39.740" style="s2">have multiple stories at hand that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.580" end="00:53:41.630" style="s2">can use to illustrate your point and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.740" end="00:53:43.220" style="s2">have to have a point you have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.630" end="00:53:46.550" style="s2">organize what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.220" end="00:53:50.390" style="s2">around a problem so before I go onstage</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.550" end="00:53:52.190" style="s2">to speak on my tour I always sit for</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.390" end="00:53:54.380" style="s2">half an hour some of which involves</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.190" end="00:53:57.620" style="s2">usually about five minutes of anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.380" end="00:53:59.690" style="s2">and I think okay there&#39;s a problem I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.620" end="00:54:01.760" style="s2">trying to address tonight a central</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.690" end="00:54:03.770" style="s2">problem or a theme what is it might be</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.760" end="00:54:06.230" style="s2">courage it might be responsibility it</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.770" end="00:54:08.450" style="s2">might be meaning</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.230" end="00:54:10.369" style="s2">I think and that serves as an organizing</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.450" end="00:54:13.480" style="s2">principle so that would be the point and</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.369" end="00:54:16.250" style="s2">then basically I organize say a dozen</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.480" end="00:54:19.670" style="s2">stories around that and I can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.250" end="00:54:22.040" style="s2">arrange them in it as a journey and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.670" end="00:54:24.859" style="s2">a journey that circles the main point</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.040" end="00:54:27.170" style="s2">and so I&#39;m trying to explore it to say</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.859" end="00:54:29.750" style="s2">what I think about courage let&#39;s say but</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.170" end="00:54:32.150" style="s2">to take what I&#39;m thinking farther than</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.750" end="00:54:34.100" style="s2">I&#39;ve taken it already and so that I can</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.150" end="00:54:37.280" style="s2">plot out you know little five-minute</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.100" end="00:54:41.359" style="s2">stories that I have that are associated</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.280" end="00:54:44.690" style="s2">with courage and then I can talk to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.359" end="00:54:48.470" style="s2">audience and I would say talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.690" end="00:54:50.480" style="s2">you know use your personal experience</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.470" end="00:54:51.920" style="s2">because that&#39;s that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.480" end="00:54:53.750" style="s2">you&#39;re actually a master of you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.920" end="00:54:56.600" style="s2">bring in other material but it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.750" end="00:54:59.810" style="s2">tied to the real world through your own</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.600" end="00:55:02.090" style="s2">experience otherwise it&#39;s not real it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.810" end="00:55:03.650" style="s2">also very good to speak directly to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.090" end="00:55:05.150" style="s2">audience to the individuals in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.650" end="00:55:07.730" style="s2">audience because I&#39;m always looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.150" end="00:55:10.460" style="s2">single person one after another and</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.730" end="00:55:12.050" style="s2">focusing on them and talking to them</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.460" end="00:55:13.760" style="s2">just like you&#39;d have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.050" end="00:55:15.619" style="s2">someone and that way I can see if</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.760" end="00:55:18.470" style="s2">they&#39;re following along and I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.619" end="00:55:20.150" style="s2">listening to the audience what I really</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.470" end="00:55:22.640" style="s2">like to hear from the audience is no</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.150" end="00:55:24.200" style="s2">noise at all silence because if the</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.640" end="00:55:25.760" style="s2">audience especially you know if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.200" end="00:55:28.040" style="s2">couple hundred or a couple of thousand</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.760" end="00:55:31.190" style="s2">people if the audience is dead silent</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.040" end="00:55:38.710" style="s2">then I know that I&#39;m on the right track</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.190" end="00:55:42.320" style="s2">and so the other thing I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.710" end="00:55:44.990" style="s2">you&#39;re telling stories so every fact</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.320" end="00:55:47.000" style="s2">that you relate or every set of facts</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.990" end="00:55:49.660" style="s2">has to be tied to a story there has to</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.000" end="00:55:52.609" style="s2">be a meaningful output which is</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.660" end="00:55:55.130" style="s2">something like why is it important to</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.609" end="00:55:56.359" style="s2">your life that you know this fact how is</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.130" end="00:55:58.340" style="s2">it related to how you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.359" end="00:55:59.510" style="s2">conduct yourself moving forward or how</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.340" end="00:56:00.859" style="s2">are you going to see the world so</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.510" end="00:56:03.260" style="s2">because that&#39;s kind of the essence of</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.859" end="00:56:05.119" style="s2">meaning how does this fact change the</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.260" end="00:56:07.250" style="s2">way you perceive the world or act in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.119" end="00:56:09.590" style="s2">world that&#39;s the meaning of the fact and</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.250" end="00:56:12.410" style="s2">facts without meaning are dull so you</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.590" end="00:56:17.750" style="s2">need to know that you need to tell the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.410" end="00:56:20.099" style="s2">truth that&#39;s for sure and and and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.750" end="00:56:22.259" style="s2">for me my talks are really</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.099" end="00:56:24.329" style="s2">they&#39;re an attempt to explore a set of</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.259" end="00:56:26.729" style="s2">ideas in the most truthful way that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.329" end="00:56:30.150" style="s2">can manage and that&#39;s also an adventure</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.729" end="00:56:31.559" style="s2">because letting yourself speak freely</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.150" end="00:56:33.449" style="s2">about a topic you don&#39;t always know</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.559" end="00:56:35.400" style="s2">where it&#39;s gonna go and so but that also</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.449" end="00:56:37.920" style="s2">hooks in the audience because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.400" end="00:56:39.599" style="s2">not there along for the ride right and</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.920" end="00:56:41.219" style="s2">there&#39;s a risk that risk is you might</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.599" end="00:56:42.509" style="s2">forget where you are you might lose the</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.219" end="00:56:45.719" style="s2">thread you might say something you</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.509" end="00:56:48.150" style="s2">regret you might get confused and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.719" end="00:56:50.009" style="s2">this the talk should be a process of</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.150" end="00:56:51.959" style="s2">exploration like a journey that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.009" end="00:56:53.609" style="s2">taking the audience along on it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.959" end="00:56:56.609" style="s2">same when you&#39;re reading a novel like a</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.609" end="00:56:59.219" style="s2">great novel isn&#39;t exactly plotted out</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.609" end="00:57:02.880" style="s2">from beginning to end to begin with the</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.219" end="00:57:06.359" style="s2">author is taking himself or herself and</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.880" end="00:57:07.890" style="s2">you on an intellectual adventure through</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.359" end="00:57:09.749" style="s2">the through the character development</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.890" end="00:57:12.150" style="s2">and the characters have to be allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.749" end="00:57:14.089" style="s2">live and to express themselves and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.150" end="00:57:16.859" style="s2">novel needs to unfold it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.089" end="00:57:18.449" style="s2">colloquy between the conscious mind and</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.859" end="00:57:21.769" style="s2">the unconscious source of inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.449" end="00:57:24.690" style="s2">and the novel is actually a journey</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.769" end="00:57:27.119" style="s2">through a characterological landscape</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.690" end="00:57:28.709" style="s2">and the author shouldn&#39;t know where he</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.119" end="00:57:31.890" style="s2">or she&#39;s going to end up at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.709" end="00:57:34.739" style="s2">beginning same with an artist and who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.890" end="00:57:37.440" style="s2">writing a song or a piece of music or a</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.739" end="00:57:40.920" style="s2">piece of visual art there has to be play</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.440" end="00:57:42.329" style="s2">and exploration along the way and so you</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.920" end="00:57:44.670" style="s2">also don&#39;t want to deliver and</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.329" end="00:57:46.380" style="s2">over-prepared talk in my estimation or</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.670" end="00:57:48.719" style="s2">at least that&#39;s not how I do it you want</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.380" end="00:57:50.099" style="s2">to have a theme you want to have a body</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.719" end="00:57:51.660" style="s2">of knowledge from which you can draw on</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.099" end="00:57:54.150" style="s2">and then you want to be actively</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.660" end="00:57:56.579" style="s2">exploring the idea in front of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.150" end="00:57:58.680" style="s2">audience and that&#39;s very gripping for</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.579" end="00:58:00.209" style="s2">everyone including you and so and you</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.680" end="00:58:02.009" style="s2">should learn something from the talk</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.209" end="00:58:05.309" style="s2">it&#39;s an opportunity to think on your</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.009" end="00:58:08.819" style="s2">feet and anyways that&#39;s my style of</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.309" end="00:58:11.279" style="s2">lecturing it&#39;s it&#39;s a trapeze act</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.819" end="00:58:12.930" style="s2">without a safety net I would say and</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.279" end="00:58:15.779" style="s2">that&#39;s part of what makes it gripping is</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.930" end="00:58:18.440" style="s2">that there&#39;s a high probability of</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.779" end="00:58:24.589" style="s2">failure and I would say with any</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.440" end="00:58:27.059" style="s2">performance that&#39;s going to be gripping</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.589" end="00:58:28.739" style="s2">that on the edge of the seat gripping</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.059" end="00:58:30.239" style="s2">there has to be a high probability of</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.739" end="00:58:33.539" style="s2">failure and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t speak</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.239" end="00:58:33.900" style="s2">with notes if you speak with notes which</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.539" end="00:58:35.640" style="s2">you might</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.900" end="00:58:38.940" style="s2">have to if you&#39;re a beginning speaker</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.640" end="00:58:40.829" style="s2">then you cannot fail because you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.940" end="00:58:42.599" style="s2">always read the notes and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.829" end="00:58:44.339" style="s2">there&#39;s a net you&#39;ll fall in the net but</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.599" end="00:58:47.609" style="s2">you won&#39;t die but you&#39;ll never do</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.339" end="00:58:48.599" style="s2">anything spectacular so that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.609" end="00:58:50.279" style="s2">is if you&#39;re gonna do something</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.599" end="00:58:52.020" style="s2">spectacular you have to take the risk</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.279" end="00:58:53.849" style="s2">and if you&#39;re gonna take the risk you</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.020" end="00:58:54.990" style="s2">have to think on your feet and then you</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.849" end="00:58:56.640" style="s2">also have to have something to think</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.990" end="00:58:58.109" style="s2">about you have to be been working on</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.640" end="00:59:00.660" style="s2">this material you know I&#39;ve been working</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.109" end="00:59:03.960" style="s2">on this stuff I talk about for 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.660" end="00:59:06.960" style="s2">for tens of thousands of hours and so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.960" end="00:59:08.700" style="s2">have that reservoir of knowledge I</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.960" end="00:59:10.859" style="s2">suppose and you know whenever I read</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.700" end="00:59:12.150" style="s2">something new I&#39;m slotting it into the</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.859" end="00:59:14.520" style="s2">knowledge structure that I used to</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.150" end="00:59:17.220" style="s2">generate my talks and I&#39;m reading all</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.520" end="00:59:19.200" style="s2">the time and lots of the things I read I</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.220" end="00:59:21.539" style="s2">forget they&#39;re not relevant to my</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.200" end="00:59:24.210" style="s2">central mission whatever that happens to</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.539" end="00:59:26.670" style="s2">be looks like some it looks something</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.210" end="00:59:28.880" style="s2">like the delineation of the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.670" end="00:59:31.589" style="s2">between responsibilities and meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.880" end="00:59:33.210" style="s2">and maybe responsibilities meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.589" end="00:59:35.940" style="s2">perception it&#39;s something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.210" end="00:59:39.240" style="s2">so I have a central concern or deeper</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.940" end="00:59:42.690" style="s2">than that in some sense my central</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.240" end="00:59:46.170" style="s2">concern was how to ensure personally</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.690" end="00:59:48.390" style="s2">that if I was tempted in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.170" end="00:59:50.250" style="s2">like the situations that arose in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.390" end="00:59:54.630" style="s2">Soviet Union and Nazi Germany that I</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.250" end="00:59:56.730" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t fall prey to those totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.630" end="00:59:58.440" style="s2">systems and act in the reprehensible</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.730" end="01:00:00.690" style="s2">manner that so many people acted in</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.440" end="01:00:03.569" style="s2">that&#39;s really been a driving concern of</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.690" end="01:00:04.950" style="s2">mine and and that&#39;s bleeds over into the</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.569" end="01:00:07.049" style="s2">relationship between meaning and</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.950" end="01:00:08.579" style="s2">responsibility and perception so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.049" end="01:00:10.349" style="s2">a core set of problems that I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.579" end="01:00:12.900" style="s2">on and every talk is an attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.349" end="01:00:17.099" style="s2">further develop those so you also have</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.900" end="01:00:18.329" style="s2">to have a problem you know you think</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.099" end="01:00:19.950" style="s2">well you don&#39;t want to have a problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.329" end="01:00:22.710" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah you do you want to you</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.950" end="01:00:25.049" style="s2">want to you&#39;ve got problems anyways if</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.710" end="01:00:27.089" style="s2">you&#39;re alive you&#39;ve got problems pick</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.049" end="01:00:28.380" style="s2">one of them it can be your problem and</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.089" end="01:00:30.420" style="s2">that can be the problem you try to</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.380" end="01:00:32.190" style="s2">address whatever that happens to be and</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.420" end="01:00:33.660" style="s2">then you have something to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.190" end="01:00:36.539" style="s2">how am I going to address this problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.660" end="01:00:37.770" style="s2">how can this problem be addressed so you</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.539" end="01:00:39.150" style="s2">need to have a problem to if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.770" end="01:00:40.410" style="s2">gonna talk just like you need to have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.150" end="01:00:41.880" style="s2">problem if you&#39;re gonna write because</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.410" end="01:00:44.250" style="s2">the writing is an attempt to solve the</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.880" end="01:00:45.240" style="s2">problem and so is there talking if</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.250" end="01:00:47.520" style="s2">you&#39;re not trying to solve a problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.240" end="01:00:50.010" style="s2">what the hell are you doing talking</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.520" end="01:00:52.380" style="s2">why should anyone care it&#39;s got to be a</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.010" end="01:00:54.690" style="s2">real problem to like a you know a</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.380" end="01:00:56.940" style="s2">nail-biter of a problem a dragon of a</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.690" end="01:00:58.640" style="s2">problem and if it&#39;s a problem that</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.940" end="01:01:04.190" style="s2">everyone else shares so much the better</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.640" end="01:01:04.190" style="s2">so and then you grapple with it so</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.290" end="01:01:14.010" style="s2">thoughts on the Eastern idea of moving</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.580" end="01:01:16.620" style="s2">away from excessive thinking into the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.010" end="01:01:18.600" style="s2">awareness beyond thinking removing it</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.620" end="01:01:22.200" style="s2">from the driver&#39;s seat to be used more</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.600" end="01:01:26.070" style="s2">as a tool yeah well I thought a lot</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.200" end="01:01:28.770" style="s2">about this in relationship to a couple</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.070" end="01:01:32.250" style="s2">of ancient ideas the one Mesopotamian</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.770" end="01:01:34.310" style="s2">idea characterization of Marduk who is</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.250" end="01:01:38.010" style="s2">the highest Mesopotamian deity</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.310" end="01:01:41.610" style="s2">it was Marduk who carved up the goddess</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.010" end="01:01:43.920" style="s2">of chaos time out into pieces and made</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.610" end="01:01:45.900" style="s2">the world out of her pieces so Marduk is</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.920" end="01:01:48.660" style="s2">the force that confronts chaos and</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.900" end="01:01:51.720" style="s2">builds habitable order like the logos in</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.660" end="01:01:53.220" style="s2">Genesis and one of marducks attributes</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.720" end="01:01:54.990" style="s2">was that he had eyes all the way around</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.220" end="01:01:55.530" style="s2">his head and that he could speak magic</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.990" end="01:01:57.540" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.530" end="01:02:00.390" style="s2">those two attributes but it&#39;s the eyes</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.540" end="01:02:01.440" style="s2">that are most crucial importance with</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.390" end="01:02:04.170" style="s2">regard to this question</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.440" end="01:02:07.020" style="s2">then there&#39;s Horus the Egyptian god</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.170" end="01:02:11.670" style="s2">who&#39;s the famous AI and Horus is really</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.020" end="01:02:13.980" style="s2">a what a day off&#39; occation of attention</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.670" end="01:02:17.040" style="s2">I would say and there&#39;s a difference</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.980" end="01:02:18.450" style="s2">between attention and thinking like let</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.040" end="01:02:21.270" style="s2">me let me give you an example so</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.450" end="01:02:25.050" style="s2">thinking seems to be instrumental mostly</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.270" end="01:02:27.540" style="s2">so if you think people also often say to</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.050" end="01:02:30.240" style="s2">me well what&#39;s your what&#39;s your strategy</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.540" end="01:02:31.950" style="s2">when you go into an interview and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.240" end="01:02:34.140" style="s2">answer is well I don&#39;t have a strategy</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.950" end="01:02:35.970" style="s2">when I go into an interview because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.140" end="01:02:37.590" style="s2">there to have a conversation and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.970" end="01:02:39.120" style="s2">sure where the conversation will go and</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.590" end="01:02:41.370" style="s2">I&#39;m willing to let it go wherever it</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.120" end="01:02:42.870" style="s2">goes I&#39;m not there to sell books</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.370" end="01:02:45.110" style="s2">although I&#39;m perfectly happy if more</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.870" end="01:02:47.190" style="s2">books sell because well because of</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.110" end="01:02:48.720" style="s2">obviously I wrote a book and I want</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.190" end="01:02:50.790" style="s2">people to read it and there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.720" end="01:02:52.470" style="s2">enterprise behind it and so it&#39;s also my</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.790" end="01:02:54.150" style="s2">responsibility to do the marketing</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.470" end="01:02:55.920" style="s2">properly but I&#39;m not going to do these</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.150" end="01:02:59.300" style="s2">interviews to sell books or to promote</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.920" end="01:03:01.200" style="s2">myself or or it I don&#39;t have a strategic</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.300" end="01:03:02.670" style="s2">goal in mind</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.200" end="01:03:04.950" style="s2">except that I&#39;m going to have a</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.670" end="01:03:08.010" style="s2">conversation and I&#39;m going to say what I</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.950" end="01:03:10.800" style="s2">think and and and take the consequences</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.010" end="01:03:12.660" style="s2">because I assume that if I say something</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.800" end="01:03:14.640" style="s2">and I believe it&#39;s true then the</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.660" end="01:03:16.800" style="s2">consequences are as positive as they can</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.640" end="01:03:18.720" style="s2">be regardless of how they look at the</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.800" end="01:03:22.560" style="s2">time and that&#39;s an issue of faith</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.720" end="01:03:24.960" style="s2">because I believe that the habitable</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.560" end="01:03:27.329" style="s2">order is generated by spoken truth I</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.960" end="01:03:31.460" style="s2">believe that I think that&#39;s the truest</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.329" end="01:03:36.060" style="s2">that&#39;s the truest thing I know and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.460" end="01:03:37.560" style="s2">and so I go into the interview and I did</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.060" end="01:03:39.180" style="s2">this in my clinical practice and I try</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.560" end="01:03:41.640" style="s2">to do this when I&#39;m talking to people to</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.180" end="01:03:43.530" style="s2">is that I&#39;m not thinking about where the</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.640" end="01:03:45.540" style="s2">conversation is going or what point I</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.530" end="01:03:47.849" style="s2">want to make or what I want the outcome</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.540" end="01:03:49.650" style="s2">to be any of that I just let that go</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.849" end="01:03:52.109" style="s2">you know it&#39;s within this broader</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.650" end="01:03:54.750" style="s2">framework of assuming that the truth is</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.109" end="01:03:58.050" style="s2">the most effective means of progressing</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.750" end="01:03:59.550" style="s2">and then I pay attention and what</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.050" end="01:04:01.619" style="s2">happens when you pay attention is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.550" end="01:04:04.380" style="s2">while you&#39;re watching a person this is a</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.619" end="01:04:05.640" style="s2">great treatment for social anxiety by</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.380" end="01:04:07.170" style="s2">the way because if you&#39;re socially</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.640" end="01:04:08.730" style="s2">anxious you tend not to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.170" end="01:04:11.579" style="s2">the person pay attention to who you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.730" end="01:04:13.710" style="s2">talking to watch them like a hawk like</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.579" end="01:04:15.119" style="s2">not paranoid or anything like that and</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.710" end="01:04:17.940" style="s2">not too intently because you make them</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.119" end="01:04:19.770" style="s2">uncomfortable but intently pay attention</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.940" end="01:04:21.599" style="s2">to what they&#39;re saying to how they look</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.770" end="01:04:24.359" style="s2">to their facial gestures all of that</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.599" end="01:04:26.550" style="s2">look at their face and watch and listen</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.359" end="01:04:28.050" style="s2">and try to understand what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.550" end="01:04:30.270" style="s2">saying and what you&#39;ll see is that well</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.050" end="01:04:31.710" style="s2">questions pop into your minds like well</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.270" end="01:04:33.690" style="s2">I didn&#39;t understand what you said can</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.710" end="01:04:36.060" style="s2">you clarify that and sounds like you</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.690" end="01:04:38.700" style="s2">mean this is this what you mean but not</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.060" end="01:04:40.440" style="s2">in a I&#39;ll put you on the spot because I</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.700" end="01:04:42.990" style="s2">think you&#39;re wrong sort of way but in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.440" end="01:04:45.930" style="s2">clarification sort of way and all of</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.990" end="01:04:47.730" style="s2">that attention and so what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.930" end="01:04:49.920" style="s2">clinical work with people this is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.730" end="01:04:51.240" style="s2">reason I quit by the way about a year</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.920" end="01:04:53.250" style="s2">ago is because I was starting to get</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.240" end="01:04:54.660" style="s2">distracted I had a rule which was you</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.250" end="01:04:56.700" style="s2">have an hour with me and I do nothing</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.660" end="01:04:58.859" style="s2">but pay attention to you I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.700" end="01:05:01.140" style="s2">thinking about what I want to accomplish</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.859" end="01:05:04.140" style="s2">I&#39;m not thinking about the problems in</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.140" end="01:05:05.819" style="s2">my life not distracted and I listen to</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.140" end="01:05:09.030" style="s2">you and I ask questions when I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.819" end="01:05:10.619" style="s2">understand and if a thought occurs to me</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.030" end="01:05:13.440" style="s2">while I&#39;m paying attention to you then</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.619" end="01:05:15.180" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you what it is you see and</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.440" end="01:05:17.880" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.180" end="01:05:21.390" style="s2">using awareness primarily and thinking</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.880" end="01:05:23.610" style="s2">secondarily like I don&#39;t think well</p>

<p begin="01:05:23.610" end="01:05:28.160" style="s2">and I&#39;m going to maneuver them into</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.280" end="01:05:30.510" style="s2">certain responses by using these</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.160" end="01:05:32.970" style="s2">communicative tools I think I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.510" end="01:05:35.670" style="s2">pay attention to this person we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.970" end="01:05:37.470" style="s2">to discuss where we&#39;re going and why I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:05:37.470" end="01:05:41.880" style="s2">then when they&#39;re talking things are</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.750" end="01:05:44.700" style="s2">going to occur within me I&#39;m gonna see</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.880" end="01:05:49.110" style="s2">images and thoughts are going to emerge</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.700" end="01:05:51.630" style="s2">from the background and then I&#39;ll share</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.110" end="01:05:53.910" style="s2">them not always because I usually have</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.630" end="01:05:56.040" style="s2">more thoughts than can be shared but if</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.910" end="01:05:58.290" style="s2">a thought comes up and it seems like an</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.040" end="01:06:00.030" style="s2">interesting reaction to what the person</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.290" end="01:06:03.090" style="s2">just said then I&#39;ll just tell them and</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.030" end="01:06:06.210" style="s2">sort of without commitment to it and</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.090" end="01:06:07.920" style="s2">it&#39;s usually okay you just said this and</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.210" end="01:06:09.630" style="s2">so this question emerged so we need to</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.920" end="01:06:12.690" style="s2">straighten that out because I&#39;m confused</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.630" end="01:06:14.730" style="s2">or you said this and I had this image or</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.690" end="01:06:19.770" style="s2">you said this and this thought came to</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.730" end="01:06:21.810" style="s2">mind and it seems to be this is this so</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.770" end="01:06:23.910" style="s2">that&#39;s one person&#39;s reaction to the way</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.810" end="01:06:28.860" style="s2">that you&#39;re conducting yourself at the</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.910" end="01:06:32.160" style="s2">moment so thinking is instrumental I</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.860" end="01:06:34.610" style="s2">outlined this in I think it&#39;s rule 7 do</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.160" end="01:06:36.990" style="s2">what is meaningful not what is expedient</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.610" end="01:06:39.360" style="s2">if you do what&#39;s expedient you have a</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.990" end="01:06:41.670" style="s2">short-term conscious goal in mind and</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.360" end="01:06:44.430" style="s2">you try to bend everything towards that</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.670" end="01:06:46.530" style="s2">end but if you&#39;re pursuing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.430" end="01:06:49.860" style="s2">meaningful then you just pay attention</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.530" end="01:06:52.950" style="s2">to what&#39;s going on and you react with</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.860" end="01:06:54.480" style="s2">truth and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.950" end="01:06:57.330" style="s2">better way of living as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.480" end="01:06:59.130" style="s2">concerned it&#39;s it&#39;s a much more powerful</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.330" end="01:07:02.690" style="s2">way of living it means you have to</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.130" end="01:07:05.820" style="s2">confront things right then and there</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.690" end="01:07:07.680" style="s2">which is I suppose why so many of my</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.820" end="01:07:10.500" style="s2">interviews have been in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.680" end="01:07:13.980" style="s2">concert confrontational because people</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.500" end="01:07:15.300" style="s2">will impose in a thinking agenda on the</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.980" end="01:07:16.800" style="s2">flow of the conversation this is</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.300" end="01:07:19.200" style="s2">especially true in the mainstream media</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.800" end="01:07:22.860" style="s2">happened again recently with BBC&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.200" end="01:07:24.630" style="s2">HARDtalk that they opposed an agenda in</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.860" end="01:07:27.849" style="s2">the conversation and then that just</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.630" end="01:07:30.789" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work out very well because</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.849" end="01:07:34.180" style="s2">I&#39;m paying attention and I will object</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.789" end="01:07:38.229" style="s2">to the agenda not because I have a</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.180" end="01:07:40.029" style="s2">different agenda except for what I said</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.229" end="01:07:43.329" style="s2">which is that I want to say what I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.029" end="01:07:48.279" style="s2">I want to say as truthfully as I can</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.329" end="01:07:50.769" style="s2">what I actually am thinking in this more</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.279" end="01:07:54.489" style="s2">abstracted and detached sense and see</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.769" end="01:07:58.089" style="s2">what happens so it&#39;s it&#39;s a hard thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.489" end="01:08:00.640" style="s2">to clarify because you might say well</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.089" end="01:08:03.519" style="s2">dr. Peterson you just said you want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.640" end="01:08:05.769" style="s2">say what you&#39;re thinking but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.519" end="01:08:09.309" style="s2">exactly the same thing it&#39;s not like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.769" end="01:08:13.349" style="s2">thinking strategically I&#39;m listening</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.309" end="01:08:15.729" style="s2">thoughts II will emerge and I say them</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.349" end="01:08:17.349" style="s2">I&#39;m not trying to manipulate I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.729" end="01:08:18.940" style="s2">putting spin on things I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.349" end="01:08:21.250" style="s2">manipulate the conversation in any</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.940" end="01:08:24.219" style="s2">particular way and again the reason for</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.250" end="01:08:27.909" style="s2">that is because I decided a long time</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.219" end="01:08:29.830" style="s2">ago probably thirty years that there was</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.909" end="01:08:32.710" style="s2">no more effective way of dealing with a</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.830" end="01:08:35.770" style="s2">complex situation than to try to say</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.710" end="01:08:37.449" style="s2">what you believe to be true and not to</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.770" end="01:08:38.889" style="s2">manipulate it none of that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.449" end="01:08:40.750" style="s2">doesn&#39;t because that&#39;s all those are all</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.889" end="01:08:44.940" style="s2">lies as far as I&#39;m concerned that kind</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.750" end="01:08:44.940" style="s2">of manipulation and spin so</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.560" end="01:08:55.540" style="s2">if he is invited to the largest possible</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.350" end="01:08:57.700" style="s2">number of games is also the person that</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.540" end="01:08:59.920" style="s2">goes out to conquer the unknown could</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.700" end="01:09:02.140" style="s2">this lie in reciprocal altruism that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.920" end="01:09:06.040" style="s2">really good question I would say it</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.140" end="01:09:09.880" style="s2">almost certainly does you certainly see</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.040" end="01:09:11.650" style="s2">the reciprocal altruism in being invited</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.880" end="01:09:12.940" style="s2">to the largest possible number of games</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.650" end="01:09:14.950" style="s2">so a little background here it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.940" end="01:09:16.960" style="s2">well what&#39;s a winner well winner is</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.950" end="01:09:19.270" style="s2">someone who wins a game it&#39;s like no a</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.960" end="01:09:21.340" style="s2">winner is someone who gets invited to</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.270" end="01:09:23.710" style="s2">play the largest possible number of</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.340" end="01:09:25.630" style="s2">games and that means that you have to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.710" end="01:09:27.490" style="s2">a good sport and so the good sport is</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.630" end="01:09:30.340" style="s2">the winner in the broader game in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.490" end="01:09:32.650" style="s2">metagame now I put forward the</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.340" end="01:09:34.540" style="s2">proposition that the winner of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.650" end="01:09:37.690" style="s2">metagame is also the person that goes</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.540" end="01:09:39.070" style="s2">out to conquer the unknown now let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.690" end="01:09:42.790" style="s2">if we can take that apart a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.070" end="01:09:45.730" style="s2">well one of the one of the attributes of</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.790" end="01:09:47.050" style="s2">being a good sport let&#39;s say is that</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.730" end="01:09:49.030" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to extend your skill</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.050" end="01:09:50.950" style="s2">during the game and so you are</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.030" end="01:09:52.180" style="s2">confronting the unknown in the game</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.950" end="01:09:54.220" style="s2">because you&#39;re trying to get better at</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.180" end="01:09:56.050" style="s2">playing the game and then you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.220" end="01:09:58.000" style="s2">doing that in a way that&#39;s of benefit to</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.050" end="01:10:01.030" style="s2">the team and so then you can imagine</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.000" end="01:10:02.860" style="s2">that being a team leader in in the meta</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.030" end="01:10:04.750" style="s2">game which is the game of extending your</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.860" end="01:10:07.360" style="s2">skill across the across the broadest</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.750" end="01:10:11.050" style="s2">possible set of games is analogous to</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.360" end="01:10:12.340" style="s2">leading a team into the unknown so if</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.050" end="01:10:13.630" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna go confront the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.340" end="01:10:16.300" style="s2">you&#39;re probably not gonna do it alone</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.630" end="01:10:17.830" style="s2">although you could and to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.300" end="01:10:19.630" style="s2">you have to be alone but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.830" end="01:10:22.060" style="s2">generally gonna do it in a cooperative</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.630" end="01:10:23.860" style="s2">and competitive way I mean that&#39;s why in</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.060" end="01:10:25.900" style="s2">stories like the Lord of the Rings and</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.860" end="01:10:27.670" style="s2">The Hobbit for example and even Harry</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.900" end="01:10:31.060" style="s2">Potter for that matter none of those</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.670" end="01:10:33.220" style="s2">people are alone they they lead or are</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.060" end="01:10:35.230" style="s2">part of a broader social group and</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.220" end="01:10:37.900" style="s2">they&#39;re important and they&#39;re team</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.230" end="01:10:39.640" style="s2">players within that group so the team</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.900" end="01:10:41.500" style="s2">player elements seems to be something</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.640" end="01:10:44.680" style="s2">that&#39;s common to conquering the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.500" end="01:10:46.240" style="s2">and to reciprocal altruism and and to</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.680" end="01:10:48.370" style="s2">being invited to play the largest number</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.240" end="01:10:50.620" style="s2">of games the question then is what makes</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.370" end="01:10:51.940" style="s2">an effective leader and an effective</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.620" end="01:10:54.190" style="s2">leader is someone who&#39;s able to</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.940" end="01:10:57.190" style="s2">synthesize the group and to lead it</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.190" end="01:11:00.370" style="s2">forward towards the goal yeah that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.190" end="01:11:02.200" style="s2">and you know in a game obviously the</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.370" end="01:11:03.790" style="s2">good player is leading the team forward</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.200" end="01:11:06.610" style="s2">to the goal and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.790" end="01:11:07.990" style="s2">same in a quest the good player is the</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.610" end="01:11:10.480" style="s2">leader who&#39;s leading the team towards</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.990" end="01:11:16.660" style="s2">the goal so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.480" end="01:11:20.260" style="s2">analogy there and it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.660" end="01:11:21.880" style="s2">reciprocal altruism I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.260" end="01:11:26.340" style="s2">quite the right terminology though</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.880" end="01:11:26.340" style="s2">because there&#39;s an element of pragmatic</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.610" end="01:11:33.250" style="s2">competence that goes along with it to</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.340" end="01:11:35.380" style="s2">you you all you can&#39;t merely be willing</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.250" end="01:11:39.310" style="s2">to engage in reciprocal altruism to be a</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.380" end="01:11:41.110" style="s2">good player or to conquer the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.310" end="01:11:43.780" style="s2">you also have to have skill and</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.110" end="01:11:46.980" style="s2">discipline so I would say reciprocal</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.780" end="01:11:50.470" style="s2">altruism is necessary but not sufficient</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.980" end="01:11:53.770" style="s2">precondition right talent skill ability</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.470" end="01:11:57.930" style="s2">all of those things are creativity all</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.770" end="01:12:00.250" style="s2">of those things are also important so</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.930" end="01:12:01.570" style="s2">that&#39;s a bit of an answer to that but</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.250" end="01:12:04.660" style="s2">it&#39;s a very very good question</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.570" end="01:12:08.380" style="s2">so please confirm if you&#39;re Harry Potter</p>

<p begin="01:13:20.090" end="01:13:25.340" style="s2">the first question is how old are you</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.010" end="01:13:27.440" style="s2">and you&#39;re gonna have an easier life if</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.340" end="01:13:28.970" style="s2">you&#39;re still young because if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.440" end="01:13:31.720" style="s2">older and you have that score then</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.970" end="01:13:34.370" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be rough</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.720" end="01:13:36.320" style="s2">perhaps you&#39;re high in openness in which</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.370" end="01:13:38.900" style="s2">case you&#39;re going to derive your</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.320" end="01:13:39.710" style="s2">motivation from engaging in creative</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.900" end="01:13:41.180" style="s2">endeavors</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.710" end="01:13:43.670" style="s2">perhaps you&#39;re high in agreeableness</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.180" end="01:13:45.350" style="s2">which means that you might find meaning</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.670" end="01:13:47.540" style="s2">in caring for other people perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.350" end="01:13:49.700" style="s2">extraversion which means you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.540" end="01:13:53.960" style="s2">find engagement in being with other</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.700" end="01:13:56.360" style="s2">people so so those are potential sources</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.960" end="01:13:59.500" style="s2">of motivation you may have to look</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.360" end="01:14:02.150" style="s2">elsewhere then duty let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.500" end="01:14:04.640" style="s2">achievement ambition for your primary</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.150" end="01:14:07.640" style="s2">sources of motivation one thing I would</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.640" end="01:14:09.740" style="s2">caution you though is that you likely</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.640" end="01:14:13.040" style="s2">need to make friends with a scheduler</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.740" end="01:14:16.180" style="s2">like Google Calendar try to design days</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.040" end="01:14:20.480" style="s2">you want to have and to learn to</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.180" end="01:14:22.040" style="s2">structure your time because even if</p>

<p begin="01:14:24.530" end="01:14:30.590" style="s2">a time sticking to things and so maybe</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.800" end="01:14:34.220" style="s2">you need to partner with someone who&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.590" end="01:14:36.230" style="s2">in conscientiousness but I would really</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.220" end="01:14:39.080" style="s2">recommend trying to discipline yourself</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.230" end="01:14:41.860" style="s2">you use a use Google Calendar to design</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.080" end="01:14:45.770" style="s2">the day&#39;s you want to have and learn to</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.860" end="01:14:49.520" style="s2">schedule and regulate your time use</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.770" end="01:14:51.050" style="s2">because zero is very low and my</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.520" end="01:14:56.330" style="s2">suspicions are you&#39;ll pay quite a high</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.050" end="01:14:58.040" style="s2">price for that so what do you think</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.330" end="01:14:59.960" style="s2">about Ellis Miller enter thesis that</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.040" end="01:15:01.520" style="s2">most psychological diseases and aberrant</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.960" end="01:15:05.780" style="s2">behavior of the result of some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.520" end="01:15:07.430" style="s2">childhood trauma some are but some forms</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.780" end="01:15:09.440" style="s2">of childhood trauma are also a</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.430" end="01:15:11.780" style="s2">consequence of psychological diseases</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.440" end="01:15:14.480" style="s2">and aberrant behavior so this is very</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.780" end="01:15:16.640" style="s2">very complicated I&#39;m more on the</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.480" end="01:15:18.050" style="s2">existentialist front with regards to</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.640" end="01:15:20.060" style="s2">these sorts of theories so Ellis</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.050" end="01:15:25.250" style="s2">Miller&#39;s thesis is basically Freudian</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.060" end="01:15:27.260" style="s2">Freud&#39;s thesis Freud certainly posited</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.250" end="01:15:29.849" style="s2">that many forms of psychological</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.260" end="01:15:33.559" style="s2">distress were a consequence of</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.849" end="01:15:35.999" style="s2">childhood trauma of various sorts I</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.559" end="01:15:39.239" style="s2">think the existentialist take on that is</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.999" end="01:15:42.629" style="s2">more accurate which is that life in and</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.239" end="01:15:44.309" style="s2">of itself is sufficiently harsh and full</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.629" end="01:15:46.679" style="s2">of betrayal and other forms of</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.309" end="01:15:48.719" style="s2">malevolence to cause any number of</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.679" end="01:15:51.989" style="s2">psychological diseases and produce any</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.719" end="01:15:53.939" style="s2">amount of aberrant behavior so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.989" end="01:15:55.979" style="s2">think it has to be it&#39;s not as if we all</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.939" end="01:15:58.280" style="s2">had childhoods without trauma that we</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.979" end="01:16:01.949" style="s2">would have grown up to be perfect adults</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.280" end="01:16:04.199" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s also a disguised form of</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.949" end="01:16:06.389" style="s2">Rousseau and philosophy and the Russos</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.199" end="01:16:09.869" style="s2">philosophy is people are basically good</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.389" end="01:16:11.879" style="s2">but culture makes them evil and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.869" end="01:16:15.949" style="s2">not true people are basically good and</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.879" end="01:16:18.629" style="s2">evil and culture fortifies the</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.949" end="01:16:23.399" style="s2">possibility of both adds strength to the</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.629" end="01:16:27.119" style="s2">possibility of both so I don&#39;t I I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.399" end="01:16:28.800" style="s2">that people are sometimes damaged in</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.119" end="01:16:30.719" style="s2">childhood in ways that need to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.800" end="01:16:33.389" style="s2">addressed in adulthood but that there</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.719" end="01:16:36.889" style="s2">are plenty plenty of other reasons for</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.389" end="01:16:44.820" style="s2">psychological and physical disorder</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.889" end="01:16:47.399" style="s2">genetic causes causes related to all</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.820" end="01:16:49.939" style="s2">sorts of physical diseases no it&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.399" end="01:16:52.139" style="s2">too simple it&#39;s way too simple of a</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.939" end="01:16:54.030" style="s2">hypothesis and it&#39;s caused an awful lot</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.139" end="01:16:55.979" style="s2">of trouble because a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.030" end="01:16:58.139" style="s2">simple-minded therapists always assume</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.979" end="01:17:00.359" style="s2">that if someone is having psychological</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.139" end="01:17:02.969" style="s2">problems in adulthood it must be because</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.359" end="01:17:04.919" style="s2">they had childhood trauma and everybody</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.969" end="01:17:06.419" style="s2">has an unhappy childhood to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.919" end="01:17:08.609" style="s2">so you can always find something and</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.419" end="01:17:10.800" style="s2">often the childhood trauma that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.609" end="01:17:13.609" style="s2">looking for has to be sexual and so they</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.800" end="01:17:17.280" style="s2">dig and dig until they find or invent</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.609" end="01:17:19.829" style="s2">often invent something that you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.280" end="01:17:21.840" style="s2">allows a single causal attribution and</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.829" end="01:17:24.059" style="s2">it&#39;s just life just isn&#39;t that simple</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.840" end="01:17:26.249" style="s2">man there&#39;s lots of reasons to be ill</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.059" end="01:17:28.630" style="s2">way more reasons to be old than to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.249" end="01:17:31.370" style="s2">healthy so</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.630" end="01:17:34.610" style="s2">what if the truth could unravel your</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.370" end="01:17:37.070" style="s2">entire life yeah well first of all it</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.610" end="01:17:37.550" style="s2">would and second yeah I know what you</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.070" end="01:17:41.630" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.550" end="01:17:42.800" style="s2">you mean what if I suppose the Cardinal</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.630" end="01:17:44.390" style="s2">case there would be that you did</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.800" end="01:17:45.830" style="s2">something really terrible and then if</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.390" end="01:17:49.490" style="s2">that was revealed it would be a</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.830" end="01:17:51.590" style="s2">catastrophic situation it&#39;s like without</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.490" end="01:17:53.870" style="s2">knowing the details of that I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.590" end="01:17:57.020" style="s2">provide a generic answer you know I</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.870" end="01:17:58.970" style="s2">think that there are some sins that are</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.020" end="01:18:00.800" style="s2">so egregious that you don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.970" end="01:18:02.960" style="s2">confess to them you know like if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.800" end="01:18:04.940" style="s2">done something terrible and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.960" end="01:18:06.230" style="s2">recommending this it&#39;s just an example</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.940" end="01:18:08.000" style="s2">if you&#39;ve done something terrible and</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.230" end="01:18:10.010" style="s2">you know that if you revealed it it</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.000" end="01:18:12.230" style="s2">would blow the lives of many people</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.010" end="01:18:15.680" style="s2">around you apart it isn&#39;t obvious to me</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.230" end="01:18:18.050" style="s2">that you have any moral justification</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.680" end="01:18:21.470" style="s2">for confessing just to free your</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.050" end="01:18:23.390" style="s2">miserable soul so what if the truth</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.470" end="01:18:24.620" style="s2">could unravel your entire life well</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.390" end="01:18:26.720" style="s2">maybe you need to go to Catholic</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.620" end="01:18:28.250" style="s2">confession and let someone know exactly</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.720" end="01:18:29.930" style="s2">what happened so you&#39;re clear about it</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.250" end="01:18:31.850" style="s2">and then maybe what you need to do is to</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.930" end="01:18:33.710" style="s2">swear to whatever God you worship that</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.850" end="01:18:35.780" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna try to walk the straight</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.710" end="01:18:38.390" style="s2">and narrow from here on in and that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.780" end="01:18:40.850" style="s2">be sufficient to atone for whatever</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.390" end="01:18:43.100" style="s2">terrible thing that you did and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.850" end="01:18:45.380" style="s2">that&#39;s a form of prayer and it sounds</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.100" end="01:18:51.440" style="s2">like one that you desperately need at</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.380" end="01:18:52.880" style="s2">least in principle know so without</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.440" end="01:18:55.570" style="s2">knowing the details that&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.880" end="01:18:55.570" style="s2">best I can do</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.849" end="01:19:03.649" style="s2">I think what put you over with so many</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.999" end="01:19:05.780" style="s2">of us was the constructive message of</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.649" end="01:19:07.939" style="s2">how to be a good man well a good person</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.780" end="01:19:10.369" style="s2">I would say do you think that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.939" end="01:19:13.519" style="s2">the media want you to go I don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="01:19:15.559" end="01:19:19.159" style="s2">disintegrates and it certainly is</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.269" end="01:19:23.209" style="s2">disintegrating at an incredibly rapid</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.159" end="01:19:25.389" style="s2">rate everything is political that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.209" end="01:19:28.219" style="s2">as if the philosophical and the</p>

<p begin="01:19:31.129" end="01:19:35.840" style="s2">interviews I&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.919" end="01:19:38.239" style="s2">what&#39;s been happening at my lectures on</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.840" end="01:19:40.219" style="s2">my tour and describing the fact that the</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.239" end="01:19:41.570" style="s2">vast majority of the audience isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.219" end="01:19:42.800" style="s2">there for political reasons at all</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.570" end="01:19:45.439" style="s2">they&#39;re there because they want to</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.800" end="01:19:48.050" style="s2">figure out how to have a responsible and</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.439" end="01:19:50.289" style="s2">meaningful life and it&#39;s as if that</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.050" end="01:19:53.119" style="s2">story just doesn&#39;t exist the the</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.289" end="01:19:54.919" style="s2">framework which is basically a political</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.119" end="01:19:57.409" style="s2">framework and increasingly a politically</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.919" end="01:20:02.329" style="s2">correct framework doesn&#39;t allow that to</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.409" end="01:20:06.489" style="s2">exist as a reality and that&#39;s why well</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.329" end="01:20:08.989" style="s2">I&#39;m much more comfortable lecturing to</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.489" end="01:20:10.789" style="s2">the crowds that have been coming to see</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.989" end="01:20:13.429" style="s2">me than I am talking to journalists it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.789" end="01:20:15.979" style="s2">become I have to I have been limiting my</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.429" end="01:20:17.570" style="s2">my interactions with journalists even</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.979" end="01:20:19.879" style="s2">though that might not be self-evident</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.570" end="01:20:24.709" style="s2">yet I have been trying to do that that</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.879" end="01:20:27.859" style="s2">the demands have been increasing so the</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.709" end="01:20:29.869" style="s2">proportion of media invitations that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.859" end="01:20:32.479" style="s2">responding to has fallen dramatically</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.869" end="01:20:34.999" style="s2">even though the absolute number hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.479" end="01:20:37.550" style="s2">declined as precipitously and the reason</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.999" end="01:20:40.249" style="s2">for that is that while I find the I find</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.550" end="01:20:43.309" style="s2">the typical interview very stressful</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.249" end="01:20:45.979" style="s2">very very stressful I&#39;m on guard and I</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.309" end="01:20:48.039" style="s2">would say also my attitude isn&#39;t as good</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.979" end="01:20:50.840" style="s2">as it could be anymore because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.039" end="01:20:53.119" style="s2">I&#39;m because I&#39;m on guard so much it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.840" end="01:20:55.699" style="s2">easier for me to get a bit snappy and an</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.119" end="01:20:57.439" style="s2">unpleasant and that&#39;s bad that&#39;s bad I</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.699" end="01:21:00.889" style="s2">don&#39;t want to do that I want to stay</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.439" end="01:21:02.419" style="s2">calm and detached and try to you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.889" end="01:21:05.320" style="s2">tell the truth and be happy that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.419" end="01:21:10.159" style="s2">there regardless of the circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.320" end="01:21:12.110" style="s2">the fact that the mainstream media let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.159" end="01:21:14.570" style="s2">say is not</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.110" end="01:21:17.389" style="s2">very receptive oh the sometimes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.570" end="01:21:19.610" style="s2">exceptions not very receptive to the</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.389" end="01:21:21.500" style="s2">idea that I could just be going around</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.610" end="01:21:23.810" style="s2">talking to people who want to get their</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.500" end="01:21:25.760" style="s2">life together is quite saddening and I</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.810" end="01:21:28.699" style="s2">think it&#39;s definitely a commentary on</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.760" end="01:21:37.489" style="s2">the fundamental corruption of our media</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.699" end="01:21:40.730" style="s2">apparatus I think it&#39;s better to talk on</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.489" end="01:21:42.920" style="s2">YouTube to speak on my podcast to do</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.730" end="01:21:44.869" style="s2">these lectures and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.920" end="01:21:47.600" style="s2">increasingly better to do that the</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.869" end="01:21:49.219" style="s2">long-form discussions on YouTube though</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.600" end="01:21:52.010" style="s2">with people like Joe Rogan and Dave</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.219" end="01:21:57.199" style="s2">Rubin and and so forth that works just</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.010" end="01:21:58.310" style="s2">fine so a new media form is emerging and</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.199" end="01:22:00.860" style="s2">I think it&#39;s going to be a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.310" end="01:22:02.780" style="s2">productive it won&#39;t be as scripted it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.860" end="01:22:12.080" style="s2">be much longer form it&#39;ll be allow for</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.780" end="01:22:14.570" style="s2">much more thoughtfulness and I&#39;m but</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.080" end="01:22:16.610" style="s2">it&#39;s okay it&#39;s not like the media</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.570" end="01:22:19.150" style="s2">exposure although it&#39;s been stressful</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.610" end="01:22:21.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not like I&#39;m not grateful for it</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.150" end="01:22:23.719" style="s2">even people who&#39;ve put me on the spot</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.920" end="01:22:26.570" style="s2">very badly have ended up doing me a</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.719" end="01:22:32.989" style="s2">tremendous favor but the problem is is</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.570" end="01:22:35.739" style="s2">that because the problem is I&#39;m becoming</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.989" end="01:22:39.590" style="s2">too much on guard and and I&#39;ve noticed a</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.739" end="01:22:43.219" style="s2">developing sense of impatience within me</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.590" end="01:22:44.900" style="s2">and some suspicion and that&#39;s not good I</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.219" end="01:22:46.760" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be in situations where</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.900" end="01:22:49.010" style="s2">those are my fundamental orientations</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.760" end="01:22:50.900" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a sign of a certain</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.010" end="01:22:55.280" style="s2">amount of internal corruption on my part</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.900" end="01:22:58.100" style="s2">and I want to be in situations where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.280" end="01:22:59.830" style="s2">speaking with people speaking honestly</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.100" end="01:23:04.900" style="s2">to people who are honestly listening</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.830" end="01:23:04.900" style="s2">that would be that&#39;s a good situation so</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.240" end="01:23:11.690" style="s2">would you agree with CS lewis that if</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.680" end="01:23:13.130" style="s2">you look for truth you may find comfort</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.690" end="01:23:15.140" style="s2">if you look for comfort you will find</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.130" end="01:23:17.210" style="s2">despair oh yes that&#39;s definitely the</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.140" end="01:23:18.800" style="s2">case it&#39;s quite an intelligent phrase</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.210" end="01:23:22.100" style="s2">because he says if you look for truth</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.800" end="01:23:24.650" style="s2">you may find comfort he didn&#39;t say you</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.100" end="01:23:25.820" style="s2">will find comfort yeah well sometimes if</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.650" end="01:23:27.380" style="s2">you look for truth you don&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.820" end="01:23:30.050" style="s2">comfort to begin with that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.380" end="01:23:31.490" style="s2">you find a lot of trouble but sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.050" end="01:23:33.680" style="s2">you have to go through a lot of trouble</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.490" end="01:23:36.440" style="s2">to get to set things right if you look</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.680" end="01:23:38.630" style="s2">for comfort despair well the reason for</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.440" end="01:23:42.560" style="s2">that is that you can&#39;t look for comfort</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.630" end="01:23:46.190" style="s2">in life life isn&#39;t about comfort life is</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.560" end="01:23:46.430" style="s2">a deadly game it&#39;s a game of life and</p>

<p begin="01:23:46.430" end="01:23:51.740" style="s2">it&#39;s a game of good and evil it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:24:03.080" end="01:24:08.960" style="s2">and I think the greatest adventure that</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.870" end="01:24:12.980" style="s2">you can possibly have is one is the one</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.960" end="01:24:18.350" style="s2">that you find if you look for the truth</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.980" end="01:24:23.420" style="s2">and that&#39;s a good place to stop that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.350" end="01:24:25.280" style="s2">been 90 minutes and I&#39;ve been reasonably</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.420" end="01:24:30.200" style="s2">sharp and with it for the full 90</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.280" end="01:24:33.230" style="s2">minutes and so I think I&#39;ll bring it to</p>

<p begin="01:25:24.750" end="01:25:30.000" style="s2">quite positively to it so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.420" end="01:25:33.600" style="s2">worth the 15 minutes and the 995 that it</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.000" end="01:25:35.760" style="s2">costs discounted 20 percent now so I</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.600" end="01:25:40.350" style="s2">guess that&#39;s about 795 something like</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.760" end="01:25:41.880" style="s2">that so that the second Iceland lecture</p>
