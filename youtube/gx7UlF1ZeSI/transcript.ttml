<p begin="00:01:20.250" end="00:01:25.080" style="s2">become a part of them involved in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.200" end="00:01:26.790" style="s2">but yeah it just felt like it either</p>

<p begin="00:02:00.180" end="00:02:03.180" style="s2">and they need to unite if they want to</p>

<p begin="00:03:45.630" end="00:03:51.000" style="s2">you know really well will we have access</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.240" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">to resources in an increasingly scarce</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.000" end="00:03:54.690" style="s2">looking future yeah I mean I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:56.970" style="s2">they would articulate it to themselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.690" end="00:03:59.300" style="s2">in quite that way but no I but I agree</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.970" end="00:04:02.550" style="s2">the source of the the source of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.300" end="00:04:04.680" style="s2">whatever it is the the rage the fear</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.550" end="00:04:08.270" style="s2">that whatever it is that brings that out</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.680" end="00:04:12.330" style="s2">of people I agree with you it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.270" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">yeah hmm so yeah I&#39;m feeling a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.330" end="00:04:16.080" style="s2">bit a little bit stuck at the moment in</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:19.530" style="s2">that you know I&#39;m in Spain and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.080" end="00:04:21.720" style="s2">trying to sort of reconstruct my own</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.530" end="00:04:22.290" style="s2">life along along different lines you</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.720" end="00:04:25.350" style="s2">know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.290" end="00:04:28.020" style="s2">kind of feel that until I&#39;ve done that</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.350" end="00:04:29.700" style="s2">not sure how effective an agent of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.020" end="00:04:32.310" style="s2">positive change I can be in the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.700" end="00:04:36.060" style="s2">while I am still ensnared in the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.310" end="00:04:37.470" style="s2">kind of stuff myself you know so ya know</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.060" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">I&#39;m a big admirer of yours Richard</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.470" end="00:04:40.140" style="s2">you&#39;ve been fighting a good fight for a</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.880" end="00:04:41.730" style="s2">while now and you never seem to lose</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.140" end="00:04:43.530" style="s2">your appetite for it you never seem to</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.730" end="00:04:48.330" style="s2">lose your motivation it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.530" end="00:04:52.130" style="s2">impressive I&#39;m funny how often I say</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.330" end="00:04:54.630" style="s2">this but you know one catches up with</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.130" end="00:04:57.950" style="s2">lots of different people not that often</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.630" end="00:05:00.840" style="s2">and every time I I&#39;m fascinated by the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.950" end="00:05:03.300" style="s2">rhetoric that comes from conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.840" end="00:05:06.960" style="s2">rather than from deliberate study or</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.300" end="00:05:09.030" style="s2">sort of methodical development just</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.960" end="00:05:11.040" style="s2">because most of my work is talking to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.030" end="00:05:14.360" style="s2">people and I&#39;m amazed at what comes out</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.040" end="00:05:16.740" style="s2">and so I love sort of unscripted</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.360" end="00:05:18.480" style="s2">conversations where we just kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.740" end="00:05:21.840" style="s2">how we get on and that&#39;s when the good</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.480" end="00:05:23.760" style="s2">stuff comes out and fortunately much of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.840" end="00:05:25.590" style="s2">my work in Greymouth is based around</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.760" end="00:05:27.930" style="s2">having conversations on the street with</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.590" end="00:05:31.680" style="s2">ordinary people it&#39;s not high tech it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.930" end="00:05:34.590" style="s2">not high leverage it&#39;s just sort of face</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.680" end="00:05:38.580" style="s2">to face one or one or one on a small</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.590" end="00:05:40.290" style="s2">group of very organic conversation and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.580" end="00:05:42.090" style="s2">think that&#39;s where the good stuff is you</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.290" end="00:05:44.430" style="s2">know it&#39;s non planned it&#39;s not intended</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.090" end="00:05:47.040" style="s2">it&#39;s just see what comes out and I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.430" end="00:05:50.580" style="s2">there&#39;s a subconscious element to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.040" end="00:05:53.940" style="s2">you know where your subconscious brain</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.580" end="00:05:57.930" style="s2">is 90% of your brain can be capacity or</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.940" end="00:05:59.760" style="s2">something isn&#39;t it yeah yeah it&#39;s crazy</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.930" end="00:06:01.890" style="s2">and if you couldn&#39;t access that material</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.760" end="00:06:04.380" style="s2">then you&#39;ll do a much better job I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.890" end="00:06:05.940" style="s2">well the thing is we do access that</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.380" end="00:06:08.220" style="s2">material all the time but because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.940" end="00:06:09.450" style="s2">so convinced that all there is to us is</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.220" end="00:06:11.340" style="s2">our conscious you know our waking</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.450" end="00:06:12.540" style="s2">consciousness army you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.340" end="00:06:14.700" style="s2">because we&#39;re convinced that&#39;s all there</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.540" end="00:06:16.470" style="s2">is we don&#39;t pay attention to our</p>

<p begin="00:08:02.760" end="00:08:08.460" style="s2">it&#39;s an ever ascending pathway you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.580" end="00:08:10.860" style="s2">we just seem to get closer and closer to</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.460" end="00:08:15.330" style="s2">what we all what we all aspire to you</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.860" end="00:08:17.700" style="s2">know and every even I mean forgive me</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.050" end="00:08:25.530" style="s2">half thing and then I can yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.670" end="00:08:27.630" style="s2">so obviously some subtopics are very</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.530" end="00:08:28.950" style="s2">emotive and it&#39;s gonna be quite you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:08:28.950" end="00:08:34.229" style="s2">you know it&#39;s very very easy when</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.660" end="00:08:38.650" style="s2">everyone&#39;s so jumpy but even the mosque</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.229" end="00:08:41.050" style="s2">attacks in Christchurch were indicative</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.650" end="00:08:42.610" style="s2">a change or at least the response to</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.050" end="00:08:45.360" style="s2">them was indicative of a change in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.610" end="00:08:47.920" style="s2">sentiment of New Zealanders as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.360" end="00:08:50.320" style="s2">previously well previously there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.920" end="00:08:52.630" style="s2">frequently been a sort of a New Zealand</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.320" end="00:08:54.130" style="s2">very generalized attitude that all that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.630" end="00:08:55.360" style="s2">kind of thing goes on in the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.130" end="00:08:58.420" style="s2">world that&#39;s all because they&#39;re mad</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.360" end="00:09:00.160" style="s2">it&#39;s because they&#39;re in sis or because</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.420" end="00:09:02.350" style="s2">there are Americans or because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.160" end="00:09:06.820" style="s2">crazy British we don&#39;t do that here in</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.350" end="00:09:08.290" style="s2">New Zealand and now we do and so what</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.820" end="00:09:10.900" style="s2">I&#39;ve really been up against in the last</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.290" end="00:09:12.580" style="s2">10 years is the sort of naysayers who</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.900" end="00:09:14.770" style="s2">have got this position that oh it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.580" end="00:09:18.700" style="s2">fine you just need to work harder you</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.770" end="00:09:21.010" style="s2">know and the anomalies that we witness</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.700" end="00:09:22.300" style="s2">overseas aren&#39;t really real that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.010" end="00:09:24.610" style="s2">something that happens in these funny</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.300" end="00:09:26.500" style="s2">places where they&#39;re all fucked up yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.610" end="00:09:28.150" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t happen here and when</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.500" end="00:09:32.080" style="s2">these things start to happen here then</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.150" end="00:09:36.250" style="s2">the few and it&#39;s amazing I said whew the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.080" end="00:09:38.260" style="s2">remaining naysayers who think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.250" end="00:09:40.180" style="s2">all going to be fine and we if you start</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.260" end="00:09:42.400" style="s2">exporting coal again and we can still</p>

<p begin="00:09:52.540" end="00:09:57.250" style="s2">proportion of the population is feeling</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.089" end="00:10:00.850" style="s2">increasingly isolated now that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.250" end="00:10:04.180" style="s2">been you know 50 people shot in one</p>

<p begin="00:10:08.320" end="00:10:13.780" style="s2">the reverberations have gone out well</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.510" end="00:10:14.530" style="s2">beyond the incident itself yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.780" end="00:10:17.170" style="s2">very much so</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.530" end="00:10:18.370" style="s2">very much so of course with some abandon</p>

<p begin="00:11:40.390" end="00:11:45.970" style="s2">but per capita is I guess because of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.570" end="00:11:47.650" style="s2">lots of people have land right and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.970" end="00:11:54.790" style="s2">they need the guns as protection I get</p>

<p begin="00:12:32.170" end="00:12:36.610" style="s2">weren&#39;t fleeing terror or persecution</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.330" end="00:12:40.090" style="s2">they were looking for a better life in</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.610" end="00:12:42.240" style="s2">the nation yeah they were starting to</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.090" end="00:12:46.270" style="s2">have second thoughts about the colonial</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.240" end="00:12:47.680" style="s2">Imperial March of British aspirations</p>

<p begin="00:12:47.680" end="00:12:53.260" style="s2">and so we have the Treaty of Waitangi so</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.740" end="00:12:56.260" style="s2">they effectively did a deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.260" end="00:12:58.720" style="s2">natives and granted them considerable</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.260" end="00:13:00.310" style="s2">rights which still very significant</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.720" end="00:13:04.030" style="s2">today we&#39;re talking hundreds of millions</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.310" end="00:13:07.770" style="s2">of dollars but it&#39;s a nice is more</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.030" end="00:13:07.770" style="s2">accurately previous invaders right</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.970" end="00:13:13.500" style="s2">yeah yeah the end of the day I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.980" end="00:13:18.720" style="s2">is this that wiped out the indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.500" end="00:13:25.770" style="s2">people who know yeah yeah they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.720" end="00:13:27.720" style="s2">really like to be reminded of that but</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.770" end="00:13:29.070" style="s2">it you can sort of get silly but they</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.720" end="00:13:32.790" style="s2">were it was definitely different when</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.070" end="00:13:34.890" style="s2">they came to New Zealand and much of it</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.790" end="00:13:38.280" style="s2">was to escape the hierarchy and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.890" end="00:13:42.360" style="s2">class divisions that were prevalent in</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.280" end="00:13:44.610" style="s2">you know 19th century England so we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.360" end="00:13:46.800" style="s2">a few things like the quarter acre plots</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.610" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">no one could build a house on a site</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.800" end="00:13:50.970" style="s2">that was smaller than a quarter of an</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:52.980" style="s2">acre which is enough to have a pig and a</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.970" end="00:13:55.230" style="s2">few jokes and grow a few fruit trees</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.980" end="00:13:56.370" style="s2">kind of thing and they&#39;re still of</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.230" end="00:13:57.060" style="s2">course they&#39;ve all been built there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.370" end="00:13:59.250" style="s2">now 31</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.060" end="00:14:01.530" style="s2">a B C and D on every bloody plot you</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.250" end="00:14:03.150" style="s2">know in the towns but that that was the</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.530" end="00:14:05.460" style="s2">aspiration so that everyone could be</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.150" end="00:14:07.950" style="s2">self-sufficient and also things like</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.460" end="00:14:09.690" style="s2">access to the countryside and the water</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.950" end="00:14:11.520" style="s2">waves particularly is a thing called the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.690" end="00:14:14.700" style="s2">Queen&#39;s chain which means basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.520" end="00:14:17.280" style="s2">anybody can go anywhere within a chain</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.700" end="00:14:22.410" style="s2">you know cricket field length of any</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.280" end="00:14:23.340" style="s2">named waterway Center so even when</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.410" end="00:14:25.560" style="s2">you&#39;re just driving around the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.340" end="00:14:27.090" style="s2">countryside if there&#39;s a little creek if</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.560" end="00:14:29.370" style="s2">it&#39;s got a name then you&#39;re allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.090" end="00:14:32.700" style="s2">go into that Creek and hunt and fish and</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.370" end="00:14:34.650" style="s2">camp there gather firewood and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.700" end="00:14:38.610" style="s2">all over the country and they fiercely</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.650" end="00:14:40.500" style="s2">defend that right and that&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.610" end="00:14:43.140" style="s2">important to New Zealanders to retain</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.500" end="00:14:44.910" style="s2">those freedoms of access and it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.140" end="00:14:47.370" style="s2">came from hunting didn&#39;t it and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.910" end="00:14:50.280" style="s2">bizarrely in this country even the</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.370" end="00:14:53.810" style="s2">poorest people can go and hunt big game</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.280" end="00:14:56.520" style="s2">and feed themselves they can go fishing</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.810" end="00:14:58.710" style="s2">and they can go ride dirt bikes in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.520" end="00:15:01.530" style="s2">countryside for example which in Britain</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.710" end="00:15:03.540" style="s2">a very exclusive pursuits you know to go</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.530" end="00:15:05.790" style="s2">any sort of decent fishing or hunting is</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.540" end="00:15:08.010" style="s2">hardly accessible to anybody actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.790" end="00:15:08.730" style="s2">unless you&#39;re very wealthy or very</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.010" end="00:15:10.590" style="s2">well-connected</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.730" end="00:15:11.970" style="s2">depends where you live I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.590" end="00:15:13.140" style="s2">some really nice fishing rivers in Wales</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.970" end="00:15:14.970" style="s2">and you can get a license which allows</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.140" end="00:15:18.090" style="s2">you to finish on I believe any of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.970" end="00:15:19.620" style="s2">rivers and relatively inexpensive yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.090" end="00:15:21.150" style="s2">so I think it probably depends on where</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.620" end="00:15:22.860" style="s2">you are there there is some good visual</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.150" end="00:15:25.770" style="s2">well you know I mean this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.860" end="00:15:27.750" style="s2">one of the problems that we hope to</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.770" end="00:15:30.270" style="s2">confront right with with with the change</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.750" end="00:15:32.250" style="s2">of with the change of paradigm is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.270" end="00:15:34.589" style="s2">degradation of things like water to</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.250" end="00:15:36.839" style="s2">waterways you know what I mean you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.589" end="00:15:38.160" style="s2">just most waterways you can&#39;t just go in</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.839" end="00:15:40.440" style="s2">catch fish you know what I mean stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:44.970" style="s2">there shellfish especially you can&#39;t eat</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.440" end="00:15:47.490" style="s2">poisonous yeah yeah yeah and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.970" end="00:15:56.400" style="s2">getting a massive driver hit making life</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.490" end="00:15:58.350" style="s2">easier for us Neela no no it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.400" end="00:16:01.040" style="s2">international thing extinction rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.350" end="00:16:03.779" style="s2">if they made it over there yeah I&#39;ll not</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.040" end="00:16:05.510" style="s2">not physically but certainly own over</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.779" end="00:16:09.990" style="s2">the Internet yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.510" end="00:16:15.720" style="s2">they got a a decent kind of target or</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.990" end="00:16:17.450" style="s2">are they do bit morphic climate change</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.720" end="00:16:20.430" style="s2">that&#39;s their that&#39;s that that&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.450" end="00:16:23.100" style="s2">that&#39;s their thing so they went they</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.430" end="00:16:25.440" style="s2">blocked up various different routes in</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.100" end="00:16:27.330" style="s2">central London with placards and boats</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.440" end="00:16:28.470" style="s2">and various differences they glued</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.330" end="00:16:31.709" style="s2">themselves to the front of the stock</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.470" end="00:16:33.209" style="s2">exchange I mean it was it was at least</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.709" end="00:16:35.310" style="s2">initially for me it was quite inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.209" end="00:16:37.140" style="s2">you know what I mean to actually they</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.310" end="00:16:39.390" style="s2">actually see people mobilize and</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.140" end="00:16:42.480" style="s2">organize and commit to getting arrested</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.390" end="00:16:44.810" style="s2">if necessary you know what I mean to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.480" end="00:16:47.070" style="s2">you know to go and send out a message</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.810" end="00:16:49.380" style="s2">but I&#39;ve since been watching a little</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.070" end="00:16:51.750" style="s2">bit of you know the sort of alternative</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.380" end="00:16:53.250" style="s2">side of it on the Internet and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.750" end="00:16:54.540" style="s2">quite interesting the backgrounds a</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.250" end="00:16:56.430" style="s2">couple of the leaders of it you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.540" end="00:16:58.170" style="s2">they were they work for NGOs which were</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.430" end="00:17:01.490" style="s2">financed by telecommunications and</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.170" end="00:17:03.540" style="s2">energy companies and so and also</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.490" end="00:17:04.770" style="s2">watching a few things a couple of good</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.540" end="00:17:06.270" style="s2">points have been made people saying</p>

<p begin="00:18:23.480" end="00:18:27.649" style="s2">people&#39;s assemblies up and down the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.309" end="00:18:30.129" style="s2">country who would consult on how to best</p>

<p begin="00:18:30.129" end="00:18:36.769" style="s2">and so yeah I&#39;ve got a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.639" end="00:18:38.779" style="s2">problems with it number one climate</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.769" end="00:18:40.309" style="s2">change I don&#39;t like the term I had a</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.779" end="00:18:41.929" style="s2">conversation with Nick not very long ago</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.309" end="00:18:43.639" style="s2">it&#39;ll go up on the money free channel</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.929" end="00:18:44.840" style="s2">soon and he made a very very good point</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.639" end="00:18:46.970" style="s2">you know if instead of calling it</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.840" end="00:18:49.820" style="s2">climate change we call the environmental</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.970" end="00:18:51.769" style="s2">degradation yeah this this would be a</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.820" end="00:18:55.070" style="s2">very very much more encompassing term</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.769" end="00:18:57.350" style="s2">you know because I don&#39;t care how</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.070" end="00:18:59.299" style="s2">certain everyone says you know 97% of</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.350" end="00:19:01.820" style="s2">climate scientists agree bla bla bla bla</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.299" end="00:19:03.200" style="s2">bla what they actually agree on is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.820" end="00:19:04.369" style="s2">the world is warming right that the</p>

<p begin="00:19:04.369" end="00:19:07.639" style="s2">dioxide levels are increasing this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.749" end="00:19:09.799" style="s2">what they agree on but actually there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.639" end="00:19:13.039" style="s2">very substantial disagreement as to</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.799" end="00:19:16.519" style="s2">whether carbon dioxide increases precede</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.039" end="00:19:18.889" style="s2">or suckseed temperature rises because</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.519" end="00:19:20.119" style="s2">oxide there&#39;s 50 times as much carbon</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.889" end="00:19:22.279" style="s2">dioxide iddin know this until recently</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.119" end="00:19:24.559" style="s2">there&#39;s 50 times as much carbon dioxide</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.279" end="00:19:26.600" style="s2">dissolved in the oceans as there is in</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.559" end="00:19:28.460" style="s2">the atmosphere right and as the oceans</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.600" end="00:19:30.230" style="s2">get warmer they are their ability to</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.460" end="00:19:32.779" style="s2">hold carbon dioxide decreases the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.230" end="00:19:35.119" style="s2">solubility decreases so as the oceans</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.779" end="00:19:37.820" style="s2">get warmer they kick more carbon dioxide</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.119" end="00:19:39.739" style="s2">into the atmosphere right and so what a</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.820" end="00:19:41.359" style="s2">lot of climate scientists are actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.739" end="00:19:42.950" style="s2">saying is that they believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.359" end="00:19:44.780" style="s2">carbon dioxide Rises may be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.950" end="00:19:46.970" style="s2">consequence of warming</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.780" end="00:19:48.770" style="s2">and not a cause of warning right and</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.970" end="00:19:50.510" style="s2">there&#39;s no doubt that the oceans are</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.770" end="00:19:52.370" style="s2">getting warmer but it is that which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.510" end="00:19:54.260" style="s2">the cause of the Condor so to attack</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.370" end="00:19:56.900" style="s2">carbon dioxide levels is to completely</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.260" end="00:20:00.620" style="s2">miss the fucking point right and anyway</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.900" end="00:20:02.900" style="s2">even if even if and also the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.620" end="00:20:06.080" style="s2">is we produce something like 35 out of</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.900" end="00:20:08.180" style="s2">700 Giga tons of the carbon dioxide that</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.080" end="00:20:10.220" style="s2">the earth cycles through every year</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.180" end="00:20:13.070" style="s2">right so it&#39;s like less than 5% of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.220" end="00:20:15.050" style="s2">total global contribution is made by men</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.070" end="00:20:16.520" style="s2">and I get the idea is a delicate system</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.050" end="00:20:20.810" style="s2">and it only takes maybe a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.520" end="00:20:22.940" style="s2">percent or upset to embroil that what</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.810" end="00:20:24.550" style="s2">sorry I sidetracked myself there I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.940" end="00:20:27.020" style="s2">gonna say something else</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.550" end="00:20:29.090" style="s2">well are we are we focused on the right</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.020" end="00:20:30.980" style="s2">thing I think it&#39;s what&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.090" end="00:20:32.870" style="s2">that was exactly my point and and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.980" end="00:20:35.180" style="s2">that by focusing on carbon dioxide we</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.870" end="00:20:37.070" style="s2">are being distracted from and/or in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.180" end="00:20:38.600" style="s2">way prevented from doing anything about</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.070" end="00:20:40.760" style="s2">a lot of the other ecological</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.600" end="00:20:42.950" style="s2">catastrophes which are very definitely</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.760" end="00:20:47.030" style="s2">very certainly going on right under our</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.950" end="00:20:48.620" style="s2">noses you know what I mean it really it</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.030" end="00:20:50.630" style="s2">started to worry me I heard one</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.620" end="00:20:54.370" style="s2">conspiracy theory guys say that the end</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.630" end="00:20:57.260" style="s2">game here is to convince everyone that</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.370" end="00:20:59.390" style="s2">the threat of global warming cut human</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.260" end="00:21:02.330" style="s2">carbon dioxide cause global warming is</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.390" end="00:21:05.900" style="s2">so immediate and so catastrophic that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.330" end="00:21:07.430" style="s2">have to you know rebuild our entire GM</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.900" end="00:21:09.020" style="s2">entire energy and transport</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.430" end="00:21:10.670" style="s2">infrastructure away and the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.020" end="00:21:17.710" style="s2">do that is to take all the money out of</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.670" end="00:21:17.710" style="s2">your pension funds I&#39;ll let the dog in</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.920" end="00:21:23.930" style="s2">yes I mean I I&#39;ve got these five</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.200" end="00:21:28.060" style="s2">parameters that if there&#39;s one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.930" end="00:21:31.310" style="s2">quote most repeatedly it&#39;s probably that</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.060" end="00:21:37.130" style="s2">dog hello dog and the first of those</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.310" end="00:21:40.970" style="s2">parameters which we&#39;ve fairly recently</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.130" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">died as a species is is the letter C so</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.970" end="00:21:46.370" style="s2">I probably come back to that climate</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:47.540" style="s2">change but I immediately pounced on</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.370" end="00:21:48.680" style="s2">people say I don&#39;t really want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.540" end="00:21:51.440" style="s2">about climate change and we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.680" end="00:21:54.070" style="s2">need to it&#39;s not really relevant at this</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.440" end="00:21:56.930" style="s2">stage you know did man cause this etc</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.070" end="00:21:58.400" style="s2">the other day you know just if you&#39;re in</p>

<p begin="00:22:04.040" end="00:22:08.180" style="s2">all that really matters there&#39;s plenty</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.410" end="00:22:13.270" style="s2">of other reasons not to do things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.180" end="00:22:16.160" style="s2">may or may not claw caused climate harm</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.270" end="00:22:17.990" style="s2">and they&#39;re all driven by money at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.160" end="00:22:19.430" style="s2">end of the day and I always feel these</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.990" end="00:22:23.270" style="s2">arguments you know we immediately kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.430" end="00:22:26.420" style="s2">of get onto a Anti poisons or</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.420" end="00:22:32.600" style="s2">and we we&#39;ve already lost the point and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.650" end="00:22:34.190" style="s2">we can argue and fall out about it and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.600" end="00:22:35.570" style="s2">send each other emails and build</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.190" end="00:22:38.840" style="s2">websites about it</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.570" end="00:22:40.640" style="s2">go on protests already missed the point</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.840" end="00:22:42.410" style="s2">you know just cinder and car all in</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.640" end="00:22:43.700" style="s2">Paris patting each other on the back</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.410" end="00:22:46.130" style="s2">about what they&#39;re gonna do about the</p>

<p begin="00:22:49.730" end="00:22:55.130" style="s2">angst and dedication will go into</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.240" end="00:22:57.320" style="s2">something that&#39;s actually a symptom and</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.130" end="00:22:59.330" style="s2">not a fish just gonna use exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.320" end="00:23:00.559" style="s2">word is attacking symptom of causes</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.330" end="00:23:01.100" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.559" end="00:23:02.630" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.100" end="00:23:04.010" style="s2">all of it and yeah I mean climate change</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.630" end="00:23:06.110" style="s2">is just the latest one I tend to agree</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.010" end="00:23:07.820" style="s2">with you if we didn&#39;t do things so</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.110" end="00:23:08.840" style="s2">fucking stupid Lee and wastefully then</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.820" end="00:23:12.890" style="s2">we wouldn&#39;t be having to worry about</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.840" end="00:23:15.110" style="s2">these things you know thing yeah many</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.890" end="00:23:17.510" style="s2">people the education of our children</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.110" end="00:23:20.210" style="s2">were to include an appreciation of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.510" end="00:23:22.130" style="s2">fact that we are deeply connected to in</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.210" end="00:23:27.980" style="s2">fact we are birth ultimately by the</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.130" end="00:23:30.170" style="s2">planet bringing worse we include this</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.980" end="00:23:31.700" style="s2">over and over and over again then people</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.170" end="00:23:32.450" style="s2">would act very differently so yes sorry</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.700" end="00:23:35.090" style="s2">you were going to say something</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.450" end="00:23:37.540" style="s2">interrupts yeah yeah well again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.090" end="00:23:40.670" style="s2">television is in and it gets quite easy</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.540" end="00:23:42.260" style="s2">to back up you know we need to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.670" end="00:23:46.360" style="s2">people to think beyond the superficial</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.260" end="00:23:49.790" style="s2">ah there&#39;s been a shooting ban guns</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.360" end="00:23:51.950" style="s2">reaction yeah and ask you know okay just</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.790" end="00:23:53.750" style="s2">stop a minute back up and think well why</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.950" end="00:23:56.690" style="s2">did the guy want to shoot anyone in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.750" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">first place why do we have threats to</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.690" end="00:24:02.410" style="s2">our climate why do people hunt whales</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:04.970" style="s2">why do people beat their wives you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.410" end="00:24:07.280" style="s2">don&#39;t just have better surveillance in</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.970" end="00:24:09.170" style="s2">houses to prevent you know to catch them</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.280" end="00:24:11.420" style="s2">when they do be their wives its we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.170" end="00:24:12.960" style="s2">reactive it&#39;s almost child it&#39;s worse</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.420" end="00:24:15.310" style="s2">than child like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.960" end="00:24:17.130" style="s2">but here it&#39;s very very obvious because</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.310" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">there&#39;s so few people and they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.130" end="00:24:21.880" style="s2">intimately connected especially on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.840" end="00:24:25.420" style="s2">west coast where you know my campaign is</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.880" end="00:24:28.990" style="s2">going on and I think there&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.420" end="00:24:31.180" style="s2">shorter link between the cause and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.990" end="00:24:33.160" style="s2">effect of what people are doing whereas</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.180" end="00:24:35.110" style="s2">I dare say in Britain or Spain or</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.160" end="00:24:40.990" style="s2">something you know bigger more developed</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.110" end="00:24:43.120" style="s2">deeper civilization shall we say people</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.990" end="00:24:45.310" style="s2">are much more disconnected from the root</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.120" end="00:24:47.320" style="s2">causes of the problems that they</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.310" end="00:24:50.680" style="s2">experienced was here they&#39;re very direct</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.320" end="00:24:52.960" style="s2">so here we see dairy farming which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.680" end="00:24:55.420" style="s2">our biggest export and that crops</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.960" end="00:24:59.500" style="s2">everything up basically the sale of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.420" end="00:25:02.230" style="s2">basically milk powder overseas that pays</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.500" end="00:25:06.040" style="s2">for basically everything you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.230" end="00:25:09.160" style="s2">the short version but it&#39;s disastrous</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.040" end="00:25:13.840" style="s2">for the animals for the farmers and for</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.160" end="00:25:17.020" style="s2">the environment and the water and people</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.840" end="00:25:19.780" style="s2">know people see that very clearly and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.020" end="00:25:21.160" style="s2">if we want to address that those harm</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.780" end="00:25:23.920" style="s2">things that we see that you can&#39;t eat</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.160" end="00:25:27.940" style="s2">the food in the in in the water you</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.920" end="00:25:30.100" style="s2">can&#39;t access farms anymore because</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.940" end="00:25:31.870" style="s2">they&#39;re all like electrified prisons you</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.100" end="00:25:33.430" style="s2">know because a huge corporate owned now</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.870" end="00:25:35.350" style="s2">most of these dairy farms they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.430" end="00:25:39.250" style="s2">family-friendly farms that they used to</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.350" end="00:25:41.170" style="s2">be and it and the depression and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.250" end="00:25:41.980" style="s2">isolation of the farmers and their staff</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.170" end="00:25:43.690" style="s2">is horrific</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.980" end="00:25:46.950" style="s2">you know the suicide rate among farmers</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.690" end="00:25:49.300" style="s2">is amongst the worst in the country</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.950" end="00:25:52.660" style="s2">and they&#39;re all going into debt horrific</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.300" end="00:25:55.060" style="s2">Lee and of course the product that it</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.660" end="00:25:56.770" style="s2">produces isn&#39;t even really intended you</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.060" end="00:25:59.680" style="s2">know in natural terms for human</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.770" end="00:26:01.450" style="s2">consumption anyway so the whole thing is</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.680" end="00:26:04.240" style="s2">flawed from start to finish but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.450" end="00:26:06.730" style="s2">very easy to point it out here because</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.240" end="00:26:10.300" style="s2">we&#39;re a relatively shallow civilization</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.730" end="00:26:14.050" style="s2">no in that regard that dairy actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.300" end="00:26:18.520" style="s2">serves no intrinsic purpose except to</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.050" end="00:26:20.410" style="s2">get money yeah absolutely and if we it</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.520" end="00:26:23.350" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actually contribute towards the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.410" end="00:26:26.320" style="s2">manufacture of computers or electricity</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.350" end="00:26:28.840" style="s2">or food or</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.320" end="00:26:32.139" style="s2">gleans you know they&#39;re completely</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.840" end="00:26:34.360" style="s2">separate and if we didn&#39;t do dairy that</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.139" end="00:26:36.250" style="s2">the land and of course it&#39;s all the best</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.360" end="00:26:39.460" style="s2">land in this country could basically</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.250" end="00:26:41.590" style="s2">refer back to wilderness because we</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.460" end="00:26:43.929" style="s2">don&#39;t need it the food that New Zealand</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.590" end="00:26:46.090" style="s2">exports is extremely expensive I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.929" end="00:26:48.070" style="s2">even Kiwis can&#39;t afford it so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.090" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">Bangladeshis definitely don&#39;t get any of</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.070" end="00:26:55.049" style="s2">it it&#39;s very high high-end very high</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:58.480" style="s2">margin niche products for rich people</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.049" end="00:27:00.100" style="s2">not for hungry people and so that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.480" end="00:27:02.889" style="s2">actual and and this is difficult for</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.100" end="00:27:06.129" style="s2">Kiwis sometimes the actual produce of</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.889" end="00:27:08.710" style="s2">New Zealand serves no genuine purpose on</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.129" end="00:27:10.269" style="s2">the world table it&#39;s only for rich</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.710" end="00:27:12.070" style="s2">people it&#39;s just to bring money into</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.269" end="00:27:13.629" style="s2">it&#39;s just to bring money and just just</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.070" end="00:27:15.340" style="s2">playing devil&#39;s advocate here I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.629" end="00:27:16.600" style="s2">obviously I&#39;m on the same team as you</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.340" end="00:27:17.679" style="s2">right but just just for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.600" end="00:27:20.940" style="s2">playing devil&#39;s advocate</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.679" end="00:27:23.320" style="s2">so what extent does the money that these</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.940" end="00:27:26.230" style="s2">that these trades generate and bring</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.320" end="00:27:27.909" style="s2">into the country allow New Zealanders to</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.230" end="00:27:29.909" style="s2">buy goods from overseas that they might</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.909" end="00:27:32.019" style="s2">not otherwise be able to acquire</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.909" end="00:27:33.820" style="s2">entirely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.019" end="00:27:37.669" style="s2">it&#39;s the only way we can do that and</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.820" end="00:27:39.799" style="s2">that&#39;s one once people get to that</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.669" end="00:27:41.179" style="s2">stage I tend to especially on the first</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.799" end="00:27:43.159" style="s2">conversation I tend to leave them alone</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.179" end="00:27:46.039" style="s2">because it&#39;s a great if you&#39;ve got that</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.159" end="00:27:47.899" style="s2">far then you&#39;re well on the work well on</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.039" end="00:27:49.159" style="s2">the road road to seeing that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.899" end="00:27:53.419" style="s2">to be better off without this money</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.159" end="00:27:55.700" style="s2">thing so and if it&#39;s a funny question</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.419" end="00:27:58.419" style="s2">actually I really always enjoy it what</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.700" end="00:28:00.440" style="s2">about our imports and exports and</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.419" end="00:28:02.179" style="s2">there&#39;s actually about eight different</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.440" end="00:28:04.459" style="s2">answers to that question and this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.179" end="00:28:08.329" style="s2">where the face-to-face conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.459" end="00:28:10.279" style="s2">so important because if you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.329" end="00:28:12.859" style="s2">to an older person will say well look in</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.279" end="00:28:14.359" style="s2">the 1950s when your when you came over</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.859" end="00:28:17.089" style="s2">or when you know when you were growing</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.359" end="00:28:19.190" style="s2">up we didn&#39;t have imports at all we had</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.089" end="00:28:21.289" style="s2">Morris minors came on a boat every eight</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.190" end="00:28:23.029" style="s2">weeks and if you were very well you</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.289" end="00:28:25.009" style="s2">could afford one but in fact we made</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.029" end="00:28:25.309" style="s2">everything that we need here how bad was</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.009" end="00:28:28.519" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.309" end="00:28:30.379" style="s2">and for an old person actually we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.519" end="00:28:32.599" style="s2">need all that crap at the warehouse and</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.379" end="00:28:34.429" style="s2">then these trying selling Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.599" end="00:28:37.209" style="s2">rubbish that goes straight to landfill</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.429" end="00:28:40.849" style="s2">we don&#39;t even need the imports anyway</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.209" end="00:28:42.919" style="s2">I&#39;m talking to I don&#39;t know what I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.849" end="00:28:44.479" style="s2">know what I mean for example electronic</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.919" end="00:28:45.919" style="s2">goods it would be a good one you just</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.479" end="00:28:47.149" style="s2">mentioned showing electronic goods I</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.919" end="00:28:49.190" style="s2">mean how much of that do you manufacture</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.149" end="00:28:51.289" style="s2">cuz I mean certainly in most of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.190" end="00:28:53.089" style="s2">Western world all of that manufacturing</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.289" end="00:28:56.089" style="s2">has been outsourced to Vietnam and Korea</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.089" end="00:28:57.320" style="s2">and China and so on you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.089" end="00:29:00.679" style="s2">know that we have the capability to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.320" end="00:29:02.269" style="s2">that shit anymore no but it&#39;s funny when</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.679" end="00:29:04.599" style="s2">you really talk to people they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.269" end="00:29:07.789" style="s2">even that sure if we want it anyway</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.599" end="00:29:11.419" style="s2">again especially on the west coast where</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.789" end="00:29:14.029" style="s2">well they don&#39;t have their laptops well</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.419" end="00:29:16.070" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of pushback because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.029" end="00:29:17.809" style="s2">not brought anything it&#39;s not boring</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.070" end="00:29:20.059" style="s2">anything tangible and it&#39;s not brought</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.809" end="00:29:21.679" style="s2">anything good and most people think or</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.059" end="00:29:23.659" style="s2">frequently I get it was better off</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.679" end="00:29:25.429" style="s2">before we had them loosely to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.659" end="00:29:27.200" style="s2">people looking down at they scream yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.429" end="00:29:29.269" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure I mean I&#39;m not you know I I</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.200" end="00:29:31.820" style="s2">have some sympathy for that view but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.269" end="00:29:35.629" style="s2">not sure that&#39;s gonna fly on a global</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.820" end="00:29:40.279" style="s2">scale I&#39;m pretty attached devices you</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.629" end="00:29:42.049" style="s2">know laptops and phones much as there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.279" end="00:29:43.579" style="s2">many awful things about in particularly</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.049" end="00:29:46.959" style="s2">in the social media sphere I mean these</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.579" end="00:29:49.489" style="s2">things also have the capacity to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.959" end="00:29:51.530" style="s2">incredibly powerful tools for good right</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.489" end="00:29:54.120" style="s2">for education major</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.530" end="00:29:56.460" style="s2">activity I mean they they they they can</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.120" end="00:29:59.160" style="s2">be incredibly powerful tools for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.460" end="00:30:01.020" style="s2">elevation of the of the spirit man they</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.160" end="00:30:02.670" style="s2">don&#39;t have to be destructive I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.020" end="00:30:05.309" style="s2">I agree they largely are right now but</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.670" end="00:30:07.460" style="s2">that&#39;s a false of the way we use them</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.309" end="00:30:10.110" style="s2">not of the not of the technology itself</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.460" end="00:30:13.050" style="s2">yeah yes then I&#39;ll say a leveraging of</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.110" end="00:30:15.030" style="s2">the negative aspects of our current</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.050" end="00:30:17.160" style="s2">system yeah exactly it&#39;s in their</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.030" end="00:30:18.840" style="s2">interest exactly to have us to have us</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.160" end="00:30:20.340" style="s2">jump every time a little message comes</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.840" end="00:30:22.210" style="s2">through because it might you know might</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.340" end="00:30:24.080" style="s2">be selling us something we want</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.210" end="00:30:26.340" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.080" end="00:30:33.870" style="s2">something that they can convince us that</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.340" end="00:30:35.460" style="s2">we want yeah so okay so as to two ways</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.870" end="00:30:41.690" style="s2">of thinking about that a third way is</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.460" end="00:30:45.330" style="s2">back in 1803 when New Zealand adopted</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.690" end="00:30:48.360" style="s2">enfranchisement voting for women they</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.330" end="00:30:49.140" style="s2">didn&#39;t worry about what the Saudis would</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.360" end="00:30:51.929" style="s2">make of it</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.140" end="00:30:54.890" style="s2">yeah they thought it was the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.929" end="00:30:57.030" style="s2">to do this is and I would absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.890" end="00:31:00.030" style="s2">especially in greymouth on the west</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.030" end="00:31:01.620" style="s2">coast actually and I yeah it&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.030" end="00:31:04.410" style="s2">other conversation which I&#39;m glad your</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.620" end="00:31:08.070" style="s2">manual this probably is the leading edge</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.410" end="00:31:12.390" style="s2">of human civilization here this place</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.070" end="00:31:15.120" style="s2">and so what we do may seem a bit out</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.390" end="00:31:18.929" style="s2">there too how she say less civilized</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.120" end="00:31:21.690" style="s2">countries but it may well be the right</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.929" end="00:31:25.830" style="s2">thing but we shouldn&#39;t wait for their</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.690" end="00:31:29.820" style="s2">approval before we do it and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.830" end="00:31:32.250" style="s2">like a spearhead of progress and there</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.820" end="00:31:35.550" style="s2">will be unanswered questions but in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.250" end="00:31:39.090" style="s2">short term we can manage without brand</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.550" end="00:31:41.309" style="s2">new iPhones you know and short term and</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.090" end="00:31:44.720" style="s2">I think because of the nature of change</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.309" end="00:31:48.770" style="s2">and also the exponential rate of</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.720" end="00:31:48.770" style="s2">acceleration of change</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.820" end="00:31:55.850" style="s2">even if the fact that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:58.610" style="s2">about this today means that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.850" end="00:32:00.590" style="s2">knock-on effect and just jumping forward</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.610" end="00:32:03.620" style="s2">for a minute if New Zealand went money</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.590" end="00:32:09.200" style="s2">free in September 2020 which is still my</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.620" end="00:32:12.950" style="s2">kind of favoured day actually for this I</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.200" end="00:32:16.280" style="s2">do and everything I do my experience and</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.950" end="00:32:19.130" style="s2">I don&#39;t do much else reinforces that but</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.280" end="00:32:21.500" style="s2">if that happens then Australia</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.130" end="00:32:24.440" style="s2">you know our nearest neighbor won&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:32:24.440" end="00:32:29.420" style="s2">happens and of course the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.990" end="00:32:31.400" style="s2">world is so intimately connected that</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.420" end="00:32:33.530" style="s2">when a positive change or indeed a</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.400" end="00:32:35.900" style="s2">negative one takes place in one place</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.530" end="00:32:37.250" style="s2">because of that technology it can be</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.900" end="00:32:40.550" style="s2">spread around the world very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.250" end="00:32:41.920" style="s2">just give it a quick example of you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.550" end="00:32:46.150" style="s2">talking about climate vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.920" end="00:32:48.590" style="s2">let&#39;s say everybody on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.150" end="00:32:51.110" style="s2">certainly anybody of anything like any</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.590" end="00:32:54.620" style="s2">sort of influence now is aware of</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.110" end="00:32:58.100" style="s2">climate vulnerability all eight billion</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.620" end="00:33:00.140" style="s2">people and that news has traveled around</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.100" end="00:33:04.490" style="s2">the world in you know probably half of</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.140" end="00:33:06.800" style="s2">our lifetimes or less yeah it&#39;s gone all</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.490" end="00:33:10.570" style="s2">around the world and that&#39;s some of the</p>

<p begin="00:33:10.570" end="00:33:15.770" style="s2">whereas the prospects of a</p>

<p begin="00:33:15.770" end="00:33:23.000" style="s2">best news that humanity has ever had in</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.700" end="00:33:25.100" style="s2">all of eternity so how long&#39;s that going</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.000" end="00:33:27.020" style="s2">to take to get around the world and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.100" end="00:33:28.730" style="s2">can&#39;t see the Australian saying don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.020" end="00:33:30.800" style="s2">know we like our capitalism it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.730" end="00:33:33.230" style="s2">great over here in New Zealand they&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:33:42.770" end="00:33:48.860" style="s2">overnight should we do that so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.340" end="00:33:51.740" style="s2">think the rest of 20 is what that&#39;s nine</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.860" end="00:33:53.810" style="s2">months from now that&#39;s nine months when</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.740" end="00:33:56.240" style="s2">I&#39;m in court I would love to wake up I</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.810" end="00:33:59.510" style="s2">love to wake up on the morning of when&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.240" end="00:34:03.490" style="s2">your election and this next one is</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.510" end="00:34:05.470" style="s2">October the 12th February 20</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.490" end="00:34:07.510" style="s2">20 I assumed you meant that was that was</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.470" end="00:34:10.629" style="s2">assumed that was a general election so</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.510" end="00:34:13.179" style="s2">why anyone depict that white why did you</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.629" end="00:34:16.720" style="s2">pick that particularly well it came out</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.179" end="00:34:19.690" style="s2">in a conversation with a group actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.720" end="00:34:23.139" style="s2">in an Auckland sort of summit that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.690" end="00:34:25.149" style="s2">had a couple of years ago and I loved</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.139" end="00:34:27.429" style="s2">graphs you know my background is in big</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.149" end="00:34:32.530" style="s2">aviation and engineering and aircraft</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.429" end="00:34:38.369" style="s2">operations excuse me and we do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.530" end="00:34:42.040" style="s2">trend plotting using graphs and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.369" end="00:34:44.110" style="s2">mathematical models to try and predict</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.040" end="00:34:46.690" style="s2">the future so we&#39;re trying to work out</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.110" end="00:34:48.369" style="s2">how long can that engines stay on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.690" end="00:34:50.139" style="s2">wing of that airliner before we have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.369" end="00:34:51.820" style="s2">pull it because of a crack in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.139" end="00:34:53.679" style="s2">turbine blade or a breakdown in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.820" end="00:34:55.179" style="s2">bearing you know you don&#39;t to pull it</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.679" end="00:34:57.430" style="s2">too early these are expenses a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.179" end="00:34:59.410" style="s2">kit but by the same token you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.430" end="00:35:02.020" style="s2">to pull it too late you don&#39;t want a</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.410" end="00:35:03.820" style="s2">neck so there&#39;s a lot of sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.020" end="00:35:07.360" style="s2">technology and it happens in all big</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.820" end="00:35:11.109" style="s2">industry you know ISO 9000 is all about</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.360" end="00:35:12.520" style="s2">trying to assure quality not just</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.109" end="00:35:17.290" style="s2">control quality but you know quality</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.520" end="00:35:22.300" style="s2">assurances so if trend plotting and what</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.290" end="00:35:25.900" style="s2">we&#39;ve been doing with both I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.300" end="00:35:29.100" style="s2">layer up some graphs now when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.900" end="00:35:32.050" style="s2">trotting trends of social breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.100" end="00:35:36.220" style="s2">mental health challenges environmental</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.050" end="00:35:39.280" style="s2">challenges all the things that are going</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.220" end="00:35:43.540" style="s2">wrong in the world and if you also at</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.280" end="00:35:47.980" style="s2">the same time plot the growing awareness</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.540" end="00:35:50.470" style="s2">of solutions then you see that they</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.980" end="00:35:51.910" style="s2">start to coincide at a point in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.470" end="00:35:54.100" style="s2">future and absolutely they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.910" end="00:35:55.900" style="s2">exponential and anytime you get near</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.100" end="00:35:58.359" style="s2">anything exponential it gets really</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.900" end="00:36:01.600" style="s2">exciting really quickly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.359" end="00:36:05.260" style="s2">and it&#39;s very very important that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.600" end="00:36:08.530" style="s2">don&#39;t use historical precedent to</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.260" end="00:36:10.810" style="s2">predict future rate of change hello yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.530" end="00:36:12.100" style="s2">no absolutely absolutely are you</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.810" end="00:36:15.850" style="s2">familiar with Terence Mckenna</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.100" end="00:36:17.339" style="s2">oh it sounds familiar but remind me he</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.850" end="00:36:20.039" style="s2">spent his life investigate</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.339" end="00:36:23.779" style="s2">seeing both personally and as a medical</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.039" end="00:36:25.979" style="s2">man the actions of psychedelics and</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.779" end="00:36:27.930" style="s2">towards the end of his life he gave an</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.979" end="00:36:30.150" style="s2">interview no but he was a really well</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.930" end="00:36:31.619" style="s2">respected I mean he was he was the man</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.150" end="00:36:34.769" style="s2">you know what I mean he was then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.619" end="00:36:36.829" style="s2">really articulate really funny you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.769" end="00:36:39.420" style="s2">it&#39;ll be really easy to listen to anyway</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.829" end="00:36:41.670" style="s2">he has this theory which he put forward</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.420" end="00:36:45.380" style="s2">shortly before he died that time itself</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.670" end="00:36:49.170" style="s2">is accelerating and by that he means</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.380" end="00:36:51.749" style="s2">that time what is time other than the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.170" end="00:36:55.349" style="s2">distance between events right you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.749" end="00:36:56.880" style="s2">did fine is punctuated by the example in</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.349" end="00:36:59.609" style="s2">time if there&#39;s nothing going on</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.880" end="00:37:04.859" style="s2">then there is no time right if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.609" end="00:37:08.579" style="s2">nothing happening if there&#39;s no saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.859" end="00:37:10.289" style="s2">is that as evolution proceeds more and</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.579" end="00:37:12.150" style="s2">more and more stuff goes on more and</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.289" end="00:37:13.890" style="s2">more levels of organization are reached</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.150" end="00:37:16.140" style="s2">more and more greater and greater</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.890" end="00:37:19.259" style="s2">complexity greater and greater novelty</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.140" end="00:37:21.599" style="s2">and so it&#39;s just more stuff going on</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.259" end="00:37:23.849" style="s2">right and there as a consequence time is</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.599" end="00:37:26.759" style="s2">speeding up and that is also an</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.849" end="00:37:28.259" style="s2">exponential thing and so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.759" end="00:37:29.279" style="s2">unfortunately this falls down a little</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.259" end="00:37:31.469" style="s2">bit because he was one of the believers</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.279" end="00:37:35.069" style="s2">in 2012 you know whatever it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.469" end="00:37:39.239" style="s2">December 2012 was gonna be the you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.069" end="00:37:41.369" style="s2">like some transformative transformative</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.239" end="00:37:43.950" style="s2">thing I mean I&#39;ve never had never bought</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.369" end="00:37:45.269" style="s2">into the sudden transformation thing you</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.950" end="00:37:46.499" style="s2">know what I mean like you wake up one</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.269" end="00:37:48.089" style="s2">morning and all of a sudden everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.499" end="00:37:50.069" style="s2">different I I&#39;ve never bought into that</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.089" end="00:37:52.829" style="s2">everything&#39;s a process right it may be a</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.069" end="00:37:55.640" style="s2">chaotic and messy and turbulent one but</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.829" end="00:38:02.910" style="s2">but nevertheless it&#39;s it&#39;s a process</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.640" end="00:38:04.229" style="s2">yeah the GR you you say you&#39;re from my</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.910" end="00:38:07.799" style="s2">knowledge of physics particularly</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.229" end="00:38:09.239" style="s2">chaotic systems transition from one</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.799" end="00:38:11.190" style="s2">equilibrium state to a different</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.239" end="00:38:15.239" style="s2">equilibrium state is not possible</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.190" end="00:38:19.920" style="s2">without a highly chaotic turbulent</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.239" end="00:38:21.660" style="s2">in-between phase so do you know that do</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.920" end="00:38:24.450" style="s2">you see the truth of this equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.660" end="00:38:28.109" style="s2">you know the money market equilibrium to</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.450" end="00:38:30.299" style="s2">an RBE tight equilibrium do you think</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.109" end="00:38:31.079" style="s2">that can be accomplished without a great</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.299" end="00:38:36.660" style="s2">deal of</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.079" end="00:38:37.339" style="s2">Yulin mess in the middle wow what a</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.660" end="00:38:42.180" style="s2">feast</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.339" end="00:38:44.969" style="s2">so I&#39;ll backtrack slightly to an</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.180" end="00:38:50.749" style="s2">interview I did here actually in 2012 on</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.969" end="00:38:55.499" style="s2">my birthday bizarrely with a very wise</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.749" end="00:38:58.459" style="s2">reporter from a newspaper and we they</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.499" end="00:39:02.099" style="s2">did a big article and on the money free</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.459" end="00:39:03.420" style="s2">proposal and she really liked it me I</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.099" end="00:39:04.619" style="s2">was really thrilled you know to get that</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.420" end="00:39:05.959" style="s2">much I&#39;ve got a big chunk of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.619" end="00:39:08.700" style="s2">newspaper it was fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.959" end="00:39:12.089" style="s2">my first decent outing in the press</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.700" end="00:39:13.950" style="s2">really um but and she liked the idea but</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.089" end="00:39:16.410" style="s2">she said I think it&#39;s gonna take a</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.950" end="00:39:16.979" style="s2">massive catastrophe Richard to bring</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.410" end="00:39:20.099" style="s2">this about</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.979" end="00:39:21.869" style="s2">and that bugged me I mean this is seven</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.099" end="00:39:25.229" style="s2">years ago that&#39;s between itching away at</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.869" end="00:39:28.410" style="s2">me for years but when I started working</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.229" end="00:39:30.180" style="s2">on the west coast I suppose about a year</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.410" end="00:39:31.650" style="s2">ago which is I mean it&#39;s only three</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.180" end="00:39:34.229" style="s2">hours drive from here we&#39;re right in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.650" end="00:39:36.269" style="s2">center of the South Island so right on</p>

<p begin="00:41:13.049" end="00:41:19.380" style="s2">ready for change and I think you see it</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.859" end="00:41:20.670" style="s2">was intrigued me as you&#39;ve said there</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.380" end="00:41:24.079" style="s2">needs to be a period of chaos between</p>

<p begin="00:41:27.029" end="00:41:36.479" style="s2">aren&#39;t we and so we already have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.599" end="00:41:40.769" style="s2">of experience and activity in the no</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.479" end="00:41:43.200" style="s2">money world anyway yeah because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.769" end="00:41:46.140" style="s2">charge our dog you know we don&#39;t charge</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.200" end="00:41:47.940" style="s2">our family for toilet paper and we do a</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.140" end="00:41:49.650" style="s2">lot of volunteer work in the community</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.940" end="00:41:52.349" style="s2">we if someone falls over in the street</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.650" end="00:41:54.599" style="s2">we just help them we go to libraries we</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.349" end="00:41:56.940" style="s2">don&#39;t own shopping trolleys we just use</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.599" end="00:41:59.279" style="s2">them and we take them back we hire cars</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.940" end="00:42:01.140" style="s2">we hire hotel rooms you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.279" end="00:42:04.769" style="s2">actually quite used to a sharing type</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.140" end="00:42:06.900" style="s2">economy and environment and in fact it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.769" end="00:42:10.140" style="s2">not as alien as it seems and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.900" end="00:42:11.729" style="s2">think it&#39;ll be a in fact I still have</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.140" end="00:42:13.859" style="s2">said this a long time ago I think that</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.729" end="00:42:17.009" style="s2">the transformation will be unopposed and</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.859" end="00:42:19.200" style="s2">it will be almost effortless actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.009" end="00:42:21.420" style="s2">and we&#39;ll just ease into it overnight</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.200" end="00:42:23.789" style="s2">and again we&#39;re going to be very careful</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.420" end="00:42:26.279" style="s2">using historical precedent of change to</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.789" end="00:42:28.559" style="s2">predict future change everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.279" end="00:42:31.440" style="s2">different in the 21st century and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.559" end="00:42:33.329" style="s2">know a revolution can be I think if</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.440" end="00:42:37.009" style="s2">Jacque fresco said a revolution of</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.329" end="00:42:40.049" style="s2">consciousness yeah it doesn&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.009" end="00:42:42.539" style="s2">of collapse before before the Venus</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.049" end="00:42:44.729" style="s2">Project or I&#39;ll be able will be yes but</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.539" end="00:42:46.769" style="s2">I think we seem quiet talking from the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.729" end="00:42:48.170" style="s2">perspective of history that you know big</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.769" end="00:42:51.119" style="s2">change has always been accompanied by</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.170" end="00:42:53.420" style="s2">chaos it collapse in the past I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.119" end="00:42:56.430" style="s2">being guided by history but more of an</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.420" end="00:42:58.060" style="s2">understanding of the nature of complex</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.430" end="00:43:01.870" style="s2">systems that they say you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.060" end="00:43:04.120" style="s2">complex systems defined as lots and lots</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.870" end="00:43:05.680" style="s2">of individual parts but whose behavior</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.120" end="00:43:07.570" style="s2">affects the other individual parts and</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.680" end="00:43:09.700" style="s2">human right is a perfect example of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.570" end="00:43:11.020" style="s2">complex system right they tend to settle</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.700" end="00:43:12.850" style="s2">down into their own a career and they</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.020" end="00:43:15.580" style="s2">find internal methods of organization</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.850" end="00:43:17.140" style="s2">amongst themselves right and and they</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.580" end="00:43:18.400" style="s2">settle down into an equilibrium state</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.140" end="00:43:20.080" style="s2">but they&#39;re capable of many many</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.400" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">different equilibrium states but move</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.080" end="00:43:27.130" style="s2">shifting from one to another always</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.960" end="00:43:29.140" style="s2">involves a transition through chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.130" end="00:43:31.630" style="s2">while you&#39;re in that chaos there is no</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.140" end="00:43:33.040" style="s2">way to predict what the next equity</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.630" end="00:43:35.080" style="s2">briam is going to look like you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.040" end="00:43:36.310" style="s2">what I mean now I know that we have</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.080" end="00:43:38.260" style="s2">agency and when we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.310" end="00:43:40.540" style="s2">purely physical systems like turbulent</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.260" end="00:43:42.520" style="s2">flow of air for example the individual</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.540" end="00:43:44.550" style="s2">particles in that flow there do not have</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.520" end="00:43:47.230" style="s2">agency they don&#39;t have you know the</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.550" end="00:43:49.060" style="s2">abilities whereas we know it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.230" end="00:43:52.990" style="s2">bit different but nevertheless on a mass</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.060" end="00:43:54.970" style="s2">scale that we are human society very</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.990" end="00:43:57.240" style="s2">much is a complex system and is</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.970" end="00:43:59.620" style="s2">therefore bound by the rules of them as</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.240" end="00:44:03.280" style="s2">explained but as explained by chaos</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.620" end="00:44:04.870" style="s2">theory yes yes however and I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.280" end="00:44:08.950" style="s2">said this before don&#39;t you think that</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.870" end="00:44:13.480" style="s2">that chaos because we are precipitating</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.950" end="00:44:16.080" style="s2">a change of mentality nothing else we</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.480" end="00:44:18.880" style="s2">just have to change our perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.080" end="00:44:20.950" style="s2">that chaotic period is actually where</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:22.540" style="s2">many people are now and some of us have</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.950" end="00:44:24.940" style="s2">been through earlier than others with</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.540" end="00:44:26.680" style="s2">our midlife crises that could be we</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.940" end="00:44:28.240" style="s2">could be in that chaotic period right</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.680" end="00:44:29.860" style="s2">now and I think I think actually make a</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.240" end="00:44:31.360" style="s2">very good point that could be exactly</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.860" end="00:44:34.710" style="s2">what the explanation is that we are in</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.360" end="00:44:37.150" style="s2">that right now and which is real I mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.710" end="00:44:41.710" style="s2">that&#39;s Trump that&#39;s brexit that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.150" end="00:44:43.360" style="s2">rise at the farm that&#39;s the political</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.710" end="00:44:45.250" style="s2">correctness and identity politics</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.360" end="00:44:47.080" style="s2">everywhere generally the inability of</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.250" end="00:44:49.420" style="s2">governments to respond to even the most</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.080" end="00:44:51.700" style="s2">basic needs of their people anymore yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.420" end="00:44:53.530" style="s2">Congress doesn&#39;t even try and pretend to</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.700" end="00:44:55.150" style="s2">actually represent the people the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.530" end="00:44:57.010" style="s2">anyway give it up even on the pretense</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.150" end="00:44:59.500" style="s2">of it you know I mean you know it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.010" end="00:45:00.820" style="s2">so yeah I think I think I think you</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.500" end="00:45:02.020" style="s2">actually may very well even though it</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.820" end="00:45:05.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t feel like it because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.020" end="00:45:07.890" style="s2">talking about you know one human life or</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.320" end="00:45:11.110" style="s2">a decade or whatever in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.890" end="00:45:11.559" style="s2">evolutionary time of civilization is is</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.110" end="00:45:13.329" style="s2">nothing</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.559" end="00:45:14.680" style="s2">right and so yeah you&#39;re absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.329" end="00:45:16.089" style="s2">right that&#39;s exactly what it is we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.680" end="00:45:18.939" style="s2">that period of chaos right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.089" end="00:45:20.979" style="s2">yeah I mean a lot of people know the</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.939" end="00:45:22.479" style="s2">next if this equilibrium is broken down</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.979" end="00:45:23.799" style="s2">we&#39;re in a period of chaos we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.479" end="00:45:26.650" style="s2">what the next one&#39;s gonna look like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.799" end="00:45:28.689" style="s2">no no and a lot of people were obviously</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.650" end="00:45:31.779" style="s2">Everett very evidently actually in</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.689" end="00:45:34.779" style="s2">different places in that chaotic period</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.779" end="00:45:39.189" style="s2">so it is like a mass upheaval of</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.779" end="00:45:41.499" style="s2">humanity with effectively you know the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.189" end="00:45:44.849" style="s2">blood and the carnage and the burning</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.499" end="00:45:48.039" style="s2">and the fighting of a conventional</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.849" end="00:45:50.650" style="s2">revolution slash invasion slash</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.039" end="00:45:52.779" style="s2">insurrection but it&#39;s taking place in</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.650" end="00:45:56.079" style="s2">our heads isn&#39;t it and so people are</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.779" end="00:46:00.999" style="s2">depressed and frustrated and violent and</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.079" end="00:46:05.559" style="s2">alcoholic and dysfunctional because of</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.999" end="00:46:06.969" style="s2">that internal what they haven&#39;t gone</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.559" end="00:46:09.009" style="s2">through the revolution yet so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.969" end="00:46:12.759" style="s2">still in the fighting pitchforks burning</p>

<p begin="00:48:51.850" end="00:48:59.080" style="s2">institutions the blue church is unable</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.940" end="00:49:00.490" style="s2">to cope with the need with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.080" end="00:49:02.710" style="s2">circumstances of the new world things</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.490" end="00:49:04.660" style="s2">just changing so quickly and in</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.710" end="00:49:08.380" style="s2">opposition to the blue church is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.660" end="00:49:10.540" style="s2">Reds or the Reds</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.380" end="00:49:12.580" style="s2">religion that&#39;s it the red religion is</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.540" end="00:49:14.950" style="s2">of is in opposition so we are part of</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.580" end="00:49:17.770" style="s2">the religion right so the red religion</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.950" end="00:49:19.390" style="s2">is this urgency which is coming about</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.770" end="00:49:20.890" style="s2">and it&#39;s manifesting in all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.390" end="00:49:23.230" style="s2">different ways and the insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.890" end="00:49:25.630" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have that doesn&#39;t wield the</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.230" end="00:49:27.400" style="s2">power of the blue church right the blue</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.630" end="00:49:28.780" style="s2">church still controls all the money all</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.400" end="00:49:31.270" style="s2">the political institutions all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.780" end="00:49:32.950" style="s2">weaponry nor I mean that&#39;s still the new</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.270" end="00:49:34.960" style="s2">church but what the red surgeons what</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.950" end="00:49:37.030" style="s2">the radius urgency has is the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.960" end="00:49:38.260" style="s2">move quickly and adapt quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.030" end="00:49:40.390" style="s2">change quickly</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.260" end="00:49:43.080" style="s2">we pop up one place and the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.390" end="00:49:45.970" style="s2">in its cumbersome slow but powerful way</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.080" end="00:49:47.830" style="s2">stamps on that but before we long before</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.970" end="00:49:49.540" style="s2">that&#39;s happened is popped up over here</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.830" end="00:49:52.780" style="s2">it&#39;s like whack-a-mole you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.540" end="00:49:55.240" style="s2">mean the blue church can win this game</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.780" end="00:49:58.210" style="s2">in the long run but at the moment the</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.240" end="00:49:59.710" style="s2">blue church still holds all the all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.210" end="00:50:01.570" style="s2">big weapons you know what I mean both</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.710" end="00:50:04.270" style="s2">literal and metaphorical the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.570" end="00:50:06.190" style="s2">still holds only weapons and and then I</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.270" end="00:50:10.300" style="s2">really like this analysis that feels to</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.190" end="00:50:11.830" style="s2">me like you know the red insurgency must</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.300" end="00:50:13.830" style="s2">inevitably win right cuz it&#39;s the new</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.830" end="00:50:16.120" style="s2">thing you know and you know it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.830" end="00:50:18.130" style="s2">evilly the the the the the red</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.120" end="00:50:21.040" style="s2">insurgency must win and the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.130" end="00:50:23.050" style="s2">has no hope of once and for all finally</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.040" end="00:50:25.770" style="s2">forever stamping out the red insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.050" end="00:50:28.450" style="s2">it can&#39;t be done right and so however</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.770" end="00:50:30.520" style="s2">strongly it tries to repress it sooner</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.450" end="00:50:32.020" style="s2">or later it must come through and as I</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.520" end="00:50:34.780" style="s2">say that feels to me to be a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.020" end="00:50:37.630" style="s2">accurate analysis of where we are right</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.780" end="00:50:40.930" style="s2">now yeah yeah yeah I&#39;ve written it down</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.630" end="00:50:42.750" style="s2">I&#39;ll look him up he sounds good again</p>

<p begin="00:50:48.640" end="00:50:54.790" style="s2">different it is to anywhere else in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.620" end="00:50:56.560" style="s2">world actually and when it comes to I</p>

<p begin="00:53:00.320" end="00:53:09.350" style="s2">stumbled upon a 1980s Prime Minister&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.640" end="00:53:12.890" style="s2">autobiography in a free stall actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.350" end="00:53:15.020" style="s2">so wasn&#39;t widely read but but I like</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.890" end="00:53:17.930" style="s2">reading political history especially</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.020" end="00:53:21.020" style="s2">when it&#39;s kind of pint-sized you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.930" end="00:53:23.090" style="s2">and so I started me on a bit of a train</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.020" end="00:53:25.160" style="s2">and when you start talking Prime</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.090" end="00:53:26.930" style="s2">Minister Bill rolling for example he</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.160" end="00:53:31.370" style="s2">used to teach in the village school here</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.930" end="00:53:33.519" style="s2">that kind of thing I&#39;ve met of we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.370" end="00:53:37.089" style="s2">only lived here 15 years I&#39;ve personally</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.519" end="00:53:40.769" style="s2">mate - 2 or 3 sorry Prime Minister&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.089" end="00:53:43.149" style="s2">I mean who the heck am I you know and</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.769" end="00:53:45.399" style="s2">I&#39;ve frequently been on stage with</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.149" end="00:53:47.769" style="s2">cabinet ministers and things and they</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.399" end="00:53:49.749" style="s2">are very accessible and you know that</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.769" end="00:53:52.229" style="s2">our children go to the same schools that</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.749" end="00:53:57.939" style="s2">kind of thing it&#39;s very very important</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.229" end="00:53:59.439" style="s2">and reading these books by and about the</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.939" end="00:54:01.689" style="s2">Prime Minister&#39;s it occurred to me that</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.439" end="00:54:02.949" style="s2">a the person that wrote them if it</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.689" end="00:54:06.130" style="s2">wasn&#39;t autobiographical</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.949" end="00:54:07.749" style="s2">knew them extremely well and had lived</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.130" end="00:54:09.429" style="s2">kind of alongside them for their whole</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.749" end="00:54:10.899" style="s2">life whereas I bet there&#39;s a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.429" end="00:54:12.429" style="s2">books about Margaret Thatcher written by</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.899" end="00:54:15.669" style="s2">people who probably weren&#39;t even alive</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.429" end="00:54:17.829" style="s2">when she was in power there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.669" end="00:54:22.359" style="s2">detachment but what I really loved about</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.829" end="00:54:24.880" style="s2">it again was the common theme that they</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.359" end="00:54:28.769" style="s2">all talked about the same people and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.880" end="00:54:31.839" style="s2">same incidents and the same cities and</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.769" end="00:54:34.299" style="s2">that you could see a direct cause and</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.839" end="00:54:36.789" style="s2">effect to things like the anti-nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.299" end="00:54:41.709" style="s2">rigid legislation the anti-apartheid</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.789" end="00:54:44.589" style="s2">movement things that actually change</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.709" end="00:54:47.559" style="s2">history for this country can be traced</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.589" end="00:54:50.229" style="s2">back to conversations and activities</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.559" end="00:54:52.509" style="s2">that took place amongst people that are</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.229" end="00:54:54.939" style="s2">accessible and that truly exists and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.509" end="00:54:58.089" style="s2">that live there now and so suddenly you</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.939" end="00:55:03.189" style="s2">realize that the whole thing is actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.089" end="00:55:05.619" style="s2">still controllable by a logical rational</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.189" end="00:55:07.839" style="s2">means whereas I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.619" end="00:55:10.479" style="s2">legislation under let&#39;s say anti-hunting</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.839" end="00:55:12.549" style="s2">legislation in the UK you know why did</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.479" end="00:55:15.519" style="s2">that really come about you know is it</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.549" end="00:55:18.369" style="s2">pressure from overseas or from the</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.519" end="00:55:21.130" style="s2">judiciary or from the people or from</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.369" end="00:55:28.599" style="s2">vested interests in Europe I mean who</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.130" end="00:55:30.429" style="s2">can say why things happen yeah and yet</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.599" end="00:55:32.759" style="s2">all the people&#39;s angst and all that</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.429" end="00:55:32.759" style="s2">misery</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.239" end="00:55:37.749" style="s2">the reality is 95% of the population</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.279" end="00:55:40.689" style="s2">don&#39;t really give a shit you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.749" end="00:55:44.079" style="s2">mean not affect them directly don&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.689" end="00:55:47.430" style="s2">a shit yeah yeah but but it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.079" end="00:55:50.069" style="s2">example of how political correct</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.430" end="00:55:51.329" style="s2">and mobilize large numbers of people</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.069" end="00:55:52.849" style="s2">because you know most the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.329" end="00:55:55.470" style="s2">demonstrating on one side or the other</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.849" end="00:55:56.640" style="s2">have no direct connection to hunting at</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.470" end="00:55:58.859" style="s2">all you know what I mean it&#39;s an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.640" end="00:56:00.779" style="s2">of an ideological position they take and</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.859" end="00:56:03.390" style="s2">it&#39;s not based in their own personal</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.779" end="00:56:06.029" style="s2">experiences or whatever you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.390" end="00:56:12.510" style="s2">just all hunting is evil all people who</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.029" end="00:56:16.140" style="s2">want to ban hunting our evil what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.510" end="00:56:17.910" style="s2">what&#39;s the 5g situation like in New</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.140" end="00:56:20.430" style="s2">Zealand are they are they talking about</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.910" end="00:56:23.099" style="s2">5g they&#39;re they talking about cuz I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.430" end="00:56:25.260" style="s2">New Zealand in many ways would be an</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.099" end="00:56:26.760" style="s2">ideal place for right I feel populations</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.260" end="00:56:28.589" style="s2">in one sissy that&#39;s all you&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.760" end="00:56:30.839" style="s2">gotta cover is Auckland you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.589" end="00:56:34.770" style="s2">more than half your population down in</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.839" end="00:56:36.990" style="s2">there well if I can start with yo yes</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.770" end="00:56:41.130" style="s2">it&#39;s just such a hotbed here as well for</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.990" end="00:56:45.450" style="s2">fuck&#39;s sake it&#39;s so ridiculous but if I</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.130" end="00:56:47.369" style="s2">can start with broadband because you</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.450" end="00:56:51.270" style="s2">know we had dial-up internet in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.369" end="00:56:53.809" style="s2">early days and then the National which</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.270" end="00:56:56.670" style="s2">was a conservative right-wing government</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.809" end="00:57:00.900" style="s2">decided that we should have broadband</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.670" end="00:57:03.210" style="s2">and it was going to be expensive because</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.900" end="00:57:05.750" style="s2">of our population you know the way they</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.210" end="00:57:08.670" style="s2">spread out the geography and everything</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.750" end="00:57:10.559" style="s2">so the only way to pay for it and I had</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.670" end="00:57:12.619" style="s2">this argument with a serving cabinet</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.559" end="00:57:15.029" style="s2">minister in public on a public stage</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.619" end="00:57:20.010" style="s2">saying that they had to sell off our</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.029" end="00:57:22.079" style="s2">public utilities the airline and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.010" end="00:57:25.020" style="s2">electricity generating and transmission</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.079" end="00:57:26.430" style="s2">companies to pay for superfast broadband</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.020" end="00:57:30.270" style="s2">because we&#39;ve got to stay competitive</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.430" end="00:57:32.039" style="s2">with the rest of the world and I said at</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.270" end="00:57:35.309" style="s2">the time and I think I was quite proud</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.039" end="00:57:37.049" style="s2">of it you know off-the-cuff profound</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.309" end="00:57:38.849" style="s2">statement that superfast broadband is</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.049" end="00:57:42.599" style="s2">that actually it&#39;s merely a Trojan horse</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.849" end="00:57:44.849" style="s2">to ensure that every little girl on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.599" end="00:57:46.589" style="s2">west coast of this country who we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.849" end="00:57:49.079" style="s2">traditionally people have gone to escape</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.589" end="00:57:51.089" style="s2">this kind of thing she will have a smart</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.079" end="00:57:53.250" style="s2">device in her pocket so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.089" end="00:57:55.710" style="s2">skipping around the field barefoot in a</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.250" end="00:58:01.730" style="s2">dress she will now be checking on her</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.710" end="00:58:01.730" style="s2">makeup her teeth her body shape her hair</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.230" end="00:58:07.220" style="s2">the Beast will get to everybody and it</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.300" end="00:58:09.290" style="s2">has you know and it&#39;s horrific and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.220" end="00:58:11.240" style="s2">think 5g is just more of the same you</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.290" end="00:58:13.849" style="s2">know and yeah of course even more</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.240" end="00:58:15.890" style="s2">intrusive yeah well yeah but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.849" end="00:58:18.940" style="s2">radiation issues with 5gm it&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.890" end="00:58:21.230" style="s2">different bandwidth to previous is</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.940" end="00:58:23.380" style="s2">connectivity to previous communications</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.230" end="00:58:25.700" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah it&#39;s a much much shorter</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.380" end="00:58:28.130" style="s2">free it&#39;s a much much shorter wavelength</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.700" end="00:58:32.089" style="s2">of radiation that they&#39;re using and</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.130" end="00:58:33.710" style="s2">there has been zero testing of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.089" end="00:58:35.900" style="s2">effects of this radio they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.710" end="00:58:36.980" style="s2">rolling it out not having tested it at</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.900" end="00:58:38.990" style="s2">all and they&#39;re a lot of listen I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.980" end="00:58:41.599" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know I I haven&#39;t only</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.990" end="00:58:43.880" style="s2">testing I haven&#39;t even seen any data but</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.599" end="00:58:46.010" style="s2">it seems to me entirely reasonable that</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.880" end="00:58:48.200" style="s2">testing should be done before a system</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.010" end="00:58:50.060" style="s2">like this is rolled out that that in</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.200" end="00:58:52.579" style="s2">principle seems entirely reasonable to</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.060" end="00:58:55.520" style="s2">me yeah I&#39;m got time to test have they</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.579" end="00:58:57.589" style="s2">in the modern marketplace Russia&#39;s 4G</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.520" end="00:59:00.380" style="s2">seems pretty alright to me I mean I live</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.589" end="00:59:01.760" style="s2">on I don&#39;t have a hard-line internet</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.380" end="00:59:04.880" style="s2">connection you know I live entirely on</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.760" end="00:59:07.220" style="s2">4G and it&#39;s fine it&#39;s fine you get the</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.880" end="00:59:09.680" style="s2">occasional bad patch you know to me but</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.220" end="00:59:11.990" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely fine so I don&#39;t see what</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.680" end="00:59:13.609" style="s2">the Russians with 5g fortunately I</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.990" end="00:59:15.109" style="s2">fucking know where they&#39;re not gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.609" end="00:59:17.900" style="s2">put you might be here for a very long</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.109" end="00:59:19.130" style="s2">time is not the population I mean awful</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.900" end="00:59:21.140" style="s2">people here don&#39;t have internet access</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.130" end="00:59:23.420" style="s2">as it is the average age is like 65</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.140" end="00:59:24.619" style="s2">after people here at least half of</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.420" end="00:59:27.230" style="s2">people here don&#39;t have internet</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.619" end="00:59:29.839" style="s2">connections as it is yeah yeah fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.230" end="00:59:32.329" style="s2">however be careful because I I&#39;ve quoted</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.839" end="00:59:35.240" style="s2">in the past that you know in many parts</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.329" end="00:59:37.130" style="s2">of remote Africa they got coca-cola and</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.240" end="00:59:40.130" style="s2">Marlboro a long time before they got</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.130" end="00:59:42.349" style="s2">medicine and water you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.130" end="00:59:45.079" style="s2">the tentacles of the monetary system</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.349" end="00:59:46.640" style="s2">reach a very very long way yeah but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.079" end="00:59:48.589" style="s2">easy and cheap to deliver Marlboros and</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.640" end="00:59:50.480" style="s2">coca-cola it&#39;s not easy and she blew the</p>

<p begin="01:02:38.729" end="01:02:43.419" style="s2">ridiculous balancing act that in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.679" end="01:02:46.150" style="s2">resource-based economy&#39; world we do not</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.419" end="01:02:48.339" style="s2">have to play anymore you just tell the</p>

<p begin="01:02:50.349" end="01:02:55.619" style="s2">even difficult and I was astounded the</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.779" end="01:02:58.150" style="s2">very first public outing I made at a</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.619" end="01:03:03.069" style="s2">mayoral level when I was contesting</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.150" end="01:03:04.719" style="s2">their nelson mayoral tee in 2013 and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.069" end="01:03:07.539" style="s2">had a lovely prepared speech and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.719" end="01:03:08.799" style="s2">mayor candidates got 5 minutes and 450</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.539" end="01:03:10.749" style="s2">people in the audience I mean I was</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.799" end="01:03:12.339" style="s2">shitting myself but this is great right</p>

<p begin="01:03:12.339" end="01:03:15.669" style="s2">and how it&#39;s going to work in a</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.989" end="01:03:18.339" style="s2">resource-based economy and I discovered</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.669" end="01:03:20.609" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s amazing how you can lose and</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.339" end="01:03:23.529" style="s2">win in the same few minutes but I</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.609" end="01:03:26.229" style="s2">discovered that scripted speeches with</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.529" end="01:03:28.419" style="s2">this kind of material do not work we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.229" end="01:03:30.909" style="s2">not teaching people anything new weirdy</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.419" end="01:03:32.559" style="s2">brainwashing them and so everyone&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.909" end="01:03:34.089" style="s2">their own custom brainwash and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.559" end="01:03:36.459" style="s2">got to look them in the eye and have a</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.089" end="01:03:39.549" style="s2">conversation of some sort and figure out</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.459" end="01:03:41.890" style="s2">where are you stuck with this what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.549" end="01:03:43.539" style="s2">your personal hang-up with what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.890" end="01:03:46.209" style="s2">proposing because everyone&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.539" end="01:03:49.989" style="s2">different version so my scripted speech</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.209" end="01:03:53.019" style="s2">was rubbish but when it came to the</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.989" end="01:03:54.699" style="s2">questions and answers this big audience</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.019" end="01:03:57.729" style="s2">had a lot of questions about health care</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.699" end="01:04:02.019" style="s2">about violence about alcohol in society</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.729" end="01:04:03.939" style="s2">about jobs pollution I realized that I</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.019" end="01:04:05.829" style="s2">had the easiest job of all and</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.939" end="01:04:07.959" style="s2">authorized them by far the least</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.829" end="01:04:08.619" style="s2">experienced of the four candidates for</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.959" end="01:04:10.959" style="s2">the mayoralty</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.619" end="01:04:13.119" style="s2">I was able to genuinely put my hand up</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.959" end="01:04:15.939" style="s2">for every single question from the</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.119" end="01:04:18.759" style="s2">audience immediately without even having</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.939" end="01:04:21.159" style="s2">to think yeah start thinking in</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.759" end="01:04:23.979" style="s2">money-free terms suddenly every problem</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.159" end="01:04:26.679" style="s2">we&#39;ve got becomes easily soluble yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.979" end="01:04:29.169" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re free money you&#39;re free to</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.679" end="01:04:30.640" style="s2">think in terms of like Jacque fresco</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.169" end="01:04:32.140" style="s2">said right you&#39;re free to think in terms</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.640" end="01:04:33.279" style="s2">of do we have the technology do we have</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.140" end="01:04:34.779" style="s2">the resources do we have the manpower</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.279" end="01:04:37.589" style="s2">yes right let&#39;s do it</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.779" end="01:04:37.589" style="s2">ok</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.470" end="01:04:44.040" style="s2">not is this interest going to be upset</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.780" end="01:04:46.540" style="s2">are they gonna let us do it are we able</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.040" end="01:04:49.980" style="s2">financing reissue the bronze blah blah</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.540" end="01:04:52.540" style="s2">blah blah all of that gone gone</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.980" end="01:04:56.560" style="s2">advocates of money however would say</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.540" end="01:05:00.760" style="s2">that the necessity to raise finance for</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.560" end="01:05:11.410" style="s2">a project is a effective barrier to bad</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.760" end="01:05:15.720" style="s2">projects not being undertaken with</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.410" end="01:05:15.720" style="s2">historical precedent prove that theory</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.750" end="01:05:21.099" style="s2">how many good projects have been</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.800" end="01:05:22.990" style="s2">undertaken yeah I would say I guess now</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.099" end="01:05:25.660" style="s2">we have the scientific method to it and</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.990" end="01:05:28.800" style="s2">at the end of the day you you know even</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.660" end="01:05:31.780" style="s2">the most charismatic brilliant</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.800" end="01:05:33.970" style="s2">inspirational leader is not going to get</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.780" end="01:05:39.480" style="s2">much of a project together if it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.970" end="01:05:42.670" style="s2">suit the community that it involves and</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.480" end="01:05:45.190" style="s2">I would say yeah I guess you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.670" end="01:05:47.560" style="s2">into a degree in that the money filters</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.190" end="01:05:49.480" style="s2">out the crap projects yeah people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.560" end="01:05:50.830" style="s2">invested something I think is shit right</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.480" end="01:05:52.750" style="s2">because they&#39;re not gonna risk for their</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.830" end="01:05:55.570" style="s2">money on it and so it&#39;s a good barrier</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.750" end="01:05:56.859" style="s2">to shit not not happening unless it</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.570" end="01:06:00.520" style="s2">makes money in which case shit will</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.859" end="01:06:03.849" style="s2">happen anyway well that&#39;s the thing shit</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.520" end="01:06:07.240" style="s2">means now change will not make money no</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.849" end="01:06:08.380" style="s2">absolutely absolutely right yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.240" end="01:06:11.970" style="s2">that&#39;s the beauty of the resource-based</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.380" end="01:06:14.170" style="s2">economy because now you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.970" end="01:06:18.520" style="s2">self-referencing automated process</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.170" end="01:06:20.890" style="s2">whereby a the technology assists in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.520" end="01:06:22.780" style="s2">project so no one has to mix concrete by</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.890" end="01:06:24.160" style="s2">hand no one has to dig holes no one has</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.780" end="01:06:26.380" style="s2">to hammer nails in anymore</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.160" end="01:06:28.060" style="s2">I&#39;ve got amazing technology to do that</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.380" end="01:06:29.710" style="s2">so that&#39;s all easy if we want to do</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.060" end="01:06:32.680" style="s2">something too easy but you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.710" end="01:06:34.240" style="s2">gonna need the time so buying I have to</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.680" end="01:06:38.250" style="s2">look for a better better worth the</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.240" end="01:06:40.930" style="s2">investment still need a better word the</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.250" end="01:06:43.030" style="s2">these money this money thing goes deep</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.930" end="01:06:46.119" style="s2">you still need the involvement of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.030" end="01:06:47.500" style="s2">humans to make it actually - operation</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.119" end="01:06:49.540" style="s2">you still need the ability for people to</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.500" end="01:06:50.540" style="s2">cooperate collaborate and cooperate on a</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.540" end="01:06:52.770" style="s2">large scale</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.540" end="01:06:55.140" style="s2">still gonna need to build things like</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.770" end="01:06:58.080" style="s2">bridges and tunnel</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.140" end="01:07:02.340" style="s2">absolutely hospitals and well maybe</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.080" end="01:07:03.990" style="s2">airports but you know the the roads yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.340" end="01:07:05.460" style="s2">whatever whatever it might be you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.990" end="01:07:07.440" style="s2">there are large-scale projects which</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.460" end="01:07:11.010" style="s2">still need to be undertaken and which</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.440" end="01:07:12.900" style="s2">affects people over a large area you</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.010" end="01:07:14.670" style="s2">know what I mean and benefit people over</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.900" end="01:07:16.380" style="s2">a large area but then there are also</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.670" end="01:07:19.140" style="s2">people it doesn&#39;t affect and doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.380" end="01:07:20.610" style="s2">benefit and so I mean this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.140" end="01:07:22.950" style="s2">where I get a little bit confused and</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.610" end="01:07:24.390" style="s2">this is where I personally maybe I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:07:24.390" end="01:07:32.150" style="s2">see it I personally have a problem with</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.750" end="01:07:34.950" style="s2">detailed transition plans because I</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.150" end="01:07:36.090" style="s2">don&#39;t know part of me I guess it goes</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.950" end="01:07:37.800" style="s2">back to what I was saying before about</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.090" end="01:07:38.970" style="s2">transiting from one equilibrium to</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.800" end="01:07:40.290" style="s2">another means that you go through a</p>

<p begin="01:19:06.520" end="01:19:10.510" style="s2">got a very valuable real contribution to</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.800" end="01:19:12.250" style="s2">making you&#39;re quite right to say that in</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.510" end="01:19:14.260" style="s2">many cases they are actually the best</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.250" end="01:19:16.660" style="s2">and the brightest dollars who go into</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.260" end="01:19:18.910" style="s2">these fields and that it would do well</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.660" end="01:19:21.880" style="s2">to harness that harness those energies</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.910" end="01:19:23.470" style="s2">and intelligence for yeah for better</p>

<p begin="01:19:24.910" end="01:19:30.490" style="s2">understand why you are so successful at</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.760" end="01:19:32.380" style="s2">this because you you look to find the</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.490" end="01:19:36.040" style="s2">best you know you look to find the best</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.380" end="01:19:38.320" style="s2">in people don&#39;t see everyone as an asset</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.040" end="01:19:40.960" style="s2">rather than an enemy it&#39;s so rewarding</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.320" end="01:19:42.340" style="s2">you know because it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.960" end="01:19:45.490" style="s2">win-win you know you can&#39;t really go</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.340" end="01:19:47.020" style="s2">wrong with that yeah it seems to every</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.490" end="01:19:48.050" style="s2">every conversation seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.020" end="01:19:50.510" style="s2">positively</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.050" end="01:19:52.850" style="s2">tributing you know rather than goodies</p>

<p begin="01:19:52.850" end="01:19:57.620" style="s2">and it probably is a bit naive but I do</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.460" end="01:20:00.230" style="s2">see everybody is just victims of this</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.620" end="01:20:03.920" style="s2">system yeah we&#39;ve all become horribly</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.230" end="01:20:06.200" style="s2">corrupted by it but and especially again</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.920" end="01:20:08.750" style="s2">sorry on the west coast where everyone</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.200" end="01:20:11.570" style="s2">has such a recent or relevant experience</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.750" end="01:20:15.800" style="s2">of tragedy their humanity is that much</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.570" end="01:20:16.760" style="s2">closer to the surface and you really</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.800" end="01:20:18.380" style="s2">don&#39;t have to talk to somebody</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.760" end="01:20:21.380" style="s2">especially if you are sincere and</p>

<p begin="01:26:46.340" end="01:26:51.870" style="s2">ability to speak about it in public</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.250" end="01:26:56.280" style="s2">right yeah and so you&#39;ve gotta balance</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.870" end="01:26:57.719" style="s2">these two things so to what extent no</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.280" end="01:27:01.350" style="s2">let me slightly rephrase that how</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.719" end="01:27:03.510" style="s2">seriously are you taking the first part</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.350" end="01:27:07.620" style="s2">of that you know your mayoral duties to</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.510" end="01:27:11.969" style="s2">the citizens of your town yeah okay I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.620" end="01:27:13.679" style="s2">known quite a few mayors and we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.969" end="01:27:16.410" style="s2">greatest respect to a large degree is a</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.679" end="01:27:18.120" style="s2">ceremonial role right they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.410" end="01:27:20.940" style="s2">actually have that much executive</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.120" end="01:27:23.730" style="s2">authority then another board of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.940" end="01:27:25.620" style="s2">council kind of thing yes you are but</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.730" end="01:27:27.390" style="s2">you&#39;re only the chairman and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.620" end="01:27:29.580" style="s2">have a special casting vote you have the</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.390" end="01:27:31.710" style="s2">same valid validity vote as the other</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.580" end="01:27:34.410" style="s2">councillors who are all elected who are</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.710" end="01:27:35.850" style="s2">most definitely well embedded locals and</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.410" end="01:27:40.400" style="s2">you don&#39;t have any influence at tabling</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.850" end="01:27:40.400" style="s2">the contents of what&#39;s being discussed</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.489" end="01:27:45.449" style="s2">especially here it&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.600" end="01:27:47.790" style="s2">transparent people are very interested</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.449" end="01:27:50.610" style="s2">in council activities here I&#39;d say much</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.790" end="01:27:53.160" style="s2">more so in the UK again everybody knows</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.610" end="01:27:59.219" style="s2">everybody it&#39;s all much more local much</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.160" end="01:28:01.710" style="s2">more familiar with everybody and so the</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.219" end="01:28:03.420" style="s2">mayoral role there&#39;s not yeah I mean you</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.710" end="01:28:04.890" style="s2">get access to things that you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.420" end="01:28:06.510" style="s2">otherwise so when you say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.890" end="01:28:08.100" style="s2">ceremonial are you are you sort of</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.510" end="01:28:09.719" style="s2">saying that you have no more power than</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.100" end="01:28:11.160" style="s2">any other councillor kind of thing is</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.719" end="01:28:13.320" style="s2">that what you&#39;re saying or they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.160" end="01:28:15.570" style="s2">even have as much power as a normal</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.320" end="01:28:17.760" style="s2">councillor now you have the same power</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.570" end="01:28:19.590" style="s2">as a normal councillor but not much more</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.760" end="01:28:21.780" style="s2">only because of your probably more like</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.590" end="01:28:24.480" style="s2">to be on the radio or get quoted in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.780" end="01:28:26.250" style="s2">paper or go to conferences because</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.480" end="01:28:28.620" style="s2">you&#39;re mayor but you don&#39;t actually get</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.250" end="01:28:29.880" style="s2">to make any decisions by yourself okay</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.620" end="01:28:31.260" style="s2">and of course I don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.880" end="01:28:33.420" style="s2">anything about local government you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.260" end="01:28:34.110" style="s2">to be bluntly honest it&#39;s just no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.420" end="01:28:36.239" style="s2">done this before</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.110" end="01:28:37.739" style="s2">an American mayor where you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.239" end="01:28:39.719" style="s2">allocating the resort</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.739" end="01:28:43.530" style="s2">to your police department in schools and</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.719" end="01:28:45.840" style="s2">so on you know not at all and in terms</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.530" end="01:28:47.790" style="s2">of democratic I would say this is</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.840" end="01:28:49.290" style="s2">probably the most democratic country in</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.790" end="01:28:52.890" style="s2">the world you know that kind of thing is</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.290" end="01:28:55.860" style="s2">fiercely defended and very transparent</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.890" end="01:28:58.920" style="s2">and yeah as about as good as you could</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.860" end="01:29:02.010" style="s2">do it actually know there&#39;s an old boy</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.920" end="01:29:04.650" style="s2">network but for the most part it worked</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.010" end="01:29:05.880" style="s2">fairly well actually but that&#39;s changing</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.650" end="01:29:06.210" style="s2">because the old boys don&#39;t know what to</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.880" end="01:29:08.670" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.210" end="01:29:11.550" style="s2">so should you win you would actually be</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.670" end="01:29:13.650" style="s2">able to concentrate primarily on role</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.550" end="01:29:16.020" style="s2">number two then ie using it as a</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.650" end="01:29:18.590" style="s2">platform to publicize RBE to a wider</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.020" end="01:29:21.239" style="s2">audience yeah</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.590" end="01:29:23.550" style="s2">for a national campaign yes that is that</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.239" end="01:29:28.020" style="s2">is that kind of on your on your horizon</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.550" end="01:29:29.520" style="s2">new thinking I&#39;ll come back to the first</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.020" end="01:29:31.980" style="s2">question in a second well of course</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.520" end="01:29:38.130" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the money free party and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.980" end="01:29:41.460" style="s2">got general elections in 2020 so that</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.130" end="01:29:43.800" style="s2">may be a point of contention for me if I</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.460" end="01:29:46.290" style="s2">am mayor do I drop the mayoralty to</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.800" end="01:29:47.700" style="s2">become a member of parliament well only</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.290" end="01:29:49.290" style="s2">if you win right you wouldn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.700" end="01:29:50.790" style="s2">drop it just to run would you or would</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.290" end="01:29:52.440" style="s2">you would you have to drop it just to</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.790" end="01:29:54.960" style="s2">run now you don&#39;t have to drop it to run</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.440" end="01:29:56.310" style="s2">but if you win you do and by then they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.960" end="01:29:57.989" style="s2">have to be a by-election which are</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.310" end="01:30:00.600" style="s2">expensive and time-consuming and just</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.989" end="01:30:02.730" style="s2">annoying and of course there is a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.600" end="01:30:06.750" style="s2">happened quite a few times</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.730" end="01:30:08.550" style="s2">the locals well in instances that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.750" end="01:30:10.410" style="s2">seen in the past and I guess everyone is</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.550" end="01:30:12.960" style="s2">different the locals have been really</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.410" end="01:30:15.390" style="s2">pissed off at being abandoned yeah</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.960" end="01:30:18.480" style="s2">person might with envy I understand that</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.390" end="01:30:23.070" style="s2">yeah yeah ah so he&#39;s pursuing his own</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.480" end="01:30:25.020" style="s2">ambitious yeah yeah I can I get that on</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.070" end="01:30:27.120" style="s2">the other hand if you have the people</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.020" end="01:30:31.170" style="s2">behind you then it might be saying go on</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.120" end="01:30:33.330" style="s2">go for it it&#39;s only ceremonial we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.170" end="01:30:35.940" style="s2">we can just get another mere you go on</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.330" end="01:30:37.560" style="s2">and all the way son you know so it</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.940" end="01:30:39.249" style="s2">probably depends on how things are going</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.560" end="01:30:42.070" style="s2">at the time</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.249" end="01:30:43.959" style="s2">just to finish off the question yeah</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.070" end="01:30:46.090" style="s2">there are plenty of mayoral duties</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.959" end="01:30:50.380" style="s2">cutting ribbons kissing babies that kind</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.090" end="01:30:51.639" style="s2">of thing but what the way I see it</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.380" end="01:30:54.840" style="s2">because I do like to keep things</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.639" end="01:30:58.179" style="s2">succinct if possible believe it or not</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.840" end="01:31:01.179" style="s2">the the council machine is a big</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.179" end="01:31:04.869" style="s2">cumbersome one of many wheels turning</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.179" end="01:31:07.689" style="s2">very slowly and the position of mayor</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.869" end="01:31:10.749" style="s2">really is just part of that machine what</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.689" end="01:31:14.169" style="s2">you do have is the ability to direct</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.749" end="01:31:16.300" style="s2">that machine so with the right vision</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.169" end="01:31:17.709" style="s2">one can point the machine in the right</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.300" end="01:31:20.679" style="s2">direction but we&#39;re not going to become</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.709" end="01:31:23.380" style="s2">a money free town overnight yeah but you</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.679" end="01:31:24.789" style="s2">do by bringing people along with you</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.380" end="01:31:27.449" style="s2">right not by telling you and this is</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.789" end="01:31:31.719" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing but by convincing</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.449" end="01:31:33.309" style="s2">exactly yeah and I mean I suppose it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.719" end="01:31:37.780" style="s2">just human nature but it seems bizarre</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.309" end="01:31:40.119" style="s2">to me that once you&#39;re mayor suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.780" end="01:31:44.320" style="s2">you have relevance you have Authority</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.119" end="01:31:53.530" style="s2">you have that suddenly what you said the</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.320" end="01:31:58.380" style="s2">day before now has more very very very</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.530" end="01:31:58.380" style="s2">early age to obey Authority to you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.489" end="01:32:04.239" style="s2">the name of but they&#39;re very famously</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.019" end="01:32:06.099" style="s2">experiments where you know they had the</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.239" end="01:32:07.449" style="s2">person behind the wall who was answering</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.099" end="01:32:09.610" style="s2">questions when they got one wrong they</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.449" end="01:32:12.340" style="s2">told a guy in a white told the guy to</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.610" end="01:32:13.929" style="s2">push the punishment button and it gives</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.340" end="01:32:15.400" style="s2">an electric shock to the other person</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.929" end="01:32:17.199" style="s2">they turn the button all the way up and</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.400" end="01:32:19.239" style="s2">if the guy insists if the guy in the</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.199" end="01:32:20.559" style="s2">white coat insists they&#39;ll turn it all</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.239" end="01:32:24.369" style="s2">the way up to death I mean it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.559" end="01:32:27.039" style="s2">actually happening right but yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.369" end="01:32:29.079" style="s2">amazing how deep it runs in most people</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.039" end="01:32:31.900" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing how deep it runs it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.079" end="01:32:33.519" style="s2">authority figure it&#39;s essentially</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.900" end="01:32:36.729" style="s2">absolves you of personal responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.519" end="01:32:39.159" style="s2">by telling you to do something people do</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.729" end="01:32:41.409" style="s2">almost anything as evidenced by the fact</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.159" end="01:32:43.900" style="s2">that you know I&#39;m sure a very nice young</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.409" end="01:32:45.400" style="s2">men I&#39;m happy to drop bombs on villages</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.900" end="01:32:47.469" style="s2">during war I mean know what I mean City</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.400" end="01:32:48.849" style="s2">uniform on them and give up waters you</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.469" end="01:32:51.280" style="s2">know well they&#39;re really nice people</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.849" end="01:32:54.699" style="s2">most of them yeah</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.280" end="01:32:57.010" style="s2">yeah yeah can I can I have a go at why I</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.699" end="01:33:00.750" style="s2">think greymouth is the only place in the</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.010" end="01:33:03.760" style="s2">world that we can begin this yeah go</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.750" end="01:33:07.210" style="s2">just because I do and I&#39;ve said it in</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.760" end="01:33:09.849" style="s2">public now on Facebook and things on a</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.210" end="01:33:11.199" style="s2">page it&#39;s called love greymouth and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.849" end="01:33:13.239" style="s2">just a local thing and there&#39;s pictures</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.199" end="01:33:15.130" style="s2">of sunsets and dogs and things and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.239" end="01:33:18.520" style="s2">very but occasionally we get going with</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.130" end="01:33:21.039" style="s2">a good conversation and I&#39;ve said that I</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.520" end="01:33:25.960" style="s2">think this is actually the last bastion</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.039" end="01:33:29.920" style="s2">of human civilization because of several</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.960" end="01:33:33.760" style="s2">factors one I&#39;ll start off with is the</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.920" end="01:33:37.179" style="s2">disparity which is really important my</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.760" end="01:33:40.829" style="s2">mouth is not the most deprived place in</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.179" end="01:33:45.460" style="s2">the world but it probably is the most</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.829" end="01:33:47.980" style="s2">deprived place in the world relative to</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.460" end="01:33:52.389" style="s2">the aspirations of the rest of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.980" end="01:33:53.800" style="s2">country so New Zealand as I said it</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.389" end="01:33:55.179" style="s2">probably is one of the most civilized</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.800" end="01:33:59.340" style="s2">countries you know we have the world</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.179" end="01:34:03.489" style="s2">world leading animal welfare legislation</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.340" end="01:34:07.809" style="s2">voting for women human rights freedom of</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.489" end="01:34:11.889" style="s2">speech you know obviously anyway so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.809" end="01:34:14.800" style="s2">talking about disparity between their</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.889" end="01:34:17.050" style="s2">sort of expect expectations&#39; of a nation</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.800" end="01:34:20.170" style="s2">and the realities of the lives on the</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.050" end="01:34:24.070" style="s2">west coast yeah which i think drives the</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.170" end="01:34:26.650" style="s2">change because it&#39;s you know worse in</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.070" end="01:34:29.289" style="s2">the congo you know than they are on the</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.650" end="01:34:33.400" style="s2">west coast but then their expectations</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.289" end="01:34:36.039" style="s2">and aspirations are nothing like us hi</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.400" end="01:34:40.900" style="s2">so it there isn&#39;t the driver for the</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.039" end="01:34:48.330" style="s2">change and I think</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.900" end="01:34:54.460" style="s2">so we we leave world in bowel cancer a</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.330" end="01:34:56.260" style="s2">third in obesity suicide heart disease</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.460" end="01:34:59.530" style="s2">we&#39;re right up there</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.260" end="01:35:01.450" style="s2">legislation as well please yeah isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.530" end="01:35:04.420" style="s2">amazing in this you know it is pretty</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.450" end="01:35:06.850" style="s2">amazing place and yet there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.420" end="01:35:08.770" style="s2">ghastly problems and they&#39;re even worse</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.850" end="01:35:13.330" style="s2">they&#39;re exacerbated on the west coast so</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.770" end="01:35:15.420" style="s2">they know all about their there but we</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.330" end="01:35:19.210" style="s2">have this reputation aspirations</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.420" end="01:35:23.310" style="s2">expectations to be world leading yes</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.210" end="01:35:28.180" style="s2">over 300,000 children living below the</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.310" end="01:35:33.580" style="s2">poverty line in this country and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.180" end="01:35:36.820" style="s2">a deal I&#39;ve totally worn it before and a</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.580" end="01:35:38.860" style="s2">bit million so it&#39;s basically a quarter</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.820" end="01:35:41.890" style="s2">of children live below the poverty line</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.860" end="01:35:44.110" style="s2">no minutes and of course no one&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.890" end="01:35:50.980" style="s2">couple to do about it not at all apart</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.110" end="01:35:56.770" style="s2">from sell and sell more dairy but what</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.980" end="01:35:58.120" style="s2">so it&#39;s a funny dynamic in that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.770" end="01:36:02.200" style="s2">got these expectations we&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.120" end="01:36:05.650" style="s2">situation but we&#39;ve also still got and</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.200" end="01:36:09.790" style="s2">only on the west coast we&#39;ve still got</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.650" end="01:36:11.830" style="s2">the human relations that have generally</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.790" end="01:36:14.500" style="s2">been lost in the modern world</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.830" end="01:36:17.650" style="s2">so most countries with similar</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.500" end="01:36:21.790" style="s2">aspirations expectations etc have lost</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.650" end="01:36:23.410" style="s2">their human connections so you know in</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.790" end="01:36:27.460" style="s2">most towns people don&#39;t even know their</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.410" end="01:36:29.080" style="s2">neighbor anymore and I mean it of course</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.460" end="01:36:30.820" style="s2">many do but that&#39;s that&#39;s massively</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.080" end="01:36:33.130" style="s2">broken down and no one&#39;s really got time</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.820" end="01:36:34.780" style="s2">to talk to anybody anymore which is huge</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.130" end="01:36:36.730" style="s2">on the coast you know everybody wants to</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.780" end="01:36:38.740" style="s2">talk and they&#39;ve known their neighbor</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.730" end="01:36:41.260" style="s2">you know because they both grew up in</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.740" end="01:36:43.450" style="s2">those houses that kind of thing so</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.260" end="01:36:46.030" style="s2">you&#39;ve still got a very strong community</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.450" end="01:36:49.120" style="s2">social fabric that I think has generally</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.030" end="01:36:51.610" style="s2">been torn apart in what we call more</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.120" end="01:36:53.410" style="s2">civilized nations so the Congo they</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.610" end="01:36:54.640" style="s2">probably still do know most and the</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.410" end="01:36:56.830" style="s2">people in the village but there</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.640" end="01:37:00.400" style="s2">all poor and they&#39;re just happy if they</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.830" end="01:37:01.840" style="s2">survive to adulthood whereas in a more</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.400" end="01:37:04.210" style="s2">sophisticated country yeah they have</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.840" end="01:37:07.030" style="s2">higher standards etc but they&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.210" end="01:37:10.380" style="s2">the human connections whereas in</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.030" end="01:37:12.880" style="s2">greymouth they seem to have retained</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.380" end="01:37:14.800" style="s2">those human connections they are the</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.880" end="01:37:17.800" style="s2">expectations of a very first world</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.800" end="01:37:20.590" style="s2">country but they&#39;ve got the reality of</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.800" end="01:37:23.530" style="s2">almost a third world country and so that</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.590" end="01:37:27.160" style="s2">disparity drives enormous frustration</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.530" end="01:37:31.800" style="s2">and I guess you couldn&#39;t all my say it</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.160" end="01:37:34.570" style="s2">it demonstrates that chaos that comes</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.800" end="01:37:36.190" style="s2">with the transition from one regime to</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.570" end="01:37:38.500" style="s2">the next you know because it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.190" end="01:37:41.320" style="s2">such a bizarre situation you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.500" end="01:37:44.200" style="s2">got all this utter abundance and yet</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.320" end="01:37:46.420" style="s2">everybody&#39;s struggling even if people</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.200" end="01:37:48.340" style="s2">know the Thorpes are too stressed that</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.420" end="01:37:50.050" style="s2">they are on bloody drugs and alcohol and</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.340" end="01:37:54.190" style="s2">eating all the wrong food and fighting</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.050" end="01:37:55.750" style="s2">and and you know just like growing up in</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.190" end="01:37:59.200" style="s2">the UK I remember the term from the</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.750" end="01:38:01.960" style="s2">1970s intergenerational unemployment you</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.200" end="01:38:07.480" style="s2">know and what that hasn&#39;t that effect on</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.960" end="01:38:09.670" style="s2">a social psyche and so you have this</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.480" end="01:38:15.040" style="s2">funny combination of all these different</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.670" end="01:38:16.990" style="s2">factors so much it&#39;s the sense of not</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.040" end="01:38:20.350" style="s2">feeling like you&#39;re making any kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.990" end="01:38:21.880" style="s2">contribution to anything you know money</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.350" end="01:38:23.770" style="s2">coming in but I mean that</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.880" end="01:38:28.090" style="s2">psychologically that secondary I think</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.770" end="01:38:30.970" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah yeah except with our</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.090" end="01:38:32.920" style="s2">modern devices now you know it is</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.970" end="01:38:35.110" style="s2">secondary but of course you can no</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.920" end="01:38:36.760" style="s2">longer afford the things that you aspire</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.110" end="01:38:40.240" style="s2">to so everyone expects to have their own</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.760" end="01:38:45.670" style="s2">jetboat widescreen TV two bathrooms in</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.240" end="01:38:47.200" style="s2">every bedroom it all dit so yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.670" end="01:38:49.330" style="s2">again there&#39;s a disparity there the</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.200" end="01:38:51.490" style="s2">expectation of it very high but the</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.330" end="01:38:56.380" style="s2">actual reality is very very low and a</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.490" end="01:38:58.060" style="s2">Greymouth sorry gone when there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.380" end="01:39:01.870" style="s2">thousand people and there are two and a</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.060" end="01:39:03.840" style="s2">half thousand houses of the don&#39;t are</p>

<p begin="01:39:03.840" end="01:39:08.800" style="s2">in a town know that they&#39;re still on</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.659" end="01:39:10.780" style="s2">septic tanks and there is actually a</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.800" end="01:39:12.760" style="s2">government requirement that started</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.780" end="01:39:15.520" style="s2">about ten years ago to update this kind</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.760" end="01:39:18.010" style="s2">of thing but they just cannot afford to</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.520" end="01:39:20.800" style="s2">do it and I was having a cup of tea in a</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.010" end="01:39:24.010" style="s2">lady&#39;s house the other day and she in a</p>

<p begin="01:39:24.010" end="01:39:31.929" style="s2">it still had the original wiring from</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.280" end="01:39:33.340" style="s2">the 1940s and this is very typical none</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.929" end="01:39:34.989" style="s2">of these people can afford to fix their</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.340" end="01:39:37.139" style="s2">houses up because they haven&#39;t got any</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.989" end="01:39:37.139" style="s2">money</p>

<p begin="01:39:46.929" end="01:39:51.219" style="s2">the cost of that so basically it means</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.060" end="01:39:53.080" style="s2">it&#39;s no one&#39;s done anything the value of</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.219" end="01:39:56.139" style="s2">property as a whole has fallen in the</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.080" end="01:39:57.670" style="s2">region because there&#39;s no work so nobody</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.139" end="01:40:00.250" style="s2">will lend them the money to do the work</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.670" end="01:40:04.170" style="s2">many people are in negative equity and</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.250" end="01:40:05.889" style="s2">suddenly the whole thing spirals down</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.170" end="01:40:09.310" style="s2">and we haven&#39;t even talked about</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.889" end="01:40:12.730" style="s2">earthquake risk yet which is represented</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.310" end="01:40:15.880" style="s2">throughout the town itself in that many</p>

<p begin="01:40:25.900" end="01:40:31.510" style="s2">had quite like that here this would fall</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.000" end="01:40:35.170" style="s2">down and who can afford to pay to fix it</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.510" end="01:40:36.909" style="s2">up nobody so consequently the businesses</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.170" end="01:40:38.320" style="s2">are leaving town in droves because they</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.909" end="01:40:40.780" style="s2">can&#39;t afford to fix the building that</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.320" end="01:40:42.940" style="s2">they&#39;re in the landlord can&#39;t afford to</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.780" end="01:40:45.699" style="s2">fix it insurance companies won&#39;t insure</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.940" end="01:40:48.400" style="s2">them presumably won&#39;t go near them yeah</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.699" end="01:40:49.690" style="s2">and in fact that came out the other day</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.400" end="01:40:51.250" style="s2">because in Sharia the insurance</p>

<p begin="01:41:50.320" end="01:41:54.550" style="s2">is where it&#39;s absolutely imperative to</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.630" end="01:41:56.560" style="s2">have the people on board and depending</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.550" end="01:41:58.870" style="s2">on how on board they are depends on</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.560" end="01:41:59.770" style="s2">which which road will travel and I guess</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.870" end="01:42:02.650" style="s2">it&#39;ll probably end up being a</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.770" end="01:42:04.000" style="s2">combination of both but one is if the</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.650" end="01:42:08.400" style="s2">people are really behind me and if we&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="01:42:51.930" end="01:42:56.520" style="s2">question there are two things we could</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.870" end="01:42:58.860" style="s2">do we can either go money free straight</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.520" end="01:43:00.630" style="s2">away and fuck it and then because the</p>

<p begin="01:43:00.630" end="01:43:04.380" style="s2">in the woods and so sorry</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.340" end="01:43:07.949" style="s2">just just pause you for a minute there</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.380" end="01:43:09.570" style="s2">so by going money right away you mean or</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.949" end="01:43:13.230" style="s2">correct me if I&#39;m wrong but by that I</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.570" end="01:43:15.630" style="s2">get that you mean okay so whatever</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.230" end="01:43:17.340" style="s2">potholes need fixing so who&#39;s got the</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.630" end="01:43:20.340" style="s2">trucks who&#39;s got who&#39;s got the gravel</p>

<p begin="01:43:21.840" end="01:43:26.160" style="s2">and fix these potholes and and you know</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.969" end="01:43:27.750" style="s2">put noticeboards up and whatever and</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.160" end="01:43:28.980" style="s2">recruit people to do the things that</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.750" end="01:43:31.650" style="s2">need doing is that is that essentially</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.980" end="01:43:32.940" style="s2">what you mean yeah fucking we won&#39;t wait</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.650" end="01:43:34.440" style="s2">for the central government to provide</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.940" end="01:43:35.910" style="s2">the money we&#39;ll just go and fucking do</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.440" end="01:43:37.980" style="s2">it and there&#39;s already a history of</p>

<p begin="01:43:44.040" end="01:43:50.130" style="s2">sensor at the moment by the council</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.980" end="01:43:52.890" style="s2">overseers because he and a mate when</p>

<p begin="01:43:52.890" end="01:43:56.520" style="s2">to be done the hurry they just went out</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.870" end="01:43:58.980" style="s2">with their diggers and they&#39;re fucking</p>

<p begin="01:44:03.170" end="01:44:08.100" style="s2">of course subsequently there was a bill</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.910" end="01:44:09.570" style="s2">over 1/2 million dollars for the council</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.100" end="01:44:10.800" style="s2">which they then freaked out about</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.570" end="01:44:13.370" style="s2">because they hadn&#39;t gone through the</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.800" end="01:44:16.380" style="s2">transparency</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.370" end="01:44:19.110" style="s2">but this is the nature of these Peter no</p>
