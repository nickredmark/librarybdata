<p begin="00:00:13.500" end="00:00:17.690" style="s2">and the models that you&#39;ve constructed</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.719" end="00:00:25.439" style="s2">to understand the world over the last</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.690" end="00:00:27.240" style="s2">sort of 20 years or so if you if you</p>

<p begin="00:00:27.240" end="00:00:32.520" style="s2">very interesting inquiry because we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:00:32.520" end="00:00:39.000" style="s2">sense making and for me with that ends</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.750" end="00:00:41.430" style="s2">up always doing is creating many</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.000" end="00:00:43.920" style="s2">different layers of awareness of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.430" end="00:00:47.460" style="s2">happening so even trying to figure out</p>

<p begin="00:00:47.460" end="00:00:52.350" style="s2">history leads to the inquiry into sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.610" end="00:00:58.230" style="s2">making us of course making sense of my</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.350" end="00:01:07.380" style="s2">story but broadly speaking it shows up</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.230" end="00:01:09.479" style="s2">as I was born in 1971 in Texas and my</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.380" end="00:01:13.820" style="s2">father was in the military but we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.479" end="00:01:16.170" style="s2">move around too much and my mom was</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.820" end="00:01:18.479" style="s2">college-educated went on to a career in</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.170" end="00:01:23.250" style="s2">psychology and education and ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:25.380" style="s2">politics and for me there&#39;s if you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.250" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">anything about the culture of Texas in</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.380" end="00:01:32.030" style="s2">the 70s just assume that&#39;s if you watch</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:35.130" style="s2">the movie boyhood or Dazed and Confused</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.030" end="00:01:39.210" style="s2">just assume that that&#39;s the context and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.130" end="00:01:43.290" style="s2">then later on the fact that I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.210" end="00:01:45.930" style="s2">was participating in boy and nerd</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.290" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">culture in that time so comic books</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.930" end="00:01:54.979" style="s2">science fiction fantasy really OCD level</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.840" end="00:01:57.240" style="s2">of pop culture film and television</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.979" end="00:02:01.939" style="s2">computers and role-playing games and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.240" end="00:02:04.979" style="s2">again pretty obsessively like a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.939" end="00:02:06.689" style="s2">so this is impresses itself upon my</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.979" end="00:02:11.430" style="s2">psychology lots of different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.689" end="00:02:13.020" style="s2">artifacts things like not just the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.430" end="00:02:13.260" style="s2">notion of say the way that a person who</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.020" end="00:02:15.060" style="s2">grew</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.260" end="00:02:17.610" style="s2">playing chess thinks about life in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.060" end="00:02:19.349" style="s2">model or the framework of chess but</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.610" end="00:02:22.019" style="s2">actually growing up playing every game</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.349" end="00:02:24.000" style="s2">and thinking about the meta structure</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.019" end="00:02:25.349" style="s2">that gives rise to games intuitively and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.000" end="00:02:27.450" style="s2">how you can drop into any game and be</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.349" end="00:02:29.159" style="s2">able to derive what it is and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.450" end="00:02:30.390" style="s2">kids these days are already they sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.159" end="00:02:31.260" style="s2">naturally think about it like the idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.390" end="00:02:33.060" style="s2">because I&#39;m calling a game of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.260" end="00:02:35.010" style="s2">first-person shooter or calling it a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.060" end="00:02:37.349" style="s2">sandbox game has become part of the</p>

<p begin="00:02:37.349" end="00:02:41.159" style="s2">then the concepts didn&#39;t exist so for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.019" end="00:02:43.859" style="s2">they were built at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.159" end="00:02:47.340" style="s2">intuition but then also things like</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.859" end="00:02:49.560" style="s2">role-playing where the notion that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.340" end="00:02:51.540" style="s2">world that you lived in the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.560" end="00:02:53.430" style="s2">structures that gave rise to the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.540" end="00:02:56.579" style="s2">that you made sense of meaning in your</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.430" end="00:02:58.560" style="s2">world were actually objects of creative</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.579" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">participation and not just a</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.560" end="00:03:01.560" style="s2">role-playing game but all of them so</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:04.290" style="s2">having to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.560" end="00:03:06.389" style="s2">spontaneously create a 1920s simulator</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.290" end="00:03:08.069" style="s2">and had a created medieval Japan</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.389" end="00:03:09.540" style="s2">simulator and how to create a simulator</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.069" end="00:03:10.920" style="s2">of contemporary New York but with</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.540" end="00:03:13.260" style="s2">different changes different natures of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.920" end="00:03:16.650" style="s2">reality was again just part of my</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.260" end="00:03:19.109" style="s2">developmental environment and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.650" end="00:03:21.180" style="s2">you&#39;d add to that the experience which I</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.109" end="00:03:26.639" style="s2">don&#39;t think is that atypical but my</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.180" end="00:03:30.230" style="s2">particular experience of not being able</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.639" end="00:03:35.160" style="s2">to play the game that was handed to me</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.230" end="00:03:37.169" style="s2">fluidly you know so the game of going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.160" end="00:03:40.260" style="s2">school mostly going to school right as</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.169" end="00:03:41.849" style="s2">soon as you show up it at I guess first</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.260" end="00:03:43.680" style="s2">great was when I first started getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.849" end="00:03:45.540" style="s2">to recognize that there was something</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.680" end="00:03:47.940" style="s2">definitely off</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.540" end="00:03:49.139" style="s2">and initially simple things like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.940" end="00:03:51.449" style="s2">idea that there&#39;s an authority who</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.139" end="00:03:52.829" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actually have the capacity that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.449" end="00:03:54.030" style="s2">they are supposed to have like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.829" end="00:03:56.010" style="s2">teaching things that are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.030" end="00:03:57.510" style="s2">actually wrong and you can tell that as</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.010" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">a first grader in my case a second</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.510" end="00:04:01.530" style="s2">grader and then the notion of having to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:03.060" style="s2">deal with an arbitrary Authority that</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.530" end="00:04:04.949" style="s2">you didn&#39;t sign up for but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.060" end="00:04:06.299" style="s2">has coercive capacitive force to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.949" end="00:04:06.840" style="s2">things that clearly suck and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.299" end="00:04:09.419" style="s2">or stupid</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.840" end="00:04:10.680" style="s2">so that idea that feeling of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.419" end="00:04:15.750" style="s2">figure out like what the hell&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.680" end="00:04:18.030" style="s2">here in a sense of constraint but so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.750" end="00:04:20.669" style="s2">the official game the official story</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.030" end="00:04:23.190" style="s2">didn&#39;t fit and my developmental</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.669" end="00:04:25.110" style="s2">environment was teaching me that these</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.190" end="00:04:27.690" style="s2">things these kinds of stories are in</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.110" end="00:04:31.410" style="s2">fact creative acts they</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.690" end="00:04:33.419" style="s2">just the laws of nature put me on a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.410" end="00:04:37.110" style="s2">journey of trying to figure figure it</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.419" end="00:04:39.509" style="s2">out and figure it out always in a combo</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.110" end="00:04:42.960" style="s2">between West suppose we might call</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.509" end="00:04:44.310" style="s2">sense-making and agency never just one</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.960" end="00:04:46.229" style="s2">of the other always thinking okay how do</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.310" end="00:04:47.940" style="s2">we figure out what&#39;s happening and how</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.229" end="00:04:53.759" style="s2">do we have agency in what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.940" end="00:04:58.110" style="s2">and if we sort of fast forward to</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.759" end="00:04:59.819" style="s2">college this put me in a place where for</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.110" end="00:05:02.039" style="s2">example I didn&#39;t really have any</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.819" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">particular notion of a major because</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.039" end="00:05:04.770" style="s2">that&#39;s just a story and it&#39;s not a story</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:07.409" style="s2">that worked for what I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.770" end="00:05:08.669" style="s2">accomplish so I just hacked that it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.409" end="00:05:11.250" style="s2">nice that the concept of hacking had</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.669" end="00:05:12.599" style="s2">become somewhat meaningful in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.250" end="00:05:15.690" style="s2">timeframe and I had participated in</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.599" end="00:05:17.430" style="s2">hacker culture so broad like broadly</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.690" end="00:05:18.930" style="s2">applying the hacker ethos to what ever</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.430" end="00:05:20.520" style="s2">happened to be there you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.930" end="00:05:22.949" style="s2">relationship with the power structure</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.520" end="00:05:25.729" style="s2">that&#39;s stronger than you but if you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.949" end="00:05:27.599" style="s2">use a combination of cleverness and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.729" end="00:05:29.190" style="s2">elegance you can figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.599" end="00:05:30.419" style="s2">actually make it do the things you want</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.190" end="00:05:33.240" style="s2">to do and get away with it this is kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.419" end="00:05:35.969" style="s2">of like the very gen-x temporary</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.240" end="00:05:38.780" style="s2">autonomous zone hacker cypher freak</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.969" end="00:05:42.570" style="s2">ethos we can create a space for autonomy</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.780" end="00:05:45.449" style="s2">and my junior year of college I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.570" end="00:05:48.560" style="s2">coming up with the basis of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.449" end="00:05:51.229" style="s2">beginnings of my meta theory of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.560" end="00:05:56.150" style="s2">particularly how culture and technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.229" end="00:06:01.740" style="s2">co-create each other and spent the next</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.150" end="00:06:04.319" style="s2">what was that probably 93 to 2007 so</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.740" end="00:06:07.080" style="s2">it&#39;s 14 15 years kind of playing that</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.319" end="00:06:09.830" style="s2">out and refining it building it in me</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.080" end="00:06:15.659" style="s2">distressed so you know it&#39;s reading</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.830" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">sheet alloys and learning how to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.659" end="00:06:19.080" style="s2">learn how to do information theory for</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:23.789" style="s2">video compression for example or more</p>

<p begin="00:06:23.789" end="00:06:27.030" style="s2">cents and learning how to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.319" end="00:06:30.810" style="s2">spreadsheets actually even more more</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.030" end="00:06:33.630" style="s2">specifically and so eventually what this</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.810" end="00:06:38.020" style="s2">leads me to is I figured out another</p>

<p begin="00:06:55.580" end="00:07:02.200" style="s2">more legible credential and a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.690" end="00:07:04.730" style="s2">brief search led me to the path of</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.200" end="00:07:06.830" style="s2">noticing that you could get into law</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.730" end="00:07:08.660" style="s2">school through the vehicle doing well on</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.830" end="00:07:12.140" style="s2">a standardized test and really nothing</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.660" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">else and so I knew from experience that</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.140" end="00:07:15.950" style="s2">I could do well on standardized tests so</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:19.070" style="s2">I took a weekend study for the L SAT</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.950" end="00:07:20.900" style="s2">took the L SAT low cost if I got a good</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.070" end="00:07:22.670" style="s2">score cool if I didn&#39;t who cares</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.900" end="00:07:25.460" style="s2">I got a good score this allowed me to</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.670" end="00:07:26.690" style="s2">get into Harvard Law School which the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.460" end="00:07:28.160" style="s2">law school part you can kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.690" end="00:07:29.540" style="s2">tear off the bottom of the Diploma and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.160" end="00:07:32.510" style="s2">throw away because most people just read</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.540" end="00:07:35.390" style="s2">the first letter H Oh Harvard cool</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.510" end="00:07:37.550" style="s2">that&#39;s neat and you have a credential so</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.390" end="00:07:39.380" style="s2">that&#39;s write it so I spent three years</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.550" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">again more or less not going to law</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.380" end="00:07:41.480" style="s2">school</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.680" end="00:07:43.970" style="s2">it spent most of my time with Larry</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.480" end="00:07:46.340" style="s2">Lessig and with people like Cornel West</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.970" end="00:07:48.080" style="s2">and folks like that doing whatever I</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.340" end="00:07:49.730" style="s2">thought was interesting and continued to</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.080" end="00:07:50.380" style="s2">refine the stuff that I&#39;ve been trying</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.730" end="00:07:53.270" style="s2">to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.380" end="00:07:56.210" style="s2">lesyk stuff was awesome like very very</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.270" end="00:07:58.250" style="s2">important for me at least and more</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.210" end="00:08:00.050" style="s2">broadly back then and then when I</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.250" end="00:08:01.580" style="s2">graduated moved out to California had no</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.050" end="00:08:02.870" style="s2">idea by the way how the tech industry</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.580" end="00:08:05.210" style="s2">worked at all I guess zero experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.870" end="00:08:06.500" style="s2">and for example didn&#39;t know how the San</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.210" end="00:08:08.420" style="s2">Francisco was the place to go I just</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.500" end="00:08:13.580" style="s2">knew the kind of West was a good good</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.420" end="00:08:15.740" style="s2">directionality and in San Diego ended up</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.580" end="00:08:16.820" style="s2">getting involved in the high tech scene</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.740" end="00:08:19.190" style="s2">and then it being involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.820" end="00:08:22.550" style="s2">startup of three companies in a row</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.190" end="00:08:26.290" style="s2">pretty quickly right at the froth stage</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.550" end="00:08:28.640" style="s2">of the but kombu something called mp3</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.290" end="00:08:30.590" style="s2">and then the third company was DivX</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.640" end="00:08:33.110" style="s2">which I was the founder and CEO of and</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.590" end="00:08:34.250" style="s2">rode that through the bubble popping and</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.110" end="00:08:38.390" style="s2">then all the way up to the financial</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.250" end="00:08:39.740" style="s2">crisis of 2008 but it&#39;s nice like I</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.390" end="00:08:42.140" style="s2">actually got on the one hand to apply</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.740" end="00:08:44.180" style="s2">the underlying theory refine the theory</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.140" end="00:08:46.730" style="s2">in practice like really seeing firsthand</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.180" end="00:08:48.680" style="s2">how a lot of these things emerged and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.730" end="00:08:50.760" style="s2">went through their arc it&#39;s like from</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.680" end="00:08:53.340" style="s2">inception all the way to maturity</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.760" end="00:08:54.720" style="s2">through that pace and ended up with</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.340" end="00:08:57.930" style="s2">enough resources that I could more or</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.720" end="00:09:03.630" style="s2">less do what I wanted to so so then I</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.930" end="00:09:06.630" style="s2">did and I spent two glorious years doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.630" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">exactly what I wanted to and in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.630" end="00:09:10.770" style="s2">process of that war do what I want to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:12.420" style="s2">is like spend time at a place called the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.770" end="00:09:13.980" style="s2">Senate famous to do and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.420" end="00:09:17.100" style="s2">another place called Necker islands like</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.980" end="00:09:19.620" style="s2">two very different versions of what I</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.100" end="00:09:20.850" style="s2">want to but continued by the way basic</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.620" end="00:09:22.440" style="s2">under the heading of getting a better</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.850" end="00:09:23.700" style="s2">sense of what&#39;s exactly going on like</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.440" end="00:09:25.770" style="s2">are who are these rich people we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.700" end="00:09:27.450" style="s2">heard of and who at the global elite to</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.770" end="00:09:31.860" style="s2">be pretty so much about oh I would just</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.450" end="00:09:33.540" style="s2">meet them and find out so I did and in</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.860" end="00:09:35.070" style="s2">the context of science art we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.540" end="00:09:37.350" style="s2">smartest people do the most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.070" end="00:09:38.580" style="s2">work in the broadest way oh they&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.350" end="00:09:40.770" style="s2">okay cool let&#39;s go spend time with them</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.580" end="00:09:43.470" style="s2">as well but then the financial crisis</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.770" end="00:09:44.670" style="s2">hit and I happen to be just sitting</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.470" end="00:09:47.190" style="s2">there at a place where I could ask</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.670" end="00:09:47.640" style="s2">questions and so I start asking</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.190" end="00:09:48.660" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.640" end="00:09:51.330" style="s2">and I was in this really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.660" end="00:09:53.760" style="s2">place where I was literally at a</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.330" end="00:09:56.610" style="s2">conference at SFI when I think like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.760" end="00:09:58.170" style="s2">Dow dropped 800 points 900 points and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.610" end="00:10:01.230" style="s2">thousand points like day after day after</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.170" end="00:10:05.880" style="s2">day which had the consequence of getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.230" end="00:10:08.390" style="s2">a lot of attention and I was able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.880" end="00:10:11.130" style="s2">watch the story that was being told</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.390" end="00:10:13.740" style="s2">through MSNBC and through official</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.130" end="00:10:15.390" style="s2">channels I was able to ask the actual</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.740" end="00:10:17.610" style="s2">Nobel prize-winning economists who just</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.390" end="00:10:19.320" style="s2">happened to be like right there what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.610" end="00:10:21.210" style="s2">actually going on and as they better</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.320" end="00:10:23.340" style="s2">than witnessed the gap between the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.210" end="00:10:26.760" style="s2">official story what was really happening</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.340" end="00:10:29.100" style="s2">and the fact the economists had no</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.760" end="00:10:33.150" style="s2"> idea there even their underlying</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.100" end="00:10:34.820" style="s2">models were just whack so I got</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.150" end="00:10:38.550" style="s2">interested and so I started digging and</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.820" end="00:10:41.190" style="s2">I just more or less followed my nose you</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.550" end="00:10:44.340" style="s2">know I tried to read all the books on</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.190" end="00:10:47.520" style="s2">money theory for example and David</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.340" end="00:10:50.330" style="s2">Graeber book by the way is fantastic and</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.520" end="00:10:52.950" style="s2">blows a lot of concepts particularly the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.330" end="00:10:55.650" style="s2">legitimacy of the economic discipline</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.950" end="00:10:56.670" style="s2">out of the water and of course also</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.650" end="00:10:58.680" style="s2">about other things like complexity</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.670" end="00:10:59.940" style="s2">economics but didn&#39;t you know the you</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.680" end="00:11:01.590" style="s2">know it didn&#39;t stop there what you start</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.940" end="00:11:02.640" style="s2">getting into complexity the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.590" end="00:11:03.460" style="s2">you learn is that everything&#39;s connected</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.640" end="00:11:05.770" style="s2">everything else</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.460" end="00:11:06.640" style="s2">so if you want to do economics you also</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.770" end="00:11:08.649" style="s2">have to look at the interface between</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.640" end="00:11:10.000" style="s2">economics and politics I think yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.649" end="00:11:12.370" style="s2">we talked about the four layer model</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.000" end="00:11:16.060" style="s2">that talks about the path you can for</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.370" end="00:11:18.460" style="s2">example model finance economics politics</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.060" end="00:11:20.970" style="s2">and cultures being distinct layers that</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.460" end="00:11:24.370" style="s2">feed back into the very complex fashion</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.970" end="00:11:26.350" style="s2">but that if you have a financial crisis</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.370" end="00:11:28.060" style="s2">you can actually allow that financial</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.350" end="00:11:29.350" style="s2">crisis to happen at the finance level</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.060" end="00:11:31.089" style="s2">and while it will have impacts at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.350" end="00:11:32.709" style="s2">economic level it may not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.089" end="00:11:34.420" style="s2">have any meaningful impact at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.709" end="00:11:36.459" style="s2">political level and may even strengthen</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.420" end="00:11:40.180" style="s2">the political level or you can do what</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.459" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">we did which was you can actually more</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.180" end="00:11:44.200" style="s2">or less bail out well both</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:46.660" style="s2">metaphorically and practically bail out</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.200" end="00:11:49.089" style="s2">the financial level by spending cultural</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.660" end="00:11:52.029" style="s2">currency meaning breaking people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.089" end="00:11:54.220" style="s2">underlying trust at the political level</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.029" end="00:11:55.899" style="s2">and then ultimately even at the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.220" end="00:11:58.450" style="s2">level to say people&#39;s sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.899" end="00:12:00.040" style="s2">part of the same cultural fabric greece</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.450" end="00:12:02.170" style="s2">for example i think has had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.040" end="00:12:04.330" style="s2">that then of course again watching that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.170" end="00:12:06.310" style="s2">in real time so again a place of being</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.330" end="00:12:08.260" style="s2">able to be front and center with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.310" end="00:12:11.470" style="s2">unfurling of reality and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.260" end="00:12:13.180" style="s2">having skin in the game my large pile of</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.470" end="00:12:15.310" style="s2">money that i&#39;d made by being a tech</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.180" end="00:12:17.140" style="s2">entrepreneur became a smaller pile of</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.310" end="00:12:19.990" style="s2">money as a result of financial crisis i</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.140" end="00:12:21.190" style="s2">wasn&#39;t with the right term interest I</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.990" end="00:12:22.540" style="s2">was not disinterested I was quite</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.190" end="00:12:25.089" style="s2">interested in a bit pissed off to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.540" end="00:12:26.560" style="s2">perfectly frank and I got even more</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.089" end="00:12:28.240" style="s2">pissed off as I continued watching what</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.560" end="00:12:31.300" style="s2">was happening because it was to me at</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.240" end="00:12:34.000" style="s2">least now increasingly obvious that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.300" end="00:12:36.430" style="s2">choices that we were being made at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.000" end="00:12:38.770" style="s2">level of how our collective choice</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.430" end="00:12:43.330" style="s2">making worked let&#39;s say for example to</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.770" end="00:12:45.459" style="s2">level politics were bad like actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.330" end="00:12:48.810" style="s2">bad like they would have long-term</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.459" end="00:12:48.810" style="s2">negative consequences and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.600" end="00:12:56.500" style="s2">just kept on going deeper and then I</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.970" end="00:13:00.190" style="s2">found myself in a situation where I had</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.500" end="00:13:01.810" style="s2">a series of significant oh where I</p>

<p begin="00:13:01.810" end="00:13:06.400" style="s2">were really like the expert in some</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.180" end="00:13:09.220" style="s2">particular domain of interest say for</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.400" end="00:13:12.040" style="s2">example a nuclear proliferation or the</p>

<p begin="00:13:12.040" end="00:13:19.150" style="s2">like very narrow specific domains and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.360" end="00:13:22.390" style="s2">had to probably over period about a year</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.150" end="00:13:25.900" style="s2">a series of conversations each one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.390" end="00:13:27.550" style="s2">which was things are really terrible</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.900" end="00:13:31.200" style="s2">like there&#39;s something going on that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.550" end="00:13:33.430" style="s2">way bad like but nuclear proliferation</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.200" end="00:13:35.560" style="s2">the likelihood that we will be able to</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.430" end="00:13:37.390" style="s2">and to keep the world from having a</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.560" end="00:13:40.510" style="s2">quite significant bad nuclear event of</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.390" end="00:13:42.250" style="s2">the next decade is very low like 5% like</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.510" end="00:13:43.390" style="s2">sitting there was like the three experts</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.250" end="00:13:44.440" style="s2">in the world on that question they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.390" end="00:13:46.060" style="s2">all a lot not in their heads saying yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.440" end="00:13:48.280" style="s2">this is like they were this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.060" end="00:13:49.720" style="s2">really a serious problem and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.280" end="00:13:51.520" style="s2">taking literally one step back and</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.720" end="00:13:55.960" style="s2">noticing that that fact does not seem to</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.520" end="00:13:57.580" style="s2">propagate out of that room and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.960" end="00:13:58.750" style="s2">beginning to you know get my metamodel</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.580" end="00:14:00.310" style="s2">relationship between culture and</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.750" end="00:14:02.110" style="s2">technology now just plugging we&#39;re in a</p>

<p begin="00:14:09.610" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">notice that I seem to be one of the very</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.530" end="00:14:16.180" style="s2">few people who was talking to all these</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:17.740" style="s2">different groups and trying to see well</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.180" end="00:14:20.500" style="s2">how the chain fit together from</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.740" end="00:14:22.570" style="s2">beginning to end top to bottom and how</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.500" end="00:14:23.710" style="s2">the thing everything synthesized and</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.570" end="00:14:26.800" style="s2">what happens when you start thinking</p>

<p begin="00:14:40.170" end="00:14:49.750" style="s2">somewhere around I guess 2012 came to</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.520" end="00:14:52.060" style="s2">the conclusion that the thing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.750" end="00:14:55.630" style="s2">operating in whatever the container is</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.060" end="00:14:59.740" style="s2">that keeps the world held in a somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.630" end="00:15:01.660" style="s2">functioning system is end of life and</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.740" end="00:15:04.200" style="s2">there&#39;s theoretical ways to describe</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.660" end="00:15:05.810" style="s2">exactly why exactly what it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.200" end="00:15:08.750" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.810" end="00:15:10.220" style="s2">why and exactly what we might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.750" end="00:15:12.650" style="s2">do about which by the way is very little</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.220" end="00:15:14.920" style="s2">in the context of itself right so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.650" end="00:15:17.779" style="s2">reached the end of life of a deep</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.920" end="00:15:19.340" style="s2">premise on how to go about being humans</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.779" end="00:15:22.240" style="s2">together in relationship to the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.340" end="00:15:24.710" style="s2">and we&#39;re seeing this come to fruition</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.240" end="00:15:26.230" style="s2">everywhere by the way I mean everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.710" end="00:15:28.700" style="s2">you can even literally describe</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.230" end="00:15:34.460" style="s2">Hollywood blockbuster films in this</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.700" end="00:15:36.080" style="s2">model and video games so okay so then</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.460" end="00:15:38.660" style="s2">the next couple of years was given that</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.080" end="00:15:39.980" style="s2">just get back to actuation so in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.660" end="00:15:41.570" style="s2">making let&#39;s take what what might we be</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.980" end="00:15:43.460" style="s2">able to do and this gave rise to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.570" end="00:15:45.260" style="s2">project that became called game B which</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.460" end="00:15:47.390" style="s2">some people have heard of that which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.260" end="00:15:49.250" style="s2">actually kind of neat because they were</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.390" end="00:15:51.710" style="s2">ultimately about 30 or 40 people who</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.250" end="00:15:53.930" style="s2">were involved in that project and we</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.710" end="00:15:55.550" style="s2">weren&#39;t able to get to where it needed</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.930" end="00:15:58.279" style="s2">to get to in and of itself so he</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.550" end="00:16:01.820" style="s2">dissolved the project in I think 2013 or</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.279" end="00:16:03.170" style="s2">so maybe 2014 and the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.820" end="00:16:06.200" style="s2">concepts have propagated out is actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.170" end="00:16:10.850" style="s2">very interesting reality but not vastly</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.200" end="00:16:13.850" style="s2">and means that kind of gets this more or</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.850" end="00:16:15.950" style="s2">less where we are so so the story that</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.850" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard you sketch out is that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.950" end="00:16:19.520" style="s2">have been a tech entrepreneur for many</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.839" end="00:16:22.790" style="s2">years which has given you the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.520" end="00:16:25.010" style="s2">then kind of detach a little bit take a</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.790" end="00:16:26.780" style="s2">bit more of a bird&#39;s eye view and speak</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.010" end="00:16:29.930" style="s2">to people who really know what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.780" end="00:16:31.970" style="s2">on in the culture try to understand and</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.930" end="00:16:33.290" style="s2">put the pieces together one of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.970" end="00:16:36.560" style="s2">things that I&#39;ve heard you talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.290" end="00:16:38.510" style="s2">lot is the crisis of sense making which</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.560" end="00:16:40.730" style="s2">in some sense seems to be underneath all</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.510" end="00:16:41.810" style="s2">these other crises because if we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.730" end="00:16:44.420" style="s2">make sense of the world it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.810" end="00:16:48.980" style="s2">difficult to know what we what we should</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.420" end="00:16:51.020" style="s2">do next so what would you how would you</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.980" end="00:16:52.790" style="s2">describe the crisis of sense making what</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.020" end="00:16:57.310" style="s2">I&#39;d like to do first is maybe establish</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.790" end="00:17:02.050" style="s2">a method and in the method that I would</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.310" end="00:17:04.819" style="s2">propose is one of having a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.050" end="00:17:06.260" style="s2">attentional parallax but just to say</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.819" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.260" end="00:17:11.900" style="s2">and we&#39;re also going to be doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:12.829" style="s2">we&#39;re willing to be aware of both so we</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.900" end="00:17:15.250" style="s2">have a couple of different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.829" end="00:17:17.480" style="s2">going on simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.250" end="00:17:19.180" style="s2">so what I&#39;d invite us to be but just</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.480" end="00:17:21.910" style="s2">notice that there&#39;s that fact and</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.180" end="00:17:24.490" style="s2">you can try to be split your attention</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.910" end="00:17:29.080" style="s2">into three distinct pieces and try to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.490" end="00:17:31.960" style="s2">aware of all three simultaneously now in</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.080" end="00:17:34.230" style="s2">the context of let&#39;s call it the big</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.960" end="00:17:36.520" style="s2">question of the situation where are we</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.230" end="00:17:40.390" style="s2">one of the things that we&#39;ll notice is</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.520" end="00:17:42.160" style="s2">that we&#39;re engaging in a narrative we</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.390" end="00:17:44.140" style="s2">end up having to take a slice like our</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.160" end="00:17:47.920" style="s2">attention is finite really quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.140" end="00:17:50.980" style="s2">distinctly finite and our capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.920" end="00:17:53.590" style="s2">engage in conversation has some</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.980" end="00:17:56.410" style="s2">linearity to it it may be wandering but</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.590" end="00:17:58.870" style="s2">it has a reality tunnel ask effect but</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.410" end="00:18:01.570" style="s2">the problem that we&#39;re in isn&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.870" end="00:18:04.000" style="s2">it&#39;s hole it&#39;s a it&#39;s a wholeness to it</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.570" end="00:18:06.070" style="s2">it&#39;s a whole system and I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.000" end="00:18:08.530" style="s2">use the strictly physical but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.070" end="00:18:13.150" style="s2">wholeness so we find ourselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.530" end="00:18:16.720" style="s2">circumstance where we have to use just a</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.150" end="00:18:17.920" style="s2">lens a perspective but be aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.720" end="00:18:20.740" style="s2">fact that we&#39;re trying to do is actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.920" end="00:18:23.890" style="s2">grasp a whole and it&#39;s a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.740" end="00:18:25.120" style="s2">that well at least my version might take</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.890" end="00:18:29.080" style="s2">in that story of the blind men and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.120" end="00:18:31.140" style="s2">elephant where if the blind men take</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.080" end="00:18:33.910" style="s2">their perspective as being the hole</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.140" end="00:18:35.950" style="s2">they&#39;re making an error right it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.910" end="00:18:38.410" style="s2">task turns into a rhino and the foot</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.950" end="00:18:40.390" style="s2">turns into a tree but if the blind men</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.410" end="00:18:42.880" style="s2">are able to recognize the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.390" end="00:18:45.220" style="s2">between the narrow finite perspective</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.880" end="00:18:47.920" style="s2">that they&#39;re holding and the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.220" end="00:18:49.210" style="s2">the trying to grasp a hole and then they</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.920" end="00:18:50.440" style="s2">communicate with each other they</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.210" end="00:18:53.020" style="s2">establish a parallax</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.440" end="00:18:54.880" style="s2">then they can in fact perhaps grasp the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.020" end="00:18:56.080" style="s2">whole oh it&#39;s an elephant and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.880" end="00:18:57.940" style="s2">something about that that is very much</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.080" end="00:18:59.290" style="s2">more than just the sum of their</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.940" end="00:19:02.350" style="s2">particular perspectives and take a lot</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.290" end="00:19:05.620" style="s2">more in this case and we can even maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.350" end="00:19:08.020" style="s2">enrich that metaphor by saying okay well</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.620" end="00:19:10.780" style="s2">we generally when I say it&#39;s an elephant</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.020" end="00:19:13.630" style="s2">will end up happening is wool will</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.780" end="00:19:14.770" style="s2">actually put visual take we see the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.630" end="00:19:17.830" style="s2">whole elephant but the blind that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.770" end="00:19:19.510" style="s2">blind they feel pieces and we perceive</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.830" end="00:19:22.030" style="s2">seeing the whole elephant to somehow</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.510" end="00:19:24.400" style="s2">seeing the whole but of course we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.030" end="00:19:25.720" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing the exterior as reflected</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.400" end="00:19:26.710" style="s2">by light when we&#39;re seeing we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.720" end="00:19:28.600" style="s2">seeing the interior of the elephant</p>

<p begin="00:19:45.920" end="00:19:50.870" style="s2">the whole and so it&#39;s interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:52.670" style="s2">regress the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.870" end="00:19:54.140" style="s2">parts that were perceived by the blind</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.670" end="00:19:56.900" style="s2">men and the whole that we could perceive</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.140" end="00:19:58.340" style="s2">we saw and then noticing that that hole</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.900" end="00:20:01.430" style="s2">that we see is actually a part of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.340" end="00:20:03.230" style="s2">whole and we just try to kind of absorb</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.430" end="00:20:04.580" style="s2">that and take that it&#39;s almost a moral</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.230" end="00:20:09.650" style="s2">lesson how to tell the difference</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.580" end="00:20:11.060" style="s2">between dark parts and holes then we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.650" end="00:20:14.980" style="s2">talk about the crisis of sense making</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.060" end="00:20:18.350" style="s2">because it is a part of a larger story</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.980" end="00:20:21.680" style="s2">but a big answer to the question is</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.350" end="00:20:23.630" style="s2">being able to separate between parts and</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.680" end="00:20:29.860" style="s2">wholes and actually learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.630" end="00:20:29.860" style="s2">perceive through homeless and</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.470" end="00:20:41.149" style="s2">that last part has a lot of richness to</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.570" end="00:20:44.419" style="s2">it I think so there&#39;s a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.149" end="00:20:47.179" style="s2">ways to start this and I think I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.419" end="00:20:50.570" style="s2">kind of start near the end and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.179" end="00:20:55.220" style="s2">teleport to the beginning so so near the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.570" end="00:20:58.429" style="s2">end we have we have a problem and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.220" end="00:21:00.379" style="s2">is if we want to be able to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.429" end="00:21:02.090" style="s2">our environment if we want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.379" end="00:21:05.360" style="s2">make good choices in executing our</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.090" end="00:21:10.039" style="s2">actions effectively it&#39;s useful to know</p>

<p begin="00:21:10.039" end="00:21:12.919" style="s2">particularly true when we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.120" end="00:21:17.059" style="s2">with multiple people and we&#39;re trying to</p>

<p begin="00:21:17.059" end="00:21:21.740" style="s2">a situation where the magnitude the</p>

<p begin="00:21:21.740" end="00:21:27.139" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with is is very large and</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.899" end="00:21:31.269" style="s2">getting larger by the minute and at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.139" end="00:21:33.860" style="s2">same time the way that we go about</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.269" end="00:21:38.120" style="s2">knowing what&#39;s going on together is</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.860" end="00:21:40.279" style="s2">actually at its best isn&#39;t up to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.120" end="00:21:41.779" style="s2">task at its best could not make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.279" end="00:21:42.710" style="s2">what was happening and is actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.779" end="00:21:46.610" style="s2">getting worse and worse every day</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.710" end="00:21:48.080" style="s2">so if we need to be here we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.610" end="00:21:50.059" style="s2">we&#39;re going that way and the problems</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.080" end="00:21:53.019" style="s2">getting bigger so that I would consider</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.059" end="00:21:57.080" style="s2">that to be a because of ever increasing</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.019" end="00:21:59.389" style="s2">complexity no let me get to that in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.080" end="00:22:07.009" style="s2">moment we&#39;ll take that as a whole piece</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.389" end="00:22:08.090" style="s2">and yes by the way but it&#39;s complex to</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.009" end="00:22:10.639" style="s2">figure to explain why that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.090" end="00:22:12.200" style="s2">but just by itself we can just take a</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.639" end="00:22:13.519" style="s2">look at the degrading functionality of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.200" end="00:22:15.470" style="s2">our since making systems has its own</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.519" end="00:22:17.000" style="s2">story and they can talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.470" end="00:22:19.279" style="s2">increase in complexity of our</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.000" end="00:22:20.690" style="s2">environment as its own story and then we</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.279" end="00:22:22.940" style="s2">can actually talk about how those two</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.690" end="00:22:25.639" style="s2">pieces actually fit together in a larger</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.940" end="00:22:26.720" style="s2">story so that&#39;s the where we are now so</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.639" end="00:22:29.120" style="s2">we talked about the crisis and sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.720" end="00:22:31.580" style="s2">making through the trying to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.120" end="00:22:34.009" style="s2">edge of it like why does that land why</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.580" end="00:22:37.279" style="s2">is it a meaningful proposition what I</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.009" end="00:22:39.169" style="s2">would say is that we can&#39;t make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.279" end="00:22:41.149" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and I mean this in</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.169" end="00:22:43.549" style="s2">almost any way like we can&#39;t make sense</p>

<p begin="00:22:43.549" end="00:22:47.090" style="s2">can&#39;t make sense of financial</p>

<p begin="00:22:47.090" end="00:22:51.289" style="s2">politics is unrolling the way that it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.070" end="00:22:52.580" style="s2">we can&#39;t make sense of gender we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.289" end="00:22:55.309" style="s2">make sense of why we can&#39;t make sense in</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.580" end="00:22:56.419" style="s2">gender right we&#39;re rapidly moving in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.309" end="00:23:00.190" style="s2">direction of having a very hard time</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.419" end="00:23:04.899" style="s2">making sense about anything at all and</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.190" end="00:23:07.009" style="s2">the urgency the the level of</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.899" end="00:23:11.989" style="s2">meaningfulness the level of impact level</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.009" end="00:23:14.690" style="s2">consequence of the need of us making</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.989" end="00:23:18.109" style="s2">sense is increasing and so we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.690" end="00:23:19.429" style="s2">situation where we actually could be</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.109" end="00:23:21.230" style="s2">really really good at making choices</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.429" end="00:23:24.980" style="s2">because we&#39;re very powerful in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.230" end="00:23:26.779" style="s2">context of our world and so that means</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.980" end="00:23:28.609" style="s2">our sense making has to be vastly better</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.779" end="00:23:30.889" style="s2">than where it is right now and soon</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.609" end="00:23:33.739" style="s2">otherwise we&#39;re likely going to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.889" end="00:23:36.679" style="s2">experiencing the phenomenon like wheels</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.739" end="00:23:39.759" style="s2">coming off you know small perturbations</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.679" end="00:23:41.899" style="s2">creating bigger perturbations creating D</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.759" end="00:23:43.909" style="s2">destabilization in both sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.899" end="00:23:48.679" style="s2">harder choices leading to a race effect</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.909" end="00:23:49.940" style="s2">into catastrophe so that&#39;s a crisis so</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.679" end="00:23:54.889" style="s2">that&#39;s what I mean by a crisis and sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.940" end="00:23:58.340" style="s2">making so maybe now we can teleport back</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.889" end="00:24:01.190" style="s2">and do some basic models it&#39;s like some</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.340" end="00:24:05.749" style="s2">basic notions and I actually did this in</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.190" end="00:24:08.739" style="s2">the blue church essay so what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.749" end="00:24:14.179" style="s2">introduce is some concepts around</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.739" end="00:24:15.590" style="s2">coherence and yeah I&#39;ll do maybe two</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.179" end="00:24:19.129" style="s2">turns on it at different levels of scale</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.590" end="00:24:20.720" style="s2">so let&#39;s just begin with one eye you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.129" end="00:24:23.749" style="s2">got one eye and that gives you a certain</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.720" end="00:24:26.179" style="s2">level of perception and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.749" end="00:24:26.989" style="s2">two eyes and you may notice the two eyes</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.179" end="00:24:29.869" style="s2">are better than one</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.989" end="00:24:32.809" style="s2">in fact a lot better than one so then</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.869" end="00:24:34.159" style="s2">you might think well and I should stop</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.809" end="00:24:35.509" style="s2">there&#39;s two eyes are better than one but</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.159" end="00:24:37.519" style="s2">it&#39;s actually quite important that</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.509" end="00:24:39.230" style="s2">they&#39;re not independent it&#39;s crucial</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.519" end="00:24:40.909" style="s2">that they be bound into a visual field</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.230" end="00:24:43.789" style="s2">you notice that you actually don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.909" end="00:24:46.269" style="s2">two eyes you see one reality so they are</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.789" end="00:24:49.789" style="s2">coherent so there&#39;s a capacity to have</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.269" end="00:24:52.779" style="s2">diversity of perspective in this case</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.789" end="00:24:55.669" style="s2">and also to integrate it into a</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.779" end="00:24:57.030" style="s2">wholeness of perception so those are all</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.669" end="00:25:00.130" style="s2">part of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.030" end="00:25:03.400" style="s2">chunk so you want to have as an</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.130" end="00:25:06.010" style="s2">increasing diversity of in this case</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.400" end="00:25:09.190" style="s2">perception while maintaining an</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.010" end="00:25:12.040" style="s2">integrated wholeness of perception and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.190" end="00:25:16.870" style="s2">that combination I&#39;m going to call</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.040" end="00:25:17.800" style="s2">coherence of perception at least so then</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.870" end="00:25:20.050" style="s2">you what you might do is you might want</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.800" end="00:25:21.700" style="s2">to add a third eye then that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.050" end="00:25:24.520" style="s2">and flies have multiple eyes that&#39;s neat</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.700" end="00:25:28.120" style="s2">but here&#39;s a better move adhering at</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.520" end="00:25:30.100" style="s2">ears if you had hearing to vision that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.120" end="00:25:33.160" style="s2">a lot lot better than just having three</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.100" end="00:25:35.490" style="s2">eyes because you&#39;ve totally shifted you</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.160" end="00:25:37.840" style="s2">actually have qualitatively different</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.490" end="00:25:39.370" style="s2">perceptive capacities and you might</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.840" end="00:25:40.930" style="s2">notice that for example a very large</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.370" end="00:25:42.490" style="s2">amount of seeing doesn&#39;t really help you</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.930" end="00:25:47.880" style="s2">at all in the domain of hearing and vice</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.490" end="00:25:50.080" style="s2">versa so modal increase in prospective</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.880" end="00:25:51.280" style="s2">capacity and then still being able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.080" end="00:25:53.050" style="s2">integrate that into a wholeness of</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.280" end="00:25:55.960" style="s2">perception of course this is just</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.050" end="00:25:57.580" style="s2">experiencing reality that&#39;s one story</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.960" end="00:25:58.870" style="s2">right that&#39;s own story of coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.580" end="00:26:00.730" style="s2">I&#39;m using that to give you a sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.870" end="00:26:02.290" style="s2">in your own body yes your body is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.730" end="00:26:04.090" style="s2">coherent entity at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.290" end="00:26:07.570" style="s2">perception you have many many many</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.090" end="00:26:10.180" style="s2">different modes and many different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.570" end="00:26:12.670" style="s2">within those modes two ears two eyes</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.180" end="00:26:13.930" style="s2">that are integrated into a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.670" end="00:26:15.640" style="s2">whole mnestheus rise to you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:26:16.540" end="00:26:21.130" style="s2">individual human body is important in</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.130" end="00:26:22.720" style="s2">this story but then we can step it up</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.130" end="00:26:24.780" style="s2">let&#39;s not take a group and now I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.720" end="00:26:26.710" style="s2">to combine both perception and action</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.780" end="00:26:28.690" style="s2">because of course your body does that</p>

<p begin="00:26:37.750" end="00:26:41.500" style="s2">have to have the effort of getting the</p>

<p begin="00:26:43.030" end="00:26:47.920" style="s2">the boat so that&#39;s a a set of functions</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.520" end="00:26:49.300" style="s2">a set of different kinds of perception</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.920" end="00:26:51.310" style="s2">and actuation capacities you have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.300" end="00:26:52.840" style="s2">have some sensitivity to how your weight</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.310" end="00:26:55.270" style="s2">is affecting the way to the boat and how</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.840" end="00:26:57.430" style="s2">to buy higher arms and moving the or</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.270" end="00:26:59.530" style="s2">into the water but as individual as it</p>

<p begin="00:26:59.530" end="00:27:02.440" style="s2">relatively straightforward thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.820" end="00:27:04.090" style="s2">and you can notice this when you go from</p>

<p begin="00:27:06.520" end="00:27:09.160" style="s2">it takes a little bit of time to figure</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.750" end="00:27:10.179" style="s2">out how to get them all together but and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.160" end="00:27:11.829" style="s2">not too long</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.179" end="00:27:13.659" style="s2">you can become coherent you can bring</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.829" end="00:27:18.969" style="s2">tours into coherence you can take the</p>

<p begin="00:27:24.129" end="00:27:27.819" style="s2">it pops you have an insight which to say</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.469" end="00:27:29.289" style="s2">you bring into your body the wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.819" end="00:27:30.069" style="s2">of that you&#39;ve integrated that into a</p>

<p begin="00:27:30.069" end="00:27:35.469" style="s2">you can now actuate ruin the boat but</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.579" end="00:27:37.779" style="s2">now you add another person into the boat</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.469" end="00:27:40.329" style="s2">and notice that there&#39;s a significant</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.779" end="00:27:42.909" style="s2">difference there that two people ruin</p>

<p begin="00:27:42.909" end="00:27:46.359" style="s2">have to use communication you have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.409" end="00:27:48.039" style="s2">actually practice substantially more if</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.359" end="00:27:50.049" style="s2">you get a sense an embodied sense and</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.039" end="00:27:52.719" style="s2">feeling and say so you just wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.049" end="00:27:53.859" style="s2">canoe it&#39;s a little bit easier the</p>

<p begin="00:27:56.589" end="00:28:00.639" style="s2">back is steering while the person in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.509" end="00:28:02.229" style="s2">front is you know just throwing the</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.639" end="00:28:03.879" style="s2">person the backs in charge like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.229" end="00:28:05.949" style="s2">a big bunch of stuff that has to happen</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.879" end="00:28:09.759" style="s2">that enables two people to come into</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.949" end="00:28:12.459" style="s2">coherence and you may be able to scale</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.759" end="00:28:13.779" style="s2">that to say three people but at a</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.459" end="00:28:16.119" style="s2">certain point you actually start seeing</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.779" end="00:28:19.179" style="s2">a phase transition where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.119" end="00:28:21.099" style="s2">particularly now to switch it to Rowan</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.179" end="00:28:23.319" style="s2">with two or so you&#39;ve got three people</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.099" end="00:28:25.119" style="s2">in the boat you really do have to start</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.319" end="00:28:26.739" style="s2">doing division of labor to maintain that</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.119" end="00:28:29.769" style="s2">you have to actually have the guy in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.739" end="00:28:32.529" style="s2">front I suppose who&#39;s yelling stroke</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.769" end="00:28:35.129" style="s2">because otherwise the ability of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.529" end="00:28:38.019" style="s2">individuals to stay coordinated to stay</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.129" end="00:28:39.099" style="s2">perception link to action in a fashion</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.019" end="00:28:41.289" style="s2">that is acting as an integrated whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.099" end="00:28:42.819" style="s2">it&#39;s not up to snuff what we as humans</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.289" end="00:28:45.189" style="s2">haven&#39;t got the capacity to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.819" end="00:28:46.839" style="s2">maintain that much complexity with our</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.189" end="00:28:49.179" style="s2">embodied sensorial without trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.839" end="00:28:51.669" style="s2">simplify the task so we do we simplify</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.179" end="00:28:53.259" style="s2">agency we actually compressed the agency</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.669" end="00:28:55.959" style="s2">and the perception and the actuation</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.259" end="00:28:58.689" style="s2">agency so what happens is you now become</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.959" end="00:29:00.279" style="s2">a instrument you no longer have full</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.689" end="00:29:01.779" style="s2">agency over your choice making or your</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.279" end="00:29:05.169" style="s2">perception you don&#39;t decide when to</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.779" end="00:29:06.459" style="s2">stroke you just do it when told and if</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.169" end="00:29:08.529" style="s2">everybody now is acting in that</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.459" end="00:29:10.089" style="s2">actuation function and you and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.529" end="00:29:12.029" style="s2">person up front is doing it at least a</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.089" end="00:29:15.009" style="s2">mediocre job of keeping a good rhythm</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.029" end="00:29:16.779" style="s2">suddenly you&#39;re now coherent again and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.009" end="00:29:19.359" style="s2">able to go much much faster</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.779" end="00:29:21.519" style="s2">hence the trireme you know the big guy</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.359" end="00:29:23.320" style="s2">with the drums that&#39;s my vision I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.519" end="00:29:28.240" style="s2">British so I don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.320" end="00:29:29.440" style="s2">Oshin okay so that&#39;s a framework now the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.240" end="00:29:37.180" style="s2">reason why I wonder about that framework</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.440" end="00:29:39.640" style="s2">is that this is dynamic between complex</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.180" end="00:29:41.440" style="s2">coherence your body integrated as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.640" end="00:29:44.130" style="s2">whole and what I&#39;m gonna call</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.440" end="00:29:46.750" style="s2">complicated coherence which is this</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.130" end="00:29:51.070" style="s2">relation of simplification and actuation</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.750" end="00:29:53.440" style="s2">through some kind of structure is a big</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.070" end="00:29:55.120" style="s2">part of the rollout of what I&#39;ve come to</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.440" end="00:29:56.950" style="s2">call game a which we might also call</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.120" end="00:30:00.430" style="s2">civilization if you want to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.950" end="00:30:04.810" style="s2">start at fifteen twenty thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.430" end="00:30:09.400" style="s2">and up to ten years from now that story</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.810" end="00:30:11.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s a story where just like moving</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.400" end="00:30:13.090" style="s2">from one person to three people to seven</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.080" end="00:30:16.930" style="s2">people and moving from one art of Tours</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.090" end="00:30:21.780" style="s2">is a story of an increase in the the</p>

<p begin="00:30:31.540" end="00:30:37.950" style="s2">as a group okay so you can then use this</p>

<p begin="00:32:25.270" end="00:32:28.960" style="s2">perspectives on a whole and then try to</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.340" end="00:32:30.790" style="s2">grasp the whole which both he and I are</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.960" end="00:32:33.850" style="s2">urging you to do then you&#39;re in a really</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.790" end="00:32:35.050" style="s2">good place and there&#39;s other people who</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.850" end="00:32:36.400" style="s2">are doing the same kind of thing and</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.050" end="00:32:40.440" style="s2">that&#39;s I think is the key is to be able</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.400" end="00:32:42.760" style="s2">to recognize that they&#39;re each</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.440" end="00:32:46.630" style="s2">perspectives on a whole which happens to</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.760" end="00:32:48.580" style="s2">be by the way reality and if you&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.630" end="00:32:50.260" style="s2">to hold that notion of wholeness and</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.580" end="00:32:52.870" style="s2">then allow the perspective to give you</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.260" end="00:32:54.730" style="s2">sensing into what the wholeness might be</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.870" end="00:32:56.110" style="s2">then you can start dropping into deeper</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.730" end="00:32:57.670" style="s2">insight about the nature of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.110" end="00:33:02.260" style="s2">and then begin to be able to make better</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.670" end="00:33:04.150" style="s2">choices so I&#39;m tempted right now to kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.260" end="00:33:05.320" style="s2">of drop into the blue Church story just</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.150" end="00:33:07.330" style="s2">kind of fast forward well fast forward</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.320" end="00:33:08.710" style="s2">from the axial age yeah I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.330" end="00:33:11.710" style="s2">question that comes up when you talk</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.710" end="00:33:15.250" style="s2">about game a is game a synonymous with</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.710" end="00:33:18.580" style="s2">the blue church no no game a is the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.250" end="00:33:20.250" style="s2">larger but in terms of the structure to</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.580" end="00:33:23.190" style="s2">create coherence that&#39;s the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.250" end="00:33:26.110" style="s2">blue church is the very specific</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.190" end="00:33:29.760" style="s2">solution to the problem during the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.110" end="00:33:31.050" style="s2">timeframe between roughly 1930 through</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.050" end="00:33:42.550" style="s2">2016 and so it&#39;s a in much the same way</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.990" end="00:33:44.980" style="s2">that say pre airshow Tilian Athens had a</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.550" end="00:33:47.500" style="s2">solution to the problem the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.980" end="00:33:50.020" style="s2">is a historically specific solution to</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.500" end="00:33:53.240" style="s2">the problem of which game a is the gen</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.020" end="00:33:54.740" style="s2">category of establishing coherence of</p>

<p begin="00:33:56.450" end="00:34:12.370" style="s2">you want to be precise so using some</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.570" end="00:34:15.410" style="s2">combination of simplification and causal</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.370" end="00:34:18.800" style="s2">mechanism to be able to establish</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.410" end="00:34:22.370" style="s2">coherence in perception and meaning</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.800" end="00:34:25.010" style="s2">making in an actuation so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.370" end="00:34:26.270" style="s2">game a and then we get a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.010" end="00:34:30.110" style="s2">precision what I mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.270" end="00:34:32.900" style="s2">so we talked about as a rower when you</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.110" end="00:34:34.910" style="s2">shift from being a fully autonomous free</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.900" end="00:34:35.540" style="s2">agent to being the guy who just does</p>

<p begin="00:34:35.540" end="00:34:43.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what I mean I say simplification</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.150" end="00:34:46.160" style="s2">and bounding choice within a straight</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.280" end="00:34:49.100" style="s2">causal context so if you remember Henry</p>

<p begin="00:34:49.100" end="00:34:54.170" style="s2">color you want as long as it&#39;s black</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.530" end="00:34:56.420" style="s2">that kind of an idea you take choice the</p>

<p begin="00:34:56.420" end="00:35:04.970" style="s2">choice and you put it in a box you get a</p>

<p begin="00:35:04.970" end="00:35:09.620" style="s2">make a machining right you can say the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.620" end="00:35:12.170" style="s2">game a is a machine ik structure it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.620" end="00:35:13.730" style="s2">fundamentally computational in nature of</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.170" end="00:35:14.990" style="s2">course it&#39;s always complicated by the</p>

<p begin="00:35:19.940" end="00:35:26.180" style="s2">it in its essence is of that sort and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.870" end="00:35:27.590" style="s2">every Barack bureaucracy is an effort to</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.180" end="00:35:29.480" style="s2">do that right you want to have very</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.590" end="00:35:31.130" style="s2">well-defined processes and very</p>

<p begin="00:35:34.730" end="00:35:42.140" style="s2">have choice within that box and so you</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.980" end="00:35:44.660" style="s2">can put the bottle cap on the bottle or</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.140" end="00:35:47.660" style="s2">not but that&#39;s it that&#39;s what you do on</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.660" end="00:35:49.490" style="s2">the assembly line or what is it you file</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.660" end="00:35:51.200" style="s2">the weenus and you check one of three</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.490" end="00:35:52.490" style="s2">boxes and then you you put it out there</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.200" end="00:35:55.250" style="s2">or you fill in the spreadsheet and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.490" end="00:35:58.760" style="s2">input an output or you try to turn human</p>

<p begin="00:36:19.930" end="00:36:23.860" style="s2">system that is gaming there&#39;s a couple</p>

<p begin="00:36:23.860" end="00:36:30.580" style="s2">very good way of looking at it and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.190" end="00:36:32.230" style="s2">what we find is over time and remember</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.580" end="00:36:34.900" style="s2">there&#39;s three different dimensions you</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.230" end="00:36:38.920" style="s2">have in relationship with nature with</p>

<p begin="00:37:39.610" end="00:37:43.900" style="s2">have stories like the the Tainter curve</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.920" end="00:37:45.760" style="s2">that talks about how and why these kinds</p>

<p begin="00:37:51.220" end="00:37:57.310" style="s2">you&#39;d like and we could talk about why</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.210" end="00:37:58.960" style="s2">they fail I think it was I think that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.310" end="00:38:01.090" style="s2">the segue into the blue church was was</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.960" end="00:38:03.100" style="s2">good yes okay so so now we&#39;re gonna move</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.090" end="00:38:05.620" style="s2">to the blue church so what we do is we</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.100" end="00:38:07.030" style="s2">have a if you don&#39;t mind maybe I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.620" end="00:38:09.640" style="s2">recapitulate that story I think I can do</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.030" end="00:38:12.010" style="s2">it pretty quickly so we&#39;re exiting what</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.640" end="00:38:15.079" style="s2">I call the Victorian synthesis I were</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.010" end="00:38:17.599" style="s2">talking the time frame roughly 1852 now</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.079" end="00:38:19.309" style="s2">ten or so and we&#39;re entering into a</p>

<p begin="00:38:20.630" end="00:38:24.349" style="s2">not a Bronze Age collapse it&#39;s pretty</p>

<p begin="00:38:24.349" end="00:38:28.069" style="s2">of World War one to the end of World War</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.880" end="00:38:30.589" style="s2">two which you may remember kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.069" end="00:38:33.200" style="s2">sucked and a lot of stuff happened like</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.589" end="00:38:35.059" style="s2">a lot of change Kurt in that context the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.200" end="00:38:36.890" style="s2">Titanic always feels like this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.059" end="00:38:42.170" style="s2">weird harbinger of life that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.890" end="00:38:45.200" style="s2">you watch Downton Abbey panic seems like</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.170" end="00:38:47.989" style="s2">a weird harbinger of yes it has that</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.200" end="00:38:49.700" style="s2">archetypical feeling of a portent yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.989" end="00:38:54.079" style="s2">and of course it is right it&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.700" end="00:38:55.670" style="s2">hey Victorian synthesis complex reality</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.079" end="00:38:58.400" style="s2">is still out there and you have not yet</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.670" end="00:38:59.930" style="s2">in fact conquered it which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.400" end="00:39:02.420" style="s2">kind of the moral lesson of course then</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.930" end="00:39:07.219" style="s2">world war once it was a demoralization</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.420" end="00:39:08.900" style="s2">of the sense of mastery in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.219" end="00:39:11.809" style="s2">that complicated had finally mastered</p>

<p begin="00:39:14.390" end="00:39:22.640" style="s2">delve into the meltdown of culture</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.609" end="00:39:25.069" style="s2">mostly in Germany but elsewhere and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.640" end="00:39:28.369" style="s2">we got to delve into what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.069" end="00:39:30.170" style="s2">culture melts down and then we got to</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.369" end="00:39:33.680" style="s2">build the blue church alright so coming</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.170" end="00:39:35.359" style="s2">out of World War two we have a new state</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.680" end="00:39:37.130" style="s2">of affairs so a new set of problems</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.359" end="00:39:39.949" style="s2">instead of capacities with which to</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.130" end="00:39:41.089" style="s2">engage in trying to bring the</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.949" end="00:39:46.400" style="s2">complicated relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.089" end="00:39:50.539" style="s2">complex so we have the mass production</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.400" end="00:39:53.390" style="s2">so the movement of industrial like</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.539" end="00:39:55.009" style="s2">trains to cars and in post-world War two</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.390" end="00:39:56.479" style="s2">mass production of cars like the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.009" end="00:40:00.400" style="s2">invention people a to produce a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.479" end="00:40:02.269" style="s2">it and so the significant economic</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.400" end="00:40:04.849" style="s2">dislocation that that involves in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.269" end="00:40:06.799" style="s2">massive wealth at least in in the US and</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.849" end="00:40:10.519" style="s2">then ultimately percolating out into the</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.799" end="00:40:13.190" style="s2">quote-unquote first world you have mass</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.519" end="00:40:15.949" style="s2">media and you have the ability first</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.190" end="00:40:17.630" style="s2">earn in the earliest stages mostly radio</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.949" end="00:40:18.739" style="s2">but then transitioning very quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.630" end="00:40:20.509" style="s2">for the dominant period of the blue</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.739" end="00:40:21.890" style="s2">church television right has lots of</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.509" end="00:40:23.989" style="s2">characteristics people probably zoom in</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.890" end="00:40:26.090" style="s2">on back is it so important but let me do</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.989" end="00:40:28.490" style="s2">a few more you have education</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.090" end="00:40:30.200" style="s2">the formal structure of like for example</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.490" end="00:40:33.820" style="s2">the missile gap during the Kennedy years</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.200" end="00:40:36.530" style="s2">to vastly increase the intensity of</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.820" end="00:40:38.240" style="s2">expenditure and effort on college</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.530" end="00:40:40.220" style="s2">education at the number of kids who went</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.240" end="00:40:41.870" style="s2">to college through the arc of the blue</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.220" end="00:40:43.250" style="s2">shirts went from I think like twenty</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.870" end="00:40:45.800" style="s2">percent to eighty five percent or</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.250" end="00:40:49.160" style="s2">something like that so significant and</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.800" end="00:40:51.080" style="s2">the the normalization of education</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.160" end="00:40:54.470" style="s2">because obviously when high school is no</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.080" end="00:40:56.690" style="s2">longer a end of itself but is part of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.470" end="00:40:58.070" style="s2">larger story it now becomes some train</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.690" end="00:41:03.200" style="s2">to a bigger structure now becomes</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.070" end="00:41:05.210" style="s2">normalized as a single object a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.200" end="00:41:06.800" style="s2">people you know the population went from</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.210" end="00:41:08.750" style="s2">100 million in the u.s. to 300 million</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.800" end="00:41:11.270" style="s2">during that arc so it&#39;s a lot and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.750" end="00:41:12.710" style="s2">of urbanization and by the way mixing of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.270" end="00:41:14.330" style="s2">demographics because you had the</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.710" end="00:41:16.010" style="s2">interstate highway system allowed people</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.330" end="00:41:18.380" style="s2">in cars to drive around so you had the</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.010" end="00:41:20.750" style="s2">massive diaspora of moving from city</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.380" end="00:41:22.850" style="s2">centers into the suburbs and moving from</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.750" end="00:41:26.120" style="s2">the east to the west and the south so a</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.850" end="00:41:28.070" style="s2">lot of change happened and the blue</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.120" end="00:41:29.750" style="s2">church emerged in the context of having</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.070" end="00:41:32.900" style="s2">to figure out how to navigate all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.750" end="00:41:34.730" style="s2">these changes and generate coherence how</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.900" end="00:41:37.400" style="s2">do we get all of these people with these</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.730" end="00:41:39.320" style="s2">new capacities to be able to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.400" end="00:41:41.000" style="s2">of the world in some fashion that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.320" end="00:41:42.860" style="s2">able to then make choices together and</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.000" end="00:41:46.910" style="s2">to act effectively right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.860" end="00:41:48.620" style="s2">question and the blue church developed</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.910" end="00:41:50.390" style="s2">to be the answer to that question</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.620" end="00:41:52.430" style="s2">and so it developed the ability to say</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.390" end="00:41:56.920" style="s2">for example you use the education system</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.430" end="00:42:00.530" style="s2">to establish an embodied sense of</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.920" end="00:42:06.890" style="s2">vertical meritocratic hierarchy the idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.530" end="00:42:09.620" style="s2">that some people are better at others in</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.890" end="00:42:12.260" style="s2">knowing certain kinds of things we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.620" end="00:42:14.330" style="s2">find them and then we empower them to</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.260" end="00:42:16.490" style="s2">have hierarchical authority in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.330" end="00:42:17.800" style="s2">structure that we&#39;re in and I should say</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.490" end="00:42:21.230" style="s2">this by the way both formally and</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.800" end="00:42:23.840" style="s2">informally you know the role of being in</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.230" end="00:42:25.790" style="s2">class is teaching that whether the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.840" end="00:42:27.590" style="s2">content of the story of the of the class</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.790" end="00:42:29.540" style="s2">whatever the in the class is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.590" end="00:42:32.300" style="s2">experience of the student is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.540" end="00:42:35.930" style="s2">teachers in charge our job is just to</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.300" end="00:42:38.120" style="s2">listen and some of us are smart and they</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.930" end="00:42:39.320" style="s2">get to be teachers or in charge right</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.120" end="00:42:42.620" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of that&#39;s the story</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.320" end="00:42:44.120" style="s2">school it&#39;s very important that first</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.620" end="00:42:46.520" style="s2">part that there&#39;s a relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.120" end="00:42:48.440" style="s2">authority and receptor that has a</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.520" end="00:42:51.770" style="s2">broadcast modality so the blue church is</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.440" end="00:42:53.300" style="s2">very broadcast across its entire mode so</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.770" end="00:42:55.460" style="s2">what I mean by a broadcast of course is</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.300" end="00:42:59.570" style="s2">exemplified in television which is to</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.460" end="00:43:02.900" style="s2">say that some small number of people get</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.570" end="00:43:04.850" style="s2">to speak and a very very large number of</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.900" end="00:43:07.760" style="s2">people get to listen this is very</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.850" end="00:43:09.290" style="s2">different and then say but we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.760" end="00:43:11.120" style="s2">right here and it&#39;s it&#39;s symmetric</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.290" end="00:43:12.500" style="s2">well of course I&#39;m the one speaking in</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.120" end="00:43:13.700" style="s2">principle there&#39;s nothing about this</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.500" end="00:43:16.100" style="s2">conversation that couldn&#39;t be perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.700" end="00:43:18.080" style="s2">symmetric but in television in any kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.100" end="00:43:20.510" style="s2">of broadcast modality structurally that</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.080" end="00:43:22.370" style="s2">way so Walter Cronkite tells the news</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.510" end="00:43:24.260" style="s2">and everybody else watches it and</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.370" end="00:43:29.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of passivity there like my</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.260" end="00:43:32.860" style="s2">job is not to perceive what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.960" end="00:43:36.530" style="s2">make sense of it and then express it in</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.860" end="00:43:39.170" style="s2">the world my job is to see the story</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.530" end="00:43:41.960" style="s2">that I&#39;m being told and be able to then</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.170" end="00:43:44.810" style="s2">express that story effectively in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.960" end="00:43:48.010" style="s2">society that I&#39;m in and I call this good</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.810" end="00:43:50.630" style="s2">sense the emergence of good sense and</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.010" end="00:43:52.370" style="s2">you see an emerging mesh of good sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.630" end="00:43:56.210" style="s2">you know who are the authoritative</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.370" end="00:43:58.610" style="s2">speakers whether they&#39;re NBC News or</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.210" end="00:44:00.140" style="s2">they&#39;re the New York Times and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.610" end="00:44:01.850" style="s2">diversity of course these are a variety</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.140" end="00:44:03.340" style="s2">of different perspectives in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.850" end="00:44:05.420" style="s2">authoritative frameworks the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.340" end="00:44:07.490" style="s2">recognizes the necessity of having eyes</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.420" end="00:44:09.110" style="s2">and ears but it also recognizes the</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.490" end="00:44:10.820" style="s2">necessity of having coherence so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.110" end="00:44:15.200" style="s2">a diversity but there&#39;s a diversity</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.820" end="00:44:17.240" style="s2">within a particular boundary and so when</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.200" end="00:44:19.880" style="s2">you show up in society if you are</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.240" end="00:44:22.040" style="s2">speaking good sense if your expressions</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.880" end="00:44:23.300" style="s2">are of the sort that everybody else has</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.040" end="00:44:25.550" style="s2">broadly been hearing or the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.300" end="00:44:29.720" style="s2">authoritative statements then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.550" end="00:44:31.100" style="s2">showing up well and if you aren&#39;t then</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.720" end="00:44:32.750" style="s2">you&#39;re showing up poorly and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.100" end="00:44:34.130" style="s2">notice that I can you begin to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.750" end="00:44:36.410" style="s2">things that are contour narrative in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.130" end="00:44:37.910" style="s2">deep way even today much less so now</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.410" end="00:44:39.980" style="s2">though than like 30 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.910" end="00:44:41.900" style="s2">then you will notice an discomfort</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.980" end="00:44:44.090" style="s2">people get uncomfortable viscerally</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.900" end="00:44:45.260" style="s2">physically and you will notice that</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.090" end="00:44:46.910" style="s2">discomfort of this way physically and</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.260" end="00:44:48.530" style="s2">then you&#39;ll stop doing it and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.910" end="00:44:50.180" style="s2">a nice policing mechanism there just at</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.530" end="00:44:51.230" style="s2">the cocktail party set particularly</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.180" end="00:44:52.820" style="s2">places like say New York Los Angeles</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.230" end="00:44:56.120" style="s2">Chicago</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.820" end="00:44:58.730" style="s2">sisqó where the the elite cachet is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.120" end="00:45:00.460" style="s2">most important where the choice of</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.730" end="00:45:03.080" style="s2">social success is the choice between</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.460" end="00:45:06.380" style="s2">being elevated in the hierarchy or not</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.080" end="00:45:08.030" style="s2">then good sense becomes even more self</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.380" end="00:45:10.960" style="s2">concern so good opinion so I good</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.030" end="00:45:13.130" style="s2">opinion thank you thank you good opinion</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.960" end="00:45:14.810" style="s2">and it&#39;s actually interesting to make</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.130" end="00:45:16.010" style="s2">that distinction because the effort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.810" end="00:45:20.450" style="s2">the blue church is actually provide good</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.010" end="00:45:22.880" style="s2">sense and what is the truth about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.450" end="00:45:24.770" style="s2">war in Vietnam but of course what it can</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.880" end="00:45:27.020" style="s2">only produces good opinion what is our</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.770" end="00:45:29.330" style="s2">perspective and then make sure everybody</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.020" end="00:45:30.890" style="s2">more or less has that because then you</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.330" end="00:45:32.180" style="s2">can actually have choices you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.890" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">actually make choices together if we all</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.180" end="00:45:36.470" style="s2">more or less agree this is the nature of</p>

<p begin="00:51:49.680" end="00:51:53.130" style="s2">growing up in the Texas Hill Country I</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.540" end="00:51:55.290" style="s2">wasn&#39;t having this kind of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.130" end="00:51:57.000" style="s2">and I think most people don&#39;t so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.290" end="00:51:58.380" style="s2">an example like that that that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.000" end="00:52:00.080" style="s2">artifact that emerges out of the notion</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.380" end="00:52:02.130" style="s2">of the blue church that once you have a</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.080" end="00:52:03.450" style="s2">vertical hierarchy and then by</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.130" end="00:52:06.000" style="s2">definition you have a finite amount of</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.450" end="00:52:07.020" style="s2">time you get clusters of these people</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.000" end="00:52:08.310" style="s2">who are hanging together and then by the</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.020" end="00:52:11.250" style="s2">way a lot of that human complexity</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.310" end="00:52:12.840" style="s2">creeps back in they start having clubs</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.250" end="00:52:14.670" style="s2">cliques they start caring about each</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.840" end="00:52:16.260" style="s2">other and that&#39;s what&#39;s lurking a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.670" end="00:52:18.510" style="s2">group think that good opinion stress to</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.260" end="00:52:22.560" style="s2">really solidify and they become blind to</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.510" end="00:52:23.850" style="s2">what&#39;s not within that good opinion yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.560" end="00:52:25.380" style="s2">in fact so at this point and introduce</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.850" end="00:52:26.790" style="s2">another concept it&#39;s kind of a deep</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.380" end="00:52:28.230" style="s2">concept it&#39;s very useful and then it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.790" end="00:52:34.070" style="s2">help us navigate the transition of</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.230" end="00:52:34.070" style="s2">what&#39;s happening so here the concept is</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.660" end="00:52:43.590" style="s2">that&#39;s a bundle so what we&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.990" end="00:52:46.050" style="s2">Fitness landscapes we&#39;re going to do the</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.590" end="00:52:49.050" style="s2">idea of excellence and remarque ability</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.050" end="00:52:51.120" style="s2">and then we&#39;re gonna do niche</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.050" end="00:52:51.570" style="s2">construction okay I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.120" end="00:52:55.380" style="s2">take that long</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.570" end="00:52:56.940" style="s2">very helpful so Fitness landscape is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.380" end="00:53:00.390" style="s2">concept that originated in evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.940" end="00:53:02.460" style="s2">theory biological evolutionary theory</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.390" end="00:53:04.560" style="s2">but evolutionary theory has become more</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.460" end="00:53:05.790" style="s2">and more meta so it covers a much more</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.560" end="00:53:08.030" style="s2">abstract function so the fitness</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.790" end="00:53:11.840" style="s2">landscape is an abstract concept and</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.030" end="00:53:17.340" style="s2">what it describes is where you have</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.840" end="00:53:18.810" style="s2">agents that have resource needs and will</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.340" end="00:53:20.340" style="s2">find themselves in conflict with each</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.810" end="00:53:22.500" style="s2">other and with the environment to</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.340" end="00:53:24.960" style="s2">acquire their resources and have an</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.500" end="00:53:26.580" style="s2">agency then certain kinds of things are</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.960" end="00:53:29.640" style="s2">going to happen and the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.580" end="00:53:31.050" style="s2">describes what strategies what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.640" end="00:53:33.060" style="s2">approach is what kind of agenting</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.050" end="00:53:35.490" style="s2">choices or capacity to make choices will</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.060" end="00:53:39.150" style="s2">end up being successful and then as it</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.490" end="00:53:40.290" style="s2">turns out if strategy effective strategy</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.150" end="00:53:40.980" style="s2">can be passed down in either</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.290" end="00:53:42.220" style="s2">moment-to-moment</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.980" end="00:53:45.039" style="s2">or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.220" end="00:53:47.530" style="s2">child to parent to child then you start</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.039" end="00:53:48.940" style="s2">getting concentrations around good</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.530" end="00:53:52.210" style="s2">strategies because those were successful</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.940" end="00:53:55.059" style="s2">repeat so if you look at a fitness</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.210" end="00:53:57.220" style="s2">landscape for example in the Arctic the</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.059" end="00:53:59.260" style="s2">strategy of being a dark black rabbit is</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.220" end="00:54:01.750" style="s2">poor and so you might think of it as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.260" end="00:54:04.180" style="s2">valley it&#39;s a very low Fitness choice</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.750" end="00:54:05.980" style="s2">and so nothing survives for very long</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.180" end="00:54:09.099" style="s2">down there whereas the strategy of being</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.980" end="00:54:10.990" style="s2">a perfectly white fuzzy bunny is good so</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.099" end="00:54:12.520" style="s2">it&#39;s very high point and if you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.990" end="00:54:14.530" style="s2">you were to change the fitness landscape</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.520" end="00:54:17.500" style="s2">so taking my two bunnies and shift them</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.530" end="00:54:18.640" style="s2">to put it be say in the desert when</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.500" end="00:54:22.510" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s a brown bunny just to make it</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.640" end="00:54:24.460" style="s2">a better metaphor Sandra the bunnies are</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.510" end="00:54:26.200" style="s2">the same the landscape just inverted so</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.460" end="00:54:28.059" style="s2">now being a bright white fuzzy bunny is</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.200" end="00:54:30.190" style="s2">bad you&#39;re gonna die out and being a</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.059" end="00:54:33.460" style="s2">brown Jackrabbit is good you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.190" end="00:54:35.470" style="s2">survivor is the relationship so then if</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.460" end="00:54:37.930" style="s2">you imagine that Fitness landscapes have</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.470" end="00:54:40.690" style="s2">a certain topography and a certain</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.930" end="00:54:42.220" style="s2">variability so topography meaning what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.690" end="00:54:43.210" style="s2">the shape of the hills is there one big</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.220" end="00:54:44.589" style="s2">hill right in the middle or there a</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.210" end="00:54:46.180" style="s2">whole bunch of little hills and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.589" end="00:54:46.660" style="s2">the spacing between them and how long do</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.180" end="00:54:48.430" style="s2">they last</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.660" end="00:54:52.119" style="s2">is it fluctuated wildly or is it just</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.430" end="00:54:53.920" style="s2">like one massive hill forever and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.119" end="00:54:58.119" style="s2">gonna define a concept called excellence</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.920" end="00:54:58.869" style="s2">I think Brett one side actually uses</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.119" end="00:55:00.970" style="s2">different terms</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.869" end="00:55:02.470" style="s2">so I&#39;ll just define them that I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.970" end="00:55:04.900" style="s2">sure he does richer uses the right terms</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.470" end="00:55:09.720" style="s2">but I&#39;ll use my terms so excellence here</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.900" end="00:55:13.450" style="s2">refers to a strategy which is about</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.720" end="00:55:17.319" style="s2">climbing the hill you&#39;re on and getting</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.450" end="00:55:18.670" style="s2">very good at holding the top so if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.319" end="00:55:20.289" style="s2">on a landscape that is defined by a</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.670" end="00:55:21.670" style="s2">small number of large Hills and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.289" end="00:55:23.410" style="s2">doesn&#39;t change very much excellence is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.670" end="00:55:26.020" style="s2">very good strategy if I happen to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.410" end="00:55:27.970" style="s2">near the bottom vaguely near the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.020" end="00:55:29.799" style="s2">of a good hill then what I do is I climb</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.970" end="00:55:30.359" style="s2">them all the way to the top and then I</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.799" end="00:55:33.279" style="s2">stay there</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.359" end="00:55:36.819" style="s2">saber-tooth Tiger goldman sachs banker</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.279" end="00:55:39.250" style="s2">all right excellence so then the next</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.819" end="00:55:40.900" style="s2">concept is remarkable it&#39;s so smooth</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.250" end="00:55:43.480" style="s2">Bally crossing sorry that&#39;s the formal</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.900" end="00:55:47.109" style="s2">term so if I&#39;m in an environment where</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.480" end="00:55:50.079" style="s2">there may be in fact many hills that</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.109" end="00:55:53.470" style="s2">maybe not aren&#39;t so tall or just many</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.079" end="00:55:55.800" style="s2">hills and or a lot of variability then</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.470" end="00:55:57.630" style="s2">excellence starts to be a pretty poor</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.800" end="00:55:59.490" style="s2">because there&#39;s a lot of competition</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.630" end="00:56:02.099" style="s2">trying to get to the top of that one big</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.490" end="00:56:03.780" style="s2">hill everybody&#39;s right there it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.099" end="00:56:05.310" style="s2">hard to get to the top and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.780" end="00:56:07.440" style="s2">aren&#39;t the very top being third or</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.310" end="00:56:09.060" style="s2">fourth tier really sucks if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.440" end="00:56:10.619" style="s2">possible for me to go down for a little</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.060" end="00:56:12.090" style="s2">bit which isn&#39;t great</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.619" end="00:56:13.080" style="s2">I better get across at a different Hill</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.090" end="00:56:14.280" style="s2">when there&#39;s less competition that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.080" end="00:56:16.020" style="s2">awesome so this is the remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.280" end="00:56:17.750" style="s2">strategy the valley crossing strategy</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.020" end="00:56:20.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a very different strategy and</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.750" end="00:56:21.840" style="s2">equivalently if it turns out that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.640" end="00:56:22.760" style="s2">all in this big hill and then it goes</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.840" end="00:56:25.590" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.760" end="00:56:27.960" style="s2">whoever had the capacity to go somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.590" end="00:56:29.910" style="s2">else wins survives and who didn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.960" end="00:56:31.680" style="s2">rates the saber-tooth tiger goes extinct</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.910" end="00:56:35.820" style="s2">and it turns out these two strategies</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.680" end="00:56:38.190" style="s2">have a certain tension so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.820" end="00:56:39.630" style="s2">really optimizing for excellence what</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.190" end="00:56:41.369" style="s2">are the things you&#39;ll have to do is get</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.630" end="00:56:43.680" style="s2">rid of your remarkable this to make room</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.369" end="00:56:46.470" style="s2">for more excellence you become a</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.680" end="00:56:48.990" style="s2">signature tiger or a Tyrannosaurus Rex</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.470" end="00:56:53.790" style="s2">if you&#39;re really optimizing for</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.990" end="00:56:54.869" style="s2">remarkable nough specialization of</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.790" end="00:56:58.410" style="s2">excellence and so you&#39;re not gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.869" end="00:57:00.480" style="s2">able to be as effective so then they add</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.410" end="00:57:02.790" style="s2">finally niche construction it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.480" end="00:57:05.970" style="s2">important so niche construction is your</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.790" end="00:57:08.910" style="s2">strategy is not just responsive to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.970" end="00:57:11.550" style="s2">niche passively it&#39;s able to feedback on</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.910" end="00:57:13.560" style="s2">the niche actively that&#39;s you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.550" end="00:57:16.380" style="s2">transform the fitness landscape into</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.560" end="00:57:20.609" style="s2">something that by hypothesis you prefer</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.380" end="00:57:23.099" style="s2">so if the brown bunny could somehow say</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.609" end="00:57:24.750" style="s2">put a lot of sand on the Arctic and turn</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.099" end="00:57:26.910" style="s2">up the temperature and convert the</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.750" end="00:57:29.580" style="s2">Arctic into the desert it would do so</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.910" end="00:57:31.200" style="s2">that&#39;s niche construction now of course</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.580" end="00:57:33.089" style="s2">you can imagine that when excellence</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.200" end="00:57:34.830" style="s2">combines with excellence at niche</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.089" end="00:57:35.580" style="s2">construction you get a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.830" end="00:57:39.960" style="s2">dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.580" end="00:57:43.140" style="s2">it turns the fitness landscape into a</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.960" end="00:57:44.940" style="s2">hill and then it keeps it there and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.140" end="00:57:47.220" style="s2">it becomes more and more excellent so I</p>

<p begin="01:07:36.930" end="01:07:44.310" style="s2">that when we can there&#39;s very good</p>

<p begin="01:07:44.310" end="01:07:51.120" style="s2">is done meaning that it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.000" end="01:07:52.980" style="s2">senescence stage and senescence has a</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.120" end="01:07:54.000" style="s2">characteristic where when you move into</p>

<p begin="01:07:54.000" end="01:07:57.960" style="s2">downhill pretty quickly so I&#39;m expecting</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.100" end="01:08:00.960" style="s2">to see the blue church sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.960" end="01:08:04.700" style="s2">increasingly obviously failing and</p>

<p begin="01:08:22.049" end="01:08:26.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not the whole thing and it seems to</p>

<p begin="01:08:28.140" end="01:08:34.620" style="s2">what that&#39;s the key I run our in a space</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.140" end="01:08:38.819" style="s2">for in that space between 1918 and 1945</p>

<p begin="01:09:21.150" end="01:09:28.319" style="s2">exploding because it had nowhere to to</p>

<p begin="01:10:40.800" end="01:10:45.980" style="s2">up to the commonplace if you kind of see</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.360" end="01:10:50.159" style="s2">the the struggle between blue church</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.980" end="01:10:51.960" style="s2">normative good opinion and new</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.159" end="01:10:53.550" style="s2">structures of sense making and new</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.960" end="01:10:55.560" style="s2">structures of meaning making a new Jeff</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.550" end="01:10:57.989" style="s2">structures of how those are beginning to</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.560" end="01:10:59.400" style="s2">try to cohere into actually sovereign</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.989" end="01:11:01.770" style="s2">collective intelligences that are able</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.400" end="01:11:02.909" style="s2">to do the whole the whole thing but</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.770" end="01:11:08.270" style="s2">we&#39;re a bit of the way is there for sure</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.909" end="01:11:11.580" style="s2">it&#39;ll take certainly single-digit years</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.270" end="01:11:12.840" style="s2">and possibly double digit years for the</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.580" end="01:11:16.199" style="s2">whole thing to come together to a point</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.840" end="01:11:18.330" style="s2">where it&#39;s transitioned formally we talk</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.199" end="01:11:21.659" style="s2">about discernment and how that&#39;s a key</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.330" end="01:11:24.690" style="s2">skill in decentralized media compared to</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.659" end="01:11:26.400" style="s2">broadcast media oh absolutely so so now</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.690" end="01:11:28.219" style="s2">the the conversation which i think is</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.400" end="01:11:33.510" style="s2">really nice is turning to</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.219" end="01:11:35.150" style="s2">now what and how so the answer now what</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.510" end="01:11:38.599" style="s2">is decentralize collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.150" end="01:11:44.639" style="s2">great how how do we do that</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.599" end="01:11:47.429" style="s2">so I said first step is know that you</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.639" end="01:11:51.000" style="s2">don&#39;t know know that most of your habits</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.429" end="01:11:52.619" style="s2">are blue church habits in fact most your</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.000" end="01:11:53.699" style="s2">average even gamei habits but let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.619" end="01:11:56.670" style="s2">leave it up to church right now</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.699" end="01:11:57.960" style="s2">and certainly everything you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.670" end="01:11:59.340" style="s2">formally taught and everything you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.960" end="01:12:01.710" style="s2">learned from formal institutions and</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.340" end="01:12:04.820" style="s2">almost all those are gonna be wrong so</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.710" end="01:12:04.820" style="s2">you have to actually step into a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.349" end="01:12:14.929" style="s2">child&#39;s mind place and as a rule of</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.949" end="01:12:19.080" style="s2">thumb go very slowly and don&#39;t try to</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.929" end="01:12:22.440" style="s2">come to doing come to action very</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.080" end="01:12:24.989" style="s2">quickly step-by-step you have to learn</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.440" end="01:12:26.820" style="s2">was it you have to stand before you walk</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.989" end="01:12:31.650" style="s2">and to walk before you run and this is</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.820" end="01:12:32.909" style="s2">very much developmental so within that</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.650" end="01:12:34.110" style="s2">context what are some of the core</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.909" end="01:12:36.270" style="s2">capacities that are part of our</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.110" end="01:12:37.320" style="s2">development of stage for us to actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.270" end="01:12:39.719" style="s2">be able to move this decentralized</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.320" end="01:12:41.280" style="s2">collective intelligence forward and one</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.719" end="01:12:46.790" style="s2">of the core capacities is discernment</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.280" end="01:12:52.290" style="s2">and I will distinguish discernment from</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.790" end="01:12:53.760" style="s2">st. judgment or good opinion so and oh</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.290" end="01:12:56.460" style="s2">and here I would like to actually invoke</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.760" end="01:12:58.170" style="s2">the distinction between thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.460" end="01:12:59.550" style="s2">simulated thinking so let me just do</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.170" end="01:13:03.510" style="s2">that distinction really quickly and then</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.550" end="01:13:05.250" style="s2">come back to discernment so if we</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.510" end="01:13:06.449" style="s2">remember that a lot of the way of</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.250" end="01:13:08.340" style="s2">thinking about the fundamental structure</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.449" end="01:13:10.010" style="s2">of game a and in this case specifically</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.340" end="01:13:16.139" style="s2">the structure of the blue church is</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.010" end="01:13:19.199" style="s2">computational in nature there&#39;s a schema</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.139" end="01:13:21.000" style="s2">of information which is simply true and</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.199" end="01:13:24.719" style="s2">your job is to simply learn it as a</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.000" end="01:13:27.420" style="s2">schema like know the map and to be able</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.719" end="01:13:29.190" style="s2">to repeat it back with fidelity and if</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.420" end="01:13:32.159" style="s2">there if then statements to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.190" end="01:13:34.020" style="s2">execute on identifying what is the if</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.159" end="01:13:37.380" style="s2">what&#39;s the pattern that is present and</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.020" end="01:13:41.220" style="s2">then execute on the then so</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.380" end="01:13:43.230" style="s2">if I say read press the red button your</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.220" end="01:13:45.570" style="s2">job is to be able to know that I said</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.230" end="01:13:47.060" style="s2">read and then to press the red button</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.570" end="01:13:53.550" style="s2">when I say computational function</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.060" end="01:13:57.060" style="s2">bureaucratic game a and when I&#39;m in that</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.550" end="01:13:57.720" style="s2">mode there&#39;s a optimization for being</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.060" end="01:13:59.700" style="s2">able to do that</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.720" end="01:14:01.560" style="s2">which is to be able to do so quickly and</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.700" end="01:14:03.060" style="s2">with fidelity I want to become a really</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.560" end="01:14:06.030" style="s2">good computer I want to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.060" end="01:14:08.940" style="s2">recognize do pattern recognition against</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.030" end="01:14:11.160" style="s2">the patterns that are available very</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.940" end="01:14:12.270" style="s2">rapidly and never get it wrong and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.160" end="01:14:14.190" style="s2">I want to be able to output the</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.270" end="01:14:15.780" style="s2">appropriate output very rapidly it was</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.190" end="01:14:19.830" style="s2">high fidelity I mean if you ever played</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.780" end="01:14:21.720" style="s2">the game where you did math challenges</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.830" end="01:14:22.890" style="s2">where a kid would stand up the kid next</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.720" end="01:14:24.810" style="s2">him would stand up the teacher would</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.890" end="01:14:26.910" style="s2">sure like four times four and whoever</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.810" end="01:14:29.100" style="s2">said the answer right got to move things</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.910" end="01:14:31.410" style="s2">called around the world that is this</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.100" end="01:14:33.660" style="s2">precisely right your job is to know your</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.410" end="01:14:35.010" style="s2">math tables down pat to be able to see</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.660" end="01:14:36.360" style="s2">four by four before the other kid is</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.010" end="01:14:39.120" style="s2">even figured out what the board says</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.360" end="01:14:41.750" style="s2">you&#39;re saying eight that is a simulated</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.120" end="01:14:45.900" style="s2">intelligence optimization function and</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.750" end="01:14:48.090" style="s2">then this other side thinking from</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.900" end="01:14:52.500" style="s2">similar to thinking - thinking thinking</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.090" end="01:14:53.640" style="s2">is a very different gig thinking is well</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.500" end="01:14:56.810" style="s2">it&#39;s so different I have to actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.640" end="01:14:59.730" style="s2">slow down even begin to articulate it</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.810" end="01:15:01.580" style="s2">for example we absolutely have no idea</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.730" end="01:15:03.740" style="s2">what&#39;s going on thinking is helpful</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.580" end="01:15:10.530" style="s2">retract it&#39;s necessary it&#39;s what you do</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.740" end="01:15:14.640" style="s2">you have to be able to perceive a lot I</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.530" end="01:15:17.160" style="s2">perceive subtly and multimodal II like</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.640" end="01:15:18.840" style="s2">to be able to use your eyes and ears and</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.160" end="01:15:26.330" style="s2">anything else you happen to have as much</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.840" end="01:15:29.810" style="s2">as possible and you want it to be very</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.330" end="01:15:29.810" style="s2">available to</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.400" end="01:15:37.790" style="s2">novelty which means you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.199" end="01:15:40.130" style="s2">close what you&#39;re perceiving on</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.790" end="01:15:41.540" style="s2">something that you think you think it is</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.130" end="01:15:45.170" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to impose a structure</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.540" end="01:15:48.350" style="s2">from your framework what is real so if</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.170" end="01:15:49.790" style="s2">you&#39;re walking through the woods and you</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.350" end="01:15:53.120" style="s2">hear something in the bushes</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.790" end="01:15:55.460" style="s2">if you imagine it&#39;s a horrible monster</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.120" end="01:15:58.699" style="s2">and you panic you&#39;re engaging in</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.460" end="01:16:01.640" style="s2">simulated thinking if instead you stop</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.699" end="01:16:03.500" style="s2">walking and you listen and look and you</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.640" end="01:16:06.080" style="s2">don&#39;t have any preconceived notion of</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.500" end="01:16:07.760" style="s2">what it what it is you know exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.080" end="01:16:10.850" style="s2">you know which is that I heard something</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.760" end="01:16:12.440" style="s2">and no more and you tune yourself to</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.850" end="01:16:15.350" style="s2">just become increasingly capable of</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.440" end="01:16:18.140" style="s2">perceiving reality as fully as possible</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.350" end="01:16:22.880" style="s2">and then as that reality reveals itself</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.140" end="01:16:25.250" style="s2">in clarity making use of that and</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.880" end="01:16:27.949" style="s2">nothing more I have just seen a flash of</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.250" end="01:16:29.570" style="s2">orange I haven&#39;t seen a tiger I just</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.949" end="01:16:32.239" style="s2">jumped to a conclusion that imposed</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.570" end="01:16:36.890" style="s2">sense-making on reality I just saw a</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.239" end="01:16:39.830" style="s2">flash of orange okay what else oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.890" end="01:16:42.199" style="s2">up there oh I also heard chirping oh</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.830" end="01:16:44.660" style="s2">it&#39;s a to camp right you slow down and</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.199" end="01:16:47.179" style="s2">allow the perception to really settle in</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.660" end="01:16:48.800" style="s2">and you allow your mind to even be quite</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.179" end="01:16:50.929" style="s2">open and fluid you&#39;re in a flow state</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.800" end="01:16:52.310" style="s2">not to use that language the closer you</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.929" end="01:16:54.980" style="s2">are to a flow state and the more you</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.310" end="01:16:57.560" style="s2">were able to engage in insight which is</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.980" end="01:16:58.969" style="s2">to say not be in the box but actually be</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.560" end="01:17:01.370" style="s2">perceiving reality with a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.969" end="01:17:08.530" style="s2">fluidity to it that&#39;s real thinking okay</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.370" end="01:17:12.469" style="s2">and so discernment is the the the use of</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.530" end="01:17:17.360" style="s2">sensing in very a very subtle way a</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.469" end="01:17:19.100" style="s2">nuance and subtlety and a broad net of</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.360" end="01:17:22.100" style="s2">sense particularly like your whole</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.100" end="01:17:23.600" style="s2">instrument noticing for example that you</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.100" end="01:17:26.660" style="s2">actually do have a lot going on you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.600" end="01:17:28.460" style="s2">not just eyes and ears you&#39;re several</p>

<p begin="01:17:28.460" end="01:17:31.820" style="s2">that had to survive in the</p>

<p begin="01:17:31.820" end="01:17:35.900" style="s2">didn&#39;t throw out the good stuff right so</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.770" end="01:17:37.580" style="s2">all of that is here and it&#39;s all more or</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.900" end="01:17:39.560" style="s2">less fully integrated into a very</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.580" end="01:17:44.570" style="s2">effective sense-making coherence as an</p>

<p begin="01:18:08.170" end="01:18:11.630" style="s2">now to actually explain that have to go</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.250" end="01:18:14.960" style="s2">a little bit deeper now to make a</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.630" end="01:18:18.860" style="s2">distinction we keep having to make these</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.960" end="01:18:20.270" style="s2">distinctions because well the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.860" end="01:18:22.370" style="s2">gotten a lot of phrase well it&#39;s been</p>

<p begin="01:18:28.670" end="01:18:34.970" style="s2">and feelings and feelings and thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.560" end="01:18:36.080" style="s2">so and DiMaggio is the guy who I first</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.970" end="01:18:37.520" style="s2">learned this from I&#39;m not using his</p>

<p begin="01:18:37.520" end="01:18:50.500" style="s2">first came from for me so an emotion is</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.680" end="01:18:55.340" style="s2">a very physical shift in disposition</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.500" end="01:19:00.050" style="s2">poised for action okay so you feel the</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.340" end="01:19:03.710" style="s2">emotion of fear you&#39;re poising your body</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.050" end="01:19:05.840" style="s2">to flee and that you begin to feel the</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.710" end="01:19:07.280" style="s2">building of that energy what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.840" end="01:19:09.320" style="s2">actually feeling is a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.280" end="01:19:10.700" style="s2">stuff going on in your body that is</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.320" end="01:19:13.670" style="s2">beginning to shift the entire</p>

<p begin="01:19:26.210" end="01:19:32.330" style="s2">that emotion anger so there&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.100" end="01:19:37.340" style="s2">many emotions and they are systemic and</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.330" end="01:19:41.120" style="s2">very biological physical feelings are</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.340" end="01:19:43.580" style="s2">completely different we if you feel our</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.120" end="01:19:45.110" style="s2">emotions so we can get confused we feel</p>

<p begin="01:19:45.110" end="01:19:50.900" style="s2">experience or have fear but a better way</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.980" end="01:19:55.610" style="s2">of grasping feeling would be something</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.900" end="01:19:58.190" style="s2">like you&#39;re trying to stack a rock on</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.610" end="01:19:59.060" style="s2">top of another rock and you&#39;re trying to</p>

<p begin="01:20:22.670" end="01:20:25.070" style="s2">have to be able to use all these</p>

<p begin="01:20:36.890" end="01:20:40.090" style="s2">actually rather ungainly you have to</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.390" end="01:20:44.270" style="s2">figure how to hold that appropriately</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.090" end="01:20:46.430" style="s2">standing is a feeling thing the feeling</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.270" end="01:20:48.680" style="s2">of being balanced is what I mean by</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.430" end="01:20:50.300" style="s2">feeling and then we can move that to a</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.680" end="01:20:52.550" style="s2">higher level of action if you&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.300" end="01:20:54.290" style="s2">shot a basketball there&#39;s a feeling of</p>

<p begin="01:21:04.370" end="01:21:09.860" style="s2">feeling right now thought is something</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.300" end="01:21:11.270" style="s2">that happens in a much narrower</p>

<p begin="01:21:11.270" end="01:21:15.430" style="s2">particular like if you&#39;re actually your</p>

<p begin="01:21:21.500" end="01:21:27.080" style="s2">up and so to the thinking process is a</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.430" end="01:21:28.940" style="s2">very distinct kind of thing than feeling</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.080" end="01:21:31.210" style="s2">it&#39;s much more associated with this</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.940" end="01:21:32.960" style="s2">simulated thinking to be honest</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.210" end="01:21:34.280" style="s2">simulated thinking is in fact when you</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.960" end="01:21:36.260" style="s2">just take thinking it to be the whole</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.280" end="01:21:37.640" style="s2">thing and you don&#39;t allow feeling to</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.260" end="01:21:42.290" style="s2">participate meaningfully in the equation</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.640" end="01:21:43.430" style="s2">implicit thinking is deeper so if you</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.290" end="01:21:46.070" style="s2">think about implicit thinking the way</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.430" end="01:21:48.980" style="s2">that John talks about it what you have</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.070" end="01:21:50.390" style="s2">is remember he wouldn&#39;t even to describe</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.980" end="01:21:52.820" style="s2">that experiment but you had the the</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.390" end="01:21:54.560" style="s2">series of alphanumeric codes there were</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.820" end="01:21:55.700" style="s2">like 10 digits long so it&#39;s not the kind</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.560" end="01:21:57.890" style="s2">of thing that was available to thinking</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.700" end="01:21:59.900" style="s2">it was larger than working memory and</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.890" end="01:22:01.400" style="s2">you had a series of them and it had an</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.900" end="01:22:02.360" style="s2">algorithm to define what they were you</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.400" end="01:22:04.180" style="s2">were gonna be able to figure that out</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.360" end="01:22:07.790" style="s2">and their chance</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.180" end="01:22:09.500" style="s2">but then when shown other hexadecimal</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.790" end="01:22:11.240" style="s2">codes some of which did use that</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.500" end="01:22:11.850" style="s2">algorithm ie matched the pattern some of</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.240" end="01:22:14.440" style="s2">which didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.850" end="01:22:16.780" style="s2">you could kind of tell much better than</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.440" end="01:22:18.820" style="s2">50% much better than random and but if</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.780" end="01:22:21.100" style="s2">you ask people how did you know the</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.820" end="01:22:23.260" style="s2">honest answer was I have no idea but I</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.100" end="01:22:24.940" style="s2">felt it that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.260" end="01:22:27.850" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s a functional capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.940" end="01:22:29.560" style="s2">be able to use the whole thing by the</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.850" end="01:22:31.090" style="s2">way the whole thing here to write this</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.560" end="01:22:32.290" style="s2">this whole brain includes a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.090" end="01:22:35.170" style="s2">of stuff of which the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.290" end="01:22:37.210" style="s2">is the super cool awesome tiny bit but</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.170" end="01:22:38.500" style="s2">you know the visual cortex and the</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.210" end="01:22:40.660" style="s2">cerebellum are actually doing a whole</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.500" end="01:22:43.510" style="s2">lot of work so being able to use the</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.660" end="01:22:46.600" style="s2">whole thing to make sense of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.510" end="01:22:49.330" style="s2">going on that&#39;s the beginning of</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.600" end="01:22:50.680" style="s2">discernment alright so you learn how to</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.330" end="01:22:54.220" style="s2">come into a tune which you learn how to</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.680" end="01:22:57.400" style="s2">bring your body into alignment with your</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.220" end="01:23:01.930" style="s2">mind and to use that whole thing to</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.400" end="01:23:04.210" style="s2">perceive and then you allow feeling to</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.930" end="01:23:08.070" style="s2">emerge which is the appropriate modality</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.210" end="01:23:11.230" style="s2">for this kind of thinking by the way</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.070" end="01:23:12.640" style="s2">this is true in any type of this source</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.230" end="01:23:14.920" style="s2">so discernment for example is how you do</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.640" end="01:23:17.560" style="s2">art if you want to be able to express</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.920" end="01:23:20.470" style="s2">yourself artistically you first feel a</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.560" end="01:23:22.330" style="s2">feeling with clarity and then you allow</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.470" end="01:23:26.260" style="s2">that feeling to become expressed with</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.330" end="01:23:29.080" style="s2">skillfulness which takes time of course</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.260" end="01:23:31.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s done by the way by feeling you</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.080" end="01:23:33.520" style="s2">you feel the feeling and then you take a</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.480" end="01:23:35.680" style="s2">color and you notice whether or not that</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.520" end="01:23:37.660" style="s2">color corresponds what the color feels</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.680" end="01:23:39.220" style="s2">like the feeling you have to get good</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.660" end="01:23:41.050" style="s2">and notice in that correspondence like</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.220" end="01:23:42.940" style="s2">balancing a rock when you get good at it</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.050" end="01:23:45.250" style="s2">you can now put a color on a piece of</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.940" end="01:23:46.810" style="s2">paper that feels like the feeling and</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.250" end="01:23:47.860" style="s2">then you actually look at what the line</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.810" end="01:23:51.450" style="s2">has the feeling on the feeling of</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.860" end="01:23:57.580" style="s2">adventure to you&#39;re a painter so</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.450" end="01:23:59.530" style="s2">discernment attunement feeling clarity</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.580" end="01:24:01.960" style="s2">so now you have to actually have the</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.530" end="01:24:06.460" style="s2">sense of when a feeling is actually</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.960" end="01:24:09.360" style="s2">coming to clarity when there&#39;s a yep</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.460" end="01:24:12.400" style="s2">to me at least it kind of feels like</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.360" end="01:24:15.850" style="s2">everybody&#39;s checked in that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.400" end="01:24:17.800" style="s2">internal consensus to whatever degree my</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.850" end="01:24:20.290" style="s2">ability to perceive and make sense of</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.800" end="01:24:22.090" style="s2">what&#39;s happening has done what it can</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.290" end="01:24:23.830" style="s2">not a whole lot more it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.090" end="01:24:25.030" style="s2">emerge and there&#39;s something about this</p>

<p begin="01:24:25.030" end="01:24:28.690" style="s2">yes to it where I can say like I am yes</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.370" end="01:24:31.150" style="s2">I&#39;m balanced I&#39;m not falling over right</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.690" end="01:24:32.470" style="s2">now yes the rock is going to stay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.150" end="01:24:33.760" style="s2">a good human it&#39;s great practice just</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.470" end="01:24:35.650" style="s2">put a rock on top of another rock and</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.760" end="01:24:37.330" style="s2">notice you can in fact feel when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.650" end="01:24:40.780" style="s2">gonna stay and you can do with another</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.330" end="01:24:43.000" style="s2">rock maybe you knew seven rocks same</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.780" end="01:24:44.560" style="s2">idea and you&#39;ve got clarity yep it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.000" end="01:24:49.120" style="s2">balanced then you could step back so you</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.560" end="01:24:50.440" style="s2">build clarity now the deep thing here by</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.120" end="01:24:52.150" style="s2">the way is what happens next is you can</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.440" end="01:24:54.900" style="s2">actually at that point have insight just</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.150" end="01:24:57.360" style="s2">by the way I practice back to John stuff</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.900" end="01:25:00.610" style="s2">which is in this place of clarity</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.360" end="01:25:03.130" style="s2">whatever it is that is coming clear you</p>

<p begin="01:25:05.110" end="01:25:11.230" style="s2">thought comes back in that it is new you</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.580" end="01:25:12.700" style="s2">may have actually changed your self in</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.230" end="01:25:15.520" style="s2">some way in relationship to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.700" end="01:25:17.110" style="s2">happening and now because you&#39;ve changed</p>

<p begin="01:25:17.110" end="01:25:20.500" style="s2">world has changed so now we take a break</p>

<p begin="01:27:53.090" end="01:27:57.170" style="s2">right then what ends up happening is the</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.920" end="01:27:59.810" style="s2">network is amazing</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.170" end="01:28:01.969" style="s2">and making sense of subtlety right you</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.810" end="01:28:04.730" style="s2">can take the perception these subtle</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.969" end="01:28:08.239" style="s2">broad implicit pattern recognizers that</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.730" end="01:28:10.550" style="s2">were also gifted with and grab very</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.239" end="01:28:12.350" style="s2">vague and weird not quite knowing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.550" end="01:28:14.600" style="s2">going on thing put it into the system</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.350" end="01:28:17.000" style="s2">and after a couple of turns it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.600" end="01:28:19.610" style="s2">actually reified to a very crisp clarity</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.000" end="01:28:21.080" style="s2">that can be shared so that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:28:21.080" end="01:28:24.850" style="s2">that process and you notice how much of</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.120" end="01:28:27.199" style="s2">a burden is placed on the individual now</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.850" end="01:28:30.890" style="s2">it&#39;s not like the broadcast modality</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.199" end="01:28:32.060" style="s2">where most of your agency is limited to</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.890" end="01:28:33.440" style="s2">a very narrow band and you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.060" end="01:28:34.640" style="s2">relying on the causal structure that</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.440" end="01:28:36.739" style="s2">you&#39;re embedded in to do almost all the</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.640" end="01:28:38.630" style="s2">work in the decentralized collective</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.739" end="01:28:40.699" style="s2">intelligence for to actually work almost</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.630" end="01:28:42.380" style="s2">all of the agency is actually on the</p>

<p begin="01:28:42.380" end="01:28:47.449" style="s2">really a</p>

<p begin="01:28:47.449" end="01:28:51.110" style="s2">responsible I mean is there they&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.130" end="01:28:52.010" style="s2">to respond to the environment in the way</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.110" end="01:28:54.550" style="s2">that I&#39;m talking about they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.010" end="01:28:57.110" style="s2">reacting they&#39;re not shifting to a</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.550" end="01:28:58.760" style="s2">causal domain they&#39;re not saying what</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.110" end="01:29:00.260" style="s2">they&#39;re supposed to say or rejecting</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.760" end="01:29:05.480" style="s2">because they&#39;re supposed to reject their</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.260" end="01:29:08.449" style="s2">listening and refining and doing the</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.480" end="01:29:09.679" style="s2">work of collaboration think about</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.449" end="01:29:13.610" style="s2">collaboration how collaboration works</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.679" end="01:29:14.510" style="s2">you and I are collaborating on a song if</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.610" end="01:29:16.849" style="s2">we&#39;re partners we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.510" end="01:29:18.199" style="s2">collaborating I&#39;m gonna be like ah man I</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.849" end="01:29:20.329" style="s2">just had this crazy sense and I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.199" end="01:29:23.510" style="s2">to play it terrible sound</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.329" end="01:29:24.920" style="s2">but you&#39;re listening very closely right</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.510" end="01:29:26.780" style="s2">and you&#39;re good at it you&#39;re good at</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.920" end="01:29:29.000" style="s2">listening very closely and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.780" end="01:29:31.159" style="s2">you know what is it like this and you</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.000" end="01:29:33.619" style="s2">play it back and what you play back is</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.159" end="01:29:34.010" style="s2">actually closer to what I&#39;m feeling like</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.619" end="01:29:36.110" style="s2">ah</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.010" end="01:29:38.570" style="s2">yes more like that more like that and</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.110" end="01:29:39.530" style="s2">then like okay and then this but now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.570" end="01:29:40.760" style="s2">actually little bit better right because</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.530" end="01:29:42.469" style="s2">it&#39;s more clearing me because what you</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.760" end="01:29:43.810" style="s2">did was you refine it and expressed it</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.469" end="01:29:46.760" style="s2">back to me with it I couldn&#39;t perceive</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.810" end="01:29:48.290" style="s2">myself but once I saw it pop that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.760" end="01:29:51.020" style="s2">insight you just gave me an insight</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.290" end="01:29:52.550" style="s2">collaboratively collaborative insight so</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.020" end="01:29:53.989" style="s2">now I take a night out put something</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.550" end="01:29:55.849" style="s2">back to you and now you&#39;re like oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.989" end="01:29:57.560" style="s2">I totally get it and then you drop into</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.849" end="01:29:59.989" style="s2">it and now we&#39;re now a collective</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.560" end="01:30:01.699" style="s2">intelligence coherence is now happening</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.989" end="01:30:03.739" style="s2">in the flu and collaboration between us</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.699" end="01:30:05.570" style="s2">and the things that can be produced are</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.739" end="01:30:07.760" style="s2">vastly more than what either one of us</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.570" end="01:30:09.320" style="s2">could have done separately now of course</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.760" end="01:30:10.310" style="s2">this requires that you have developed a</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.320" end="01:30:11.570" style="s2">certain level of discernment I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.310" end="01:30:13.880" style="s2">developed a certain level of discernment</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.570" end="01:30:15.829" style="s2">we&#39;re in a relationship that allows us</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.880" end="01:30:17.179" style="s2">to actually use that and we can talk</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.829" end="01:30:18.739" style="s2">about that means what the requirements</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.179" end="01:30:20.960" style="s2">are and then we&#39;ve also built a certain</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.739" end="01:30:22.639" style="s2">of those skillfulness and expression so</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.960" end="01:30:23.810" style="s2">that I&#39;m not creating noise and</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.639" end="01:30:27.050" style="s2">expressing it I&#39;m actually making it</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.810" end="01:30:29.030" style="s2">more signal when I express it more real</p>

<p begin="01:31:09.470" end="01:31:14.180" style="s2">can feel true even when it&#39;s kind of a</p>

<p begin="01:31:20.690" end="01:31:25.730" style="s2">basic like deep humanness is like all</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.180" end="01:31:26.330" style="s2">right I can work with that where do we</p>

<p begin="01:31:26.330" end="01:31:31.850" style="s2">and by the way I&#39;m interested and by</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.940" end="01:31:32.840" style="s2">there with this openness hey you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.850" end="01:31:35.150" style="s2">we&#39;re just figuring this out</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.840" end="01:31:37.430" style="s2">I&#39;m trying what do you got and you send</p>

<p begin="01:31:37.430" end="01:31:42.380" style="s2">we&#39;re available and I listen and I hear</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.670" end="01:31:43.970" style="s2">you then we&#39;ve actually created a</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.380" end="01:31:46.280" style="s2">relationship that has that feeling of</p>

<p begin="01:31:46.280" end="01:31:49.730" style="s2">creates an open channel to do more of it</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.020" end="01:31:51.860" style="s2">now of course we&#39;re late we&#39;re a limited</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.730" end="01:31:53.120" style="s2">preliminary discernment so we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.860" end="01:31:54.950" style="s2">going to have to be doing work on</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.120" end="01:31:57.590" style="s2">improving the quality of our discernment</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.950" end="01:31:59.690" style="s2">in all the modalities that happen to be</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.590" end="01:32:01.610" style="s2">happening and we are really limited by</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.690" end="01:32:02.960" style="s2">our capacity to express we have to get</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.610" end="01:32:07.990" style="s2">better and better being able to express</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.960" end="01:32:10.910" style="s2">with clarity with elegance and width I</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.990" end="01:32:12.590" style="s2">wanna say it&#39;s fidelity meaning we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.910" end="01:32:15.170" style="s2">want to put stuff in it that doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:32:15.170" end="01:32:19.330" style="s2">there&#39;s also subtly manipulative just</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.170" end="01:32:21.680" style="s2">gotta tell the truth</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.330" end="01:32:23.420" style="s2">pure truth two degrees in which I can</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.680" end="01:32:24.650" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna it up but at least I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.420" end="01:32:26.210" style="s2">not it up with stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.650" end="01:32:29.090" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to be there at all so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.210" end="01:32:31.070" style="s2">just expressing it and what happens</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.090" end="01:32:33.410" style="s2">about that is very good news and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.070" end="01:32:34.640" style="s2">extremely powerful process and the</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.410" end="01:32:35.690" style="s2">process of collaboration that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.640" end="01:32:39.710" style="s2">available now because we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.690" end="01:32:41.870" style="s2">connected to each other is unprecedented</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.710" end="01:32:43.370" style="s2">and that has the capacity to solve all</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.870" end="01:32:44.630" style="s2">the problems we&#39;re dealing with that</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.370" end="01:32:46.640" style="s2">kind of a decentralized collective</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.630" end="01:32:49.160" style="s2">intelligence with high discerning</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.640" end="01:32:52.610" style="s2">individuals with it clearly expressing</p>

<p begin="01:32:56.930" end="01:33:00.560" style="s2">signal but are actually simply</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.520" end="01:33:02.600" style="s2">endeavoring to share what is</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.560" end="01:33:05.560" style="s2">authentically perceived by them to</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.600" end="01:33:08.889" style="s2">actually feel true back out with quality</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.560" end="01:33:12.520" style="s2">is incomprehensible</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.889" end="01:33:15.760" style="s2">capable of making sense and by the way</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.520" end="01:33:17.500" style="s2">making choices and doing things so much</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.760" end="01:33:19.480" style="s2">so that it&#39;s sort of absurd that we just</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.500" end="01:33:21.369" style="s2">don&#39;t go there and you want flying cars</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.480" end="01:33:23.440" style="s2">and going to the Stars this will get you</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.369" end="01:33:24.969" style="s2">there it&#39;ll solve everything the amount</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.440" end="01:33:26.770" style="s2">of bandwidth is available inside that</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.969" end="01:33:29.679" style="s2">domain is enormous the problem of course</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.770" end="01:33:32.920" style="s2">is that it&#39;s hard at an individual level</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.679" end="01:33:35.020" style="s2">and it&#39;s counter-current now we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.920" end="01:33:37.000" style="s2">trained for generations to do the exact</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.020" end="01:33:39.010" style="s2">opposite we&#39;ve been training for many</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.000" end="01:33:41.020" style="s2">many many many generations to insert</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.010" end="01:33:41.429" style="s2">egoic content in between everything that</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.020" end="01:33:43.690" style="s2">we do</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.429" end="01:33:45.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve been changed for several</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.690" end="01:33:48.340" style="s2">generations to be simulating thinking</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.400" end="01:33:50.739" style="s2">not thinking and so we&#39;ve got to relearn</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.340" end="01:33:53.860" style="s2">all that stuff and we have to be doing</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.739" end="01:33:55.540" style="s2">it here first each individual has to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.860" end="01:33:57.820" style="s2">able to take the responsibility and then</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.540" end="01:33:59.619" style="s2">learn to trust their own discernment in</p>

<p begin="01:33:59.619" end="01:34:04.389" style="s2">relationship with you and you are in</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.420" end="01:34:05.889" style="s2">fact trying to manipulate me I have to</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.389" end="01:34:07.830" style="s2">be in this really weird widely</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.889" end="01:34:10.210" style="s2">vulnerable state of actually listening</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.830" end="01:34:12.310" style="s2">but then noticing in myself that is a</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.210" end="01:34:14.949" style="s2">feeling this little off and then being</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.310" end="01:34:17.380" style="s2">able to respond to that as well ideally</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.949" end="01:34:20.139" style="s2">to call it out I do this is a way for me</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.380" end="01:34:21.790" style="s2">to exquisitely invite you into a higher</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.139" end="01:34:24.400" style="s2">level of integrity in yourself in</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.790" end="01:34:25.960" style="s2">relationship but also perhaps sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.400" end="01:34:30.219" style="s2">just to be able to be able to make it</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.960" end="01:34:31.570" style="s2">safe for myself and for others that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.219" end="01:34:33.369" style="s2">like that&#39;s the practice as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.570" end="01:34:34.540" style="s2">concerned that is the thing that more or</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.369" end="01:34:38.440" style="s2">less everybody should be doing right now</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.540" end="01:34:44.679" style="s2">full-time and everybody who&#39;s good at it</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.440" end="01:34:46.420" style="s2">should be doing it more like it should</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.679" end="01:34:48.850" style="s2">show up like if you&#39;re if you are good</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.420" end="01:34:50.619" style="s2">at it other people should be noticing</p>

<p begin="01:34:51.909" end="01:34:55.929" style="s2">notice sharing that fact so that the</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.550" end="01:34:57.310" style="s2">collective intelligence begins the</p>

<p begin="01:35:20.830" end="01:35:22.929" style="s2">are gonna do better so it&#39;s actually a</p>
