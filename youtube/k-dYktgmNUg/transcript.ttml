<p begin="00:03:41.420" end="00:03:46.300" style="s2">Creative people are getting a really rough, uh, they&#39;re not getting a break at all.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.580" end="00:03:51.680" style="s2">And there&#39;re probably more creative people doing non-creative work in the workforce than the other way around.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.700" end="00:03:53.340" style="s2">Oh definitely, definitely.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.520" end="00:04:00.700" style="s2">You know, the thing is, I don&#39;t want to paint too dismal a picture about being creative because one of the things that pays off big for creative people</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.700" end="00:04:02.200" style="s2">is that they get to be creative, right?</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.200" end="00:04:05.080" style="s2">There&#39;s great aesthetic joy in that and depth.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.440" end="00:04:13.960" style="s2">And I&#39;ve been privileged because I&#39;ve worked with more creative people than would fall to the lot, let&#39;s say, of the typical psychotherapist.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.980" end="00:04:22.040" style="s2">Because people often come and see me because they&#39;ve watched my videos online and they deal with... people who are interested in those subjects tend to be creative.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.440" end="00:04:31.600" style="s2">And one of things I&#39;ve really been struck by, first of all, I&#39;ve learned that for those of you who are interested in such things, that the reason Jungian psychology works</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.600" end="00:04:33.180" style="s2">is because it works for creative people.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.180" end="00:04:35.060" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t work at all for non-creative people.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.060" end="00:04:39.860" style="s2">It just falls dead and flat for them. They&#39;re not interested in it at all, it isn&#39;t how they think.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.860" end="00:04:40.700" style="s2">You mean as therapy?</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.040" end="00:04:44.120" style="s2">Yeah, it doesn&#39;t match their personalities.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.120" end="00:04:47.440" style="s2">Whereas creative people, man, they dream archetypal dreams all the time.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.440" end="00:04:51.120" style="s2">It&#39;s really interesting. And also they die if they&#39;re not being creative.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.120" end="00:04:52.600" style="s2">They wither on the vine.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.600" end="00:04:56.600" style="s2">I have one client, I really liked him, he was a brilliant architect.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.400" end="00:05:02.120" style="s2">And his rational mind was his worst enemy because it just criticized everything.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.120" end="00:05:06.460" style="s2">He was hyper-rational, criticized everything, really in a dark way, and effectively, you know?</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.260" end="00:05:11.980" style="s2">If I could get him to not think and just create, he was a complete genius.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.340" end="00:05:15.540" style="s2">That&#39;s where all of the vitality in his life was.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.540" end="00:05:20.240" style="s2">That&#39;s where the sap rose up inside the dead tree that was sort of embedded inside of him.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.740" end="00:05:24.360" style="s2">And it is very common with creative people, is that it&#39;s their life blood.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.360" end="00:05:30.440" style="s2">And it really is, from a biological perspective. This isn&#39;t some epi-phenomena, it&#39;s built right into people, and deeply.</p>
