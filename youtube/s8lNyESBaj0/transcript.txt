 Hello, good afternoon, my name is Daniel Bahr and I am the author of the design book 
 in which at the tiff coachers it is a great pleasure to be able to greet you this afternoon at 
 the celebration of earth day in costa rica eduardo thanks for giving me the 
 opportunity to contribute this short video 
 Eduardo has asked me to talk a little about the subject that there is a great 
 growing movement in the world that is dedicating itself to creating cultures 
 regenerative that are very elegantly adapted to the conditions 
 unique cultural bios of your place and to briefly summarize what 
 we're talking like we're talking about 
 the regeneration of this bill read graph from 2006 offers us a way 
 a path from business is yuyo towards the body also all green that 
 is a bit better but still harm t to a sustainable extent than in this 
 frame originates as the point of doing no more damage but as this is no longer 
 enough as we have done so much damage in the history of mankind and its 
 relationship with nature through the last five thousand to eight thousand 
 years with the invention of agriculture and land use change and that 
 we have bare the earth an 9.8 billion trees have been cut down 
 name of trees of forest hectares have been cut in the last 
 five thousand years by man then it is necessary to create something more 
 which is to restore ecosystems and it is a pleasure to know that the 1 is reacting 
 and in the 20s and 130s the decade for ecosystem restoration has been declared 
 but if we do not make one more change of the restorative design of only 
 restore and systems stuff and realize we don't have to do this 
 reconciliatory step of creating from a change of culture a change of 
 worldview thinking that again includes humanity within the 
 nature that we finally realize that as biological living beings we are 
 nature and we are able to create conducive conditions for life in 
 an evolutionary step that we finally 
 we realize that in competition it is only part of the regulation and 
 that collaboration has largely created a much more complex living world 
 through millions of years of the evolution of life and like us 
 We ourselves have done so much damage to this web of life, now it is our turn to create 
 cultures that are truly mature and mature members of this community of the 
 life I think this is already asking for 
 very 
 In many ways, London has formed the extinct rebellion that is 
 growing up to the level of the world in the movement fried wife of grita terna 
 is taking school children to the streets every Friday to ask for a 
 deeper shift towards a reaction to climate change that already has to be 
 so profound that it is truly a redesign of the human presence in the 
 planet and this is what it is all about and I am super happy that my book design edition 
 art scouters that was published in 2016 has been part of this change of 
 consciousness and I have just returned from Brazil where we have launched 
 regenerative cultures in Portuguese and by the end of this year there will also be 
 launch the book in Spanish Costa Rica is a leading country in 
 leadership in this whole movement the work he has done was very read with the 
 chapter institute and other partners such as guy education institute or cyber and in 
 several others is to create a network at the local and global level to strengthen this movement 
 to create regenerative cultures and economies to create a new 
 human presence on the planet through regenerative development at the 
 bioregional and it is a great pleasure to collaborate with you in Costa Rica and 
 I am doing my thing here on the island of Mallorca in Spain and every day there are more 
 people who are moving or moving this issue of active regional development 
 bioregional as a redesign of the human presence on the planet and 
 important of degenerative cultures that are diverse as life and have to 
 be highly adapted to the unique conditions of your place and 
 with this we create a diverse world but alienated to create regenerative futures 
 for all life and all future generations of our species 
 of our children and of our grandchildren and great-grandchildren then 
 congratulations on jacques red creating a regeneration day and if we get it right 
 the next decade is going to be the decade of ecosystem restoration and this 
 century is going to be the century of regeneration of the earth and 
 humanity thank you very much and have a good afternoon and see you soon 
 in Costa Rica
