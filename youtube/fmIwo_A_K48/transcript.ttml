<p begin="00:00:11.740" end="00:00:15.880" style="s2">this is the gym rut show and I&#39;m your</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.750" end="00:00:18.520" style="s2">host Jim rut my guest today is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.880" end="00:00:20.800" style="s2">thinker writer and doer Bonita Roy I</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.520" end="00:00:22.570" style="s2">usually give a brief bio but but need</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.800" end="00:00:25.090" style="s2">his life and work are so multifaceted</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.570" end="00:00:26.020" style="s2">and always changing I thought it better</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.090" end="00:00:28.329" style="s2">to ask her</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.020" end="00:00:30.910" style="s2">so Bonita why don&#39;t you give us a mini</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.329" end="00:00:33.070" style="s2">bio first of all thanks for asking me to</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.910" end="00:00:34.510" style="s2">come on your show and thanks for turning</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.070" end="00:00:36.910" style="s2">the tables on me so I have to introduce</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.510" end="00:00:40.210" style="s2">myself and it can be difficult for me</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.910" end="00:00:43.000" style="s2">too I think at the fundamental level I</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.210" end="00:00:46.510" style="s2">call myself an insight guide but I also</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.000" end="00:00:48.340" style="s2">work toward trying to get novel insight</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.510" end="00:00:50.079" style="s2">so that&#39;s something I wanted to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.340" end="00:00:52.929" style="s2">you about as we were discussing earlier</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.079" end="00:00:54.760" style="s2">that sometimes people are confused about</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.929" end="00:00:57.190" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to do what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.760" end="00:00:59.589" style="s2">say and because I was coming on this</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.190" end="00:01:03.429" style="s2">podcast I really spent some time trying</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.589" end="00:01:05.320" style="s2">to clarify for myself what it is how do</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.429" end="00:01:06.550" style="s2">I fit in this space so I thought we</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.320" end="00:01:08.920" style="s2">could talk about it this would be my</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.550" end="00:01:10.450" style="s2">first time of talking about myself this</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.920" end="00:01:12.730" style="s2">way and kind of throwing it out there</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.450" end="00:01:14.680" style="s2">and hopefully that&#39;ll be fun for you</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.730" end="00:01:17.320" style="s2">because I know you&#39;re interested in new</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.680" end="00:01:20.409" style="s2">ideas also so what I want to frame</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.320" end="00:01:22.420" style="s2">myself is interested in insights so</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.409" end="00:01:24.700" style="s2">unlike some of your other gasps I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.420" end="00:01:28.060" style="s2">an expert in complex thought or</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.700" end="00:01:31.479" style="s2">complexity science but I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.060" end="00:01:33.909" style="s2">what are the limitations of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.479" end="00:01:36.189" style="s2">science can we push those limitations so</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.909" end="00:01:38.829" style="s2">that we go even further what are the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.189" end="00:01:42.340" style="s2">fundamental assumptions that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.829" end="00:01:45.130" style="s2">constrain complexity science and one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.340" end="00:01:48.180" style="s2">the things that I&#39;ve had insight into is</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.130" end="00:01:50.770" style="s2">that I think that there&#39;s very few</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.180" end="00:01:53.530" style="s2">complexity scientists are complex</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.770" end="00:01:56.200" style="s2">thinkers who have integrated what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.530" end="00:01:58.450" style="s2">would call process thinking into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.200" end="00:02:01.570" style="s2">complexity sciences and I actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.450" end="00:02:03.820" style="s2">googled that this morning and found the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.570" end="00:02:06.130" style="s2">only intersection between those two and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.820" end="00:02:08.110" style="s2">Google scholars was my own work so it</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.130" end="00:02:10.869" style="s2">started to really crystallize for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.110" end="00:02:12.940" style="s2">just recently that that&#39;s perhaps why</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.869" end="00:02:14.740" style="s2">process philosophers don&#39;t really get me</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.940" end="00:02:17.740" style="s2">and complex thinkers don&#39;t really get me</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.740" end="00:02:20.860" style="s2">because I&#39;m actually trying to see how</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.740" end="00:02:23.050" style="s2">these two approaches to thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.860" end="00:02:25.330" style="s2">approaches to science approaches to</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.050" end="00:02:25.580" style="s2">philosophy can stretch each other into</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.330" end="00:02:28.130" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.580" end="00:02:30.890" style="s2">thing new so that would be an example of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.130" end="00:02:33.410" style="s2">how I&#39;m always working with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.890" end="00:02:36.050" style="s2">information science or the system&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.410" end="00:02:38.450" style="s2">thinking not just to work with it but to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.050" end="00:02:40.520" style="s2">understand it making it object of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.450" end="00:02:43.490" style="s2">inquiry and see if we can move these</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.520" end="00:02:45.340" style="s2">boundaries into a different approach</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.490" end="00:02:47.390" style="s2">that may be more profitable for</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.340" end="00:02:49.370" style="s2">addressing some of the problems we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.390" end="00:02:51.440" style="s2">today so this integration of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.370" end="00:02:54.620" style="s2">thinking or complex thought in process</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.440" end="00:02:56.000" style="s2">philosophy is what makes my work</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.620" end="00:02:58.280" style="s2">different than some of the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.000" end="00:02:59.990" style="s2">people&#39;s work in the space that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.280" end="00:03:02.120" style="s2">really and think of I think as we both</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.990" end="00:03:05.420" style="s2">know whenever you draw a circle around</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.120" end="00:03:07.370" style="s2">something call it complexity science not</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.420" end="00:03:09.800" style="s2">only do you restrict what&#39;s in but you</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.370" end="00:03:12.620" style="s2">also build it on artificial barrier to</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.800" end="00:03:14.660" style="s2">what&#39;s outside right so taking any given</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.620" end="00:03:17.090" style="s2">circle that one&#39;s drawn around some</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.660" end="00:03:19.760" style="s2">arbitrary area of content and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.090" end="00:03:21.770" style="s2">looking at how that intersect with</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.760" end="00:03:23.690" style="s2">what&#39;s outside of it is often very</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.770" end="00:03:26.630" style="s2">generative let&#39;s just hop right into it</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.690" end="00:03:29.600" style="s2">so I would say here my role is going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.630" end="00:03:32.330" style="s2">sound like I&#39;m a process thinker beating</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.600" end="00:03:35.630" style="s2">up on complexity science but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.330" end="00:03:37.970" style="s2">true that very few process thinkers and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.630" end="00:03:40.430" style="s2">what I mean by that is Alawite Head and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.970" end="00:03:44.870" style="s2">Griffin and Hartshorn and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.430" end="00:03:47.930" style="s2">school very few of them have managed to</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.870" end="00:03:50.870" style="s2">stretch outside of a process ontology</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.930" end="00:03:52.730" style="s2">into complexity science there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.870" end="00:03:54.500" style="s2">resonances so I don&#39;t think the stretch</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.730" end="00:03:57.680" style="s2">is that hard but like you said people</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.500" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">tend to put themselves in a box or build</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.680" end="00:04:02.630" style="s2">a boundary and then navigate through</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:04.519" style="s2">their thought on the basis of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.630" end="00:04:06.380" style="s2">assumptions that are defined by that</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.519" end="00:04:08.030" style="s2">boundary so just saying that just so you</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.380" end="00:04:10.130" style="s2">know it&#39;s gonna sound like I&#39;m beating</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.030" end="00:04:12.110" style="s2">up on complexity theory because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.130" end="00:04:13.790" style="s2">going to represent more the process</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.110" end="00:04:16.580" style="s2">space here and I think you can represent</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.790" end="00:04:18.620" style="s2">the complexity space better they tumble</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.580" end="00:04:20.720" style="s2">over each other they both have very</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.620" end="00:04:22.430" style="s2">important ways to inform each other so</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.720" end="00:04:23.570" style="s2">that&#39;s hopefully we can proceed that way</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.430" end="00:04:25.669" style="s2">yeah that sounds great</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.570" end="00:04:27.410" style="s2">I love active engagement at the boundary</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.669" end="00:04:29.990" style="s2">between areas and sometimes that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.410" end="00:04:32.180" style="s2">most fruitful areas for investigation</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.990" end="00:04:33.950" style="s2">yeah and so then in general what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.180" end="00:04:36.110" style="s2">going to be doing here Jim if we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.950" end="00:04:38.270" style="s2">pull this out is a lot of thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.110" end="00:04:39.150" style="s2">experiment and a lot of hybridization</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.270" end="00:04:41.280" style="s2">and I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.150" end="00:04:43.350" style="s2">call that insight practice because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.280" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">actually trying to have insight into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.350" end="00:04:47.610" style="s2">ways the perspectives were taking the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:50.040" style="s2">assumptions we&#39;re making we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.610" end="00:04:52.320" style="s2">at the architecture of the thought we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.040" end="00:04:55.230" style="s2">looking through these are all complex</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.320" end="00:04:57.630" style="s2">metacognitive skills which i think is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.230" end="00:04:58.980" style="s2">feature of most of the guests that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.630" end="00:05:00.870" style="s2">have on this show that that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.980" end="00:05:02.760" style="s2">capable of doing that so this is really</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.870" end="00:05:04.740" style="s2">cool so the first thing I would say and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.760" end="00:05:06.900" style="s2">some of this is not generous I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.740" end="00:05:08.550" style="s2">trying to clear out some territory for</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.900" end="00:05:11.010" style="s2">the audience and then you can say but</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.550" end="00:05:13.290" style="s2">complexity science does do this in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.010" end="00:05:15.870" style="s2">thing so some of its not generous and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.290" end="00:05:18.600" style="s2">can build up from there so for example a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.870" end="00:05:22.560" style="s2">lot of complexity science has this</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.600" end="00:05:26.040" style="s2">problem that process philosophy is very</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.560" end="00:05:29.430" style="s2">wary of and that is reification so that</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.040" end="00:05:31.200" style="s2">for example when we&#39;re thinking of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.430" end="00:05:34.620" style="s2">certain type of systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.200" end="00:05:36.410" style="s2">we&#39;re AFI it as if it has a boundary</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.620" end="00:05:39.810" style="s2">that it&#39;s an object that can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.410" end="00:05:42.240" style="s2">manipulated that I can act on the system</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.810" end="00:05:44.460" style="s2">either by observing or experimenting</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.240" end="00:05:47.270" style="s2">with it and yet it doesn&#39;t act back on</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.460" end="00:05:50.520" style="s2">me so this is a process of reification</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.270" end="00:05:52.950" style="s2">that process philosophy would have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.520" end="00:05:54.450" style="s2">yellow flag for complexity science and</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.950" end="00:05:56.690" style="s2">so for example you know it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.450" end="00:05:59.010" style="s2">to think of light as a wave without</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.690" end="00:06:00.990" style="s2">thinking that it propagates through</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.010" end="00:06:03.720" style="s2">something right there&#39;s a whole history</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.990" end="00:06:06.420" style="s2">of the science of whether light had an</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.720" end="00:06:09.480" style="s2">ether that it propagated through the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.420" end="00:06:11.490" style="s2">same way sound propagates through air so</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.480" end="00:06:14.310" style="s2">in process philosophy we would say the</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.310" end="00:06:19.110" style="s2">model that there&#39;s an ether that light</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.500" end="00:06:21.780" style="s2">propagates through that&#39;s the third term</p>

<p begin="00:06:21.780" end="00:06:25.200" style="s2">in process philosophy is more</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.460" end="00:06:27.150" style="s2">comfortable with just understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.200" end="00:06:29.760" style="s2">you know light moves or a light is</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.150" end="00:06:32.400" style="s2">movement or it is propagation and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.760" end="00:06:34.680" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of the same move that Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.400" end="00:06:37.350" style="s2">made where instead of gravity being a</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.680" end="00:06:39.510" style="s2">force which is like a third term like</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.350" end="00:06:42.240" style="s2">something you could go look for he saw</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.510" end="00:06:44.700" style="s2">it as just the relative motion of</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.240" end="00:06:46.980" style="s2">inertial different inertial frames right</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.700" end="00:06:50.250" style="s2">so you see this moving process</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.980" end="00:06:52.529" style="s2">philosophy is to go to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.250" end="00:06:54.299" style="s2">everything is in motion with this</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.529" end="00:06:57.089" style="s2">back to everything else nothing is D</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.299" end="00:06:59.789" style="s2">animated there&#39;s no privileged position</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.089" end="00:07:03.379" style="s2">outside of the system in which you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.789" end="00:07:08.329" style="s2">look at it so it increases the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.379" end="00:07:11.219" style="s2">complexity and unbound the complex space</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.329" end="00:07:14.129" style="s2">in a way that requires a level of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.219" end="00:07:16.829" style="s2">sophistication that I think is demanding</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.129" end="00:07:18.269" style="s2">that&#39;s it thank you let me reply to that</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.829" end="00:07:20.759" style="s2">let me see if I get what you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.269" end="00:07:23.609" style="s2">correctly again and kind of put back</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.759" end="00:07:26.219" style="s2">mode I&#39;ll suggest that what you describe</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.609" end="00:07:28.799" style="s2">strikes me is exactly what science ought</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.219" end="00:07:31.499" style="s2">to be which is model building right</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.799" end="00:07:33.509" style="s2">anyone who tells you that science proves</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.499" end="00:07:36.059" style="s2">Act you know the person&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.509" end="00:07:38.519" style="s2">scientist right because science never</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.059" end="00:07:40.469" style="s2">proves anything right proved right what</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.519" end="00:07:42.269" style="s2">it does is has you know contingent</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.469" end="00:07:45.119" style="s2">theories that are have not been</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.269" end="00:07:47.909" style="s2">falsified by experiment that are the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.119" end="00:07:49.439" style="s2">best knowledge we have at the moment but</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.909" end="00:07:52.139" style="s2">if we look at the history of science</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.439" end="00:07:54.479" style="s2">we&#39;re almost certain is incomplete and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.139" end="00:07:56.729" style="s2">or partially wrong so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.479" end="00:07:58.769" style="s2">really the job of science is to build</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.729" end="00:08:02.189" style="s2">models that have some come as much</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.769" end="00:08:04.709" style="s2">congruence with reality as we can and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.189" end="00:08:07.110" style="s2">use those models to tell us something</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.709" end="00:08:09.749" style="s2">about reality and then other people take</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.110" end="00:08:11.729" style="s2">those models technologists and say all</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.749" end="00:08:14.819" style="s2">right how can I use those models to</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.729" end="00:08:17.429" style="s2">actually create some action or leverage</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.819" end="00:08:20.099" style="s2">in reality so I would push back a little</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.429" end="00:08:21.509" style="s2">man what you say is interesting and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.099" end="00:08:23.669" style="s2">there is more to be said than just</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.509" end="00:08:26.369" style="s2">science but within the container of</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.669" end="00:08:28.529" style="s2">complexity science I would map the term</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.369" end="00:08:30.959" style="s2">reification to model building and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.529" end="00:08:33.029" style="s2">what I would say is the main job of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.959" end="00:08:35.639" style="s2">science yeah so that pushback is</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.029" end="00:08:37.349" style="s2">completely 100% received because I agree</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.639" end="00:08:39.269" style="s2">with you I think that as long as we</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.349" end="00:08:41.490" style="s2">understand that we are constructing</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.269" end="00:08:44.159" style="s2">models and they&#39;re useful and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.490" end="00:08:46.679" style="s2">relevant and they carry us forward if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.159" end="00:08:48.779" style="s2">understand that we are in the process we</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.679" end="00:08:51.120" style="s2">are participating in the construction of</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.779" end="00:08:53.220" style="s2">this model but it doesn&#39;t stop there</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.120" end="00:08:55.079" style="s2">it&#39;s like a stepping stone and then from</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.220" end="00:08:56.819" style="s2">there we can ask new questions we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.079" end="00:08:59.999" style="s2">have different insights and we can carry</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.819" end="00:09:02.399" style="s2">the enterprise of science forward not</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.999" end="00:09:05.059" style="s2">only as a technology but as this double</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.399" end="00:09:08.089" style="s2">step between insight and action</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.059" end="00:09:10.099" style="s2">and I think action is definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.089" end="00:09:11.959" style="s2">requirement because effective action</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.099" end="00:09:15.019" style="s2">tends to simplify the search space</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.959" end="00:09:17.989" style="s2">really fast so I tend to sound like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.019" end="00:09:20.119" style="s2">complete theoretical person but I&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.989" end="00:09:22.279" style="s2">you introduced me as an action person</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.119" end="00:09:25.039" style="s2">too because when you&#39;re working in these</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.279" end="00:09:28.549" style="s2">complex domains it&#39;s the action in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.039" end="00:09:30.529" style="s2">world that can clarify and simplify yet</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.549" end="00:09:32.179" style="s2">through model building and action what</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.529" end="00:09:34.339" style="s2">the hell&#39;s going on truthfully that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.179" end="00:09:36.079" style="s2">what it&#39;s all about really is acting in</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.339" end="00:09:37.969" style="s2">the world I think we both also have an</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.079" end="00:09:40.309" style="s2">interest in the science of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.969" end="00:09:43.339" style="s2">or consciousness more broadly and here</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.309" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">ok and my argument is consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.339" end="00:09:47.049" style="s2">nothing but a tool to help us more</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:49.309" style="s2">effectively have action in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.049" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">science is another tool one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.309" end="00:09:52.519" style="s2">markers I want to put down and it might</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.959" end="00:09:54.829" style="s2">help us have our discussion without</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.519" end="00:09:55.909" style="s2">unnecessary conflict you know useful</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.829" end="00:09:58.539" style="s2">conflict that&#39;s good but unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.909" end="00:10:01.159" style="s2">conflict isn&#39;t is that I am NOT a</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.539" end="00:10:03.469" style="s2">scientific totalizer I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.159" end="00:10:05.689" style="s2">everything is science by any means right</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.469" end="00:10:07.969" style="s2">and you hear this argument against</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.689" end="00:10:09.919" style="s2">science scientism some people call it</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.969" end="00:10:11.209" style="s2">that people try to totalize science and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.919" end="00:10:12.979" style="s2">yeah there I&#39;m sure there are people</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.209" end="00:10:15.109" style="s2">that do that but I don&#39;t know any first</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.979" end="00:10:17.539" style="s2">class scientists that do that you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.109" end="00:10:19.309" style="s2">science is this thing it&#39;s a box it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.539" end="00:10:21.319" style="s2">model building that has congruence to</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.309" end="00:10:23.959" style="s2">reality that looks for data and</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.319" end="00:10:25.519" style="s2">experiments to falsify the models and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.959" end="00:10:27.049" style="s2">then create new models or improve the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.519" end="00:10:29.059" style="s2">models so they&#39;re not falsified and</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.049" end="00:10:30.949" style="s2">that&#39;s what science is science is not</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.059" end="00:10:33.649" style="s2">technology right it&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.949" end="00:10:36.049" style="s2">technology existed long before science</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.649" end="00:10:39.379" style="s2">right you know you know the invention of</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.049" end="00:10:41.929" style="s2">the plow the invention of Agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.379" end="00:10:44.569" style="s2">the invention of the waterwheel now</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.929" end="00:10:47.299" style="s2">science has amazingly accelerated</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.569" end="00:10:49.699" style="s2">technology but it is a separate domain</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.299" end="00:10:52.339" style="s2">and so the doing is to because not</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.699" end="00:10:54.159" style="s2">science science builds the models and</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.339" end="00:10:57.439" style="s2">then doers of various sorts whether</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.159" end="00:10:59.299" style="s2">technologists or general empiricists you</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.439" end="00:11:02.119" style="s2">know I consider technology to be a</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.299" end="00:11:03.679" style="s2">subset of general empiricist and so we</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.119" end="00:11:05.509" style="s2">then have technologists and other</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.679" end="00:11:07.639" style="s2">classes of doers in which there are many</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.509" end="00:11:10.459" style="s2">other classes including organizational</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.639" end="00:11:12.919" style="s2">design as an example of a class of doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.459" end="00:11:15.470" style="s2">that isn&#39;t really technology elite not</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.919" end="00:11:17.689" style="s2">in the hard sense though in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.470" end="00:11:18.800" style="s2">taking scientific models let&#39;s say our</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.689" end="00:11:20.630" style="s2">models of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.800" end="00:11:22.310" style="s2">clients and putting them to work one</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.630" end="00:11:25.670" style="s2">could argue that organizational design</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.310" end="00:11:28.490" style="s2">is a form of technology so with that as</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.670" end="00:11:30.440" style="s2">some boundary setting a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.490" end="00:11:32.660" style="s2">things I have like four little clouds</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.440" end="00:11:35.089" style="s2">word clouds here that came out of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.660" end="00:11:37.070" style="s2">so in in terms of complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.089" end="00:11:42.110" style="s2">what you&#39;ve said I think it highlights</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.070" end="00:11:45.170" style="s2">the role of action in complex domains so</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.110" end="00:11:47.450" style="s2">if we look at some of the pools that</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.170" end="00:11:50.149" style="s2">scientists have relied upon in the past</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.450" end="00:11:53.060" style="s2">classical science we make if-then</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.149" end="00:11:56.269" style="s2">propositions and if-then propositions</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.060" end="00:11:59.029" style="s2">can create hypotheses hypotheses can</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.269" end="00:12:01.820" style="s2">establish experimental design and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.029" end="00:12:03.709" style="s2">we can test those if-then propositions</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.820" end="00:12:05.959" style="s2">but when we get into the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.709" end="00:12:08.000" style="s2">domain something really interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.959" end="00:12:09.800" style="s2">happening with causality let&#39;s just keep</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.000" end="00:12:13.430" style="s2">it at that right now maybe you want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.800" end="00:12:14.899" style="s2">comment on that and these easy if-then</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.430" end="00:12:16.790" style="s2">propositions</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.899" end="00:12:18.920" style="s2">start to break up they&#39;re not adequate</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.790" end="00:12:20.510" style="s2">to facing complexity and so what we see</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.920" end="00:12:23.720" style="s2">with people that are working in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.510" end="00:12:27.380" style="s2">complex domain is this return to action</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.720" end="00:12:29.209" style="s2">action in probing and sensing these are</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.380" end="00:12:32.630" style="s2">all words that we associate with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.209" end="00:12:35.600" style="s2">body and empiricism observation action</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.630" end="00:12:38.950" style="s2">probing sensing pattern recognition and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.600" end="00:12:43.130" style="s2">you start to see science as returning or</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.950" end="00:12:45.649" style="s2">evolving to more roots in action sensory</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.130" end="00:12:48.140" style="s2">motor action and that&#39;s interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.649" end="00:12:50.540" style="s2">the way you kind of put what I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.140" end="00:12:52.130" style="s2">saying before together and highlighted</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.540" end="00:12:55.579" style="s2">actions almost like we&#39;re being pushed</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.130" end="00:12:57.350" style="s2">now to rediscover the domain of inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.579" end="00:12:59.660" style="s2">that has to do with our sensory motor</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.350" end="00:13:01.399" style="s2">perception capacities and maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.660" end="00:13:03.649" style="s2">could comment on that a lot of good</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.399" end="00:13:05.390" style="s2">things you talk about causality one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.649" end="00:13:07.640" style="s2">my favorite topic and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.390" end="00:13:09.860" style="s2">complexity science really does open up a</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.640" end="00:13:11.420" style="s2">whole new field of inquiry and I like to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.860" end="00:13:13.730" style="s2">point out to people that least in my</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.420" end="00:13:15.589" style="s2">mind the gateway from previous</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.730" end="00:13:17.990" style="s2">reductionist science to complexity</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.589" end="00:13:20.690" style="s2">science was the mathematical field of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.990" end="00:13:23.779" style="s2">deterministic chaos if you actually look</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.690" end="00:13:26.779" style="s2">at some of the people involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.779" end="00:13:28.520" style="s2">earliest pre-work in complexity many of</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.779" end="00:13:30.529" style="s2">them came through deterministic chaos</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.520" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">and for the members of the audience who</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.529" end="00:13:33.800" style="s2">don&#39;t understand or don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:35.149" style="s2">about deterministic chaos it essentially</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.800" end="00:13:37.250" style="s2">means that in systems of even</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.149" end="00:13:39.230" style="s2">surprisingly little complexity but some</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.250" end="00:13:41.480" style="s2">level of complexity that are entirely</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.230" end="00:13:45.160" style="s2">deterministic the actual trajectory of</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.480" end="00:13:47.930" style="s2">the system over time is very very very</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.160" end="00:13:49.910" style="s2">wildly based on the initial conditions</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.930" end="00:13:52.670" style="s2">so that while in theory the old</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.910" end="00:13:54.950" style="s2">laplacian Newtonian model that oh I</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.670" end="00:13:56.600" style="s2">could have every I knew every position</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.950" end="00:13:58.430" style="s2">and every motion of every particle in</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.600" end="00:14:00.740" style="s2">the universe I could predict all of time</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.430" end="00:14:02.420" style="s2">going forward in theory even if that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.740" end="00:14:04.670" style="s2">were true which it probably isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.420" end="00:14:06.770" style="s2">then deterministic chaos means it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.670" end="00:14:08.779" style="s2">practically be done even an</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.770" end="00:14:10.790" style="s2">extraordinarily simple system like the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.779" end="00:14:13.310" style="s2">Lorenz attractor or a three body problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.790" end="00:14:15.410" style="s2">and orbital mechanic the tiniest</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.310" end="00:14:17.240" style="s2">difference in the initial conditions way</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.410" end="00:14:18.890" style="s2">below the level of human capability to</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.240" end="00:14:21.350" style="s2">measure results in very different</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.890" end="00:14:24.470" style="s2">trajectories so that basically overthrew</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.350" end="00:14:26.060" style="s2">that laplacian view of the world as</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.470" end="00:14:28.010" style="s2">mechanism at least from a practical</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.060" end="00:14:30.410" style="s2">perspective and that&#39;s basically just</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.010" end="00:14:33.200" style="s2">math right it turns out that you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.410" end="00:14:35.060" style="s2">mathematically do deterministic chaos in</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.200" end="00:14:38.300" style="s2">very sound system so then that basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.060" end="00:14:42.020" style="s2">led to okay what else does that lead to</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.300" end="00:14:45.709" style="s2">and in this case it basically to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.020" end="00:14:48.020" style="s2">said that causality is way flip rear of</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.709" end="00:14:51.070" style="s2">a concept than we thought it is right</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.020" end="00:14:53.899" style="s2">and as we&#39;ve exposed and explored in</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.070" end="00:14:57.770" style="s2">complexity science we&#39;ve run into two</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.899" end="00:15:00.020" style="s2">kind of related phenomena the first is</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.770" end="00:15:01.940" style="s2">emergence right still the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.020" end="00:15:03.800" style="s2">question in complexity science what</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.940" end="00:15:06.079" style="s2">exactly is emergence and what can we</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.800" end="00:15:07.430" style="s2">really truly say about it what can we</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.079" end="00:15:09.589" style="s2">say about it that might actually be</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.430" end="00:15:12.950" style="s2">useful for the applied people to cause</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.589" end="00:15:15.260" style="s2">emergencies of some sort of that are you</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.950" end="00:15:17.240" style="s2">that are useful in the world and and</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.260" end="00:15:19.790" style="s2">essentially emergence again for folks is</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.240" end="00:15:21.980" style="s2">how do very low-level phenomena somehow</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.790" end="00:15:25.220" style="s2">promote themselves to higher level of</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.980" end="00:15:28.360" style="s2">phenomena let&#39;s take like an organism as</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.220" end="00:15:31.100" style="s2">a fine example of an emergent property</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.360" end="00:15:33.529" style="s2">at the bottom you and I are both just</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.100" end="00:15:35.750" style="s2">atoms jingling around right somehow</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.529" end="00:15:38.240" style="s2">those atoms become embedded in chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.750" end="00:15:40.640" style="s2">they turn Munda molecule create basic</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.240" end="00:15:42.290" style="s2">chemistry the basic chemistry is</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.640" end="00:15:44.810" style="s2">involved in a very complex and network</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.290" end="00:15:45.540" style="s2">of biochemistry which eventually results</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.810" end="00:15:48.269" style="s2">in metabolism</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.540" end="00:15:50.970" style="s2">which then results in cells cells</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.269" end="00:15:53.519" style="s2">organize and classify themselves as</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.970" end="00:15:55.920" style="s2">tissues tissues become organs organs</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.519" end="00:15:58.410" style="s2">become system systems become organisms</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.920" end="00:16:00.839" style="s2">and organisms are embedded in ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.410" end="00:16:03.089" style="s2">and emergence what&#39;s that all about when</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.839" end="00:16:07.230" style="s2">we get to causality my other favorite</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.089" end="00:16:09.120" style="s2">slippery topic is top-down cause Alan</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.230" end="00:16:11.130" style="s2">what the hell could that mean so in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.120" end="00:16:13.620" style="s2">case of the human one could say the fact</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.130" end="00:16:16.440" style="s2">that some specific atoms and say one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.620" end="00:16:21.300" style="s2">your red blood cells is contained inside</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.440" end="00:16:24.750" style="s2">of a ecosystem a organism tissue systems</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.300" end="00:16:26.399" style="s2">etc mean that those atoms will behave</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.750" end="00:16:28.079" style="s2">very differently than they would if they</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.399" end="00:16:31.050" style="s2">were just on their own floating around</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.079" end="00:16:34.589" style="s2">and say the ocean and so one could say</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.050" end="00:16:38.970" style="s2">that the cause of the behavior of those</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.589" end="00:16:41.790" style="s2">atoms is considerably constrained and</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.970" end="00:16:43.680" style="s2">define defines too strong but let&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.790" end="00:16:45.899" style="s2">constrained by the fact they&#39;re embedded</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.680" end="00:16:48.209" style="s2">in this hierarchical Tower so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.899" end="00:16:52.079" style="s2">that would be great because this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.209" end="00:16:54.930" style="s2">where complexity thinking use in process</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.079" end="00:16:58.170" style="s2">spot no process relational process</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.930" end="00:17:01.440" style="s2">thinking is as complexity is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.170" end="00:17:03.569" style="s2">aesthetic discipline so we need to try</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.440" end="00:17:05.699" style="s2">to integrate them so process thinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.569" end="00:17:09.209" style="s2">would say that the the paradox of</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.699" end="00:17:11.760" style="s2">emergence and top-down causality comes</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.209" end="00:17:15.480" style="s2">from the limitations of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:18.480" style="s2">thinking so let me reframe that and see</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.480" end="00:17:20.459" style="s2">if we can work with these two concepts</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.480" end="00:17:22.439" style="s2">in a way that we don&#39;t get these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.459" end="00:17:25.380" style="s2">of conundrums that you so well</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.439" end="00:17:28.020" style="s2">articulated so for emergence for example</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.380" end="00:17:30.150" style="s2">we can look at when you tackle the</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.020" end="00:17:31.740" style="s2">problem of emergence the way you do and</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.150" end="00:17:35.570" style="s2">you construct these larger and larger</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.740" end="00:17:38.220" style="s2">levels this is something that process</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.570" end="00:17:41.309" style="s2">philosophy would say is your reifying a</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.220" end="00:17:44.790" style="s2">level your reifying the larger system so</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.309" end="00:17:46.559" style="s2">how can we work with emergent systems</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.790" end="00:17:48.929" style="s2">let&#39;s say just using that as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.559" end="00:17:51.570" style="s2">placeholder and not do that so one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.929" end="00:17:54.570" style="s2">the easy ways we can do is we can say</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.570" end="00:17:57.270" style="s2">that there are developmental processes</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.570" end="00:17:59.240" style="s2">and their evolutionary processes and</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.270" end="00:18:02.000" style="s2">every agent that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.240" end="00:18:04.130" style="s2">developing its own creative advance it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.000" end="00:18:06.290" style="s2">doing novel things at probing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.130" end="00:18:09.230" style="s2">bumping into things it&#39;s doing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.290" end="00:18:12.380" style="s2">within a developmental feel the human</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.230" end="00:18:14.510" style="s2">body is the developmental field for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.380" end="00:18:16.700" style="s2">molecules the same molecule and a</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.510" end="00:18:18.920" style="s2">different kind of environment is going</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.700" end="00:18:21.080" style="s2">to exercise different affordances so</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.920" end="00:18:22.790" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get patterns emergent</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.080" end="00:18:25.220" style="s2">patterns that are different because you</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.790" end="00:18:27.350" style="s2">have you have action inside</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.220" end="00:18:29.809" style="s2">developmental fields now it gets more</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.350" end="00:18:31.970" style="s2">complicated than that because the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.809" end="00:18:34.160" style="s2">developmental fields themselves are also</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.970" end="00:18:37.330" style="s2">evolving and this is kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.160" end="00:18:40.160" style="s2">Stephen Jay Gould says that organisms</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.330" end="00:18:42.620" style="s2">develop within developmental fields in</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.160" end="00:18:45.320" style="s2">the developmental fields evolve and he</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.620" end="00:18:47.870" style="s2">argued that with these two if you really</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.320" end="00:18:50.360" style="s2">understand the two pattern dynamics the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.870" end="00:18:50.929" style="s2">two dynamics and how they relate to each</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.360" end="00:18:54.380" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.929" end="00:18:56.630" style="s2">then this is what emerges so he would</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.380" end="00:18:59.660" style="s2">say that emergence of new species has</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.630" end="00:19:03.890" style="s2">happens because you have developmental</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.660" end="00:19:06.080" style="s2">potentials that are codependent upon the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.890" end="00:19:08.179" style="s2">fields in which they&#39;re developing which</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.080" end="00:19:11.510" style="s2">changes and evolves a developmental</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.179" end="00:19:13.910" style="s2">field so you get changes that are are no</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.510" end="00:19:16.550" style="s2">longer progressive and developmental you</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.910" end="00:19:18.559" style="s2">get changes that look like leaps and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.550" end="00:19:21.350" style="s2">that&#39;s what emergence is it&#39;s a change</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.559" end="00:19:24.200" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t look continuous with the</p>

<p begin="00:26:17.780" end="00:26:24.470" style="s2">d spacial eise&#39;s complexity and goes</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.900" end="00:26:27.170" style="s2">into this sense of things are rising and</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.470" end="00:26:28.910" style="s2">falling with a signature duration and</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.170" end="00:26:31.850" style="s2">this is true at all what we would call</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.910" end="00:26:34.070" style="s2">scales using spatial terms so so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.850" end="00:26:36.020" style="s2">one thing that it would be great if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.070" end="00:26:37.970" style="s2">you know continue to think about that</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.020" end="00:26:41.570" style="s2">and you&#39;ll start to feel more into a</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.970" end="00:26:43.670" style="s2">process orientation now the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.570" end="00:26:45.860" style="s2">you said and this is gets you know some</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.670" end="00:26:47.929" style="s2">of this gets hard to wrap your head</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.860" end="00:26:50.780" style="s2">around because it process philosophies</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.929" end="00:26:53.480" style="s2">really a different way of thinking but</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.780" end="00:26:54.320" style="s2">if you look at coarse graining and fine</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.480" end="00:26:58.509" style="s2">graining</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.320" end="00:27:01.730" style="s2">and so if I wanted to try to explain a</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.509" end="00:27:03.529" style="s2">airplane at the level of quantum</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.730" end="00:27:05.149" style="s2">fluctuations you&#39;re right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.529" end="00:27:06.769" style="s2">impossible so we say we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.149" end="00:27:10.250" style="s2">coarse-grain we&#39;re going to look at</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.769" end="00:27:12.830" style="s2">things as objects as persistent in time</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.250" end="00:27:16.850" style="s2">blah blah blah but what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.830" end="00:27:21.320" style="s2">when we move down to the smaller parts</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.850" end="00:27:24.710" style="s2">if I move from myself to my cells myself</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.320" end="00:27:27.379" style="s2">to molecules we are actually entering</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.710" end="00:27:30.559" style="s2">much larger domain can you see what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.379" end="00:27:33.259" style="s2">saying so for example the iron in my red</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.559" end="00:27:36.740" style="s2">blood cells the hemoglobin in my red</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.259" end="00:27:39.049" style="s2">cells has iron in it and even I though I</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.740" end="00:27:43.220" style="s2">use the term in this little piece of</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.049" end="00:27:46.629" style="s2">iron is in my cells it&#39;s actually made</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.220" end="00:27:49.970" style="s2">in the in where stars are made in these</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.629" end="00:27:52.220" style="s2">cosmological fields and I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.970" end="00:27:54.980" style="s2">think that right now that iron is no</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.220" end="00:27:58.000" style="s2">longer in that cosmological field but it</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.980" end="00:28:01.639" style="s2">is and so process philosophy is really</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.000" end="00:28:04.279" style="s2">suspect about what&#39;s inside of what so</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.639" end="00:28:08.269" style="s2">it seems like that little piece of iron</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.279" end="00:28:11.080" style="s2">in my hemoglobin is small enough to fit</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.269" end="00:28:14.659" style="s2">inside of me like dandy fits in a box</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.080" end="00:28:18.350" style="s2">but process philosophy doesn&#39;t bound</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.659" end="00:28:21.080" style="s2">things like that it says iron is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.350" end="00:28:23.570" style="s2">cosmological process and it exists in</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.080" end="00:28:26.389" style="s2">this developmental field also that I</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.570" end="00:28:28.940" style="s2">would call me but it&#39;s still part of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.389" end="00:28:31.190" style="s2">cosmological process it doesn&#39;t cease to</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.940" end="00:28:33.590" style="s2">be part of the cosmological trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.190" end="00:28:36.950" style="s2">of iron itself anymore than the protons</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.590" end="00:28:39.049" style="s2">in that iron ceased to have their</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.950" end="00:28:41.029" style="s2">signature half-life and so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.049" end="00:28:44.090" style="s2">categories of existence that were</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.029" end="00:28:47.929" style="s2">interested in in process philosophy seem</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.090" end="00:28:51.200" style="s2">to defy this notion of what smaller and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.929" end="00:28:55.820" style="s2">what&#39;s larger because these processes</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.200" end="00:28:59.809" style="s2">are not inside me as smaller pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.820" end="00:29:03.409" style="s2">candy inside a box they&#39;re what we call</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.809" end="00:29:05.750" style="s2">internally related to me this is not the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.409" end="00:29:08.179" style="s2">same as being spatially inside and this</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.750" end="00:29:11.360" style="s2">means that the cosmological process</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.179" end="00:29:13.639" style="s2">internally related to me without which I</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.360" end="00:29:16.070" style="s2">could not be me and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.639" end="00:29:18.619" style="s2">external relations too so we switch from</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.070" end="00:29:21.350" style="s2">insights and outsides which is a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.619" end="00:29:24.200" style="s2">concrete metaphor doesn&#39;t not adequate</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.350" end="00:29:26.600" style="s2">to process relational terms in this</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.200" end="00:29:29.450" style="s2">notion of duration and internal and</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.600" end="00:29:32.559" style="s2">external relationships and we start to</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.450" end="00:29:35.119" style="s2">stretch out the notion of our</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.559" end="00:29:36.769" style="s2">participation so I loved what you were</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.119" end="00:29:39.320" style="s2">kind of saying that thing because if we</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.769" end="00:29:43.039" style="s2">find grain we&#39;re actually working with</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.320" end="00:29:44.749" style="s2">much larger processes and then we see</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.039" end="00:29:49.279" style="s2">that then quantum fluctuations are not</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.749" end="00:29:51.769" style="s2">in the plane the plane is in the quantum</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.279" end="00:29:54.740" style="s2">fluctuations because the quantum</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.769" end="00:29:56.869" style="s2">fluctuations is much larger domain it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.740" end="00:29:59.869" style="s2">a cosmological domain I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.869" end="00:30:02.419" style="s2">that this is very clear I&#39;m just trying</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.869" end="00:30:05.299" style="s2">to give you a taste of how process</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.419" end="00:30:07.249" style="s2">philosophy can enter into complexity</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.299" end="00:30:11.119" style="s2">science and some of these ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.249" end="00:30:14.960" style="s2">coarse graining and really hybridize and</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.119" end="00:30:17.509" style="s2">catalyze the field of thought and</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.960" end="00:30:19.909" style="s2">science and let&#39;s pursue the example of</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.509" end="00:30:21.980" style="s2">iron&#39;s and I&#39;d clear one we all know</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.909" end="00:30:25.249" style="s2">those of us who&#39;ve studied little</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.980" end="00:30:27.889" style="s2">astrophysics to know that iron is indeed</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.249" end="00:30:31.190" style="s2">created in the late stages of certain</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.889" end="00:30:34.879" style="s2">larger stars and we are all Stardust as</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.190" end="00:30:37.820" style="s2">it turns out and some of the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.879" end="00:30:39.619" style="s2">are only created in supernovas so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.820" end="00:30:42.769" style="s2">we are not only starred us but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.619" end="00:30:45.289" style="s2">also supernova dust and so those atoms</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.769" end="00:30:46.820" style="s2">of iron were distributed a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.289" end="00:30:49.820" style="s2">billion years before the earth came into</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.820" end="00:30:52.519" style="s2">existence probably and the Sun and those</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.820" end="00:30:53.950" style="s2">iron molecules some number of them that</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.519" end="00:30:57.230" style="s2">ended up being captured by the</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.950" end="00:30:59.840" style="s2">gravitational concentration that was the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.230" end="00:31:01.970" style="s2">Sun ended up being captured in that disk</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.840" end="00:31:04.220" style="s2">and some of them ended up being captured</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.970" end="00:31:05.840" style="s2">in the gravitationally attracted entity</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.220" end="00:31:07.580" style="s2">limit of being the earth and some of</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.840" end="00:31:10.340" style="s2">them have been extracted by biological</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.580" end="00:31:13.039" style="s2">processes and ended up in ourselves I</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.340" end="00:31:14.779" style="s2">think that&#39;s certainly true on the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.039" end="00:31:16.159" style="s2">hands interesting you brought up time</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.779" end="00:31:18.889" style="s2">scale so I think that&#39;s really a good</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.159" end="00:31:21.539" style="s2">tool for differentiating you know the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.889" end="00:31:24.059" style="s2">the activity of cells is on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.539" end="00:31:26.999" style="s2">of microseconds you know the chemical</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.059" end="00:31:29.759" style="s2">operations of metabolism microseconds</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.999" end="00:31:31.979" style="s2">and below that and so the model of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.759" end="00:31:33.509" style="s2">cell or the cell itself if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.979" end="00:31:36.559" style="s2">reify it let&#39;s call it the model of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.509" end="00:31:40.139" style="s2">cell on the micro second level is</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.559" end="00:31:42.840" style="s2">essentially entirely independent of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.139" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2">cosmological evolution of iron and so if</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.840" end="00:31:50.309" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to understand the amazingly</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:52.320" style="s2">complex mess that a cell is I can safely</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.309" end="00:31:54.359" style="s2">at you know at the level of microseconds</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.320" end="00:31:57.889" style="s2">the level of metabolism I can it can</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.359" end="00:32:01.909" style="s2">safely ignore very long time frame</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.889" end="00:32:04.320" style="s2">phenomena like the Astrophysical</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.909" end="00:32:06.690" style="s2">creation of iron it&#39;s just not relevant</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.320" end="00:32:08.389" style="s2">because there there&#39;s nothing about it</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.690" end="00:32:11.279" style="s2">that&#39;s relevant on the same level the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.389" end="00:32:12.479" style="s2">the half-life of the neutrons in iron I</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.279" end="00:32:14.609" style="s2">don&#39;t really need to worry about either</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.479" end="00:32:16.259" style="s2">and certainly not in proton so the class</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.609" end="00:32:18.239" style="s2">I check protons didn&#39;t have a half-life</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.259" end="00:32:20.429" style="s2">was least not clear so when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.239" end="00:32:23.369" style="s2">thinking about the timeframe of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.429" end="00:32:25.229" style="s2">so that you&#39;re not just overwhelmed by</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.369" end="00:32:27.720" style="s2">way too much detail it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.229" end="00:32:30.179" style="s2">perfectly reasonable to just say yes it</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.720" end="00:32:32.460" style="s2">is true that iron was is part of an</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.179" end="00:32:33.989" style="s2">ongoing process in fact by the way the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.460" end="00:32:36.599" style="s2">eventually the earth will get eaten by</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.989" end="00:32:39.539" style="s2">the Sun and the Sun will turn into a I</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.599" end="00:32:42.090" style="s2">guess it&#39;s a neutron star eventually and</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.539" end="00:32:44.129" style="s2">maybe it&#39;ll get collided with something</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.090" end="00:32:45.419" style="s2">else and become a supernova or get eaten</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.129" end="00:32:47.099" style="s2">by a black hole and something will</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.419" end="00:32:49.830" style="s2">happen that an iron yeah that&#39;s all true</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.099" end="00:32:51.149" style="s2">over billions of years but when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.830" end="00:32:52.769" style="s2">looking at what&#39;s happening in the cell</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.149" end="00:32:54.720" style="s2">microsecond by microsecond or</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.769" end="00:32:58.559" style="s2">millisecond by millisecond that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.720" end="00:33:00.960" style="s2">not useful or relevant right so the move</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.559" end="00:33:04.169" style="s2">though here and whether we can make it</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.960" end="00:33:07.379" style="s2">illustrate it as profitable is to look</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.169" end="00:33:10.679" style="s2">at the scales of duration rather than</p>

<p begin="00:33:10.679" end="00:33:16.169" style="s2">looking at spatially grained we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:33:23.460" end="00:33:28.259" style="s2">aspect of duration is a synchronous</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.559" end="00:33:31.559" style="s2">arising and falling so if all my cells</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.259" end="00:33:33.960" style="s2">you know the cell lives for X number of</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.559" end="00:33:35.220" style="s2">years different cells for different</p>

<p begin="00:33:35.220" end="00:33:42.210" style="s2">my epithelial cells don&#39;t live very long</p>

<p begin="00:33:42.210" end="00:33:47.100" style="s2">the same time I would be dead right so</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.120" end="00:33:49.320" style="s2">it&#39;s the fact that we are not only</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.100" end="00:33:51.720" style="s2">working with different durations but</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.320" end="00:33:53.730" style="s2">they&#39;re all the arising and falling of</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.720" end="00:33:56.580" style="s2">these durations are asynchronous and</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.730" end="00:33:59.220" style="s2">it&#39;s why process philosophy can use</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.580" end="00:34:02.159" style="s2">models and patterns and call them</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.220" end="00:34:05.970" style="s2">structures and systems because as an</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.159" end="00:34:10.470" style="s2">individual cell is born its entrained by</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.970" end="00:34:12.270" style="s2">the pre-existing rhythms of its society</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.470" end="00:34:14.490" style="s2">of cells so that the structure holds</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.270" end="00:34:16.919" style="s2">together it&#39;s kind of like the old</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.490" end="00:34:19.290" style="s2">Buddhist story of you know you take a</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.919" end="00:34:20.609" style="s2">bow and you replace one side and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.290" end="00:34:22.740" style="s2">you replace the other side and then you</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.609" end="00:34:25.980" style="s2">place the mass and then replace the</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.740" end="00:34:27.960" style="s2">floor and do you still have the same</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.980" end="00:34:30.960" style="s2">boat but it&#39;s this notion that the</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.960" end="00:34:34.230" style="s2">patterns hold because things are coming</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.960" end="00:34:36.899" style="s2">and going in communion with their</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.230" end="00:34:38.310" style="s2">societies that are persistent the other</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.899" end="00:34:40.260" style="s2">patterns essentially there are patterns</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.310" end="00:34:41.429" style="s2">that are persistent right doctor let me</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.260" end="00:34:43.649" style="s2">suggest a movie I&#39;d love to get your</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.429" end="00:34:47.310" style="s2">reacts to this instead of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.649" end="00:34:50.580" style="s2">faith and time what about if we talk</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.310" end="00:34:53.070" style="s2">about network and time all right</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.580" end="00:34:55.349" style="s2">networks are topological and a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.070" end="00:34:57.450" style="s2">network certainly has a time dimension</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.349" end="00:35:00.359" style="s2">and again let&#39;s use this example of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.450" end="00:35:03.119" style="s2">living organism and the definition I</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.359" end="00:35:05.339" style="s2">chose to use to define the individual is</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.119" end="00:35:08.820" style="s2">basically that collection of cells which</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.339" end="00:35:12.869" style="s2">is connected to one or two second time</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.820" end="00:35:15.630" style="s2">depth network of nutrients and gases and</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.869" end="00:35:17.730" style="s2">that&#39;s all a very interesting network</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.630" end="00:35:19.320" style="s2">and you know Geoffrey west out of Santa</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.730" end="00:35:21.750" style="s2">Fe Institute has written a bunch of good</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.320" end="00:35:23.400" style="s2">stuff on the mathematics and the physics</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.750" end="00:35:25.859" style="s2">of how that plumbing actually works</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.400" end="00:35:28.260" style="s2">really if somehow I had itself from my</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.859" end="00:35:30.570" style="s2">body that was 20 feet away but it was</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.260" end="00:35:33.060" style="s2">connected to this near-real-time Network</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.570" end="00:35:35.940" style="s2">I could say topologically and in time</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.060" end="00:35:37.710" style="s2">binding it is part of me so I&#39;m not so</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.940" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">interested in space but rather the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.710" end="00:35:41.880" style="s2">network you know it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:45.480" style="s2">because in process philosophy we would</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.880" end="00:35:47.750" style="s2">talk more about functional relationships</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.480" end="00:35:49.580" style="s2">it&#39;s really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.750" end="00:35:51.920" style="s2">one or half dozen of another because</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.580" end="00:35:53.960" style="s2">what you called it a dynamic network and</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.920" end="00:35:55.700" style="s2">that&#39;s what I would say is functional</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.960" end="00:35:58.400" style="s2">relationships it&#39;s different than nodes</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.700" end="00:36:01.880" style="s2">and connection right so nodes and</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.400" end="00:36:04.310" style="s2">connections are like I can connect</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.880" end="00:36:07.070" style="s2">training wheels to my bicycle</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.310" end="00:36:09.580" style="s2">I don&#39;t know life out of that but those</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.070" end="00:36:11.780" style="s2">are not a functional relationship</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.580" end="00:36:13.670" style="s2">functional relationship and process</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.780" end="00:36:15.830" style="s2">philosophy is a relationship that makes</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.670" end="00:36:19.160" style="s2">a difference in both directions that</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.830" end="00:36:23.270" style="s2">constrains possibilities and actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.160" end="00:36:25.880" style="s2">also creates new possibilities and so if</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.270" end="00:36:28.130" style="s2">we look at networks that way if we look</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.880" end="00:36:30.470" style="s2">at the human body as a system of</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.130" end="00:36:33.290" style="s2">functional relationships that both</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.470" end="00:36:35.210" style="s2">constrain and enable new relationships</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.290" end="00:36:38.630" style="s2">or ongoing relationships so we could say</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.210" end="00:36:41.390" style="s2">carry them forward so nothing can stay</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.630" end="00:36:43.370" style="s2">the same although that patterns can</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.390" end="00:36:45.590" style="s2">reiterate then we&#39;re getting close to</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.370" end="00:36:47.840" style="s2">the notion of a network and process</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.590" end="00:36:50.180" style="s2">thinking good I had a suspicion that</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.840" end="00:36:52.520" style="s2">putting out the move of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.180" end="00:36:55.310" style="s2">networks rather VAP might be useful for</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.520" end="00:36:56.930" style="s2">convergence yeah thinking and again just</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.310" end="00:36:58.820" style="s2">to make it clear for you know this model</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.930" end="00:37:00.650" style="s2">analogy we&#39;ve been using the network I</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.820" end="00:37:03.140" style="s2">had in mind here is essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.650" end="00:37:06.860" style="s2">circulatory system which delivers oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.140" end="00:37:09.760" style="s2">and nutrients to the cells and takes</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.860" end="00:37:13.600" style="s2">from the cells waste product and co2</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.760" end="00:37:16.490" style="s2">delivers the co2 to the lungs to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.600" end="00:37:18.350" style="s2">exhaled delivers the toxicities to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.490" end="00:37:20.990" style="s2">deliver to be further processed and</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.350" end="00:37:23.350" style="s2">disposed of and operates in the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.990" end="00:37:26.780" style="s2">direction bringing nutrients from the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.350" end="00:37:29.360" style="s2">intestines to the cells and bring oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.780" end="00:37:32.120" style="s2">to the cells and anything that is not in</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.360" end="00:37:34.520" style="s2">real-time in near-real-time 2 seconds</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.120" end="00:37:37.490" style="s2">coupled to that network is not a living</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.520" end="00:37:40.490" style="s2">cell that it&#39;s part of me and so there</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.490" end="00:37:42.350" style="s2">we unify this site this concept of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.490" end="00:37:44.750" style="s2">identity of an individual as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.350" end="00:37:47.150" style="s2">collection of lower level entities cells</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.750" end="00:37:50.090" style="s2">which are reasonably well defined at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.150" end="00:37:54.830" style="s2">cell membrane level with membership in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.090" end="00:37:56.870" style="s2">single Network this network of gases and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.830" end="00:37:58.970" style="s2">nutrients essentially yes so I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.870" end="00:38:01.640" style="s2">that&#39;s sufficiently coarse-grained to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.970" end="00:38:04.190" style="s2">almost like a complicated</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.640" end="00:38:05.660" style="s2">you know the way you&#39;ve this attaches to</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.190" end="00:38:08.480" style="s2">that and then this moves to that but</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.660" end="00:38:11.089" style="s2">what happens at the interfaces of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.480" end="00:38:14.180" style="s2">elite Olevia are in the lungs and that</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.089" end="00:38:16.430" style="s2">gas is really very complex we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.180" end="00:38:18.200" style="s2">more into the territory of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.430" end="00:38:20.990" style="s2">one of the things if we could pivot here</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.200" end="00:38:22.849" style="s2">and maybe kind of move into a different</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.990" end="00:38:25.269" style="s2">model one of the things I like to do is</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.849" end="00:38:27.769" style="s2">in my presentations when I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.269" end="00:38:31.640" style="s2">self-organization I show a picture of</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.769" end="00:38:36.410" style="s2">the ribosome the ribosome is a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.640" end="00:38:42.170" style="s2">complex intracellular piece of machinery</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.410" end="00:38:46.190" style="s2">really that has no agent in it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.170" end="00:38:49.549" style="s2">sub cellular system it&#39;s a very complex</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.190" end="00:38:52.700" style="s2">piece of machinery has to do all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.549" end="00:38:55.160" style="s2">of complex things like identifying and</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.700" end="00:38:57.740" style="s2">detecting and pacing itself in looking</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.160" end="00:39:00.970" style="s2">at threshold events and micro States of</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.740" end="00:39:04.220" style="s2">course it&#39;s required for the DNA to</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.970" end="00:39:06.859" style="s2">replicate itself unravels it&#39;s a station</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.220" end="00:39:11.029" style="s2">where the DNA and Revels and messenger</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.859" end="00:39:13.069" style="s2">RNA finds its own positions and there</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.029" end="00:39:15.380" style="s2">I&#39;m not really exactly sure about all</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.069" end="00:39:18.650" style="s2">the terms anymore but for me the</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.380" end="00:39:22.190" style="s2">question is how does this system self</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.650" end="00:39:24.920" style="s2">organize in where it itself does not</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.190" end="00:39:29.119" style="s2">have DNA it is the machinery on which</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.920" end="00:39:33.069" style="s2">DNA is replicated so what are the</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.119" end="00:39:37.549" style="s2">principles or their protocols that are</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.069" end="00:39:40.670" style="s2">guiding this self-organization and this</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.549" end="00:39:41.990" style="s2">is you know now this to me is where we</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.670" end="00:39:44.029" style="s2">get into like really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.990" end="00:39:47.180" style="s2">understand self-organization and human</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.029" end="00:39:52.809" style="s2">systems as something that&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.180" end="00:39:56.000" style="s2">complex than single agent decision make</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.809" end="00:39:57.410" style="s2">something else is seems to be going on</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.000" end="00:39:58.279" style="s2">so I didn&#39;t know if you had any thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.410" end="00:40:00.769" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.279" end="00:40:03.519" style="s2">oh yeah it&#39;s there&#39;s lots of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.769" end="00:40:07.519" style="s2">things and part problems in conundrum</p>

<p begin="00:40:09.829" end="00:40:13.670" style="s2">remember having with Stewart Kaufman out</p>

<p begin="00:43:22.349" end="00:43:26.490" style="s2">because I think in this this</p>

<p begin="00:43:26.490" end="00:43:32.819" style="s2">more questions and conundrums than facts</p>

<p begin="00:43:35.550" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">really well so in terms of pulling</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.869" end="00:43:44.400" style="s2">causality out of space you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:47.730" style="s2">the terms that I&#39;ve used to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.400" end="00:43:51.240" style="s2">causality in truly complex systems is I</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.730" end="00:43:54.300" style="s2">use the term numinous causality and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.240" end="00:43:56.609" style="s2">a little bit of a hedge because the word</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.300" end="00:43:58.700" style="s2">numinous also slightly connotes</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.609" end="00:44:01.470" style="s2">something that is either</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.700" end="00:44:04.680" style="s2">extraterrestrial or metaphysical or</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.470" end="00:44:08.579" style="s2">religious as a religiosity in the term</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.680" end="00:44:11.400" style="s2">numinous and i think that it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.579" end="00:44:12.030" style="s2">term because he always as you described</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.400" end="00:44:14.579" style="s2">your friend</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.030" end="00:44:18.329" style="s2">we often get to this place of well it</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.579" end="00:44:21.560" style="s2">must be something in that domain this</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.329" end="00:44:25.410" style="s2">domain of mystery or magic call it magic</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.560" end="00:44:27.900" style="s2">reality but what I mean by numinous is</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.410" end="00:44:29.700" style="s2">that it&#39;s simultaneously everywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.900" end="00:44:33.990" style="s2">nowhere at the same time that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.700" end="00:44:37.109" style="s2">sense that there is causality in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.990" end="00:44:40.430" style="s2">system in or that there&#39;s that the</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.109" end="00:44:42.330" style="s2">system is causal implications or or</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.430" end="00:44:44.580" style="s2">agents are causally</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.330" end="00:44:47.880" style="s2">implicated with their actions and</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.580" end="00:44:52.380" style="s2">vice-versa but at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.880" end="00:44:54.930" style="s2">complexity there is a sense that the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.380" end="00:44:58.860" style="s2">causality is so distributed everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.930" end="00:45:00.510" style="s2">and and nowhere at the same time but</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.860" end="00:45:03.120" style="s2">that&#39;s just the term I use this term</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.510" end="00:45:06.080" style="s2">numinous causality probably a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.120" end="00:45:09.150" style="s2">to have a discussion about because my</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.080" end="00:45:11.760" style="s2">operational model is to reject all</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.150" end="00:45:14.150" style="s2">things numinous unless there is</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.760" end="00:45:20.300" style="s2">substantial proof for their existence</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.150" end="00:45:25.340" style="s2">and so I define my exploration is in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.300" end="00:45:28.890" style="s2">real scientific domain and attempted ly</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.340" end="00:45:31.830" style="s2">to see how far we can go with that now</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.890" end="00:45:34.800" style="s2">as we know maybe the scientific mission</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.830" end="00:45:38.550" style="s2">isn&#39;t up to it but so far it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.800" end="00:45:40.020" style="s2">failed so I resist the temptation that</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.550" end="00:45:44.070" style="s2">would take what I would call the easy</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.020" end="00:45:46.830" style="s2">move and construct metaphysical entities</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.070" end="00:45:48.990" style="s2">to resolve gaps in our knowledge in fact</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.830" end="00:45:49.890" style="s2">fight that fairly vehemently in things</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.990" end="00:45:51.870" style="s2">that I&#39;m involved with</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.890" end="00:45:54.090" style="s2">I think it&#39;s look at the history of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.870" end="00:45:56.640" style="s2">human race it&#39;s been one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.090" end="00:46:00.090" style="s2">that&#39;s held humans back is the easy</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.640" end="00:46:01.800" style="s2">tendency to retreat to the numinous when</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.090" end="00:46:03.240" style="s2">it when yet and this is I love to point</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.800" end="00:46:05.610" style="s2">this out whatever time whenever the</p>

<p begin="00:47:49.829" end="00:47:56.220" style="s2">them so I guess I&#39;m putting up a big yo</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.299" end="00:47:58.650" style="s2">lay down when you when you make the</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.220" end="00:48:00.089" style="s2">numinous move yeah yes so that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.650" end="00:48:01.680" style="s2">know and I think you know I call it</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.089" end="00:48:05.640" style="s2">numinous causality because I&#39;m hedging</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.680" end="00:48:07.019" style="s2">it tends to want you to go and create a</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.640" end="00:48:10.589" style="s2">third term with some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.019" end="00:48:14.970" style="s2">metaphysical term but it still has kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.589" end="00:48:16.529" style="s2">of real-life causal features or aspects</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.970" end="00:48:19.200" style="s2">to it but I&#39;m gonna ask you a question</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.529" end="00:48:21.599" style="s2">do you think given enough time that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.200" end="00:48:23.989" style="s2">complex systems that we&#39;re studying will</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.599" end="00:48:27.259" style="s2">eventually prove to have specifiable</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.989" end="00:48:30.450" style="s2">linear or direct causations don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.259" end="00:48:32.220" style="s2">put down a small bet I would say kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.450" end="00:48:35.160" style="s2">like deterministic chaos and maybe able</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.220" end="00:48:38.759" style="s2">to show that there probably is something</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.160" end="00:48:42.150" style="s2">like direct causality but it&#39;s beyond</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.759" end="00:48:44.009" style="s2">the scale of humans and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.150" end="00:48:46.349" style="s2">universe converted the computor own IAM</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.009" end="00:48:48.480" style="s2">to say anything very specific about it</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.349" end="00:48:50.579" style="s2">yeah so that that&#39;s very close to what I</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.480" end="00:48:54.210" style="s2">call numinous causality that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.579" end="00:48:56.809" style="s2">it everywhere and or at the same time so</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.210" end="00:48:59.069" style="s2">process philosophy has this cool move</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.809" end="00:49:01.380" style="s2">and again we&#39;re not gonna be able to</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.069" end="00:49:05.130" style="s2">solve the problem I just want to open</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.380" end="00:49:09.329" style="s2">the search base with this kind of new</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.130" end="00:49:11.549" style="s2">orientation so in process philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.329" end="00:49:13.499" style="s2">for you go and if you do a thought</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.549" end="00:49:15.979" style="s2">experiment in process philosophy and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.499" end="00:49:19.680" style="s2">say what are the three what are the most</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.979" end="00:49:22.829" style="s2">fundamental things I need to start out</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.680" end="00:49:25.920" style="s2">with it derived this universe as best we</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.829" end="00:49:28.349" style="s2">know it this this all this stuff will</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.920" end="00:49:30.059" style="s2">process philosophy says you you only</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.349" end="00:49:32.099" style="s2">need three things and then you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.059" end="00:49:34.289" style="s2">I&#39;ll get back to the numinous causality</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.099" end="00:49:36.420" style="s2">and and to your point</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.289" end="00:49:38.069" style="s2">you&#39;re a very valid point so process</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.420" end="00:49:40.739" style="s2">philosophy says you only need three</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.069" end="00:49:43.019" style="s2">things so number one you need something</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.739" end="00:49:45.650" style="s2">even if it&#39;s just a placeholder to start</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.019" end="00:49:51.359" style="s2">with so you can call it process or</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.650" end="00:49:53.789" style="s2">potential or some kind of movement some</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.359" end="00:49:54.749" style="s2">kind of potential our language is you</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.789" end="00:49:57.930" style="s2">have to start somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.749" end="00:50:00.329" style="s2">so this is just axiomatic you you have</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.930" end="00:50:02.279" style="s2">this is our starting place so process</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.329" end="00:50:05.719" style="s2">philosophies this process which is like</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.279" end="00:50:08.479" style="s2">potential number two you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.719" end="00:50:12.029" style="s2">this process has to be self</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.479" end="00:50:14.569" style="s2">differentiating and another way or a</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.029" end="00:50:17.160" style="s2">simpler way to say that it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.569" end="00:50:20.190" style="s2">asymmetric so if you think of it as a</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.160" end="00:50:22.979" style="s2">feel it has to be self differentiating</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.190" end="00:50:25.469" style="s2">or you can even simplify that and say it</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.979" end="00:50:30.029" style="s2">has to be it has some asymmetry in it</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.469" end="00:50:36.269" style="s2">now these two alone can create a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.029" end="00:50:39.329" style="s2">stuff a lot of stuff can happen but what</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.269" end="00:50:42.029" style="s2">we also need it could create a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.329" end="00:50:44.670" style="s2">stuff but there would be no awareness</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.029" end="00:50:47.579" style="s2">without a third term we would not be</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.670" end="00:50:49.940" style="s2">aware that their cosmos exists and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.579" end="00:50:52.619" style="s2">third thing we need is the self</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.940" end="00:50:55.380" style="s2">differentiating parts need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.619" end="00:50:57.749" style="s2">participate with each other so in</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.380" end="00:50:59.940" style="s2">process philosophy you can derive the</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.749" end="00:51:02.489" style="s2">whole universe from three principles or</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.940" end="00:51:07.549" style="s2">protocols that there is process or</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.489" end="00:51:10.619" style="s2">movement or dynamism or creative</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.549" end="00:51:12.930" style="s2">potential that that has to self</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.619" end="00:51:14.999" style="s2">differentiate or another way to say that</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.930" end="00:51:18.359" style="s2">it&#39;s got to have a symmetric properties</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.999" end="00:51:20.849" style="s2">and the self differentiating parts need</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.359" end="00:51:22.559" style="s2">to participate so that you have</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.849" end="00:51:22.890" style="s2">awareness of difference than you have</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.559" end="00:51:25.650" style="s2">all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.890" end="00:51:27.329" style="s2">so the stuff that&#39;s in the world but the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.650" end="00:51:30.510" style="s2">interesting thing about processed</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.329" end="00:51:32.819" style="s2">philosophy is once this system gets</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.510" end="00:51:36.660" style="s2">started you cannot assume that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.819" end="00:51:39.390" style="s2">original process field or the process</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.660" end="00:51:42.539" style="s2">blenheim exists anymore it could</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.390" end="00:51:45.930" style="s2">actually self differentiate into more</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.539" end="00:51:47.940" style="s2">and more parts that then are you know in</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.930" end="00:51:50.760" style="s2">relation to each other in this case they</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.940" end="00:51:53.430" style="s2">have the original potential field is all</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.760" end="00:51:56.670" style="s2">internally related to the parts which is</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.430" end="00:51:58.440" style="s2">why we have a parent causality and so in</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.670" end="00:51:59.760" style="s2">this case it&#39;s very similar to what</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.440" end="00:52:03.869" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.760" end="00:52:06.240" style="s2">in terms of deterministic chaos because</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.869" end="00:52:09.539" style="s2">it could be the case that you could</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.240" end="00:52:11.099" style="s2">never trace back the causal origins of</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.539" end="00:52:13.559" style="s2">the universe because they don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.099" end="00:52:15.240" style="s2">exist it&#39;s kind of like it does the</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.559" end="00:52:18.799" style="s2">first amoeba exists</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.240" end="00:52:22.619" style="s2">well you can&#39;t find it but it it</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.799" end="00:52:25.680" style="s2">persists or subsist as as Whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.619" end="00:52:28.109" style="s2">would call it so there is a case to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.680" end="00:52:33.269" style="s2">made fairly similar to what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.109" end="00:52:36.539" style="s2">saying is that the though these complex</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.269" end="00:52:39.299" style="s2">systems are causally implicated but</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.539" end="00:52:42.869" style="s2">they&#39;re the causal origins cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.299" end="00:52:46.319" style="s2">found because they subsist they do not</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.869" end="00:52:49.410" style="s2">actually exist so this is a way another</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.319" end="00:52:54.920" style="s2">way that process philosophical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.410" end="00:52:57.630" style="s2">can understand some this this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.920" end="00:53:01.339" style="s2">important conundrum it&#39;s interesting not</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.630" end="00:53:04.529" style="s2">to ponder that some it doesn&#39;t again</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.339" end="00:53:07.170" style="s2">necessarily direct me as contrary to my</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.529" end="00:53:08.609" style="s2">own approach but it might so I have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.170" end="00:53:11.369" style="s2">think about it a little bit here and</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.609" end="00:53:13.079" style="s2">maybe I&#39;ll ask some questions and if I</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.369" end="00:53:14.549" style="s2">were to turn it around and say you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.079" end="00:53:17.490" style="s2">where&#39;s the universe come from and what</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.549" end="00:53:21.119" style="s2">is it again taking a scientific realist</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.490" end="00:53:24.410" style="s2">approach the best we know today is we</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.119" end="00:53:27.509" style="s2">had a Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.410" end="00:53:31.289" style="s2">that had specific attributes to it this</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.509" end="00:53:33.000" style="s2">specific universe had attributes and one</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.289" end="00:53:35.810" style="s2">of my earlier guess when the most</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.000" end="00:53:40.190" style="s2">interesting shows I did I think was Lee</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.810" end="00:53:42.950" style="s2">small one the who works both on the very</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.190" end="00:53:45.740" style="s2">small and very large you know he has a</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.950" end="00:53:47.600" style="s2">working hypothesis that the other lots</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.740" end="00:53:49.160" style="s2">of universes and universes are formed</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.600" end="00:53:51.980" style="s2">basically out the back end to black</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.160" end="00:53:53.800" style="s2">holes etc and each universe is different</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.980" end="00:53:57.770" style="s2">has different laws of physics different</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.800" end="00:54:00.770" style="s2">sizes etc some are interesting some</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.770" end="00:54:02.870" style="s2">aren&#39;t and they even hypothesizes very</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.770" end="00:54:05.060" style="s2">loosely an evolution of universes</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.870" end="00:54:08.780" style="s2">towards a specific sort that are more</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.060" end="00:54:11.630" style="s2">second and that our universe is probably</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.780" end="00:54:14.060" style="s2">one of those and so I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.630" end="00:54:15.890" style="s2">necessarily sign on to his theory but I</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.060" end="00:54:17.240" style="s2">would go one step short of that and say</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.890" end="00:54:19.730" style="s2">our universe had some specific</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.240" end="00:54:22.400" style="s2">attributes at the beginning one of which</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.730" end="00:54:25.220" style="s2">was a gigantic energy flux yeah so that</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.400" end="00:54:28.130" style="s2">would be like my process just some to</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.220" end="00:54:31.040" style="s2">start with something yeah right and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.130" end="00:54:33.380" style="s2">I then I look at Brigantine right and</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.040" end="00:54:36.170" style="s2">his cool of complexity which is by the</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.380" end="00:54:38.210" style="s2">way not the Santa Fe Institute one when</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.170" end="00:54:41.540" style="s2">I bring up per ego gene at SFI people</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.210" end="00:54:43.430" style="s2">always you know bad right I go yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.540" end="00:54:45.550" style="s2">I disagree I say Ferengi gene has some</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.430" end="00:54:49.190" style="s2">very interesting things to say</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.550" end="00:54:51.650" style="s2">fundamentally is that interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.190" end="00:54:54.140" style="s2">only happen in the case the you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.650" end="00:54:56.990" style="s2">your word asymmetric or in his case and</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.140" end="00:54:58.910" style="s2">for me energy flows yeah right any</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.990" end="00:55:00.320" style="s2">system at equilibrium nothing</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.910" end="00:55:03.320" style="s2">interesting is going to happen right</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.320" end="00:55:05.900" style="s2">it&#39;s just flat right and when there&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:55:23.060" end="00:55:28.880" style="s2">of machinery to use up the energy flux</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.070" end="00:55:31.870" style="s2">from the Sun and so where he was where</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.880" end="00:55:36.400" style="s2">you would say self differentiating</p>

<p begin="00:55:49.519" end="00:55:54.319" style="s2">evolution occurred but and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.699" end="00:55:57.829" style="s2">I would get back to my conference with</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.319" end="00:56:00.140" style="s2">Coffman only up to a certain level and</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.829" end="00:56:02.359" style="s2">we talked about differentiation the</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.140" end="00:56:04.099" style="s2">interstellar dust and gases for instant</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.359" end="00:56:05.929" style="s2">are quite differentiated right we can we</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.099" end="00:56:08.149" style="s2">can find all kinds of interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.929" end="00:56:11.329" style="s2">complicated chemistry that has occurred</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.149" end="00:56:13.789" style="s2">in the interstellar gas driven by energy</p>

<p begin="00:56:13.789" end="00:56:20.449" style="s2">interacting with probably just hydrogen</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.369" end="00:56:24.199" style="s2">initially but also now spiced up with</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.449" end="00:56:26.269" style="s2">the results of supernovae and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.199" end="00:56:28.819" style="s2">been an evolution of sorts chemical</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.269" end="00:56:30.229" style="s2">evolution but at a very slow rate and it</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.819" end="00:56:34.249" style="s2">just produces kind of somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.229" end="00:56:37.640" style="s2">interesting dust as far as we know then</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.249" end="00:56:40.309" style="s2">we get to can think of all this another</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.640" end="00:56:42.979" style="s2">conversation I had on my show with David</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.309" end="00:56:45.559" style="s2">Krakauer who defines his field of study</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.979" end="00:56:48.679" style="s2">as the history of information processing</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.559" end="00:56:51.159" style="s2">in the universe you know we got up to a</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.679" end="00:56:54.889" style="s2">point where there&#39;s some freakish Indian</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.159" end="00:56:57.229" style="s2">evolution up to a point but then it kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.889" end="00:57:02.599" style="s2">of stopped and the universe was a</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.229" end="00:57:04.639" style="s2">physical thing until like a life were</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.599" end="00:57:06.349" style="s2">analog the lights I mean there may be</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.639" end="00:57:07.849" style="s2">lots of life and they were things that</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.349" end="00:57:09.499" style="s2">are analogous to life in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.849" end="00:57:10.939" style="s2">that we have no comprehension of but</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.499" end="00:57:15.409" style="s2">let&#39;s just use the one thing we do know</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.939" end="00:57:18.619" style="s2">about that life fundamentally moved the</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.409" end="00:57:22.099" style="s2">ability of evolution to do to explore</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.619" end="00:57:24.739" style="s2">new space to a radically new level you</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.099" end="00:57:26.509" style="s2">know good old earth without any life had</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.739" end="00:57:29.619" style="s2">it has some dynamic you know has some</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.509" end="00:57:32.659" style="s2">complexity dynamic plate tectonic etc</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.619" end="00:57:36.380" style="s2">but they&#39;re not going to produce a 777</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.659" end="00:57:38.479" style="s2">or a solar cell or or write a</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.380" end="00:57:41.269" style="s2">Shakespearean play or anything out or</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.479" end="00:57:43.549" style="s2">fall in love or anything else somehow</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.269" end="00:57:45.829" style="s2">getting back to this magical</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.549" end="00:57:48.380" style="s2">transcending of the era catastrophe a</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.829" end="00:57:50.839" style="s2">bright line appeared at some point and</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.380" end="00:57:54.199" style="s2">an evolutionary system that had much</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.839" end="00:57:57.619" style="s2">greater information processing occurred</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.199" end="00:57:59.359" style="s2">and life moved forward from that point</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.619" end="00:58:02.940" style="s2">relatively rapidly to where we are today</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.359" end="00:58:05.720" style="s2">and I like to throw down another</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.940" end="00:58:08.310" style="s2">line that occurred sometime in the last</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.720" end="00:58:10.170" style="s2">a couple hundred thousand years maybe</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.310" end="00:58:13.920" style="s2">the last ten thousand years and that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.170" end="00:58:15.780" style="s2">language which is another new even way</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.920" end="00:58:17.400" style="s2">more powerful means of information</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.780" end="00:58:20.010" style="s2">processing than life itself</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.400" end="00:58:23.880" style="s2">which has opened up a radically new</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.010" end="00:58:29.060" style="s2">domain for evolution of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.880" end="00:58:31.680" style="s2">phenomena in the universe are those two</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.060" end="00:58:34.050" style="s2">ways of thinking about but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.680" end="00:58:36.810" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know I like the story it</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.050" end="00:58:38.940" style="s2">makes sense but I think the story cuts</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.810" end="00:58:43.790" style="s2">the scenes the scenes are cut too</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.940" end="00:58:46.319" style="s2">strongly because life is a cosmological</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.790" end="00:58:48.119" style="s2">process it&#39;s not like the cosmological</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.319" end="00:58:50.310" style="s2">process is happening in the background</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.119" end="00:58:51.750" style="s2">now over here our scene to something</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.310" end="00:58:56.220" style="s2">more interesting is happening</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.750" end="00:58:58.800" style="s2">you can&#39;t just it is it is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.220" end="00:59:03.660" style="s2">duration of the cosmological process</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.800" end="00:59:07.230" style="s2">itself things evolve as a whole so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.660" end="00:59:10.470" style="s2">think that saying that well this was</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.230" end="00:59:12.510" style="s2">true and and in the physiological the</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.470" end="00:59:14.339" style="s2">cosmological physical universe that</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.510" end="00:59:19.530" style="s2">wasn&#39;t that interesting until life game</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.339" end="00:59:22.079" style="s2">these processes are subtended in life</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.530" end="00:59:24.720" style="s2">itself it&#39;s not like that scene you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.079" end="00:59:26.849" style="s2">the way the story was you told it pretty</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.720" end="00:59:29.000" style="s2">quickly but those scenes are cut too</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.849" end="00:59:31.920" style="s2">quickly and it&#39;s the same with language</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.000" end="00:59:36.510" style="s2">language evolves not on top of life</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.920" end="00:59:38.460" style="s2">language is the enduring evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.510" end="00:59:41.579" style="s2">life in the same way that life is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.460" end="00:59:45.359" style="s2">enduring evolution of the cosmic Osmos</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.579" end="00:59:46.920" style="s2">those cuts are to I think tooth they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.359" end="00:59:50.300" style="s2">too severe and I think they&#39;re useful</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.920" end="00:59:52.410" style="s2">they&#39;re useful at a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.300" end="00:59:55.500" style="s2">analysis maybe that&#39;s a coarse graining</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.410" end="00:59:57.690" style="s2">problem but I think when we are asking</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.500" end="00:59:59.780" style="s2">some of these larger existential</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.690" end="01:00:04.410" style="s2">questions those cuts are very unhelpful</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.780" end="01:00:05.849" style="s2">let me address that specifically like to</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.410" end="01:00:08.880" style="s2">my mind when I look at the history of</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.849" end="01:00:11.609" style="s2">the universe of the universe prior to</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.880" end="01:00:13.589" style="s2">life and afterlife look very different</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.609" end="01:00:16.020" style="s2">in the you know the level of complexity</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.589" end="01:00:16.800" style="s2">which could evolve and we could look at</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.020" end="01:00:20.690" style="s2">some smaller</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.800" end="01:00:23.640" style="s2">lines like the specific multicellular</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.690" end="01:00:26.520" style="s2">technology that was developed around the</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.640" end="01:00:30.060" style="s2">Cambrian explosion that&#39;s a specific</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.520" end="01:00:34.070" style="s2">technology that evolved and once it</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.060" end="01:00:37.970" style="s2">reached a critical mass essentially all</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.070" end="01:00:40.710" style="s2">vertebrate life came out of that one</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.970" end="01:00:42.960" style="s2">particular innovation so I suppose what</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.710" end="01:00:44.880" style="s2">I&#39;m what I see is that the history of</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.960" end="01:00:48.330" style="s2">the universe is contingent and based on</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.880" end="01:00:50.130" style="s2">some specific inventions along the way</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.330" end="01:00:50.490" style="s2">and that on both sides of why it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.130" end="01:00:52.770" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.490" end="01:00:54.770" style="s2">before that Cambrian innovation life</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.770" end="01:00:56.760" style="s2">looked very different than it did after</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.770" end="01:00:59.070" style="s2">the universe looked very different</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.760" end="01:01:03.660" style="s2">before life and after and I would say</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.070" end="01:01:07.680" style="s2">that modern cognition which I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.660" end="01:01:11.460" style="s2">say is coincident with language looks</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.680" end="01:01:14.550" style="s2">very different than even homo sapiens or</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.460" end="01:01:18.810" style="s2">it&#39;s not Homo sapiens our earliest ants</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.550" end="01:01:21.030" style="s2">are close relatives and humans you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.810" end="01:01:24.690" style="s2">at chimpanzee is not going to design a</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.030" end="01:01:26.460" style="s2">Boeing 777 right a chimpanzee is not</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.690" end="01:01:28.500" style="s2">going to write a Shakespearean sonnet</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.460" end="01:01:30.990" style="s2">it&#39;s just completely qualitatively</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.500" end="01:01:34.760" style="s2">different and I think that it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.990" end="01:01:36.480" style="s2">very useful to look at the qualitative</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.760" end="01:01:39.450" style="s2">transitions in the history of</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.480" end="01:01:43.080" style="s2">information processing and that they</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.450" end="01:01:46.440" style="s2">tell us huge amounts about what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.080" end="01:01:48.180" style="s2">on and maybe even you know what we</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.440" end="01:01:53.280" style="s2">should be thinking about as our purpose</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.180" end="01:01:55.110" style="s2">as yeah so so it just I&#39;m gonna argue</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.280" end="01:01:59.300" style="s2">with you here this is cool</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.110" end="01:02:02.430" style="s2">so yes the universe has language now</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.300" end="01:02:06.920" style="s2">people don&#39;t have language the universe</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.430" end="01:02:09.780" style="s2">has language without all the background</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.920" end="01:02:12.290" style="s2">processes there would be no people</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.780" end="01:02:15.390" style="s2">having language took universes</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.290" end="01:02:18.390" style="s2">coterminous continuous in the languaging</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.390" end="01:02:20.670" style="s2">that people do this is too too hard a</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.390" end="01:02:22.620" style="s2">cut I was sitting once with people that</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.670" end="01:02:24.810" style="s2">you know actually here I won&#39;t name</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.620" end="01:02:26.490" style="s2">names and we were talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.810" end="01:02:29.809" style="s2">singularity and people were kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.490" end="01:02:32.029" style="s2">computing when the</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.809" end="01:02:35.329" style="s2">processing speed of AI was going to</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.029" end="01:02:35.599" style="s2">outdo the processing speed of the human</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.329" end="01:02:37.609" style="s2">brain</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.599" end="01:02:41.930" style="s2">well actually turns out that&#39;s not very</p>

<p begin="01:02:44.269" end="01:02:52.099" style="s2">it&#39;s not very powerful but what I said</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.930" end="01:02:54.439" style="s2">is so you&#39;re gonna take the 16 to 42</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.099" end="01:02:56.449" style="s2">bits a second that the conscious brain</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.439" end="01:02:58.160" style="s2">can calculate and then you&#39;re going to</p>

<p begin="01:02:58.160" end="01:03:03.769" style="s2">and machine of course it&#39;s it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.079" end="01:03:06.140" style="s2">no comparison but you have to include in</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.769" end="01:03:08.329" style="s2">the human system the information in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.140" end="01:03:10.309" style="s2">ribosomes the information in the DNA the</p>

<p begin="01:03:21.019" end="01:03:24.650" style="s2">there&#39;s no comparison</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.400" end="01:03:28.130" style="s2">you can&#39;t just bracket out this little</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.650" end="01:03:30.739" style="s2">layer of reality and call that the</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.130" end="01:03:34.339" style="s2">evolved human the evolved human is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.739" end="01:03:37.939" style="s2">duration and time so the human being is</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.339" end="01:03:39.799" style="s2">its duration is from the Big Bang to its</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.939" end="01:03:42.650" style="s2">point in history now that&#39;s its</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.799" end="01:03:45.859" style="s2">complexity it&#39;s this whole it&#39;s spread</p>

<p begin="01:03:45.859" end="01:03:50.239" style="s2">and you can&#39;t and so yes the mind wants</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.829" end="01:03:53.059" style="s2">to make a cut this is completely</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.239" end="01:03:55.819" style="s2">different this is act 2 scene 3 now we</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.059" end="01:03:58.489" style="s2">have humans on the stage earlier in act</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.819" end="01:04:01.789" style="s2">1 they weren&#39;t on the stage so this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.489" end="01:04:06.949" style="s2">this is a way our mind works that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.789" end="01:04:10.579" style="s2">would say structurally reify events away</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.949" end="01:04:12.349" style="s2">from the processes that generate them so</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.579" end="01:04:15.679" style="s2">i could say for example what&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.349" end="01:04:19.999" style="s2">complex the cow or the mycorrhizae in</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.679" end="01:04:20.839" style="s2">the soil that the cow depends upon I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.999" end="01:04:24.859" style="s2">be careful</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.839" end="01:04:28.069" style="s2">what&#39;s more complex that&#39;s hard to say</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.859" end="01:04:31.009" style="s2">you&#39;d have to do the calculations well</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.069" end="01:04:32.569" style="s2">but but so that&#39;s kind of kind of what</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.009" end="01:04:34.279" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is the language that</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.569" end="01:04:36.829" style="s2">people speak more complex than the</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.279" end="01:04:38.569" style="s2">generative pole that produced people in</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.829" end="01:04:40.369" style="s2">language in the first place so in</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.569" end="01:04:42.589" style="s2">process philosophy with two definitions</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.369" end="01:04:43.650" style="s2">of complexity we have realized</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.589" end="01:04:46.200" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.650" end="01:04:48.990" style="s2">like the cow and then we have generative</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.200" end="01:04:52.260" style="s2">complexity so the cows could die and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.990" end="01:04:54.990" style="s2">mycorrhizae would still create grass and</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.260" end="01:04:57.600" style="s2">then potentially a new animal grazing</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.990" end="01:04:59.700" style="s2">animal would evolve but if all the grass</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.600" end="01:05:02.690" style="s2">and mycorrhizae died everything would</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.700" end="01:05:07.710" style="s2">die so now what we have to do is switch</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.690" end="01:05:09.390" style="s2">from from simple categories to process</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.710" end="01:05:13.310" style="s2">categories there&#39;s different types of</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.390" end="01:05:15.660" style="s2">complexity there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.310" end="01:05:17.280" style="s2">realized actual the complexity of</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.660" end="01:05:19.920" style="s2">language and then there&#39;s a generative</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.280" end="01:05:22.340" style="s2">complexity all of which is required not</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.920" end="01:05:27.390" style="s2">only to originate that but to uphold it</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.340" end="01:05:32.970" style="s2">if if the cosmos died if if every</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.390" end="01:05:37.500" style="s2">element I don&#39;t know what if every if</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.970" end="01:05:39.780" style="s2">every quantum fluctuation stopped there</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.500" end="01:05:42.120" style="s2">would be no language it&#39;s cool to Google</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.780" end="01:05:44.640" style="s2">the evolutionary tree now they have this</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.120" end="01:05:46.410" style="s2">big wave of a tree and then humans are</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.640" end="01:05:50.070" style="s2">at the end it has extinction events and</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.410" end="01:05:51.960" style="s2">then it says in the side it says this is</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.070" end="01:05:55.230" style="s2">the evolutionary tree from the vantage</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.960" end="01:05:56.880" style="s2">point of humans who are at the end but</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.230" end="01:05:58.950" style="s2">if you look at it from the vantage point</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.880" end="01:06:01.320" style="s2">of the bacteria</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.950" end="01:06:02.940" style="s2">they&#39;ve been evolving just as long and</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.320" end="01:06:06.330" style="s2">humans are here over here just this</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.940" end="01:06:09.090" style="s2">little side thing so we tend to think as</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.330" end="01:06:11.370" style="s2">humans have evolved on top of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.090" end="01:06:13.380" style="s2">bacteria but everything living today</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.370" end="01:06:15.720" style="s2">it&#39;s evolved the same amount of time</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.380" end="01:06:18.210" style="s2">right absolutely a point I make all the</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.720" end="01:06:20.040" style="s2">time right that a dog is just as evolved</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.210" end="01:06:22.080" style="s2">as a human right there exactly they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.040" end="01:06:24.330" style="s2">all and to your point archaea or</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.080" end="01:06:26.520" style="s2">bacteria has all evolved for an equal</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.330" end="01:06:29.610" style="s2">period of time however this is where I</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.520" end="01:06:31.680" style="s2">think we can use a cleaver to make the</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.610" end="01:06:35.880" style="s2">cut remember we talked earlier about</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.680" end="01:06:38.820" style="s2">action right and what are the actions</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.880" end="01:06:40.890" style="s2">that these entities can do you know my</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.820" end="01:06:42.750" style="s2">Corazon my coryza</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.890" end="01:06:45.090" style="s2">are not going to make milk but a cow</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.750" end="01:06:48.330" style="s2">can&#39;t right and so they have different</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.090" end="01:06:50.430" style="s2">actions and humans have with once they</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.330" end="01:06:52.620" style="s2">transition to language and then science</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.430" end="01:06:55.860" style="s2">and technology have opened up an</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.620" end="01:06:57.240" style="s2">unbelievable action potential which were</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.860" end="01:06:57.570" style="s2">capable of which we have no idea what</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.240" end="01:06:59.550" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.570" end="01:07:01.500" style="s2">sorry yet now of course some of those</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.550" end="01:07:04.110" style="s2">actions are very dangerous and we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.500" end="01:07:07.200" style="s2">a road that if we&#39;re not careful you</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.110" end="01:07:09.030" style="s2">know we may very substantially damaged</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.200" end="01:07:11.640" style="s2">the earth and the ecosystems to a degree</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.030" end="01:07:13.320" style="s2">that we could likely unless we change</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.640" end="01:07:15.480" style="s2">our ways that this is going to happen</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.320" end="01:07:18.600" style="s2">but on the other hand we have the action</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.480" end="01:07:23.220" style="s2">a capability to get ourselves past that</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.600" end="01:07:24.960" style="s2">problem I hope and take us to very very</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.220" end="01:07:27.900" style="s2">very far ways that we can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.960" end="01:07:29.820" style="s2">envision at this point and so the action</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.900" end="01:07:32.490" style="s2">capability on the other side of this</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.820" end="01:07:34.500" style="s2">quite bright line of language is</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.490" end="01:07:37.140" style="s2">qualitatively different from the cow</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.500" end="01:07:37.770" style="s2">which is qualitatively different from my</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.140" end="01:07:40.950" style="s2">coryza</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.770" end="01:07:42.420" style="s2">and so that&#39;s where I think and what you</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.950" end="01:07:45.150" style="s2">say is true yes</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.420" end="01:07:48.320" style="s2">we&#39;re dependent on everything yes if</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.150" end="01:07:51.720" style="s2">suddenly all the protons decided to</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.320" end="01:07:53.940" style="s2">break down yeah you know game over right</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.720" end="01:07:55.200" style="s2">and I can&#39;t tell you that won&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.940" end="01:07:57.300" style="s2">how the hell should I know</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.200" end="01:07:59.580" style="s2">right how should anybody know but I</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.300" end="01:08:01.410" style="s2">don&#39;t really care from a perspective of</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.580" end="01:08:03.390" style="s2">the lifetime of a human I suspected</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.410" end="01:08:05.790" style="s2">exceedingly unlikely so I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.390" end="01:08:07.680" style="s2">ignore it you know on the other hand our</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.790" end="01:08:09.180" style="s2">micro Raisa better damn well take take</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.680" end="01:08:11.940" style="s2">good care of that one of the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.180" end="01:08:14.100" style="s2">most proud of on our farm is how we have</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.940" end="01:08:16.380" style="s2">massively improved the soil since we</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.100" end="01:08:18.990" style="s2">bought it thirty years ago it was a very</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.380" end="01:08:22.800" style="s2">depleted Mountain farm that had been</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.990" end="01:08:25.470" style="s2">over grazed and over farmed and you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.800" end="01:08:28.410" style="s2">we built up back to soils via organic</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.470" end="01:08:30.060" style="s2">processes for 30 years and not only do</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.410" end="01:08:33.450" style="s2">we have a couple inches more soil than</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.060" end="01:08:35.070" style="s2">we did before but very active biome in</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.450" end="01:08:36.750" style="s2">the soil and oh by the way bird we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.070" end="01:08:40.080" style="s2">producing three and a half times as much</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.750" end="01:08:42.570" style="s2">hay as we used to so you know very aware</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.080" end="01:08:44.700" style="s2">of the stack of dependencies I would say</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.570" end="01:08:47.970" style="s2">the stack of dependencies is very</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.700" end="01:08:51.710" style="s2">different than the affordances that</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.970" end="01:08:56.040" style="s2">these these qualitatively different</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.710" end="01:09:00.120" style="s2">levels provide yeah so I like that stack</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.040" end="01:09:03.150" style="s2">of dependencies and maybe we can we can</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.120" end="01:09:05.370" style="s2">move on to some practical things because</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.150" end="01:09:07.109" style="s2">one of the things that I talk a lot</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.370" end="01:09:08.880" style="s2">about you may disagree with it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.109" end="01:09:10.530" style="s2">useful anyways I think in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.880" end="01:09:11.440" style="s2">organizations and doing things like</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.530" end="01:09:14.859" style="s2">improving the</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.440" end="01:09:18.339" style="s2">soyal and working on a farm is when we</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.859" end="01:09:20.920" style="s2">get into true complexity we realize if</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.339" end="01:09:23.609" style="s2">we have emergent patterns we could say</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.920" end="01:09:26.319" style="s2">the healthy cow is an emergent</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.609" end="01:09:28.779" style="s2">phenomenon from healthy mycorrhizae</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.319" end="01:09:31.779" style="s2">that&#39;s not that&#39;s a bad metaphor but if</p>

<p begin="01:09:59.160" end="01:10:04.030" style="s2">there the most leverage point and I</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.960" end="01:10:06.310" style="s2">think one of the things that we do in</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.030" end="01:10:08.920" style="s2">organisations and we do in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.310" end="01:10:11.500" style="s2">these hyper complex problems we have</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.920" end="01:10:13.930" style="s2">like climate or environment we try to</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.500" end="01:10:16.150" style="s2">handle it or process it at the level</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.930" end="01:10:18.280" style="s2">highest level of complexity which is the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.150" end="01:10:21.160" style="s2">emergent complexity rather than trying</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.280" end="01:10:23.380" style="s2">to find what Daniel shmatte and Berger</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.160" end="01:10:25.780" style="s2">would call the generator functions what</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.380" end="01:10:30.370" style="s2">I call the protocols what are the</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.780" end="01:10:33.280" style="s2">protocols that have which we have most</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.370" end="01:10:34.870" style="s2">leverage and and so this is a little</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.280" end="01:10:36.160" style="s2">different than a question for example</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.870" end="01:10:38.410" style="s2">carbon</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.160" end="01:10:40.989" style="s2">let&#39;s take carbon out of the air is not</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.410" end="01:10:42.969" style="s2">working at the level of protocol that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.989" end="01:10:44.739" style="s2">just working at a level of reactivity</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.969" end="01:10:47.469" style="s2">you know there&#39;s too much carbon in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.739" end="01:10:50.680" style="s2">air working at the level of protocols is</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.469" end="01:10:55.120" style="s2">how can we amplify protocols that are</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.680" end="01:10:58.090" style="s2">self catalytic so that they then create</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.120" end="01:11:00.340" style="s2">these generative stacks of dependencies</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.090" end="01:11:03.969" style="s2">rather than make them more precarious so</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.340" end="01:11:05.380" style="s2">I think this is what farmers who are</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.969" end="01:11:07.210" style="s2">working at the level of a soil</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.380" end="01:11:09.040" style="s2">understand you know there&#39;s this great</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.210" end="01:11:11.370" style="s2">little video a hundred thousand beating</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.040" end="01:11:14.830" style="s2">hearts where this man changed his</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.370" end="01:11:19.929" style="s2">conventional ranch into biodynamic or an</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.830" end="01:11:24.400" style="s2">organic ranch and he found that in doing</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.929" end="01:11:25.510" style="s2">so he actually restored the community he</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.400" end="01:11:28.690" style="s2">had a local</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.510" end="01:11:31.659" style="s2">farmers market and a butchery and stores</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.690" end="01:11:34.570" style="s2">and basically he connected the dots that</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.659" end="01:11:40.420" style="s2">growing the soil grew the community and</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.570" end="01:11:45.369" style="s2">so to me the the field of complexity its</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.420" end="01:11:51.489" style="s2">biggest promise is in trying to get us</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.369" end="01:11:56.500" style="s2">to understand how to improve the staff</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.489" end="01:12:00.010" style="s2">at the level that is most generative and</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.500" end="01:12:03.369" style="s2">most catalytic for all the other other</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.010" end="01:12:05.469" style="s2">levels I think that&#39;s a useful insight</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.369" end="01:12:07.780" style="s2">but I would also put a warning</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.469" end="01:12:10.269" style="s2">the biggest takeaway I would say the</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.780" end="01:12:11.980" style="s2">biggest change in my personal highest</p>

<p begin="01:15:15.099" end="01:15:20.409" style="s2">and and learning something about our</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.530" end="01:15:23.380" style="s2">environment anew and and for me like I</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.409" end="01:15:26.800" style="s2">was you know I did landscape design</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.380" end="01:15:29.920" style="s2">building construction for 30 years and</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.800" end="01:15:31.900" style="s2">we built beautiful gardens for the rich</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.920" end="01:15:34.929" style="s2">and famous you know ones that look like</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.900" end="01:15:40.119" style="s2">Versailles and were both ornamental and</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.929" end="01:15:42.010" style="s2">and food production but there was it was</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.119" end="01:15:44.349" style="s2">so labor intensive like this whole</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.010" end="01:15:46.449" style="s2">approach was so labor intensive and then</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.349" end="01:15:49.550" style="s2">I worked on a biodynamic farm and I</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.449" end="01:15:52.430" style="s2">thought oh my god you&#39;d have to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.550" end="01:15:56.300" style="s2">to work this hard you know the the the</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.430" end="01:16:00.470" style="s2">farm had fairly poor soils had been</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.300" end="01:16:04.160" style="s2">grazed and so so for years just moving</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.470" end="01:16:06.890" style="s2">from one failed experiment let&#39;s say to</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.160" end="01:16:09.380" style="s2">the next and then we purchased this</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.890" end="01:16:11.840" style="s2">property here and I set out some nice</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.380" end="01:16:14.540" style="s2">vegetable gardens and herb gardens and</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.840" end="01:16:16.940" style="s2">we have horses I would notice every year</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.540" end="01:16:20.240" style="s2">I&#39;d go up to the second year poop pile</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.940" end="01:16:22.760" style="s2">and it&#39;d be tomatoes growing as big as</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.240" end="01:16:24.710" style="s2">the trees in there and and without any</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.760" end="01:16:26.780" style="s2">kind of cultivation at all and then I</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.710" end="01:16:29.990" style="s2">started doing experiments and noticing</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.780" end="01:16:33.020" style="s2">how if I planted pumpkins the tomatoes</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.990" end="01:16:35.450" style="s2">would follow the pumpkin vines down the</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.020" end="01:16:37.040" style="s2">poop pile and so finally I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.450" end="01:16:40.190" style="s2">why it took me so long finally I just</p>

<p begin="01:19:19.180" end="01:19:22.210" style="s2">seems to me what is you know just to</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.830" end="01:19:24.250" style="s2">change directions entirely here this</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.210" end="01:19:25.960" style="s2">seems to me what I&#39;m so interested in</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.250" end="01:19:28.660" style="s2">right now is the people who are doing</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.960" end="01:19:32.650" style="s2">serious thinking about what comes next</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.660" end="01:19:34.840" style="s2">what social operating system what does</p>

<p begin="01:19:44.500" end="01:19:50.980" style="s2">we be running that we can evolve boards</p>

<p begin="01:19:50.980" end="01:19:55.260" style="s2">which preserves all the great things</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.780" end="01:19:58.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve created over the last 400 years</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.260" end="01:19:59.770" style="s2">but navigates them to something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.000" end="01:20:02.950" style="s2">truly sustainable for you know at least</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.770" end="01:20:04.690" style="s2">a few millennia and that strikes me as</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.950" end="01:20:06.880" style="s2">the number one challenge of our time</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.690" end="01:20:10.990" style="s2">yeah and I agree with you I think I</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.880" end="01:20:14.020" style="s2">often comment on the expectation</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.990" end="01:20:17.230" style="s2">anticipation of world population peaking</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.020" end="01:20:19.450" style="s2">I often like to think</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.230" end="01:20:21.040" style="s2">what affordances what spaces and</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.450" end="01:20:24.640" style="s2">potentials will be open when it actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.040" end="01:20:27.040" style="s2">declines if it has a generative decline</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.640" end="01:20:31.239" style="s2">a complete crash obviously could be</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.040" end="01:20:34.989" style="s2">problematic I think that also because we</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.239" end="01:20:37.930" style="s2">are complex life and life operates at</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.989" end="01:20:40.060" style="s2">the edge of chaos you know far from</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.930" end="01:20:44.400" style="s2">equilibrium I believe that that</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.060" end="01:20:47.290" style="s2">projection is right where it must be at</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.400" end="01:20:49.660" style="s2">maximum you know whether it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.290" end="01:20:53.320" style="s2">overshoot just slightly overshoot or not</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.660" end="01:20:55.750" style="s2">it seems like as a lot of human a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.320" end="01:20:58.630" style="s2">living systems the trajectory toward</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.750" end="01:21:01.440" style="s2">that peak and the instability that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.630" end="01:21:05.770" style="s2">going to be encountered up to that peak</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.440" end="01:21:09.280" style="s2">or right there at this very thin thread</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.770" end="01:21:12.580" style="s2">at the edge of chaos you know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.280" end="01:21:15.720" style="s2">story it&#39;s a mythology but I think that</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.580" end="01:21:20.080" style="s2">it actually gives me hope this projected</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.720" end="01:21:22.900" style="s2">release of population exponential growth</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.080" end="01:21:26.980" style="s2">in population of course there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.900" end="01:21:30.160" style="s2">local turbulence that happens because of</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.980" end="01:21:32.650" style="s2">a lot of migration a lot of implications</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.160" end="01:21:36.250" style="s2">for economies and stuff but is a as a</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.650" end="01:21:40.060" style="s2">broad story I really find optimism in</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.250" end="01:21:42.850" style="s2">that and yeah and so what is possible</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.060" end="01:21:46.200" style="s2">what is possible should we be designing</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.850" end="01:21:50.410" style="s2">today for that anticipated future</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.200" end="01:21:53.070" style="s2">designing not only to survive this</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.410" end="01:21:55.860" style="s2">transition phase to survive this</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.070" end="01:21:59.460" style="s2">exponential complexity all these</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.860" end="01:22:04.690" style="s2">increasing pressures on the system but</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.460" end="01:22:07.780" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s the world we design for we</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.690" end="01:22:10.510" style="s2">begin trying experimental design for</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.780" end="01:22:12.220" style="s2">today this after the after the peak</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.510" end="01:22:14.590" style="s2">population yeah I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.220" end="01:22:16.210" style="s2">youthful thought and the course we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.590" end="01:22:17.620" style="s2">running the experiment right now I mean</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.210" end="01:22:20.800" style="s2">there are already countries with the</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.620" end="01:22:22.510" style="s2">climbing populate you know Germany I</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.800" end="01:22:26.080" style="s2">think some of the Eastern European</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.510" end="01:22:28.290" style="s2">countries Romania Bulgaria I think the</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.080" end="01:22:30.820" style="s2">Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.290" end="01:22:33.909" style="s2">are declining Japan</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.820" end="01:22:35.889" style="s2">just transitioning to decline and will</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.909" end="01:22:39.250" style="s2">go very rapidly in the client as well</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.889" end="01:22:41.590" style="s2">Korea and then China not far behind that</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.250" end="01:22:44.500" style="s2">so we&#39;ll actually have some real time</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.590" end="01:22:47.590" style="s2">experiments on what stresses do</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.500" end="01:22:49.659" style="s2">declining and then of course fortunately</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.590" end="01:22:51.940" style="s2">or unfortunately the very big change in</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.659" end="01:22:54.040" style="s2">the age pyramid</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.940" end="01:22:56.679" style="s2">doot-doot to it to societies we start</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.040" end="01:22:59.409" style="s2">running those experiments right now and</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.679" end="01:23:01.599" style="s2">it is potentially hopeful that on the</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.409" end="01:23:03.190" style="s2">other side we have more room when such</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.599" end="01:23:04.270" style="s2">that we could if over a period of a</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.190" end="01:23:06.159" style="s2">couple hundred years build our</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.270" end="01:23:07.840" style="s2">population down to two billion or</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.159" end="01:23:11.530" style="s2">something at two billion we could</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.840" end="01:23:14.170" style="s2">actually run a Western quality of life</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.530" end="01:23:16.750" style="s2">with fully organic farming probably</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.170" end="01:23:20.560" style="s2">right and we could certainly run a</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.750" end="01:23:23.079" style="s2">carbon-free energy system etc probably</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.560" end="01:23:25.360" style="s2">can&#39;t do those things at ten billion and</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.079" end="01:23:28.300" style="s2">so it&#39;s hopeful to to know that there is</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.360" end="01:23:30.280" style="s2">another side and on the other hand we</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.300" end="01:23:32.949" style="s2">may not have that&#39;s the back side but</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.280" end="01:23:35.770" style="s2">perhaps more immediately important is</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.949" end="01:23:38.889" style="s2">how do we navigate over the next hundred</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.770" end="01:23:41.469" style="s2">years to that peak without crashing yes</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.889" end="01:23:43.480" style="s2">at them or at least that or at least</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.469" end="01:23:45.670" style="s2">that the craft would be relatively small</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.480" end="01:23:49.889" style="s2">we talked about this on the podcast or I</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.670" end="01:23:53.159" style="s2">was the guest recently that fortunately</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.889" end="01:23:55.780" style="s2">collapsed scenarios seem to follow a</p>

<p begin="01:23:57.460" end="01:24:01.449" style="s2">that there&#39;s gonna be more collapses</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.960" end="01:24:03.310" style="s2">than you know Gaussian thinking would</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.449" end="01:24:04.989" style="s2">lead us to believe but on the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.310" end="01:24:08.590" style="s2">there will be more smaller collapses</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.989" end="01:24:10.000" style="s2">than big collapses and so yeah maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.590" end="01:24:11.560" style="s2">have a co-op for ten percent of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.000" end="01:24:14.530" style="s2">world&#39;s population dies and that</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.560" end="01:24:17.980" style="s2">provides a breathing base for the system</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.530" end="01:24:19.929" style="s2">to then start to recover and and and the</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.980" end="01:24:22.270" style="s2">collapses aren&#39;t always bad in their</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.929" end="01:24:24.730" style="s2">outcomes you know the famous one was the</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.270" end="01:24:26.530" style="s2">Black Death killed a third to forty</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.730" end="01:24:28.690" style="s2">percent the population of Western Europe</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.530" end="01:24:32.110" style="s2">and many historians point to that</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.690" end="01:24:33.820" style="s2">opening up as the end of as what brought</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.110" end="01:24:36.300" style="s2">the end of feudalism the beginning of</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.820" end="01:24:38.980" style="s2">freedom and the beginning of the modern</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.300" end="01:24:43.510" style="s2">yeah none of them are bad if it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.980" end="01:24:44.560" style="s2">happen to you but I think like putting</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.510" end="01:24:47.410" style="s2">together what you said</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.560" end="01:24:50.290" style="s2">for all this is why we have so much</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.410" end="01:24:52.570" style="s2">pressure on boundaries and immigration</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.290" end="01:24:54.730" style="s2">now because there are countries that are</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.570" end="01:24:56.770" style="s2">being able to experiment with declining</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.730" end="01:24:59.830" style="s2">populations but the world as a whole</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.770" end="01:25:04.690" style="s2">there&#39;s osmotic pressure for populations</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.830" end="01:25:09.270" style="s2">to migrate to to lower population</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.690" end="01:25:12.850" style="s2">densities and so those experiments are</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.270" end="01:25:15.610" style="s2">complicated by the movement of the whole</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.850" end="01:25:18.010" style="s2">and and I think that that&#39;s a big code</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.610" end="01:25:21.760" style="s2">to crack how are we going to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.010" end="01:25:24.600" style="s2">that are we going to try to stratify</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.760" end="01:25:27.730" style="s2">those movements are we going to try to</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.600" end="01:25:29.920" style="s2">ameliorate them on a global scale I mean</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.730" end="01:25:32.920" style="s2">what&#39;s your opinion about that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.920" end="01:25:34.300" style="s2">very interesting and a major problem</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.920" end="01:25:36.700" style="s2">that we have just started to see the</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.300" end="01:25:40.690" style="s2">very beginnings of now I mean most of</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.700" end="01:25:42.820" style="s2">the migration today is not caused by at</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.690" end="01:25:45.400" style="s2">least not directly caused by reaching</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.820" end="01:25:47.800" style="s2">the limits of the ecosystem most of them</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.400" end="01:25:49.540" style="s2">are caused by war right or civil war</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.800" end="01:25:51.790" style="s2">internal conflict Syria being the</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.540" end="01:25:53.920" style="s2">biggest example but the Congo being</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.790" end="01:25:56.520" style="s2">another gigantic example South Sudan</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.920" end="01:25:59.890" style="s2">being another one those are not yet</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.520" end="01:26:01.930" style="s2">climate or Malthusian driven immigration</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.890" end="01:26:06.850" style="s2">migrations those are side effect</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.930" end="01:26:09.040" style="s2">conflict but by 2050 point six we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.850" end="01:26:11.080" style="s2">gonna start to see assuming we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.040" end="01:26:14.620" style="s2">change our ways as much as we should or</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.080" end="01:26:19.780" style="s2">need to you know massive migrations from</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.620" end="01:26:23.230" style="s2">places like Bangladesh and where climate</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.780" end="01:26:25.840" style="s2">change rising sea levels perhaps major</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.230" end="01:26:29.670" style="s2">famines in parts of the world including</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.840" end="01:26:32.020" style="s2">possibly China driven by climate change</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.670" end="01:26:34.180" style="s2">that will be on a scale that makes these</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.020" end="01:26:37.540" style="s2">current things look like you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.180" end="01:26:39.490" style="s2">child&#39;s play and you know the decisions</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.540" end="01:26:41.160" style="s2">that that societies take are going to be</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.490" end="01:26:43.510" style="s2">very important you know on one side</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.160" end="01:26:46.240" style="s2">humanitarianism says you know maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.510" end="01:26:47.980" style="s2">should take in these folks on the other</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.240" end="01:26:50.860" style="s2">side as we&#39;re learning more about what</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.980" end="01:26:53.350" style="s2">makes society work there&#39;s a real danger</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.860" end="01:26:55.720" style="s2">of producing decoherence in a society</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.350" end="01:26:57.640" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing it in Western Europe quite</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.720" end="01:26:59.290" style="s2">substantially today</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.640" end="01:27:01.410" style="s2">and you know through a lesser but still</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.290" end="01:27:04.480" style="s2">substantial degree in the US where</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.410" end="01:27:06.760" style="s2">neo-fascist tendencies are arising in</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.480" end="01:27:10.210" style="s2">reaction to the perceived decoherence of</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.760" end="01:27:13.480" style="s2">society and that&#39;s something to take</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.210" end="01:27:16.270" style="s2">seriously I believe so it&#39;s it&#39;s a damn</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.480" end="01:27:17.830" style="s2">difficult problem and I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.270" end="01:27:19.810" style="s2">the aunt the right answer is but</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.830" end="01:27:22.570" style="s2">fortunately we have a few years until it</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.810" end="01:27:26.920" style="s2">becomes really significant we have this</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.570" end="01:27:29.470" style="s2">preview driven by conflict to sharpen</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.920" end="01:27:31.690" style="s2">our practices around yeah and as you say</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.470" end="01:27:33.640" style="s2">even if the numbers aren&#39;t great the the</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.690" end="01:27:36.370" style="s2">perception or the way people are</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.640" end="01:27:41.740" style="s2">experiencing just this this amount of</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.370" end="01:27:43.360" style="s2">migration is really quite exaggerated or</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.740" end="01:27:45.700" style="s2">quite severe I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.360" end="01:27:47.860" style="s2">exaggerated or whether it&#39;s not I mean</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.700" end="01:27:52.300" style="s2">depends what value you put on social</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.860" end="01:27:56.050" style="s2">here it and I think there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.300" end="01:27:57.700" style="s2">current thinking going on amongst</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.050" end="01:28:00.310" style="s2">independent thinkers that social</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.700" end="01:28:02.800" style="s2">coherence is more important than perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.310" end="01:28:06.580" style="s2">we&#39;ve been giving credit for the last 30</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.800" end="01:28:10.090" style="s2">or 40 years and that it may argue for</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.580" end="01:28:12.130" style="s2">smaller policies of higher coherence and</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.090" end="01:28:15.250" style="s2">that Benton has to be overlaid on the</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.130" end="01:28:18.040" style="s2">problem of environmental migration</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.250" end="01:28:21.340" style="s2">that&#39;ll be facing us 30 or 40 years from</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.040" end="01:28:23.320" style="s2">now because we have a big polity trying</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.340" end="01:28:26.350" style="s2">to have coherence is difficult you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.320" end="01:28:28.230" style="s2">I posted a video from mark live and he</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.350" end="01:28:31.240" style="s2">sees that with some of the political</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.230" end="01:28:34.510" style="s2">changes that are happening recently that</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.240" end="01:28:36.550" style="s2">there is a hope that different nation</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.510" end="01:28:40.180" style="s2">states will run different experiments so</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.550" end="01:28:42.550" style="s2">that China has its own approach to some</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.180" end="01:28:44.740" style="s2">of these looming crises that the US will</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.550" end="01:28:46.810" style="s2">run its own experiment that that Europe</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.740" end="01:28:49.270" style="s2">will run different types of experiments</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.810" end="01:28:52.690" style="s2">and he sees this is very hopeful instead</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.270" end="01:28:55.270" style="s2">of the whole globe running one type of</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.690" end="01:28:58.150" style="s2">experiment to address these potential</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.270" end="01:29:00.520" style="s2">crises or these looming threats and and</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.150" end="01:29:02.680" style="s2">I was very encouraged by that</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.520" end="01:29:04.660" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s great and then I regularly</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.680" end="01:29:06.910" style="s2">be cowed against the idea of a world</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.660" end="01:29:08.140" style="s2">government for just that reason I say</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.910" end="01:29:09.850" style="s2">I&#39;d be willing to consider a world</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.140" end="01:29:11.260" style="s2">government when we have five worlds</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.850" end="01:29:13.630" style="s2">right because we have</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.260" end="01:29:14.980" style="s2">to have diversity and we have to have</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.630" end="01:29:17.710" style="s2">the ability to compare different</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.980" end="01:29:19.450" style="s2">approaches what we don&#39;t need is a world</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.710" end="01:29:21.220" style="s2">government but what we do need is world</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.450" end="01:29:23.140" style="s2">governance which is kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.220" end="01:29:25.780" style="s2">right we need to manage the world as a</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.140" end="01:29:28.540" style="s2">commons amongst a series of independent</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.780" end="01:29:31.450" style="s2">entities whether they&#39;re nation-states</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.540" end="01:29:33.280" style="s2">or smaller level and and people get</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.450" end="01:29:36.100" style="s2">those two things confused way too often</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.280" end="01:29:38.860" style="s2">people who see the need for governance</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.100" end="01:29:41.410" style="s2">make the move to one world government</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.860" end="01:29:43.390" style="s2">which to my mind is a likely</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.410" end="01:29:45.070" style="s2">prescription for disaster for exactly</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.390" end="01:29:47.920" style="s2">the reasons you just laid out which is</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.070" end="01:29:49.690" style="s2">it produces a very large possibility of</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.920" end="01:29:51.940" style="s2">making one bad decision rather than</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.690" end="01:29:54.730" style="s2">experimenting with multiple multiple</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.940" end="01:29:56.890" style="s2">ways that to solve these problems and</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.730" end="01:30:00.100" style="s2">presumably the better ones then are</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.890" end="01:30:01.630" style="s2">adopted by people as they&#39;re yeah makes</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.100" end="01:30:03.970" style="s2">me think of one of these design</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.630" end="01:30:07.080" style="s2">principles that comes from designing for</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.970" end="01:30:10.690" style="s2">emergence this notion of maximal</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.080" end="01:30:14.290" style="s2">decomposability so for example the human</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.690" end="01:30:17.980" style="s2">body cannot be decomposed back to its</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.290" end="01:30:19.989" style="s2">cells and then have it recompose itself</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.980" end="01:30:22.989" style="s2">and so that but there are certain</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.989" end="01:30:25.630" style="s2">generative ecosystems can be decomposed</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.989" end="01:30:27.730" style="s2">into many many different types of</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.630" end="01:30:31.030" style="s2">environment and still regenerate</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.730" end="01:30:35.739" style="s2">themselves so for example my pond is a</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.030" end="01:30:37.270" style="s2">beaver pond and slowly it silts up and</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.739" end="01:30:39.250" style="s2">will become a meadow and then it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.270" end="01:30:41.380" style="s2">become a forest and then the beavers</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.250" end="01:30:43.770" style="s2">will come back when there&#39;s enough food</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.380" end="01:30:46.360" style="s2">for them and start destroying</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.770" end="01:30:49.690" style="s2">quote-unquote the forest and then it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.360" end="01:30:52.360" style="s2">return into a beaver pond and so it can</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.690" end="01:30:55.690" style="s2">be decomposed that the set of relations</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.360" end="01:30:58.570" style="s2">can be decomposed over and over and it</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.690" end="01:31:00.489" style="s2">can still recompose itself in so this</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.570" end="01:31:03.910" style="s2">notion of distributed autonomous</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.489" end="01:31:06.930" style="s2">organizations or Christopher Alexander&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.910" end="01:31:10.450" style="s2">notion of living centers is a design</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.930" end="01:31:14.790" style="s2">principle based around not only having</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.450" end="01:31:19.180" style="s2">Ecology&#39;s but that having the parts that</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.790" end="01:31:23.050" style="s2">are in this ecology of the whole being</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.180" end="01:31:25.580" style="s2">able to be decomposed back down to their</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.050" end="01:31:29.730" style="s2">own autonomous</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.580" end="01:31:32.699" style="s2">selves rather than having the part be</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.730" end="01:31:36.840" style="s2">related to the whole such that no part</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.699" end="01:31:40.159" style="s2">can recompose itself from its own self</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.840" end="01:31:43.980" style="s2">so this is an interesting question how</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.159" end="01:31:47.159" style="s2">how what is the maximum decomposable</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.980" end="01:31:50.310" style="s2">part of human civilization we know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.159" end="01:31:54.810" style="s2">not an individual right so there&#39;s a low</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.310" end="01:31:59.219" style="s2">limiting constraint there but we can ask</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.810" end="01:32:01.739" style="s2">that for in relationship to a set of</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.219" end="01:32:05.130" style="s2">principles so what is the maximally</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.739" end="01:32:08.179" style="s2">decomposed unit that a human system has</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.130" end="01:32:12.929" style="s2">to be to have this standard of living</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.179" end="01:32:16.440" style="s2">and these freedoms let&#39;s say and build</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.929" end="01:32:19.889" style="s2">around that kind of design so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.440" end="01:32:22.500" style="s2">designing for distributed systems but</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.889" end="01:32:24.780" style="s2">that they need to be wholes unto</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.500" end="01:32:28.409" style="s2">themselves yeah I think that Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.780" end="01:32:30.120" style="s2">airily interesting and important and it</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.409" end="01:32:32.100" style="s2">depends on whether these are open</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.120" end="01:32:34.080" style="s2">systems that trade or whether they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.100" end="01:32:36.480" style="s2">all targeted right</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.080" end="01:32:39.690" style="s2">you know one of the phenomena of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.480" end="01:32:42.090" style="s2">last 3040 years has been the very rapid</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.690" end="01:32:43.320" style="s2">growth of international trade most</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.090" end="01:32:45.060" style="s2">people don&#39;t know this but actually</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.320" end="01:32:47.730" style="s2">international trade hit a very high</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.060" end="01:32:49.949" style="s2">point before World War one 25 or 30</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.730" end="01:32:52.469" style="s2">percent of the world&#39;s GDP was in</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.949" end="01:32:54.420" style="s2">international trade it never recovered</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.469" end="01:32:57.510" style="s2">from World War one and it didn&#39;t pass</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.420" end="01:32:59.699" style="s2">the 30% mark again until the 80s now</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.510" end="01:33:02.670" style="s2">it&#39;s quite a bit higher than that so we</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.699" end="01:33:05.429" style="s2">have a world that it&#39;s very deeply</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.670" end="01:33:07.139" style="s2">interconnected in ways that are both</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.429" end="01:33:09.540" style="s2">economically efficient and very</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.139" end="01:33:14.460" style="s2">dangerous from a systems collapse</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.540" end="01:33:18.360" style="s2">perspective and so when you&#39;re asking at</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.460" end="01:33:21.150" style="s2">what they Gail can there be a autonomous</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.360" end="01:33:22.679" style="s2">group of humans if we assume they trade</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.150" end="01:33:24.780" style="s2">with each other there can be quite small</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.679" end="01:33:26.250" style="s2">right if we assume that they&#39;re autarkic</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.780" end="01:33:28.350" style="s2">and they have to create the whole stack</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.250" end="01:33:31.020" style="s2">and manage it themselves that it has to</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.350" end="01:33:32.429" style="s2">be much larger so I would I would turn</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.020" end="01:33:34.620" style="s2">that question around but I would also</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.429" end="01:33:36.510" style="s2">say that my own preference is not to go</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.620" end="01:33:38.520" style="s2">to autarky that is not been shown to</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.510" end="01:33:38.820" style="s2">work that that it ends up with the world</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.520" end="01:33:42.300" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.820" end="01:33:44.130" style="s2">North Korea right which has really smart</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.300" end="01:33:46.650" style="s2">energetic people who have been</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.130" end="01:33:49.050" style="s2">absolutely hobbled by a doctrine about</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.650" end="01:33:51.530" style="s2">our the nice thing about it from a</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.050" end="01:33:54.840" style="s2">coherent perspective if we assume trade</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.530" end="01:33:56.820" style="s2">and interconnectedness to some level it</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.840" end="01:33:59.070" style="s2">allows us to have higher coherence in</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.820" end="01:34:01.320" style="s2">the units you know let&#39;s say that the</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.070" end="01:34:03.150" style="s2">unit size that it let&#39;s say we can get</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.320" end="01:34:06.300" style="s2">the unit size down to a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.150" end="01:34:08.930" style="s2">and as long as we allow trade and flows</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.300" end="01:34:12.050" style="s2">we can I think almost certainly do that</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.930" end="01:34:14.730" style="s2">at a hundred thousand we can probably</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.050" end="01:34:17.330" style="s2">have a standard of pretty damn high</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.730" end="01:34:19.830" style="s2">coherence particularly if we allow</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.330" end="01:34:22.080" style="s2">encourage migration hey you don&#39;t fit in</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.830" end="01:34:24.390" style="s2">this polity because of our agreed-upon</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.080" end="01:34:26.790" style="s2">core values gonna move the one that</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.390" end="01:34:29.790" style="s2">we&#39;re you do fit right I think that move</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.790" end="01:34:31.770" style="s2">opens up releases a lot of pressures you</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.790" end="01:34:34.440" style="s2">know if you have a continental class</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.770" end="01:34:37.500" style="s2">Nate a nation-state the tendencies to</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.440" end="01:34:39.870" style="s2">try to coerce those who disagree right</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.500" end="01:34:41.940" style="s2">with the core values if your average</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.870" end="01:34:43.410" style="s2">policy size is a hundred thousand and</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.940" end="01:34:45.000" style="s2">then we could be very much like the</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.410" end="01:34:47.220" style="s2">hunter-gatherers one of the things the</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.000" end="01:34:48.720" style="s2">art anthropologists have found is that</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.220" end="01:34:51.150" style="s2">the hunter-gatherers have a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.720" end="01:34:52.800" style="s2">people leave one band and join another</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.150" end="01:34:55.200" style="s2">because they disagree with the culture</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.800" end="01:34:59.460" style="s2">or they get into a pissing match with</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.200" end="01:35:02.280" style="s2">people and so you know having a smaller</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.460" end="01:35:04.830" style="s2">autonomous unit that say in a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.280" end="01:35:07.290" style="s2">thousand or less size that is viable</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.830" end="01:35:09.270" style="s2">because of trade might well be the right</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.290" end="01:35:10.620" style="s2">way to balance these two but it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.270" end="01:35:12.600" style="s2">know it&#39;s a question that we need to be</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.620" end="01:35:13.920" style="s2">thinking about here as we try to figure</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.600" end="01:35:16.500" style="s2">out what comes next</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.920" end="01:35:19.860" style="s2">yeah so that reminds me of these other</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.500" end="01:35:23.520" style="s2">principles of it&#39;d be interesting if we</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.860" end="01:35:26.010" style="s2">could come up with a design tool kit</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.520" end="01:35:29.540" style="s2">that had this notion of universal access</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.010" end="01:35:32.640" style="s2">so people could move around but each</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.540" end="01:35:34.920" style="s2">autonomous organization would have some</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.640" end="01:35:37.980" style="s2">kind of self-organized criticality so</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.920" end="01:35:42.780" style="s2">that beyond a certain scale or</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.980" end="01:35:46.140" style="s2">dependency it would have small crises</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.780" end="01:35:48.930" style="s2">small collapses and stay robust so that</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.140" end="01:35:52.470" style="s2">but that people could move in between</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.930" end="01:35:56.010" style="s2">these domains a self-organized</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.470" end="01:35:58.140" style="s2">all domains through universal access and</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.010" end="01:36:00.120" style="s2">trade right so through actual movement</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.140" end="01:36:02.720" style="s2">of people and also movement of goods and</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.120" end="01:36:05.510" style="s2">services and financial instruments so</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.720" end="01:36:07.350" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of interesting it made me</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.510" end="01:36:10.200" style="s2">think about that</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.350" end="01:36:11.700" style="s2">in terms of yeah that like that I like</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.200" end="01:36:13.710" style="s2">that cuz again if we have let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.700" end="01:36:17.460" style="s2">United States consisted of how many</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.710" end="01:36:19.920" style="s2">would it be three thousand units of a</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.460" end="01:36:21.660" style="s2">hundred thousand each right if a couple</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.920" end="01:36:24.600" style="s2">of them went bust or I completely failed</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.660" end="01:36:26.610" style="s2">so what right all the rest of them could</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.600" end="01:36:27.540" style="s2">just absorb the refugees from those and</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.610" end="01:36:31.140" style="s2">life goes on</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.540" end="01:36:32.730" style="s2">nobody dies you know a few few hundred</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.140" end="01:36:36.210" style="s2">thousand people have some disruption in</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.730" end="01:36:38.900" style="s2">their life but the system is robust to</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.210" end="01:36:42.120" style="s2">you know a sustained rate of failure</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.900" end="01:36:45.390" style="s2">essentially and and of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.120" end="01:36:47.310" style="s2">also a comparative competition some</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.390" end="01:36:48.930" style="s2">policies will have better operating</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.310" end="01:36:51.540" style="s2">systems than others and the word will</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.930" end="01:36:54.390" style="s2">get out and people will migrate towards</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.540" end="01:36:55.710" style="s2">the better ones and you know assuming we</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.390" end="01:36:58.170" style="s2">concluded something like a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.710" end="01:36:59.580" style="s2">thousand is an optimal size might some</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.170" end="01:37:02.840" style="s2">of my discussions with Daniel shamaton</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.580" end="01:37:06.030" style="s2">burger I&#39;ve strongly suggested that we</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.840" end="01:37:09.990" style="s2">build fission into the operating systems</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.030" end="01:37:13.500" style="s2">right when a when a polity gets too big</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.990" end="01:37:16.350" style="s2">it ought to decide to fission and</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.500" end="01:37:17.880" style="s2">divided into two you know this is</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.350" end="01:37:20.130" style="s2">something we know that hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.880" end="01:37:23.760" style="s2">bands did as they started to exceed the</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.130" end="01:37:27.000" style="s2">Dunbar number they fission in two to two</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.760" end="01:37:29.760" style="s2">policies and I think that&#39;s you know a</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.000" end="01:37:31.770" style="s2">very useful design principle to you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.760" end="01:37:34.650" style="s2">you know keep front and center as we</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.770" end="01:37:36.420" style="s2">think about you know designing this this</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.650" end="01:37:40.140" style="s2">kind of more decentralized autonomous</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.420" end="01:37:44.190" style="s2">world yeah and I think that that&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.140" end="01:37:46.590" style="s2">to have as you said much greater local</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.190" end="01:37:52.110" style="s2">coherence amongst these hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.590" end="01:37:53.720" style="s2">and have a less precarious situation and</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.110" end="01:37:56.460" style="s2">again going back to the hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.720" end="01:37:58.980" style="s2">model because when we know that work for</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.460" end="01:38:01.020" style="s2">you know millions of years if we have</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.980" end="01:38:03.390" style="s2">these polities they&#39;re not going to be</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.020" end="01:38:05.370" style="s2">arbitrarily randomly selected they&#39;re</p>
