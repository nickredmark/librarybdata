<p begin="00:01:20.720" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">that are happening right now uh the</p>

<p begin="00:01:31.600" end="00:01:35.280" style="s2">embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.479" end="00:01:36.799" style="s2">uh revolution now in both of these</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">cultural revolutions</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.799" end="00:01:42.720" style="s2">we see a synergistic convergence between</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.320" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">an emergence of communities of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.720" end="00:01:46.799" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:48.880" style="s2">and scientific studies so the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.799" end="00:01:52.240" style="s2">academic world is converging on</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.880" end="00:01:54.720" style="s2">these topics and that is in</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.240" end="00:01:56.240" style="s2">discussion and in relationship with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:01:57.280" style="s2">cultural emergence of many people</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.240" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">undertaking</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.280" end="00:02:01.520" style="s2">uh these relevant practices so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:02.799" style="s2">take a look at the first one the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.520" end="00:02:04.240" style="s2">mindfulness revolution</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.799" end="00:02:06.079" style="s2">let&#39;s look for that convergence more</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.079" end="00:02:09.679" style="s2">at the cultural level of course what the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:11.360" style="s2">the book the mindfulness revolution was</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.679" end="00:02:13.520" style="s2">pointing to was the fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.360" end="00:02:15.200" style="s2">that we&#39;re seeing the widespread growth</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.520" end="00:02:18.080" style="s2">of people engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.200" end="00:02:20.000" style="s2">individually and collectively in</p>

<p begin="00:02:20.000" end="00:02:26.319" style="s2">now that&#39;s in convergence with</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.599" end="00:02:28.400" style="s2">um increasing psychological cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.319" end="00:02:30.560" style="s2">scientific and neuroscientific study</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.400" end="00:02:31.680" style="s2">of mindfulness and it&#39;s amazing how</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.560" end="00:02:36.080" style="s2">rapid</p>

<p begin="00:02:40.879" end="00:02:44.560" style="s2">but i&#39;m i believe i&#39;m the first person</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:46.160" style="s2">who started teaching academically</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.560" end="00:02:48.160" style="s2">about mindfulness at the university of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.160" end="00:02:51.440" style="s2">toronto uh around</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.160" end="00:02:53.280" style="s2">1997 and when i started teaching that</p>

<p begin="00:02:53.280" end="00:02:56.800" style="s2">quietly</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.640" end="00:02:58.159" style="s2">and you know everybody&#39;s looking at me</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.800" end="00:02:59.840" style="s2">like all of a sudden he&#39;s going to start</p>

<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:06.400" style="s2">um and so um i had to and if</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.159" end="00:03:07.519" style="s2">i wanted to do research on mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.400" end="00:03:08.879" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.519" end="00:03:10.640" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t so much google then but i</p>

<p begin="00:03:17.440" end="00:03:22.000" style="s2">there was nothing</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.720" end="00:03:23.280" style="s2">now you there every psychology</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.000" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">department has</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.280" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">multiple offerings in which mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:29.200" style="s2">is being discussed</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:30.959" style="s2">uh multiple experiments being run if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.200" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">google mindfulness as a topic</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.959" end="00:03:34.319" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get pages and pages and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:37.360" style="s2">pages of academic</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.319" end="00:03:39.519" style="s2">research so there has been an upsurge</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.360" end="00:03:41.360" style="s2">in both the cultural and the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.519" end="00:03:44.319" style="s2">interest in mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.360" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">now that scientific study is also it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.319" end="00:03:47.040" style="s2">not just</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.799" end="00:03:49.200" style="s2">sort of a single kind of study there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.040" end="00:03:50.239" style="s2">multiple domains in which mindfulness is</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.200" end="00:03:52.080" style="s2">being studied</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.239" end="00:03:53.920" style="s2">it&#39;s being studied of course clinically</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.080" end="00:03:55.760" style="s2">uh in terms of its capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.920" end="00:03:58.159" style="s2">therapeutic intervention</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.760" end="00:03:59.599" style="s2">it&#39;s being studied uh cognitively and</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.159" end="00:03:59.920" style="s2">that&#39;s where my own work on mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.599" end="00:04:03.040" style="s2">comes</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.920" end="00:04:05.439" style="s2">in i published on mindfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.040" end="00:04:07.120" style="s2">what was what mindfulness does</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.439" end="00:04:08.640" style="s2">cognitively is it tends to increase</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.120" end="00:04:11.760" style="s2">cognitive flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.640" end="00:04:13.040" style="s2">and afford insight please remember that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.760" end="00:04:14.640" style="s2">because we&#39;re going to come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.040" end="00:04:16.239" style="s2">connection between mindfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.640" end="00:04:17.919" style="s2">insight later</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.239" end="00:04:19.600" style="s2">and of course there&#39;s neuroscientific</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.919" end="00:04:20.799" style="s2">work showing the neurological changes</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.600" end="00:04:23.280" style="s2">that are wrought</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.799" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">uh by mindfulness specifically the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:26.960" style="s2">mindfulness drives</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:27.680" style="s2">brain plasticity and the rewiring of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.960" end="00:04:31.440" style="s2">brain</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.680" end="00:04:33.600" style="s2">so clearly a huge</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.440" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">upsurge in both cultural practice and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.600" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">scientific study</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:40.000" style="s2">of mindfulness i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">something very similar going on with</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.000" end="00:04:44.720" style="s2">respect to embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:47.040" style="s2">now the idea of embodiment of course is</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.720" end="00:04:49.360" style="s2">an ancient idea but</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.040" end="00:04:51.840" style="s2">the way it&#39;s the way i want to use it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:55.199" style="s2">how it has emerged from what is called</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.840" end="00:04:55.680" style="s2">4e cognitive science for e cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.199" end="00:04:57.120" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.680" end="00:04:59.840" style="s2">this is the kind of cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.120" end="00:05:01.199" style="s2">that i i practice at the university of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:02.639" style="s2">toronto and it&#39;s even the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.199" end="00:05:06.160" style="s2">cognitive psychology</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.639" end="00:05:08.160" style="s2">i do and what are the four e&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.160" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">for e cognitive science well these are</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.160" end="00:05:12.080" style="s2">four claims about</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:13.759" style="s2">four central features of cognition the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.080" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">first is that cognition is</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.759" end="00:05:17.039" style="s2">embodied there&#39;s the embodiment and i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:18.560" style="s2">come back to that cognition is</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.039" end="00:05:21.440" style="s2">inherently embodied</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:22.400" style="s2">the second that it&#39;s inactive en active</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.440" end="00:05:24.560" style="s2">inactive</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.400" end="00:05:26.479" style="s2">the third is that it&#39;s embedded and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">fourth it is that it&#39;s extended</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.479" end="00:05:29.520" style="s2">and all of these and i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">discuss what these mean in a second but</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.520" end="00:05:33.520" style="s2">all of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:34.960" style="s2">are mutually interdefining and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.520" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">inter-affording</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:42.000" style="s2">and the core of them of those four is</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:45.039" style="s2">embodiment i think the rest um in action</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.000" end="00:05:47.680" style="s2">embeddedness and extendedness are</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.039" end="00:05:48.400" style="s2">actually well forgive the pun extensions</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.680" end="00:05:52.080" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.400" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">the central feature of embodiment so</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.080" end="00:05:55.440" style="s2">what&#39;s the key idea of embodiment and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:05:57.039" style="s2">how is it going to ultimately relate to</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.440" end="00:05:59.600" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.039" end="00:06:00.319" style="s2">well the key idea here is to see the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.600" end="00:06:03.440" style="s2">brain</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.319" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">and body as an integrated</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.440" end="00:06:08.319" style="s2">dynamical system as a self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:08.319" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.720" end="00:06:14.400" style="s2">and to say there&#39;s a deep continuity to</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.840" end="00:06:16.800" style="s2">to point to this is to point to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.400" end="00:06:18.560" style="s2">central idea that was developed by</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.800" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">two cognitive scientists francisco</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.560" end="00:06:21.360" style="s2">varela and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:23.120" style="s2">my good friend and colleague evan</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.360" end="00:06:25.280" style="s2">thompson which is called the deep</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.120" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">continuity hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.280" end="00:06:29.840" style="s2">this is a hypothesis about there being a</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">deep continuity</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.840" end="00:06:34.639" style="s2">between the biology of the body and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">cognition of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.639" end="00:06:38.240" style="s2">what do i mean by deep continuity well</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.720" end="00:06:42.000" style="s2">this is to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.240" end="00:06:45.520" style="s2">that the principles and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.000" end="00:06:49.520" style="s2">patterns and processes</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.520" end="00:06:52.720" style="s2">of biology are</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.520" end="00:06:54.960" style="s2">are foundational to cognition in fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:06:58.800" style="s2">you can see cognitive processes</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.960" end="00:07:00.960" style="s2">as deeply similar to and dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.800" end="00:07:02.960" style="s2">those biological principles</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.960" end="00:07:04.080" style="s2">and processes so there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.960" end="00:07:07.440" style="s2">continuity</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.080" end="00:07:09.919" style="s2">between the way life is self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.440" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">and the way cognition is self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.919" end="00:07:13.759" style="s2">which means there&#39;s going to be a deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:16.080" style="s2">interconnection and interdependence</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.759" end="00:07:19.759" style="s2">between the functioning of your brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.080" end="00:07:21.919" style="s2">and the functioning of your body</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.759" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">so let&#39;s take a look at a living thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.919" end="00:07:25.759" style="s2">let&#39;s take a look at a paramecium</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:27.840" style="s2">well obviously a living thing is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.759" end="00:07:31.400" style="s2">self-organizing thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.840" end="00:07:34.560" style="s2">but unlike a tornado a paramecium is</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.400" end="00:07:36.080" style="s2">self-organized in order to adaptively</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.560" end="00:07:38.639" style="s2">seek out the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.080" end="00:07:40.160" style="s2">of its own existence so tornadoes are</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.639" end="00:07:42.080" style="s2">self-organizing things</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.160" end="00:07:44.479" style="s2">but they don&#39;t seek out the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">that will perpetuate their existence</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.479" end="00:07:47.919" style="s2">the paramecium is self-organized in such</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:51.360" style="s2">a way</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.919" end="00:07:54.479" style="s2">that it reliably adaptively seeks out</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.360" end="00:07:56.240" style="s2">the conditions of that will perpetuate</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.479" end="00:07:56.960" style="s2">its own existence that&#39;s what makes it a</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.240" end="00:07:59.680" style="s2">living thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.960" end="00:08:00.639" style="s2">now notice right away that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.680" end="00:08:03.440" style="s2">paramecium</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.639" end="00:08:05.440" style="s2">insofar as it&#39;s a living thing in so far</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.440" end="00:08:06.000" style="s2">is it&#39;s what&#39;s called an autopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.440" end="00:08:08.639" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.000" end="00:08:09.919" style="s2">a self-making thing an autopoetic thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.639" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">is something that is not just</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.919" end="00:08:14.400" style="s2">self-organizing but self-making it</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">self-organizes in order to continually</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.400" end="00:08:18.479" style="s2">maintain and make itself so as soon as i</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:21.360" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.479" end="00:08:22.800" style="s2">the principles of autopilesis i see that</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.360" end="00:08:26.240" style="s2">the paramecium</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.800" end="00:08:30.160" style="s2">is engaged in adaptive seeking</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.240" end="00:08:32.719" style="s2">adaptive seeking now that&#39;s the core</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.160" end="00:08:34.880" style="s2">of actually what cognition is cognition</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.719" end="00:08:38.640" style="s2">is the ability to adaptively</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.880" end="00:08:39.680" style="s2">seek the conditions that are needed for</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.640" end="00:08:42.640" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.680" end="00:08:43.919" style="s2">in the world see the way your brain is</p>

<p begin="00:08:43.919" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">is actually continuous with the way</p>

<p begin="00:08:50.959" end="00:08:55.760" style="s2">so that adaptive seeking what does that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.720" end="00:08:59.200" style="s2">mean go back to the perimysium</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.760" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">the paramecium adaptively seeks out</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.200" end="00:09:04.480" style="s2">food but soon as i say that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:06.480" style="s2">realize something</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.480" end="00:09:08.160" style="s2">food isn&#39;t part of the physics of the</p>

<p begin="00:09:08.160" end="00:09:11.360" style="s2">right there&#39;s there&#39;s nothing in physics</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.240" end="00:09:15.279" style="s2">that defines something as</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.360" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">food food is only a chemical</p>

<p begin="00:09:23.360" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">in its adaptive seeking is already</p>

<p begin="00:09:42.880" end="00:09:48.399" style="s2">and the principles of cognition are</p>

<p begin="00:11:27.680" end="00:11:30.880" style="s2">already coming in here we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">adaptive seeking</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.880" end="00:11:35.040" style="s2">as central to cognition and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">going to talk about a sensory</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.040" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">motor loop where it means motor movement</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.560" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">so in order to get clear what this new</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:46.079" style="s2">picture is let&#39;s compare it to the old</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.480" end="00:11:47.839" style="s2">standard picture</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.079" end="00:11:50.079" style="s2">the old standard picture went like this</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.839" end="00:11:52.000" style="s2">there&#39;s causal stuff out in the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.079" end="00:11:53.839" style="s2">it makes an impact on me it gets</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.000" end="00:11:55.360" style="s2">transduced it gets sent somewhere in</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.839" end="00:11:56.320" style="s2">thai till it reaches something like an</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.360" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">inner computer</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.320" end="00:11:59.519" style="s2">and then the inner computer does</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.839" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">computation on it</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.519" end="00:12:02.079" style="s2">and that&#39;s the only place where</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:03.120" style="s2">cognition is that&#39;s where the cognition</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.079" end="00:12:05.120" style="s2">is it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.120" end="00:12:06.639" style="s2">computation and then the computation</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.120" end="00:12:07.519" style="s2">sends out some signals and then i move</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.639" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">my action</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.519" end="00:12:12.399" style="s2">and the only place where the cognition</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:15.680" style="s2">is is in that very internal spot</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.399" end="00:12:19.040" style="s2">the spot of the computation so</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.680" end="00:12:20.639" style="s2">there&#39;s sensation in cognition and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.040" end="00:12:22.639" style="s2">action out</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.639" end="00:12:24.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the old picture and notice how</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.639" end="00:12:27.600" style="s2">it&#39;s a picture in which the brain</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.480" end="00:12:29.519" style="s2">is isolated it&#39;s not in a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.600" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">coupling to its body</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.519" end="00:12:34.959" style="s2">what&#39;s the new picture well the new</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:34.959" style="s2">picture looks like this</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:40.880" style="s2">the sensory motor loop is suppose i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.200" end="00:12:44.720" style="s2">looking at my pencil here</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.880" end="00:12:48.800" style="s2">don&#39;t understand this as static</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.720" end="00:12:52.480" style="s2">passive reception when organisms</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.800" end="00:12:55.200" style="s2">are perceiving they are always always</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.480" end="00:12:56.959" style="s2">adaptively seeking so when i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.200" end="00:13:00.560" style="s2">perceive this object</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.959" end="00:13:01.839" style="s2">i will start to move even my eyes will</p>

<p begin="00:13:01.839" end="00:13:06.000" style="s2">but i will move and as i move i will</p>

<p begin="00:13:06.000" end="00:13:09.200" style="s2">i&#39;m getting and as the sensory</p>

<p begin="00:13:09.200" end="00:13:12.880" style="s2">changes i change how i move and as i</p>

<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:16.560" style="s2">i change how i sense and now i change</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.880" end="00:13:19.920" style="s2">how i sense i change</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.560" end="00:13:20.959" style="s2">how i move it&#39;s not right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.920" end="00:13:23.920" style="s2">perception</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.959" end="00:13:24.480" style="s2">computation action it&#39;s perception in</p>

<p begin="00:13:24.480" end="00:13:28.800" style="s2">and action within perception there is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.040" end="00:13:31.760" style="s2">sensory motor loop that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.800" end="00:13:33.279" style="s2">constantly evolving in order to</p>

<p begin="00:13:33.279" end="00:13:38.399" style="s2">and here&#39;s the inaction and help in</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.600" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">order so that i can constantly enact</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.399" end="00:13:41.680" style="s2">this adaptive seeking that is at the</p>

<p begin="00:13:41.680" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">of cognition now why is the sensory</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.079" end="00:13:52.240" style="s2">motor loop need to adapt</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:56.399" style="s2">well there&#39;s always trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.240" end="00:13:59.600" style="s2">there&#39;s always trade-offs i can zoom out</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.399" end="00:14:02.639" style="s2">if i want to see all of the pencil</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.600" end="00:14:04.320" style="s2">now i move see how i move</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.639" end="00:14:06.800" style="s2">i can move in if i want to get more</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.320" end="00:14:06.800" style="s2">detail</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.040" end="00:14:10.560" style="s2">but they&#39;re in a trade-off relationship</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.800" end="00:14:11.920" style="s2">and what i will do is i&#39;ll move between</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.560" end="00:14:14.880" style="s2">them to try and get</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.920" end="00:14:16.800" style="s2">an optimal balance between the detail</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.880" end="00:14:19.519" style="s2">and the overall picture</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.800" end="00:14:21.279" style="s2">but here&#39;s the thing there&#39;s no final</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.519" end="00:14:22.639" style="s2">there&#39;s no final place</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.279" end="00:14:24.160" style="s2">there&#39;s you don&#39;t sort of get the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.639" end="00:14:26.000" style="s2">average and sort of stay there in some</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.160" end="00:14:29.680" style="s2">sort of canadian fashion</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.000" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">the point is what counts as the optimal</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.680" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">balance for you but in that trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.839" end="00:14:35.839" style="s2">is relative to the information that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.040" end="00:14:38.079" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.839" end="00:14:39.600" style="s2">in order to meet your auto poetic needs</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.079" end="00:14:42.079" style="s2">so sometimes it the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.600" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">given the context it&#39;s more relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.079" end="00:14:46.639" style="s2">me it matters more to me</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:47.680" style="s2">to get the details sometimes it matters</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.639" end="00:14:50.079" style="s2">more to get</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.680" end="00:14:52.079" style="s2">the overall shape sometimes it matters</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.079" end="00:14:54.160" style="s2">to get the relationship between them</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.079" end="00:14:56.320" style="s2">and so the sensory motor loop and</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.160" end="00:15:00.000" style="s2">therefore my movement</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.320" end="00:15:02.639" style="s2">is always shifting always engaged</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.000" end="00:15:03.600" style="s2">and that is not some product of my</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.639" end="00:15:06.800" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.600" end="00:15:11.199" style="s2">it is the vehicle within my cognition</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.800" end="00:15:13.680" style="s2">is actually taking shape that evolving</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.199" end="00:15:15.920" style="s2">sensory motor loop that&#39;s what it means</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.680" end="00:15:19.120" style="s2">to say that cognition is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.920" end="00:15:21.519" style="s2">inactive cognition is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.120" end="00:15:22.720" style="s2">evolving and i don&#39;t mean biologically i</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.519" end="00:15:26.160" style="s2">mean dynamically</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.720" end="00:15:27.040" style="s2">my evolving fittedness of the sensory</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.160" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">motor loop</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.040" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">to an ongoing changing environment</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.240" end="00:15:39.519" style="s2">so notice what we&#39;re seeing here we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.639" end="00:15:41.680" style="s2">already talked about what embodiment is</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.519" end="00:15:43.759" style="s2">and inaction is and you&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.680" end="00:15:46.639" style="s2">seeing how much</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.759" end="00:15:48.560" style="s2">there is a deep interpenetration between</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.639" end="00:15:51.839" style="s2">embodied movement</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.560" end="00:15:51.839" style="s2">and cognition</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.600" end="00:15:58.639" style="s2">so let&#39;s notice what we&#39;ve what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.399" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">drawn together here</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.639" end="00:16:04.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve drawn that there is a brain body</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:04.000" style="s2">coupling</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.959" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">and we&#39;ve drawn that</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.160" end="00:16:11.360" style="s2">perception and action sensory motor</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">coupling</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.360" end="00:16:15.920" style="s2">and we&#39;ve noted that that loop is</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">actually coupling the organism to a</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.920" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">dynamically changing environment</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.839" end="00:16:23.680" style="s2">so we have three couplings brain body</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:24.639" style="s2">sensory motor and brain body through</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.680" end="00:16:27.839" style="s2">sensory motor</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.639" end="00:16:29.680" style="s2">to a world that is dynamically changing</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.839" end="00:16:30.880" style="s2">so we actually have cognition is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.680" end="00:16:33.199" style="s2">meta-coupling</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.880" end="00:16:34.160" style="s2">of those three couplings always</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.199" end="00:16:36.880" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.160" end="00:16:37.680" style="s2">together at the same time mutually</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.880" end="00:16:39.920" style="s2">affording</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.680" end="00:16:40.959" style="s2">and mutually constraining and mutually</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.920" end="00:16:43.440" style="s2">informing</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.959" end="00:16:43.440" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.440" end="00:16:51.519" style="s2">what is at the center of this meta</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.880" end="00:16:54.320" style="s2">coupling well i keep pointing you to it</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.519" end="00:16:54.320" style="s2">it&#39;s movement</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.800" end="00:16:58.560" style="s2">all of the this meta couple each one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.199" end="00:16:59.920" style="s2">the individual couplings and the way</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.560" end="00:17:03.120" style="s2">they are coupled together</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.920" end="00:17:07.199" style="s2">the nexus of that is movement</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.120" end="00:17:07.199" style="s2">the nexus of that is movement</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.839" end="00:17:13.520" style="s2">so what i&#39;ve tried to argue for first is</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.520" end="00:17:15.520" style="s2">this scientific convergence coming out</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.520" end="00:17:16.720" style="s2">of 4e cognitive science to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.520" end="00:17:21.520" style="s2">conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.720" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">that movement is central to mine</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:24.640" style="s2">not it&#39;s something you happen to do or</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:26.640" style="s2">you just do</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.640" end="00:17:28.400" style="s2">for your survival or you do to get</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.640" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">around no</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.400" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">movement is constitutive to cognition</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.679" end="00:17:40.480" style="s2">now that scientific convergence</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.720" end="00:17:47.039" style="s2">is well it itself is convergence with</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.640" end="00:17:47.919" style="s2">a cultural movement in which we are</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.039" end="00:17:50.640" style="s2">seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.919" end="00:17:52.559" style="s2">emergence of embodied you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.640" end="00:17:55.919" style="s2">communities of practice</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.559" end="00:17:58.400" style="s2">that are centered upon embodied movement</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.919" end="00:17:59.760" style="s2">um and i think this conference is good</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.400" end="00:18:01.840" style="s2">evidence to that fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.760" end="00:18:03.600" style="s2">so there we go i wish all of science was</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.840" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">like this that i could just gesture</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.600" end="00:18:06.640" style="s2">and the empirical evidence would be</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:10.000" style="s2">ready to hand but here it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.640" end="00:18:12.320" style="s2">there we go la da okay so</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.000" end="00:18:14.960" style="s2">just like in the mindfulness revolution</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.320" end="00:18:18.640" style="s2">there was a convergence between</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.960" end="00:18:21.280" style="s2">scientific study and cultural practice</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.640" end="00:18:23.440" style="s2">also with the embodiment revolution</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:27.280" style="s2">there is a huge convergence</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.440" end="00:18:30.960" style="s2">between scientific study and emerging</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.280" end="00:18:30.960" style="s2">the cultural emergence of practice</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.760" end="00:18:35.840" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting also at this</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.200" end="00:18:37.919" style="s2">conference is the fact that these two</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.840" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">revolutions are coming together</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.919" end="00:18:42.320" style="s2">they&#39;re being drawn together there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.840" end="00:18:45.600" style="s2">mindfulness stage and a movement stage</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.320" end="00:18:47.679" style="s2">at this conference and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.600" end="00:18:50.480" style="s2">people are pairing these two together</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.679" end="00:18:50.880" style="s2">mindful movements and i was very lucky</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.480" end="00:18:53.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.880" end="00:18:54.400" style="s2">i was taught an ecology of practices and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.200" end="00:18:57.120" style="s2">that included</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.400" end="00:18:58.080" style="s2">tai chi chuan as a moving mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.120" end="00:19:00.240" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.080" end="00:19:01.200" style="s2">or a mindfulness moving movement</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.240" end="00:19:02.799" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.200" end="00:19:04.480" style="s2">now i want to propose something to you</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.799" end="00:19:06.160" style="s2">given this setup i want to make a</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.480" end="00:19:06.720" style="s2">proposal to you that i&#39;m going to argue</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.160" end="00:19:09.200" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.720" end="00:19:11.120" style="s2">here&#39;s the proposal i propose that these</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.200" end="00:19:12.640" style="s2">two revolutions are driven</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.120" end="00:19:15.200" style="s2">and are driven together what two</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.640" end="00:19:16.880" style="s2">revolutions the mindfulness revolution</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.200" end="00:19:17.200" style="s2">and the embodiment revolution that these</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.880" end="00:19:19.840" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.200" end="00:19:22.080" style="s2">revolutions are individually driven and</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.840" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">are jointly driven together</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.080" end="00:19:27.600" style="s2">by the need to recover lost ways of</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:30.720" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.600" end="00:19:30.720" style="s2">lost ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.120" end="00:19:35.120" style="s2">and what&#39;s going to be a corollary to</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.360" end="00:19:36.080" style="s2">that is the reason why we want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.120" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">recover them</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.080" end="00:19:40.480" style="s2">is because these lost ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:42.640" style="s2">are central to meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.480" end="00:19:44.400" style="s2">they&#39;re central to meaning in life and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.640" end="00:19:46.720" style="s2">meaning in life is going to be a higher</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.400" end="00:19:48.799" style="s2">order version of that sense making</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.720" end="00:19:50.840" style="s2">and that adaptive coupling to the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.799" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">that is constitutive of your cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.840" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">agency</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:19:59.840" style="s2">so lost ways of knowing that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.320" end="00:20:00.240" style="s2">arcane and it sounds like i&#39;m now going</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.840" end="00:20:02.400" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.240" end="00:20:04.840" style="s2">do something telismatic or alchemical or</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.400" end="00:20:06.240" style="s2">something that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.840" end="00:20:09.440" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.240" end="00:20:13.120" style="s2">what i want to do is challenge the way</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.440" end="00:20:14.720" style="s2">post descartes post newton and kant</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.120" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s all i&#39;m going to do is just</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.720" end="00:20:18.159" style="s2">mention their names i&#39;m just going to</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:18.799" style="s2">drop them in a ridiculously pretentious</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.159" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">fashion</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.799" end="00:20:24.880" style="s2">and then continue on um</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">but since then we have reduced knowing</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.880" end="00:20:29.760" style="s2">we to the point where we have identified</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:32.720" style="s2">it with one kind of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.760" end="00:20:34.159" style="s2">and this is propositional knowing</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.720" end="00:20:35.760" style="s2">propositional knowing</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.159" end="00:20:38.559" style="s2">is and the vehicle of propositional</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.760" end="00:20:40.799" style="s2">knowing is is a proposition of course</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.559" end="00:20:42.480" style="s2">and propositional knowing is knowing</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.799" end="00:20:44.960" style="s2">that something is the case</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.480" end="00:20:45.679" style="s2">and that is the content of a proposition</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.960" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.679" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">variously understood as some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:52.799" style="s2">fact for example i know that</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:54.880" style="s2">cats are mammals there we go that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.799" end="00:20:56.480" style="s2">propositional knowing</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.880" end="00:20:59.440" style="s2">and what does propositional knowing</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.480" end="00:21:03.200" style="s2">result in it results in beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.440" end="00:21:05.200" style="s2">and if those beliefs have been acquired</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.200" end="00:21:06.480" style="s2">by good inferential practice and</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.200" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">evidenced well</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.480" end="00:21:10.799" style="s2">then i come to have a theory and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">what&#39;s the normative phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.799" end="00:21:14.559" style="s2">what&#39;s my experience</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:16.240" style="s2">of having good propositional knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:19.200" style="s2">by having a good theory</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.240" end="00:21:20.799" style="s2">well i get it i get a sense a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.200" end="00:21:22.400" style="s2">conviction of truth</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.799" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">i get a sense of truth that&#39;s the way in</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.400" end="00:21:26.080" style="s2">which propositions</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:28.480" style="s2">are that&#39;s the way in which i&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.080" end="00:21:31.120" style="s2">told by my brain body</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.480" end="00:21:34.000" style="s2">that my propositions are picking up on</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.120" end="00:21:37.120" style="s2">reality i get a sense of truth</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.000" end="00:21:39.280" style="s2">but notice something in order</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.120" end="00:21:42.400" style="s2">to do propositions i actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.280" end="00:21:45.679" style="s2">know how to propose</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.400" end="00:21:46.400" style="s2">i have to know how to question i have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.679" end="00:21:49.280" style="s2">know how</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.400" end="00:21:50.480" style="s2">to adaptively seek for relevant</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.280" end="00:21:53.840" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.480" end="00:21:55.760" style="s2">from the environment my propositional</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.840" end="00:21:58.559" style="s2">knowledge is actually dependent on my</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.760" end="00:22:00.320" style="s2">knowing how to do many things</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.559" end="00:22:03.840" style="s2">this is called procedural knowledge it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.320" end="00:22:03.840" style="s2">knowing how to do something</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.280" end="00:22:08.960" style="s2">and the content of procedural knowing is</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.159" end="00:22:11.360" style="s2">not a</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.960" end="00:22:12.880" style="s2">proper it&#39;s not a fact it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.360" end="00:22:16.320" style="s2">interaction with the world a sensory</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.880" end="00:22:16.320" style="s2">motor interaction with the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.039" end="00:22:22.880" style="s2">procedural knowing doesn&#39;t result in</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.640" end="00:22:22.880" style="s2">belief in theory it results in skills</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.120" end="00:22:26.159" style="s2">and when those skills are developed well</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:29.600" style="s2">so that they</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.159" end="00:22:33.039" style="s2">have reliable applicability then</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.600" end="00:22:33.039" style="s2">what we have is expertise</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.520" end="00:22:36.720" style="s2">and then the phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.200" end="00:22:39.520" style="s2">normativity of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.720" end="00:22:40.080" style="s2">is not a sense of truth when i have</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.520" end="00:22:43.440" style="s2">expertise</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.080" end="00:22:44.400" style="s2">i have a sense of power i&#39;m empowered by</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.440" end="00:22:47.520" style="s2">my expertise</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.400" end="00:22:48.640" style="s2">i have a sense of power and that&#39;s how i</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.520" end="00:22:50.720" style="s2">sense realness</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.640" end="00:22:53.520" style="s2">in procedural knowledge i don&#39;t sense it</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.720" end="00:22:55.280" style="s2">as truth i sense it as power</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.520" end="00:22:56.559" style="s2">and power is a big way in which we</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.280" end="00:22:59.280" style="s2">evaluate if things are</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.559" end="00:22:59.280" style="s2">real to us</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:04.000" style="s2">but notice if i&#39;m going to use or</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:09.520" style="s2">acquire</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.000" end="00:23:11.520" style="s2">a skill i need situational awareness</p>

<p begin="00:32:55.039" end="00:32:57.760" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to offer a definition but</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:33:00.399" style="s2">i&#39;m going to offer a central feature of</p>

<p begin="00:34:13.839" end="00:34:18.320" style="s2">now what&#39;s interesting about this this</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.000" end="00:34:20.320" style="s2">this this ability to step back</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.320" end="00:34:23.200" style="s2">and look at that&#39;s what the meta means</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:26.560" style="s2">here your own perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.200" end="00:34:26.960" style="s2">as i was recently uh fortunate to belong</p>

<p begin="00:34:26.960" end="00:34:32.079" style="s2">uh to participate in uh um</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.399" end="00:34:34.079" style="s2">a first day workshop and then the</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.079" end="00:34:35.119" style="s2">writing of a consensus paper but from</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.079" end="00:34:37.440" style="s2">many of the</p>

<p begin="00:34:37.440" end="00:34:41.440" style="s2">are doing work on the psychology</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.520" end="00:34:42.960" style="s2">um and the cognitive science and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.440" end="00:34:44.560" style="s2">neuroscience of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.960" end="00:34:46.480" style="s2">and one of the things we came to a</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.560" end="00:34:48.960" style="s2">convergent conclusion about</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.480" end="00:34:50.320" style="s2">is that this meta-perspectival awareness</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.960" end="00:34:53.040" style="s2">is central</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.320" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">to wisdom it&#39;s central to wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.040" end="00:34:55.760" style="s2">i&#39;ll come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.079" end="00:34:57.280" style="s2">in a sec why would such</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.760" end="00:34:58.880" style="s2">meta-perspectival awareness</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.280" end="00:35:00.240" style="s2">be central to wisdom and this is of</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.880" end="00:35:01.359" style="s2">course part of what these mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.240" end="00:35:03.119" style="s2">traditions claim</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.359" end="00:35:06.000" style="s2">they claim that mindfulness is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.119" end="00:35:07.680" style="s2">cultivating wisdom but how and why</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.000" end="00:35:10.560" style="s2">well in order to bring that out i want</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.680" end="00:35:12.240" style="s2">to bring out a second aspect</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.560" end="00:35:14.480" style="s2">to mindfulness beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.240" end="00:35:16.560" style="s2">meta-perspectival awareness</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.480" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">i think it&#39;s also there&#39;s an educational</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.560" end="00:35:20.160" style="s2">aspect to mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:21.680" style="s2">and this is more controversial not all</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.160" end="00:35:22.800" style="s2">mindfulness teachers would agree with me</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.680" end="00:35:25.760" style="s2">on this</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.800" end="00:35:27.440" style="s2">but i think if mindfulness is not an</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.760" end="00:35:30.240" style="s2">educational transformative</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.440" end="00:35:32.160" style="s2">uh practice then i think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.240" end="00:35:34.079" style="s2">misrepresenting how it</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.160" end="00:35:35.200" style="s2">you&#39;re misrepresenting it it&#39;s original</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.079" end="00:35:36.960" style="s2">presentation</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.200" end="00:35:38.800" style="s2">uh within things like the buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:40.640" style="s2">tradition or the dallas tradition</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.800" end="00:35:42.800" style="s2">what&#39;s the educational aspect so i want</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.640" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">to give you a quick analogy</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.800" end="00:35:48.800" style="s2">to bring out what i mean so</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.839" end="00:35:50.320" style="s2">i want to change my perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.800" end="00:35:52.000" style="s2">ultimately and we&#39;ll come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.320" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">my participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.000" end="00:35:56.000" style="s2">in that i want to com i want to like</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.000" end="00:35:56.960" style="s2">classical music and i don&#39;t currently</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.000" end="00:35:57.920" style="s2">like classical music</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.960" end="00:35:59.520" style="s2">that&#39;s not actually true i like</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.920" end="00:36:00.160" style="s2">classical music but let&#39;s say it was the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.520" end="00:36:02.079" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.160" end="00:36:04.240" style="s2">right so what i can do is i can take a</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.079" end="00:36:05.680" style="s2">music appreciation class</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.240" end="00:36:07.680" style="s2">and if the thing about this word</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.680" end="00:36:09.920" style="s2">appreciation is it&#39;s used because it</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.680" end="00:36:12.800" style="s2">it connotes three things or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.920" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">denotes three things at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.800" end="00:36:16.240" style="s2">one is appreciation of the sense i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:18.079" style="s2">going to come to a deeper understanding</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.240" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">of music</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.079" end="00:36:21.359" style="s2">and then secondly i&#39;m going to come to</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:22.800" style="s2">value music</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.359" end="00:36:25.119" style="s2">classical music more and those are going</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.800" end="00:36:27.200" style="s2">to interpenetrate each other and</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.119" end="00:36:28.800" style="s2">interact each other</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.200" end="00:36:30.079" style="s2">and secondly i&#39;m just going to ray i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.800" end="00:36:31.280" style="s2">going to go through a transformative</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.079" end="00:36:33.040" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.280" end="00:36:36.640" style="s2">right like when we talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.040" end="00:36:38.880" style="s2">something appreciates over time</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.640" end="00:36:39.760" style="s2">and so what i would propose to you is</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.880" end="00:36:41.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.760" end="00:36:44.880" style="s2">mindfulness is meta perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.760" end="00:36:47.760" style="s2">awareness that is designed to</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.880" end="00:36:48.640" style="s2">educate an appreciation for perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.760" end="00:36:50.800" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.640" end="00:36:54.079" style="s2">so that you come to more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.800" end="00:36:54.880" style="s2">appreciate perspectival knowing why</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.079" end="00:36:58.320" style="s2">would you want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.880" end="00:37:00.720" style="s2">more deeply appreciate understand</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.320" end="00:37:02.720" style="s2">value and identify with your</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.720" end="00:37:04.480" style="s2">perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.720" end="00:37:06.960" style="s2">well because this ultimately affords</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.480" end="00:37:08.720" style="s2">insight this ultimately forwards those</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.960" end="00:37:12.320" style="s2">aha moments</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.720" end="00:37:14.640" style="s2">because what&#39;s going on in an insight</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.320" end="00:37:16.720" style="s2">is a pro like you don&#39;t you don&#39;t do an</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.640" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">insight</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.720" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">you know oh you know what i need an</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:22.560" style="s2">insight doesn&#39;t happen that way</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.800" end="00:37:24.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work that way you also can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.560" end="00:37:26.480" style="s2">just sort of sit around just like i need</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.000" end="00:37:29.920" style="s2">an insight oh well</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.480" end="00:37:34.160" style="s2">i&#39;ll wait so it&#39;s neither active</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:36.079" style="s2">expression nor static reception</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.160" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">what happens is you have to involve</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.079" end="00:37:42.079" style="s2">yourself you have to participate</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.839" end="00:37:44.640" style="s2">in a process by which your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.079" end="00:37:45.280" style="s2">will dynamically and dynamical systems</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.640" end="00:37:48.320" style="s2">theory is now</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.280" end="00:37:52.079" style="s2">used to try and explain insight</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.320" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">in which right your perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.079" end="00:37:56.640" style="s2">which is a dynamical process</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:37:58.320" style="s2">will dynamically restructure what you</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.640" end="00:38:00.640" style="s2">find salient</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.320" end="00:38:01.440" style="s2">or relevant what you background and what</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.640" end="00:38:04.400" style="s2">you foreground</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.440" end="00:38:06.240" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s happening in an aha moment</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.400" end="00:38:08.880" style="s2">you go oh i didn&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.240" end="00:38:12.400" style="s2">this was relevant or i was treating this</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.880" end="00:38:12.400" style="s2">as central and it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.400" end="00:38:21.920" style="s2">so a man lives in the united states this</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.000" end="00:38:21.920" style="s2">has nothing to do with current situation</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.079" end="00:38:30.560" style="s2">he marries multiple women</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.240" end="00:38:32.800" style="s2">in a month he divorces none of them</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.560" end="00:38:35.440" style="s2">and none of them die but he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.800" end="00:38:38.400" style="s2">break any laws</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.440" end="00:38:38.400" style="s2">how does he do that</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.320" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">he&#39;s a priest he marries many women</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.320" end="00:38:49.359" style="s2">to other men now most people get this</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:52.480" style="s2">after a few minutes of thought</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.359" end="00:38:54.240" style="s2">they&#39;ll go all right aha</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.480" end="00:38:55.599" style="s2">what what was needed how many of you</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:38:57.359" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that priests could marry</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.599" end="00:38:59.760" style="s2">people of course you knew that</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.359" end="00:39:02.960" style="s2">you knew that everybody knew that but</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.760" end="00:39:06.240" style="s2">why is that why are you initially stuck</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.960" end="00:39:08.400" style="s2">because what&#39;s salient to you is</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.240" end="00:39:10.880" style="s2">another meaning of mary which is to</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.400" end="00:39:12.640" style="s2">become someone&#39;s spouse</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.880" end="00:39:15.040" style="s2">and what you have to do is you have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.640" end="00:39:15.760" style="s2">shift and you have to let it restructure</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.040" end="00:39:18.400" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.760" end="00:39:19.119" style="s2">so the saliency of the other meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.400" end="00:39:22.079" style="s2">mary</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.119" end="00:39:24.320" style="s2">comes into your awareness and you go ah</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.079" end="00:39:27.640" style="s2">and you shift your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.320" end="00:39:31.119" style="s2">that&#39;s what insight is it is a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.640" end="00:39:33.440" style="s2">participation in a self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.119" end="00:39:35.839" style="s2">a self-organizing reconstruction of your</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.440" end="00:39:38.720" style="s2">perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.839" end="00:39:40.079" style="s2">and here&#39;s the thing mindfulness drives</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.720" end="00:39:42.079" style="s2">insight because of it</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.079" end="00:39:43.280" style="s2">the way it drives a metacognitive</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.079" end="00:39:46.000" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.280" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">and appreciation for perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.000" end="00:39:49.599" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.960" end="00:39:50.000" style="s2">and why is that central to wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.599" end="00:39:53.599" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.000" end="00:39:54.960" style="s2">insight is central to wisdom wise people</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.599" end="00:39:57.920" style="s2">have the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.960" end="00:39:59.119" style="s2">to adopt a perspective that allows them</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.920" end="00:40:01.839" style="s2">insight into</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.119" end="00:40:03.680" style="s2">things that we don&#39;t see that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.839" end="00:40:05.839" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.680" end="00:40:08.839" style="s2">the machinery of insight is the same</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.839" end="00:40:11.359" style="s2">machinery that you use to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.839" end="00:40:13.760" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.359" end="00:40:15.359" style="s2">think about here&#39;s an obvious example</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.760" end="00:40:17.119" style="s2">it&#39;s not the only example</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.359" end="00:40:18.800" style="s2">a lot of your self-deception though a</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.119" end="00:40:22.839" style="s2">lot of my self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.800" end="00:40:25.839" style="s2">is because i default to an egocentric</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.839" end="00:40:25.839" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.800" end="00:40:31.119" style="s2">but with mindfulness i can break out of</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.440" end="00:40:32.560" style="s2">that egocentric bias</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.119" end="00:40:35.440" style="s2">and that will actually afford me</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.560" end="00:40:37.599" style="s2">overcoming a lot of self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.440" end="00:40:39.520" style="s2">that same machinery also enhances my</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.599" end="00:40:43.280" style="s2">connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.520" end="00:40:46.400" style="s2">to the world this is why perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.280" end="00:40:48.560" style="s2">knowing and the ability to transform it</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.400" end="00:40:50.560" style="s2">is so central to the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.560" end="00:40:52.079" style="s2">wisdom and now you see i&#39;m starting to</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.560" end="00:40:52.720" style="s2">talk to you what i promised i would talk</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.079" end="00:40:53.920" style="s2">to you about</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.720" end="00:40:55.760" style="s2">i&#39;m starting to talk to you about</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.920" end="00:40:58.560" style="s2">personal transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.760" end="00:40:58.560" style="s2">transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.560" end="00:41:09.119" style="s2">i&#39;ve already argued that movement is the</p>

<p begin="00:41:09.119" end="00:41:14.079" style="s2">for the couplings the metacoupling that</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.000" end="00:41:18.560" style="s2">is at the core of participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.079" end="00:41:18.560" style="s2">at the core of your identity and agency</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.280" end="00:41:22.480" style="s2">it&#39;s at the core of the brain body the</p>

<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:35.839" style="s2">about participatory knowing it can also</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.480" end="00:41:37.839" style="s2">go wrong</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.839" end="00:41:39.520" style="s2">here&#39;s a primary example of this</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.839" end="00:41:40.960" style="s2">instance of it not the only one but a</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.520" end="00:41:43.520" style="s2">good one</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.960" end="00:41:44.800" style="s2">this is based on work of my friend and</p>

<p begin="00:41:44.800" end="00:41:51.200" style="s2">who also like me is part of the 4e camp</p>

<p begin="00:42:00.480" end="00:42:05.040" style="s2">and more importantly for what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.599" end="00:42:05.040" style="s2">going to talk about right now addiction</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.280" end="00:42:08.800" style="s2">and he talks about addiction in a way</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.040" end="00:42:10.880" style="s2">that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.800" end="00:42:12.000" style="s2">than how we currently talk about it we</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.880" end="00:42:14.240" style="s2">currently talk about</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.000" end="00:42:16.000" style="s2">addiction as if it&#39;s a disease that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.240" end="00:42:18.480" style="s2">catch that then compels our</p>

<p begin="00:42:19.760" end="00:42:23.839" style="s2">mark and many others are now arguing</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.079" end="00:42:24.800" style="s2">that that model doesn&#39;t fit the data</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.839" end="00:42:28.640" style="s2">well at all</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.800" end="00:42:31.040" style="s2">does not it&#39;s a bad analogy</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.640" end="00:42:32.720" style="s2">instead mark proposes what he calls a</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.040" end="00:42:34.319" style="s2">process that addiction is the result of</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.720" end="00:42:36.800" style="s2">what he calls reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.319" end="00:42:39.599" style="s2">let&#39;s do it very quickly i&#39;m in some</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.800" end="00:42:41.680" style="s2">very stressful situation</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.599" end="00:42:43.200" style="s2">so i drink some alcohol to try and</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:44.880" style="s2">alleviate the stress and it does it</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.200" end="00:42:46.160" style="s2">really alleviates the anxiety and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.880" end="00:42:48.319" style="s2">stress and that&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.160" end="00:42:49.760" style="s2">so i get an immediate sort of short-term</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.319" end="00:42:51.599" style="s2">relief</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.760" end="00:42:53.040" style="s2">the problem is what that does is it</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.599" end="00:42:55.760" style="s2">actually reduces</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.040" end="00:42:56.960" style="s2">my cognitive flexibility that adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.760" end="00:42:58.880" style="s2">seeking behavior</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:43:00.480" style="s2">it changes my perspective of knowing a</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.880" end="00:43:03.040" style="s2">big think about the same room when</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.480" end="00:43:05.920" style="s2">you&#39;re sober and when you&#39;re drunk</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.040" end="00:43:06.720" style="s2">okay so it reduces my cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.920" end="00:43:08.319" style="s2">flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.720" end="00:43:09.839" style="s2">what does that mean well that means the</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.319" end="00:43:13.119" style="s2">number of problems and the number of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.839" end="00:43:14.319" style="s2">options in my world also decrease that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.119" end="00:43:16.880" style="s2">scary</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.319" end="00:43:17.760" style="s2">that&#39;s anxiety producing that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.880" end="00:43:20.720" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.760" end="00:43:21.839" style="s2">start to limit my cognitive flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.720" end="00:43:23.440" style="s2">because if i scare you</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.839" end="00:43:25.119" style="s2">and produce a lot of anxiety your</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.440" end="00:43:26.880" style="s2">cognitive flexibility goes down</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.119" end="00:43:29.520" style="s2">also this is to put you into what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.880" end="00:43:31.040" style="s2">called a scarcity mentality</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.520" end="00:43:32.960" style="s2">when things are seeming more scarce to</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.040" end="00:43:33.520" style="s2">you you also get way more cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.960" end="00:43:36.720" style="s2">rigid</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.520" end="00:43:38.160" style="s2">okay so now my cognition narrows a bit</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.720" end="00:43:39.760" style="s2">and then the options have gone down and</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.160" end="00:43:40.480" style="s2">then that&#39;s scary and the anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.760" end="00:43:42.400" style="s2">producing</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.480" end="00:43:44.640" style="s2">and my then my cognitive flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.400" end="00:43:46.880" style="s2">narrows even more i get even more rigid</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.640" end="00:43:48.240" style="s2">and i probably take more alcohol to try</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.880" end="00:43:50.400" style="s2">and deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.240" end="00:43:52.160" style="s2">and then my world is narrowing and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.400" end="00:43:55.520" style="s2">what happens is my world</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.160" end="00:43:58.000" style="s2">and my cognition the arena and the agent</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.520" end="00:43:59.680" style="s2">reciprocally narrow until and listen to</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.000" end="00:44:03.040" style="s2">the participatory language here</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.680" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">i can&#39;t be anything other than i am</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.040" end="00:44:06.640" style="s2">and the world can&#39;t be any other than it</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.599" end="00:44:09.520" style="s2">is there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.640" end="00:44:11.280" style="s2">options for me and i am fated and doomed</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.520" end="00:44:14.800" style="s2">to do what i do</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:14.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s addiction</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.359" end="00:44:26.800" style="s2">but and this is what i said to mark</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.560" end="00:44:29.040" style="s2">if reciprocal narrowing is a thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.800" end="00:44:30.480" style="s2">then so is its opposite reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.040" end="00:44:34.800" style="s2">opening</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.480" end="00:44:37.839" style="s2">that i can enhance my flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.800" end="00:44:38.480" style="s2">and open up the affordance space in my</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.839" end="00:44:41.520" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.480" end="00:44:42.000" style="s2">and i can reciprocally open up my the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.520" end="00:44:44.800" style="s2">agent</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.000" end="00:44:44.800" style="s2">and arena</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.200" end="00:44:48.880" style="s2">and what&#39;s powerful about that</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.960" end="00:44:52.079" style="s2">is that when you get into reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.640" end="00:44:56.560" style="s2">opening you experience</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.079" end="00:44:58.960" style="s2">love love is not an emotion</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.560" end="00:45:00.800" style="s2">oh i&#39;m so tired of that and most of all</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:03.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.800" end="00:45:04.560" style="s2">when you love someone that can make you</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.520" end="00:45:09.359" style="s2">angry</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.560" end="00:45:12.800" style="s2">sad happy frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.359" end="00:45:16.240" style="s2">love is an existential mode it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.800" end="00:45:18.400" style="s2">agent arena way of being love is</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.240" end="00:45:19.680" style="s2">reciprocal opening and if i put you into</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.400" end="00:45:20.560" style="s2">a situation this has been shown</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.680" end="00:45:22.480" style="s2">experimentally</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.560" end="00:45:24.240" style="s2">when you start to reciprocally open even</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.480" end="00:45:24.800" style="s2">with another person you will start to</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.240" end="00:45:27.680" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.800" end="00:45:27.680" style="s2">love for them</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.400" end="00:45:34.240" style="s2">where&#39;s the place that i argued is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.440" end="00:45:36.880" style="s2">nexus</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.240" end="00:45:39.760" style="s2">for participatory knowing and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.880" end="00:45:42.400" style="s2">transforming it well it&#39;s movement</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.760" end="00:45:42.400" style="s2">it&#39;s movement</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.200" end="00:45:48.880" style="s2">notice how even in the core of religions</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.960" end="00:45:50.960" style="s2">when we try and talk about people going</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.880" end="00:45:53.280" style="s2">through a huge transformation</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.960" end="00:45:54.480" style="s2">we combine perspectival and</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.280" end="00:45:58.400" style="s2">participatory</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.480" end="00:46:00.960" style="s2">movement we have this term metanoia</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.400" end="00:46:02.960" style="s2">here&#39;s the meta again by the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.960" end="00:46:04.640" style="s2">translated poorly like converting to a</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.960" end="00:46:08.000" style="s2">religion as if you&#39;re a chemical</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.640" end="00:46:10.880" style="s2">what it what it means is moving</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.000" end="00:46:11.839" style="s2">and turning around so that i have a new</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.880" end="00:46:13.920" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.839" end="00:46:15.440" style="s2">and therefore a new identity is possible</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.920" end="00:46:17.760" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.440" end="00:46:19.599" style="s2">at the core of reciprocal movement at</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.760" end="00:46:22.960" style="s2">the core of reciprocal opening</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.599" end="00:46:25.359" style="s2">are transformative practices of movement</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.960" end="00:46:26.839" style="s2">that integrate participatory and</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.359" end="00:46:29.839" style="s2">perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.839" end="00:46:29.839" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.720" end="00:46:38.960" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.839" end="00:46:46.880" style="s2">if mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.119" end="00:46:48.480" style="s2">helps me to remember lost perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.880" end="00:46:50.720" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.480" end="00:46:51.920" style="s2">and movement practices helped me to</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.720" end="00:46:53.760" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.920" end="00:46:55.280" style="s2">participatory knowing that putting the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.760" end="00:46:57.440" style="s2">two together would be optimal</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.280" end="00:46:59.599" style="s2">in mindful movement and of course that</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.440" end="00:47:01.200" style="s2">makes sense because they belong together</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.599" end="00:47:02.880" style="s2">perspectival knowing depends on</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.200" end="00:47:03.920" style="s2">participatory knowing i&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.880" end="00:47:05.599" style="s2">argued that</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.920" end="00:47:07.200" style="s2">but participatory knowing also comes</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.599" end="00:47:10.000" style="s2">into a particular expression within</p>

<p begin="00:52:19.520" end="00:52:23.200" style="s2">right but know that the flow notice the</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.920" end="00:52:25.839" style="s2">flow state is one</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.200" end="00:52:28.319" style="s2">that is created by being appropriately</p>

<p begin="00:52:49.520" end="00:52:53.680" style="s2">in a dynamical process then i get the</p>

<p begin="00:52:53.680" end="00:52:57.440" style="s2">that set of affordances that we</p>

<p begin="00:52:57.440" end="00:53:00.480" style="s2">and notice what else is needed for flow</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.760" end="00:53:02.640" style="s2">i need</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.480" end="00:53:03.920" style="s2">there to be a tight coupling between my</p>

<p begin="00:53:04.720" end="00:53:09.920" style="s2">tight coupling is right what actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.359" end="00:53:11.680" style="s2">produces the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.920" end="00:53:13.280" style="s2">and what does that result in well it</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.680" end="00:53:16.400" style="s2">results in this wonderful state that</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.280" end="00:53:18.240" style="s2">people seek out repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.400" end="00:53:19.520" style="s2">not because it&#39;s pleasurable but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.240" end="00:53:22.000" style="s2">deeply rewarding</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.520" end="00:53:23.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a state of you feel at one with</p>

<p begin="00:54:02.640" end="00:54:05.200" style="s2">talked about</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.920" end="00:54:09.520" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s a change in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.920" end="00:54:10.720" style="s2">of presence when you&#39;re in the flow</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.520" end="00:54:12.720" style="s2">state ever you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.720" end="00:54:13.760" style="s2">everything seems so real everything&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:54:13.760" end="00:54:19.280" style="s2">to you and your present to it but you</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.240" end="00:54:20.720" style="s2">know what diminishes in the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.280" end="00:54:23.680" style="s2">but diminishes in the flow state is all</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.720" end="00:54:26.800" style="s2">that propositional processing</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.680" end="00:54:28.000" style="s2">you stop that nattering nanny of</p>

<p begin="00:54:34.960" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2">oh no that falls away</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.480" end="00:54:42.720" style="s2">and here&#39;s one of the powerful insights</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.280" end="00:54:44.480" style="s2">existential insights that come out of</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.720" end="00:54:46.720" style="s2">the flow experience</p>

<p begin="00:55:11.839" end="00:55:16.799" style="s2">sent me high and i would argue</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.440" end="00:55:18.799" style="s2">it actually develops your</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.799" end="00:55:20.079" style="s2">your agency your sense of identity and</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.799" end="00:55:23.280" style="s2">your sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.079" end="00:55:23.280" style="s2">in a profound way</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.000" end="00:55:27.119" style="s2">and here&#39;s what we now know</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.440" end="00:55:30.400" style="s2">a quick way to see if people find their</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.960" end="00:55:34.319" style="s2">life meaningful is ask them how</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.400" end="00:55:36.000" style="s2">frequently they get into the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.319" end="00:55:37.440" style="s2">because if they get into the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.000" end="00:55:38.559" style="s2">they will have enhanced sense of</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.440" end="00:55:40.160" style="s2">well-being</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.559" end="00:55:42.000" style="s2">and they will have an enhanced sense of</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.160" end="00:55:45.520" style="s2">meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.000" end="00:55:47.839" style="s2">because in the flow state we remember</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.520" end="00:55:50.720" style="s2">the perspectival and the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.839" end="00:55:54.640" style="s2">knowing we fall in love again</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.720" end="00:55:58.160" style="s2">with the shining aspect of being</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.640" end="00:56:01.280" style="s2">and perhaps we then recover</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.160" end="00:56:02.000" style="s2">a capacity to deeply remember meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.280" end="00:56:04.480" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.000" end="00:56:08.000" style="s2">in a way that might be relevant to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.480" end="00:56:09.680" style="s2">meaning crisis that we find ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.000" end="00:56:12.000" style="s2">but that&#39;s another argument for another</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.680" end="00:56:16.319" style="s2">day so thank you very much everyone for</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.000" end="00:56:17.520" style="s2">your time and attention</p>

<p begin="01:01:35.520" end="01:01:40.640" style="s2">that&#39;s more likely now beautiful just</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.839" end="01:01:43.200" style="s2">got to deal with this covert thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.640" end="01:01:44.079" style="s2">brandon asks if you can expand on or</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.200" end="01:01:47.280" style="s2">elaborate</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.079" end="01:01:49.040" style="s2">uh on affordances a little bit yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.280" end="01:01:49.599" style="s2">affordances was originally a notion</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.040" end="01:01:53.359" style="s2">drawn</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.599" end="01:01:55.359" style="s2">from gibson um my colleague jordan</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.359" end="01:01:57.200" style="s2">peterson has made use of the notion</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.359" end="01:01:58.559" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t think without properly giving</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.200" end="01:02:00.240" style="s2">credit to gibson so</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.559" end="01:02:01.760" style="s2">oh no he definitely talks about gibson i</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.240" end="01:02:03.359" style="s2">can say that for sure okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.760" end="01:02:04.559" style="s2">good good i haven&#39;t seen him do it in</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.359" end="01:02:05.520" style="s2">some of the lectures that i&#39;ve attended</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.559" end="01:02:08.880" style="s2">at conferences but</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.520" end="01:02:13.039" style="s2">i&#39;ll take your word for it uh uh rafe</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.880" end="01:02:15.920" style="s2">and so uh affordances is it&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.039" end="01:02:16.960" style="s2">that and this is what that perception</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.920" end="01:02:20.079" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.960" end="01:02:22.160" style="s2">work in terms of these real relations so</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.079" end="01:02:25.760" style="s2">this is the this is what we have to get</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.160" end="01:02:28.400" style="s2">we have to stop thinking that reality</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.760" end="01:02:29.039" style="s2">listen to the word reality res the thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.400" end="01:02:32.240" style="s2">latin</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.039" end="01:02:34.960" style="s2">we have to stop thinking of reality as</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.240" end="01:02:36.559" style="s2">in things and that the relations between</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.960" end="01:02:37.839" style="s2">them are just sort of mental acts we</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.559" end="01:02:40.880" style="s2">perform</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.839" end="01:02:42.400" style="s2">uh that&#39;s called nominalism and what</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.880" end="01:02:44.240" style="s2">we&#39;re now coming to see</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.400" end="01:02:45.760" style="s2">and this is even in sort of in science</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.240" end="01:02:47.839" style="s2">what&#39;s called structural realism</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.760" end="01:02:48.799" style="s2">we&#39;re coming to see is that no the</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.839" end="01:02:51.839" style="s2">relations</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.799" end="01:02:53.839" style="s2">are actually as real or if not more real</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.839" end="01:02:56.240" style="s2">than the things related</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.839" end="01:02:57.760" style="s2">um and you know you can see this both at</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.240" end="01:02:59.280" style="s2">the high level macroscopic and</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.760" end="01:03:01.760" style="s2">relativity which is ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.280" end="01:03:03.920" style="s2">a real relational theory and low-level</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.760" end="01:03:06.960" style="s2">quantum mechanics and etcetera</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.920" end="01:03:08.240" style="s2">okay so given that what we have to</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.960" end="01:03:10.799" style="s2">understand is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.240" end="01:03:12.720" style="s2">there is here&#39;s my example there is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.799" end="01:03:16.319" style="s2">real relation</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.720" end="01:03:19.039" style="s2">between this thing and my hand</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.319" end="01:03:20.480" style="s2">that makes it graspable it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.039" end="01:03:22.799" style="s2">property of this thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.480" end="01:03:24.880" style="s2">or this thing but it is a property of</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.799" end="01:03:28.319" style="s2">the real relation between them</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.880" end="01:03:33.039" style="s2">this floor is walkable by me</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.319" end="01:03:33.039" style="s2">right these clothes are wearable by me</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.520" end="01:03:36.799" style="s2">and there&#39;s clothes that are not</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.880" end="01:03:40.079" style="s2">wearable by me especially if i</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.799" end="01:03:43.200" style="s2">don&#39;t lose some more weight okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.079" end="01:03:46.240" style="s2">so the idea of an affordance</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.200" end="01:03:46.559" style="s2">is that there are real relations and i</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.240" end="01:03:48.559" style="s2">keep</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.559" end="01:03:50.559" style="s2">emphasis there are real relations they</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.559" end="01:03:51.359" style="s2">they are just as real as the things</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.559" end="01:03:53.280" style="s2">related</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.359" end="01:03:54.720" style="s2">and those real relations are where</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.280" end="01:03:56.880" style="s2">important properties</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.720" end="01:03:58.319" style="s2">that are at the center of our ability to</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.880" end="01:03:59.039" style="s2">interact successfully with the</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.319" end="01:04:01.760" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.039" end="01:04:03.200" style="s2">are to be found i can interact with this</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.760" end="01:04:05.119" style="s2">because it&#39;s graspable</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.200" end="01:04:07.039" style="s2">the graspable is not in my hand or in</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.119" end="01:04:08.000" style="s2">the cup but in the real relationship</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.039" end="01:04:12.640" style="s2">between them</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.000" end="01:04:15.440" style="s2">i hope that answered the question</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.640" end="01:04:17.039" style="s2">well uh we&#39;ll uh we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.440" end="01:04:18.480" style="s2">what he says uh if he feels</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.039" end="01:04:20.160" style="s2">a successful answer but let&#39;s move to</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.480" end="01:04:22.880" style="s2">this question um</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.160" end="01:04:24.720" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to monitor the chat so i uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.880" end="01:04:25.119" style="s2">so i&#39;m hoping i&#39;m tuning in all the way</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.720" end="01:04:27.599" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.119" end="01:04:29.839" style="s2">um i i think it&#39;s it&#39;s such a deep</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.599" end="01:04:31.119" style="s2">concept affordances and it</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.839" end="01:04:32.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit different than we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.119" end="01:04:33.839" style="s2">thought than the way that a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.640" end="01:04:35.920" style="s2">people think but it</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.839" end="01:04:36.880" style="s2">it&#39;s so important once you grasp it to</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.920" end="01:04:40.000" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.880" end="01:04:43.280" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing um so vicky asks</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.000" end="01:04:44.960" style="s2">um when we know that the main practices</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.280" end="01:04:46.480" style="s2">in society are wrong</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.960" end="01:04:48.960" style="s2">like look at the use of plastic</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.480" end="01:04:51.520" style="s2">packaging how do we live in a society</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.960" end="01:04:55.200" style="s2">that there&#39;s so much stuff that is</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.520" end="01:04:58.400" style="s2">uh that&#39;s that&#39;s she says bad or wrong</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.200" end="01:05:01.920" style="s2">um with regards to meaning yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.400" end="01:05:04.640" style="s2">that that&#39;s i mean that takes me into uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.920" end="01:05:05.039" style="s2">a couple of things there&#39;s two aspects</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.640" end="01:05:08.160" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.039" end="01:05:08.400" style="s2">this is a deep question one is um around</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.160" end="01:05:12.400" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.400" end="01:05:14.880" style="s2">thing called modal confusion um</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.400" end="01:05:16.640" style="s2">and our cultural environment especially</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.880" end="01:05:19.119" style="s2">the packaging and promotion</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.640" end="01:05:21.280" style="s2">and commodifying of things tends to push</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.119" end="01:05:24.319" style="s2">modal confusion what&#39;s modal confusion</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.280" end="01:05:26.480" style="s2">uh the idea is remember i talked about</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.319" end="01:05:27.839" style="s2">that love is an existential mode</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.480" end="01:05:30.559" style="s2">and that there&#39;s the agent arena</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.839" end="01:05:33.039" style="s2">relationship that&#39;s an existential mode</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.559" end="01:05:34.720" style="s2">and so we have two existential modes</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.039" end="01:05:36.000" style="s2">according to eric from we have one</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.720" end="01:05:38.160" style="s2">that&#39;s organized around</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.000" end="01:05:40.079" style="s2">having needs these are needs that are</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.160" end="01:05:42.880" style="s2">met by controlling and consuming i need</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.079" end="01:05:42.880" style="s2">to have water</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.039" end="01:05:46.720" style="s2">and so what do i want to do well i i</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.119" end="01:05:48.799" style="s2">want to relate to things in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.720" end="01:05:50.480" style="s2">their categorical identity</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.799" end="01:05:52.079" style="s2">that water there or that water there and</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.480" end="01:05:53.440" style="s2">if i can&#39;t get that water that water is</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.079" end="01:05:56.319" style="s2">just as good as long as they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.440" end="01:05:57.599" style="s2">equally free from disease etc so i</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.319" end="01:05:59.520" style="s2">relate to things</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.599" end="01:06:01.920" style="s2">in terms of their categorical identity</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.520" end="01:06:03.839" style="s2">and how i can there by manipulate them</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.920" end="01:06:04.799" style="s2">in order to satisfy my having needs and</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.839" end="01:06:05.839" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing wrong with that if you</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.799" end="01:06:07.520" style="s2">don&#39;t do that you&#39;re dead</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.839" end="01:06:09.440" style="s2">the paramecium doesn&#39;t get its food it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.520" end="01:06:11.520" style="s2">dead but you&#39;re not just a paramecium</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.440" end="01:06:12.880" style="s2">you go the other way remember</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.520" end="01:06:14.799" style="s2">and so you have what are called being</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.880" end="01:06:18.400" style="s2">needs these are the needs that are met</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.799" end="01:06:21.280" style="s2">not by having something and consuming it</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.400" end="01:06:22.960" style="s2">or controlling it but by entering into</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.280" end="01:06:25.280" style="s2">right relationship with it</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.960" end="01:06:26.640" style="s2">so that you become something so that you</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.280" end="01:06:27.680" style="s2">go through a perspective and</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.640" end="01:06:31.119" style="s2">participatory</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.680" end="01:06:32.480" style="s2">transformation i need to become mature</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.119" end="01:06:34.240" style="s2">in order to become mature i have to</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.480" end="01:06:35.280" style="s2">enter into right relationships with</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.240" end="01:06:38.480" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.280" end="01:06:41.760" style="s2">and with myself and with the world</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.480" end="01:06:41.760" style="s2">i need to be in love</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.559" end="01:06:48.240" style="s2">now what happens for people and this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.240" end="01:06:50.799" style="s2">especially the case in our culture</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.240" end="01:06:53.119" style="s2">is we tend to try and satisfy our being</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.799" end="01:06:57.359" style="s2">needs within the having mode</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.119" end="01:07:00.480" style="s2">so in order to be mature i have a car</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.359" end="01:07:03.039" style="s2">in order to be in love i have sex</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.480" end="01:07:04.880" style="s2">or in order to be a friend i have lots</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.039" end="01:07:08.160" style="s2">of likes</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.880" end="01:07:10.880" style="s2">on social media and so that is</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.160" end="01:07:11.920" style="s2">and and the reason why that&#39;s prevalent</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.880" end="01:07:14.640" style="s2">in our culture is it</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.920" end="01:07:15.839" style="s2">the more of your needs i can get you to</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.640" end="01:07:17.440" style="s2">try and approach from the having mode</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.839" end="01:07:19.280" style="s2">the more i can sell you stuff</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.440" end="01:07:21.280" style="s2">and manipulate you and get you to adopt</p>

<p begin="01:07:21.280" end="01:07:25.280" style="s2">profound source</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.640" end="01:07:25.920" style="s2">of frustration in the project of meaning</p>

<p begin="01:07:58.480" end="01:08:02.400" style="s2">on the other side on the more sort of</p>

<p begin="01:08:06.000" end="01:08:09.760" style="s2">you know this is a more radical aspect</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.680" end="01:08:12.079" style="s2">of my thinking i suppose</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.760" end="01:08:13.200" style="s2">i&#39;m not sort of political i call myself</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.079" end="01:08:15.520" style="s2">metapolitical</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.200" end="01:08:16.799" style="s2">i talk about stealing the culture and</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.520" end="01:08:18.560" style="s2">what i mean by that</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.799" end="01:08:20.239" style="s2">and and i think you guys exemplify what</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.560" end="01:08:20.719" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about the model i have for</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.239" end="01:08:22.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.719" end="01:08:24.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t want the french revolution i</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.560" end="01:08:27.120" style="s2">want the axial revolution</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.480" end="01:08:27.520" style="s2">right and what do i i want what happened</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.120" end="01:08:30.239" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.520" end="01:08:31.520" style="s2">in think about and i&#39;m not advocating</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.239" end="01:08:33.120" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.520" end="01:08:34.799" style="s2">christianity but think about what</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.120" end="01:08:36.560" style="s2">christianity does you have small</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.799" end="01:08:37.839" style="s2">communities of practice</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.560" end="01:08:39.839" style="s2">in which people are remembering the</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.839" end="01:08:41.440" style="s2">being mode and practicing agape</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.839" end="01:08:42.880" style="s2">and moving and singing and doing all</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.440" end="01:08:44.880" style="s2">this kind of stuff together</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.880" end="01:08:46.239" style="s2">and they&#39;re not trying to topple the</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.880" end="01:08:47.679" style="s2">state because they can&#39;t it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.239" end="01:08:49.759" style="s2">powerful it&#39;s too overwhelming</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.679" end="01:08:52.719" style="s2">but what do they do they build from the</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.759" end="01:08:53.920" style="s2">bottom up a new culture a new way of</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.719" end="01:08:56.000" style="s2">seeing and being</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.920" end="01:08:57.199" style="s2">and it permeates up and then the whole</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.000" end="01:09:00.480" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.199" end="01:09:01.679" style="s2">is eventually transformed they stole the</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.480" end="01:09:04.640" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.679" end="01:09:06.000" style="s2">from the roman empire and i think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.640" end="01:09:08.239" style="s2">happening now</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.000" end="01:09:09.520" style="s2">has that potential and i think we need</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.239" end="01:09:13.279" style="s2">to do that</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.520" end="01:09:15.199" style="s2">right now and so i think</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.279" end="01:09:17.359" style="s2">what you guys are doing in these</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.199" end="01:09:20.640" style="s2">communities are addressing both of those</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.359" end="01:09:24.080" style="s2">you&#39;re meeting together and regularly</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.640" end="01:09:26.719" style="s2">and reliably remembering the being mode</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.080" end="01:09:27.120" style="s2">and entering into agape and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.719" end="01:09:29.359" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.120" end="01:09:31.279" style="s2">sowing the seeds for a new culture what</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.359" end="01:09:32.880" style="s2">what stephen batcher calls a culture of</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.279" end="01:09:34.960" style="s2">awakening</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.880" end="01:09:36.640" style="s2">that can steal the culture from the</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.960" end="01:09:40.080" style="s2">people who have rendered it so</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.640" end="01:09:43.199" style="s2">toxic for human life</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.080" end="01:09:45.040" style="s2">it&#39;s beautiful john i i wanted to to</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.199" end="01:09:46.319" style="s2">just amplify and pick up on a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.040" end="01:09:48.239" style="s2">themes in that</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.319" end="01:09:50.799" style="s2">um there was a question in the group</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.239" end="01:09:54.239" style="s2">that i had about</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.799" end="01:09:58.159" style="s2">how how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.239" end="01:10:01.360" style="s2">be be in this when other people</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.159" end="01:10:03.360" style="s2">aren&#39;t seeing it yet and that played</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.360" end="01:10:04.719" style="s2">into a question that we had had</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.360" end="01:10:07.440" style="s2">uh in the previous conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.719" end="01:10:10.239" style="s2">sebastian fukan about</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.440" end="01:10:11.760" style="s2">the role you know the difficulty of</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.239" end="01:10:12.480" style="s2">feeling like you have this beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.760" end="01:10:14.719" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.480" end="01:10:17.120" style="s2">and that people could be transformed by</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.719" end="01:10:18.640" style="s2">it but people don&#39;t see it or are afraid</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.120" end="01:10:20.719" style="s2">or can&#39;t do it yet and that you have to</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.640" end="01:10:23.280" style="s2">have the patience</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.719" end="01:10:24.719" style="s2">to know that if you keep doing the thing</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.280" end="01:10:26.400" style="s2">that there will be people who find</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.719" end="01:10:28.080" style="s2">inspiration from it and it may not be</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.400" end="01:10:31.280" style="s2">here in this moment</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.080" end="01:10:34.320" style="s2">but just keep keep stealing the culture</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.280" end="01:10:37.840" style="s2">and and i i give the example of of agape</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.320" end="01:10:40.239" style="s2">right and um this is something that i</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.840" end="01:10:42.159" style="s2">that i learned from you but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.239" end="01:10:43.040" style="s2">those three words right eros is the word</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.159" end="01:10:45.040" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.040" end="01:10:46.159" style="s2">you we the the love that wants to</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.040" end="01:10:48.880" style="s2">consume</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.159" end="01:10:51.280" style="s2">philly is the love secret reciprocation</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.880" end="01:10:53.360" style="s2">and agape is the love that</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.280" end="01:10:54.320" style="s2">that helps something come into being</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.360" end="01:10:58.800" style="s2">that is given</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.320" end="01:11:00.560" style="s2">before it is earned and and you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.800" end="01:11:02.239" style="s2">i&#39;m not committed to the metaphysics or</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.560" end="01:11:04.719" style="s2">the are supernatural of</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.239" end="01:11:05.679" style="s2">of of uh of christianity any more than</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.719" end="01:11:08.400" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.679" end="01:11:11.199" style="s2">um but i think when when jesus says love</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.400" end="01:11:12.560" style="s2">thy neighbor and he uses that term</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.199" end="01:11:14.320" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the answer to this</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.560" end="01:11:16.640" style="s2">question right like</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.320" end="01:11:18.080" style="s2">you have to see the world around you and</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.640" end="01:11:20.159" style="s2">all those people who are doing things</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.080" end="01:11:22.320" style="s2">that might not be toxic</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.159" end="01:11:24.400" style="s2">as people who have that potential to</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.320" end="01:11:26.719" style="s2">bring good into being</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.400" end="01:11:28.080" style="s2">yeah you can behave from that place</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.719" end="01:11:28.719" style="s2">that&#39;s ultimately what steals the</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.080" end="01:11:31.040" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.719" end="01:11:33.360" style="s2">would you agree with that i would and i</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.040" end="01:11:36.400" style="s2">mean you&#39;re picking up on saint paul</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.360" end="01:11:38.080" style="s2">also um you know what he said be in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.400" end="01:11:39.520" style="s2">world but not of the world</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.080" end="01:11:40.880" style="s2">again like you i&#39;m not advocating</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.520" end="01:11:42.239" style="s2">christianity i&#39;m not committed to its</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.880" end="01:11:45.600" style="s2">metaphysics or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.239" end="01:11:47.120" style="s2">it&#39;s supernatural um claims but the idea</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.600" end="01:11:50.640" style="s2">that we can be in the world</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.120" end="01:11:52.880" style="s2">um but not being of the world which is</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.640" end="01:11:54.400" style="s2">and this in this in this converges with</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.880" end="01:11:58.800" style="s2">stoicism</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.400" end="01:12:02.320" style="s2">that we ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.800" end="01:12:03.600" style="s2">have a lot more i mean epictetus begins</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.320" end="01:12:05.760" style="s2">his manual for living</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.600" end="01:12:06.719" style="s2">notice the title of the work the great</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.760" end="01:12:09.040" style="s2">epithelia</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.719" end="01:12:10.800" style="s2">the great uh philosopher he said you</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.040" end="01:12:12.239" style="s2">know the core of wisdom is to</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.800" end="01:12:14.400" style="s2">be able to discern what&#39;s in your</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.239" end="01:12:16.400" style="s2">control and what&#39;s not in your control</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.400" end="01:12:17.760" style="s2">and what we do is we regularly think and</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.400" end="01:12:18.800" style="s2">try to have more of the world in our</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.760" end="01:12:20.880" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.800" end="01:12:22.320" style="s2">and not pay very much attention to the</p>

<p begin="01:12:22.320" end="01:12:28.400" style="s2">when when when what is actually the case</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.679" end="01:12:29.920" style="s2">is that the invert the inverse is true</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.400" end="01:12:31.360" style="s2">we actually have a lot more control over</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.920" end="01:12:33.040" style="s2">the meaning making machinery</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.360" end="01:12:35.199" style="s2">and a lot less control over the world</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.040" end="01:12:36.960" style="s2">than we&#39;d like to believe that we have</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.199" end="01:12:38.960" style="s2">and to live that way is to live in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.960" end="01:12:44.560" style="s2">world but not of the world</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.960" end="01:12:44.560" style="s2">right so if i if i am more and more</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.960" end="01:12:49.840" style="s2">what what&#39;s centered in</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.000" end="01:12:51.280" style="s2">the meaning making machinery which is</p>

<p begin="01:12:51.280" end="01:12:54.560" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t mean sitting passively</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.360" end="01:12:56.000" style="s2">it means doing all the stuff we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:12:56.000" end="01:13:03.280" style="s2">right then i can be in the world</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.080" end="01:13:06.480" style="s2">but i don&#39;t have to be overwhelmed</p>

<p begin="01:13:09.600" end="01:13:13.679" style="s2">caused by the world but by the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.320" end="01:13:14.159" style="s2">of events in the world now some of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.679" end="01:13:16.080" style="s2">caused</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.159" end="01:13:17.679" style="s2">literally by the world object hits me in</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.080" end="01:13:20.640" style="s2">the head i&#39;m dead</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.679" end="01:13:21.280" style="s2">but a lot of my distress is actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.640" end="01:13:23.920" style="s2">caused</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.280" end="01:13:24.960" style="s2">by the meaning of events as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.920" end="01:13:27.600" style="s2">the events themselves</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.960" end="01:13:30.400" style="s2">so i can live in the world of events but</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.600" end="01:13:33.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t have to be of that world</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.400" end="01:13:35.440" style="s2">was the epic tetus who said um</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.920" end="01:13:37.760" style="s2">you cannot control what happens to you</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.440" end="01:13:40.239" style="s2">you can only control how you respond</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.760" end="01:13:41.679" style="s2">basically yes that&#39;s exactly it</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.239" end="01:13:44.840" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.679" end="01:13:47.920" style="s2">um slightly different tech</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.840" end="01:13:49.360" style="s2">uh i feel like we could go on quite a</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.920" end="01:13:50.239" style="s2">quite a long ways with that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.360" end="01:13:51.920" style="s2">such a</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.239" end="01:13:53.520" style="s2">deep a deep line of conversation if</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.920" end="01:13:54.480" style="s2">people just can i say one more thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.520" end="01:13:56.480" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.480" end="01:13:58.800" style="s2">i want to be clear that i want i want</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.480" end="01:14:00.080" style="s2">people to put those two things together</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.800" end="01:14:01.440" style="s2">right i don&#39;t i don&#39;t want them to</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.080" end="01:14:02.320" style="s2">forget the first point in the second</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.440" end="01:14:04.800" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.320" end="01:14:06.560" style="s2">right so i&#39;m not i&#39;m not i mean one</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.800" end="01:14:07.040" style="s2">mistake you can get into with what the</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.560" end="01:14:09.040" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.040" end="01:14:10.239" style="s2">that aspect of christianity and stoicism</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.040" end="01:14:12.640" style="s2">is you can get into sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.239" end="01:14:15.280" style="s2">contentedness with the status quo</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.640" end="01:14:16.719" style="s2">right um and that&#39;s not i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.280" end="01:14:17.520" style="s2">advocating that i want to steal the</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.719" end="01:14:18.880" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.520" end="01:14:20.960" style="s2">but what i&#39;m saying is one of the ways</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.880" end="01:14:23.040" style="s2">of stealing the culture is to not</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.960" end="01:14:24.719" style="s2">confuse</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.040" end="01:14:26.840" style="s2">the events with the meaning that the</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.719" end="01:14:28.719" style="s2">culture is trying to assign to those</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.840" end="01:14:30.239" style="s2">events</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.719" end="01:14:33.120" style="s2">for some reason what pops into my head</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.239" end="01:14:34.000" style="s2">right there is the that paradoxical</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.120" end="01:14:36.480" style="s2">thing in the uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.000" end="01:14:38.400" style="s2">and in the daodejing the sage does</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.480" end="01:14:41.760" style="s2">nothing but nothing is left undone</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.400" end="01:14:44.320" style="s2">yes exactly yeah that&#39;s exactly it</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.760" end="01:14:45.360" style="s2">so charles asks what do you think is a</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.320" end="01:14:47.040" style="s2">better approach</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.360" end="01:14:49.360" style="s2">a top-down approach where you choose an</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.040" end="01:14:50.960" style="s2">ecology of practices and then begin them</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.360" end="01:14:54.320" style="s2">or just start doing things and</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.960" end="01:14:55.679" style="s2">organically craft your own practice</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.320" end="01:14:57.360" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to give you a frustrating</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.679" end="01:14:59.040" style="s2">answer charles but it&#39;s the answer that</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.360" end="01:14:59.600" style="s2">comes out of everything i i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.040" end="01:15:02.000" style="s2">arguing</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.600" end="01:15:02.719" style="s2">you need to be doing both simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.000" end="01:15:04.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.719" end="01:15:06.400" style="s2">just like when you&#39;re reading you need</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.880" end="01:15:08.400" style="s2">to be looking at the whole word</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.400" end="01:15:10.320" style="s2">to disambiguate the letters and you need</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.400" end="01:15:11.440" style="s2">to be looking reading the letters in</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.320" end="01:15:12.320" style="s2">order to be able to figure out what the</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.440" end="01:15:13.679" style="s2">whole word is</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.320" end="01:15:15.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s what happens in reading</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.679" end="01:15:16.880" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly moving top down and</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.440" end="01:15:18.640" style="s2">bottom up at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.880" end="01:15:20.000" style="s2">in fact you&#39;re doing it now in fact</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.640" end="01:15:22.400" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it all the time</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.000" end="01:15:23.679" style="s2">and so i would recommend and i know</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.400" end="01:15:24.080" style="s2">you&#39;re going to say well that&#39;s so hard</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.679" end="01:15:27.199" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.080" end="01:15:28.640" style="s2">yeah it is but if you&#39;re asking me in</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.199" end="01:15:29.920" style="s2">terms of speaking as a cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.640" end="01:15:31.280" style="s2">scientist what&#39;s the optimal way of</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.920" end="01:15:32.880" style="s2">trying to get one going</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.280" end="01:15:34.320" style="s2">i think you need to do both you need to</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.880" end="01:15:37.520" style="s2">be doing</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.320" end="01:15:38.640" style="s2">uh some top-down organization so</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.520" end="01:15:40.080" style="s2">what are some of the top-down</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.640" end="01:15:40.719" style="s2">organizational features you should be</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.080" end="01:15:43.360" style="s2">looking for</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.719" end="01:15:44.800" style="s2">in an ecology of practice you should be</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.360" end="01:15:46.159" style="s2">looking for relationships of</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.800" end="01:15:48.719" style="s2">complementarity</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.159" end="01:15:50.320" style="s2">how various practices have complementary</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.719" end="01:15:52.480" style="s2">sets of strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.320" end="01:15:54.000" style="s2">and you should seek to put them in into</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.480" end="01:15:56.320" style="s2">relationship with each other</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.000" end="01:15:57.040" style="s2">so that they self-correct each other uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.320" end="01:15:59.440" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.040" end="01:16:00.560" style="s2">uh you know meditation tends to take you</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.440" end="01:16:03.040" style="s2">inward</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.560" end="01:16:04.640" style="s2">uh contemplation takes to take tends to</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.040" end="01:16:06.560" style="s2">take you outward and you need to have</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.640" end="01:16:08.000" style="s2">both of them because they act as checks</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.560" end="01:16:10.080" style="s2">and balances on yourself</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.000" end="01:16:11.920" style="s2">suited practice needs to be put into a</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.080" end="01:16:12.640" style="s2">complementary relationship with moving</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.920" end="01:16:13.840" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.640" end="01:16:16.320" style="s2">so you need relationships of</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.840" end="01:16:18.640" style="s2">complementarity you also need</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.320" end="01:16:20.640" style="s2">you need relationships of linking you</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.640" end="01:16:21.840" style="s2">need practices that move you between the</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.640" end="01:16:24.080" style="s2">kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.840" end="01:16:25.280" style="s2">the way like the way chanting takes you</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.080" end="01:16:27.679" style="s2">from propositional</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.280" end="01:16:30.000" style="s2">into perspectival and participatory or</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.679" end="01:16:33.520" style="s2">lectio divina does the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.000" end="01:16:34.560" style="s2">and you also need uh you need principles</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.520" end="01:16:36.960" style="s2">of layering</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.560" end="01:16:39.760" style="s2">various practices layer on top of each</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.960" end="01:16:42.320" style="s2">other if you do enough mata practice</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.760" end="01:16:44.000" style="s2">and enough the pasta practice you can</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.320" end="01:16:44.640" style="s2">then move into what&#39;s called a prajna</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.000" end="01:16:48.000" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.640" end="01:16:50.159" style="s2">a form of of mindfulness that moves</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.000" end="01:16:51.520" style="s2">both in both directions at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.159" end="01:16:53.679" style="s2">and realizes what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.520" end="01:16:56.000" style="s2">non-duality so there are top-down</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.679" end="01:16:57.920" style="s2">principles for how you want to create</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.000" end="01:16:59.679" style="s2">your ecology of practice but you also</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.920" end="01:17:02.560" style="s2">need to do an auto bottom-up</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.679" end="01:17:03.360" style="s2">participatory observation because you</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.560" end="01:17:06.560" style="s2">aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.360" end="01:17:08.480" style="s2">i you we are not aware of most of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.560" end="01:17:10.159" style="s2">relevance realization machinery and we</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.480" end="01:17:11.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.159" end="01:17:13.440" style="s2">you know be particularly i don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.920" end="01:17:13.840" style="s2">with your sort of initial impressions</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.440" end="01:17:15.600" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.840" end="01:17:17.600" style="s2">our initial impressions are usually off</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.600" end="01:17:19.760" style="s2">i mean really deep participatory</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.600" end="01:17:21.520" style="s2">observation because you need to find</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.760" end="01:17:24.880" style="s2">those practices that gel</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.520" end="01:17:26.320" style="s2">with your own idiosyncratic background</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.880" end="01:17:29.120" style="s2">and development</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.320" end="01:17:30.239" style="s2">so you need both the top down principles</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.120" end="01:17:32.239" style="s2">of organization</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.239" end="01:17:35.280" style="s2">but you need the bottom-up participation</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.239" end="01:17:35.280" style="s2">in many different things</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.520" end="01:17:38.480" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting john because one of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.600" end="01:17:39.280" style="s2">things that&#39;s come up in our</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.480" end="01:17:42.320" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.280" end="01:17:44.640" style="s2">is how in many ways uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.320" end="01:17:46.880" style="s2">what evolved move play has it evolved</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.640" end="01:17:48.480" style="s2">into from kind of the seed of parkour</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.880" end="01:17:51.840" style="s2">and time in nature</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.480" end="01:17:54.320" style="s2">uh is so reflective of the top down</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.840" end="01:17:55.920" style="s2">vision of what an ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.320" end="01:17:58.320" style="s2">can be that you&#39;re proposing</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.920" end="01:17:59.280" style="s2">right i agree with that wholeheartedly i</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.320" end="01:18:02.400" style="s2">think i mean</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.280" end="01:18:05.199" style="s2">i often use your community practice</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.400" end="01:18:06.640" style="s2">as as an exemplary case of the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.199" end="01:18:08.719" style="s2">thing i&#39;m talking about when i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.640" end="01:18:11.920" style="s2">about an ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.719" end="01:18:12.480" style="s2">that is directed i think in a powerful</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.920" end="01:18:14.159" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.480" end="01:18:15.600" style="s2">to help people awaken from the meeting</p>

<p begin="01:18:15.600" end="01:18:21.040" style="s2">thank you um so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.199" end="01:18:24.800" style="s2">questions about the flow state</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.040" end="01:18:26.320" style="s2">right so what i i&#39;m going to throw i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.800" end="01:18:27.840" style="s2">going to throw a few at you and see</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.320" end="01:18:29.760" style="s2">what you feel like you want to because</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.840" end="01:18:31.199" style="s2">it&#39;s time&#39;s running light and i i just</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.760" end="01:18:32.800" style="s2">want to see you know it&#39;s all about flow</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.199" end="01:18:33.840" style="s2">so i want to see what what about flow</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.800" end="01:18:35.520" style="s2">you&#39;re most</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.840" end="01:18:37.600" style="s2">interested in sharing so one asks what</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.520" end="01:18:41.840" style="s2">is the role of intuition and flow</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.600" end="01:18:41.840" style="s2">another yep</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.320" end="01:18:48.880" style="s2">what is the role of introspection to</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.800" end="01:18:51.040" style="s2">find meaning after flow since you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.880" end="01:18:54.880" style="s2">aware of it necessarily within it</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.040" end="01:18:57.920" style="s2">um and what about</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.880" end="01:18:59.280" style="s2">the the aspect of being kind of and</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.920" end="01:19:00.480" style="s2">another question has to do with the</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.280" end="01:19:02.719" style="s2">aspect of</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.480" end="01:19:04.080" style="s2">of being in an individual flow state and</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.719" end="01:19:05.840" style="s2">how that</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.080" end="01:19:07.360" style="s2">impacts the community how that can be</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.840" end="01:19:08.800" style="s2">integrated in the community so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.360" end="01:19:10.400" style="s2">know if you can weave these together</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.800" end="01:19:10.719" style="s2">into an answer that&#39;s very satisfying</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.400" end="01:19:12.239" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.719" end="01:19:13.840" style="s2">i can leave the first and the third and</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.239" end="01:19:16.000" style="s2">i&#39;ll try and come back</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.840" end="01:19:17.360" style="s2">maybe therefore to the second after</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.000" end="01:19:20.320" style="s2">doing the first and the third</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.360" end="01:19:22.320" style="s2">okay so i talk a lot uh leo and erin and</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.320" end="01:19:24.480" style="s2">i talk a lot about intuition</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.320" end="01:19:25.440" style="s2">in the article on flow in fact we</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.480" end="01:19:28.560" style="s2">propose that</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.440" end="01:19:29.360" style="s2">the mechanisms of flow are an insight</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.560" end="01:19:30.800" style="s2">cascade</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.360" end="01:19:32.719" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like you&#39;re having a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.800" end="01:19:33.600" style="s2">of aha moments that are chaining each</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.719" end="01:19:36.560" style="s2">other together</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.600" end="01:19:38.320" style="s2">and affording each other but also um</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.560" end="01:19:39.920" style="s2">you&#39;re getting enhanced intuition</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.320" end="01:19:43.120" style="s2">now in order to answer that i have to</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.920" end="01:19:45.679" style="s2">quickly talk about what intuition is</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.120" end="01:19:47.040" style="s2">um because we need to take it out of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.679" end="01:19:48.560" style="s2">clutches uh well the</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.040" end="01:19:50.719" style="s2">the decaying clutches of decadent</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.560" end="01:19:52.400" style="s2">romantics because intuition isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.719" end="01:19:55.679" style="s2">magical power you have</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.400" end="01:19:57.600" style="s2">um that will you you should not try to</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.679" end="01:19:58.400" style="s2">deify or demonize any one of your</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.600" end="01:20:00.640" style="s2">faculties</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.400" end="01:20:02.400" style="s2">none of them is safe from self-deceptive</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.640" end="01:20:06.000" style="s2">self-destructive behavior</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.400" end="01:20:08.400" style="s2">um what is intuition well</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.000" end="01:20:10.800" style="s2">um intuition is the result of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.400" end="01:20:13.280" style="s2">called implicit learning</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.800" end="01:20:14.560" style="s2">so implicit learning is the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.280" end="01:20:17.280" style="s2">you can pick up</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.560" end="01:20:18.080" style="s2">on complex even dynamically complex</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.280" end="01:20:20.719" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.080" end="01:20:22.639" style="s2">in your environment uh and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.719" end="01:20:23.600" style="s2">doing is largely bypassing working</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.639" end="01:20:25.120" style="s2">memory</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.600" end="01:20:26.960" style="s2">you&#39;re largely bypassing sort of an</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.120" end="01:20:29.760" style="s2">explicit awareness of</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.960" end="01:20:31.280" style="s2">picking up on these patterns and when</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.760" end="01:20:32.320" style="s2">that goes well you have intuition and</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.280" end="01:20:35.440" style="s2">when it goes badly</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.320" end="01:20:38.239" style="s2">you call it prejudice or bias</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.440" end="01:20:39.199" style="s2">so you have to be careful about leaping</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.239" end="01:20:41.280" style="s2">to conclusions about</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.199" end="01:20:42.960" style="s2">how this process is always good it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.280" end="01:20:44.560" style="s2">it can it can go bad</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.960" end="01:20:46.480" style="s2">which means it needs to be properly</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.560" end="01:20:47.920" style="s2">educated it needs to be properly</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.480" end="01:20:49.360" style="s2">educated now we can</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.920" end="01:20:50.560" style="s2">we know how to experimentally study</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.360" end="01:20:52.080" style="s2">implicit learning we&#39;ve been doing it</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.560" end="01:20:55.120" style="s2">for quite a long time</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.080" end="01:20:56.639" style="s2">um it&#39;s really interesting by the way um</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.120" end="01:20:58.880" style="s2">sort of concrete examples of this if</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.639" end="01:21:00.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve got if you ask people to make a</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.880" end="01:21:02.080" style="s2">decision um</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.480" end="01:21:03.679" style="s2">and there&#39;s only a couple of relevant</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.080" end="01:21:05.120" style="s2">variables then they should think about</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.679" end="01:21:06.639" style="s2">it very explicitly</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.120" end="01:21:08.000" style="s2">but if you ask them to make a decision</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.639" end="01:21:09.679" style="s2">that involves a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.000" end="01:21:13.120" style="s2">dynamically integrated</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.679" end="01:21:14.000" style="s2">um variables their intuitive judgment</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.120" end="01:21:15.520" style="s2">will often work</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.000" end="01:21:18.000" style="s2">better except when it goes wrong and</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.520" end="01:21:22.560" style="s2">then it goes disastrously wrong</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.000" end="01:21:25.120" style="s2">so you can pick up on complex patterns</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.560" end="01:21:26.000" style="s2">and that gives you what happens in</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.120" end="01:21:29.120" style="s2">intuition</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.000" end="01:21:32.320" style="s2">you often know things without knowing</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.120" end="01:21:34.880" style="s2">or remembering how you came to know them</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.320" end="01:21:36.480" style="s2">that&#39;s what intuition is and you do you</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.880" end="01:21:39.840" style="s2">do that you do this all the time</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.480" end="01:21:41.199" style="s2">and and you do it often only in even a</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.840" end="01:21:43.120" style="s2">semi-conscious manner</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.199" end="01:21:45.360" style="s2">you will adjust how far you stand from</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.120" end="01:21:48.080" style="s2">somebody given their status</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.360" end="01:21:48.719" style="s2">your status and the social context with</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.080" end="01:21:51.199" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.719" end="01:21:52.560" style="s2">that you&#39;re in how close you stand to</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.199" end="01:21:54.639" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.560" end="01:21:55.920" style="s2">just move you just do that and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.639" end="01:21:57.440" style="s2">know and you won&#39;t be aware of this</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.920" end="01:21:59.120" style="s2">until you go to another culture</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.440" end="01:22:00.960" style="s2">and you&#39;ll be standing the inappropriate</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.120" end="01:22:02.800" style="s2">distance from people</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.960" end="01:22:04.880" style="s2">but what you&#39;ve done is you&#39;ve picked up</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.800" end="01:22:06.159" style="s2">on that complex set of variables</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.880" end="01:22:07.920" style="s2">through implicit learning and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.159" end="01:22:09.840" style="s2">giving you your intuition now the</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.920" end="01:22:10.960" style="s2">problem as i said with intuition is it</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.840" end="01:22:15.679" style="s2">can go disastrous</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.960" end="01:22:17.440" style="s2">disastrously wrong it can pick up on</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.679" end="01:22:19.679" style="s2">what it does is it picks up on all kinds</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.440" end="01:22:22.000" style="s2">of patterns</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.679" end="01:22:22.880" style="s2">and so it doesn&#39;t distinguish and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.000" end="01:22:24.880" style="s2">the crucial</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.880" end="01:22:26.719" style="s2">this is where the power and peril of</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.880" end="01:22:28.320" style="s2">intuition comes to a crux</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.719" end="01:22:30.000" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t distinguish between</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.320" end="01:22:32.239" style="s2">correlational patterns and causal</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.000" end="01:22:33.760" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.239" end="01:22:35.199" style="s2">you know what correlational patterns are</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.760" end="01:22:37.040" style="s2">things are often correlated but there</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.199" end="01:22:40.080" style="s2">isn&#39;t any causal relationship</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.040" end="01:22:41.120" style="s2">between them right so</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.080" end="01:22:42.800" style="s2">you know i was brought up a</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.120" end="01:22:44.239" style="s2">fundamentalist christian and they would</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.800" end="01:22:45.840" style="s2">often say you know they took prayer to</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.239" end="01:22:46.719" style="s2">the schools and crime went up it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.840" end="01:22:48.880" style="s2">by the way but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.719" end="01:22:50.320" style="s2">that&#39;s irrelevant because here&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.880" end="01:22:52.320" style="s2">correlation</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.320" end="01:22:54.719" style="s2">greenhouse gas emissions have gone up as</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.320" end="01:22:56.320" style="s2">caribbean piracy has gone down</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.719" end="01:22:57.760" style="s2">so what does that mean we should bring</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.320" end="01:22:59.520" style="s2">back caribbean piracy</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.760" end="01:23:01.120" style="s2">that will deal with the the climate</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.520" end="01:23:02.560" style="s2">change of course that&#39;s ridiculous</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.120" end="01:23:04.320" style="s2">because that&#39;s a correlational pattern</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.560" end="01:23:06.159" style="s2">it&#39;s not a causal pattern and there are</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.320" end="01:23:07.199" style="s2">way more correlational patterns than</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.159" end="01:23:11.520" style="s2">causal patterns</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.199" end="01:23:13.360" style="s2">that is why we do science</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.520" end="01:23:15.679" style="s2">science is the project of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.360" end="01:23:18.000" style="s2">distinguish the causal patterns</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.679" end="01:23:19.760" style="s2">from all the correlational patterns and</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.000" end="01:23:22.719" style="s2">when you just do intuition</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.760" end="01:23:24.800" style="s2">you pick up on all of them without any</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.719" end="01:23:27.440" style="s2">good discernment</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.800" end="01:23:27.840" style="s2">so what you want to do is you want to</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.440" end="01:23:29.920" style="s2">try and</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.840" end="01:23:31.040" style="s2">set up the condition conditions for</p>

<p begin="01:23:31.040" end="01:23:34.080" style="s2">so they&#39;re like the conditions of</p>

<p begin="01:24:13.440" end="01:24:17.040" style="s2">flow is also a place not only where</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.159" end="01:24:18.880" style="s2">you&#39;re getting</p>

<p begin="01:24:18.880" end="01:24:23.600" style="s2">and you&#39;re getting all kinds of insight</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.199" end="01:24:25.679" style="s2">you&#39;re also getting enhanced implicit</p>

<p begin="01:24:25.679" end="01:24:29.600" style="s2">on the causal patterns</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.120" end="01:24:31.280" style="s2">now flow can be hijacked like everything</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.600" end="01:24:33.679" style="s2">else that&#39;s adapted it could be hijacked</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.280" end="01:24:35.920" style="s2">by video games</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.679" end="01:24:36.800" style="s2">but flow evolved why you find flow so</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.920" end="01:24:38.800" style="s2">rewarding</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.800" end="01:24:40.800" style="s2">is because it&#39;s enhancing your insight</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.800" end="01:24:41.920" style="s2">capacity and it&#39;s enhancing your</p>

<p begin="01:24:41.920" end="01:24:47.440" style="s2">for intuition good implicit learning</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.199" end="01:24:49.600" style="s2">implicit learning that is tending to</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.440" end="01:24:51.280" style="s2">zero in on the causal patterns</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.600" end="01:24:52.639" style="s2">rather than the correlational patterns</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.280" end="01:24:53.840" style="s2">and here&#39;s the thing they mutually</p>

<p begin="01:24:53.840" end="01:24:56.880" style="s2">because another thing that your implicit</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.520" end="01:24:59.920" style="s2">learning doesn&#39;t do is</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.880" end="01:25:02.320" style="s2">it only attaches to actual patterns it</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.920" end="01:25:04.639" style="s2">doesn&#39;t explore possible new ones</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.320" end="01:25:05.600" style="s2">but if you attach insight to good</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.639" end="01:25:07.600" style="s2">intuition</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.600" end="01:25:09.360" style="s2">the implicit learning is also exploring</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.600" end="01:25:10.080" style="s2">the new possibilities created by the</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.360" end="01:25:12.480" style="s2">insight</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.080" end="01:25:13.520" style="s2">so if you take the insight cascade of</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.480" end="01:25:15.679" style="s2">flow</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.520" end="01:25:17.199" style="s2">and the good intuition of flow and put</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.679" end="01:25:20.159" style="s2">them together you get this</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.199" end="01:25:22.000" style="s2">optimal state which is why flow is a</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.159" end="01:25:22.719" style="s2">state of optimal experience and optimal</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.000" end="01:25:24.880" style="s2">performance</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.719" end="01:25:27.840" style="s2">that is the central role of intuition</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.880" end="01:25:29.440" style="s2">within flow</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.840" end="01:25:31.520" style="s2">what does that have to do with</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.440" end="01:25:34.560" style="s2">individual and collective</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.520" end="01:25:36.159" style="s2">so i am engaged in a long project of</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.560" end="01:25:38.560" style="s2">participatory observation</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.159" end="01:25:40.320" style="s2">and i&#39;m i&#39;m editing and writing for an</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.560" end="01:25:42.800" style="s2">anthology a book and doing</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.320" end="01:25:44.080" style="s2">a work and you know cognitive science</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.800" end="01:25:47.120" style="s2">trying to understand</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.080" end="01:25:48.159" style="s2">how we can get group flow states uh</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.120" end="01:25:51.120" style="s2">within</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.159" end="01:25:52.080" style="s2">dialogue process that i call dialogos</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.120" end="01:25:55.920" style="s2">and discourse</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.080" end="01:25:58.000" style="s2">because i think that is the only way</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.920" end="01:25:58.960" style="s2">remember i said there were four things</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.000" end="01:26:01.920" style="s2">about the</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.960" end="01:26:02.719" style="s2">cognitive the carbon science embodiment</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.920" end="01:26:04.560" style="s2">enacted</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.719" end="01:26:06.159" style="s2">embedded embedded i didn&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.560" end="01:26:06.880" style="s2">the last one extended but i will right</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.159" end="01:26:10.239" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.880" end="01:26:12.400" style="s2">extended is the idea that most of our</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.239" end="01:26:14.880" style="s2">problem solving</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.400" end="01:26:15.840" style="s2">most of our cognition is done and is</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.880" end="01:26:17.840" style="s2">done well</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.840" end="01:26:19.840" style="s2">when we are networked together with</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.840" end="01:26:22.159" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.840" end="01:26:23.679" style="s2">that way before the internet networked</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.159" end="01:26:25.360" style="s2">commute computers together</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.679" end="01:26:26.719" style="s2">to give us this emergent power of the</p>

<p begin="01:26:26.719" end="01:26:31.440" style="s2">network brains together through language</p>

<p begin="01:26:31.440" end="01:26:36.800" style="s2">to give us this enhanced capacity for</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.560" end="01:26:39.040" style="s2">problem solving most of our problem</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.800" end="01:26:39.760" style="s2">solving is done in concert with other</p>

<p begin="01:26:39.760" end="01:26:43.679" style="s2">this is not to say we should not engage</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.000" end="01:26:45.520" style="s2">in individual responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.679" end="01:26:48.080" style="s2">please that doesn&#39;t follow from what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.520" end="01:26:50.960" style="s2">saying but</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.080" end="01:26:52.880" style="s2">what i think we need to do is to tap</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.960" end="01:26:54.000" style="s2">into the collective intelligence that is</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.880" end="01:26:55.920" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.000" end="01:26:58.719" style="s2">in that networking what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.920" end="01:27:00.480" style="s2">distributed cognition extended cognition</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.719" end="01:27:02.000" style="s2">and learn how to get the flow state</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.480" end="01:27:04.320" style="s2">going there so we can</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.000" end="01:27:07.040" style="s2">ramp that collective intelligence up</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.320" end="01:27:09.840" style="s2">into collective wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.040" end="01:27:11.199" style="s2">because we need the collective wisdom so</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.840" end="01:27:14.159" style="s2">that we have</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.199" end="01:27:15.360" style="s2">a home and a school that gives us a</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.159" end="01:27:18.400" style="s2">place where we can</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.360" end="01:27:20.560" style="s2">get what we need in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.400" end="01:27:21.920" style="s2">information and transformation for how</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.560" end="01:27:25.040" style="s2">we curate</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.920" end="01:27:26.880" style="s2">and cultivate ecologies and practices so</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.040" end="01:27:28.560" style="s2">i think we need to really learn how to</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.880" end="01:27:31.840" style="s2">bring flow</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.560" end="01:27:33.520" style="s2">into distributed cognition and and</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.840" end="01:27:34.480" style="s2">direct it towards the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.520" end="01:27:36.480" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.480" end="01:27:38.639" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the answer to the first</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.480" end="01:27:40.000" style="s2">and the third</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.639" end="01:27:43.600" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to remember what the second</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.000" end="01:27:43.600" style="s2">one was right what was the second one</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.040" end="01:27:48.239" style="s2">uh that one that was i think ben&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.360" end="01:27:52.719" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.239" end="01:27:57.600" style="s2">uh so where was it</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.719" end="01:27:57.600" style="s2">um the role so</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.840" end="01:28:01.040" style="s2">once you enter the flow state you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.280" end="01:28:02.960" style="s2">worry about this retrospective</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.040" end="01:28:04.560" style="s2">yes once all that is said and done</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.960" end="01:28:06.239" style="s2">defined meaning wouldn&#39;t there also need</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.560" end="01:28:08.080" style="s2">to be a period of introspection as a</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.239" end="01:28:09.280" style="s2">retrospective afterwards</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.080" end="01:28:11.520" style="s2">yeah i wouldn&#39;t say so much</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.280" end="01:28:14.800" style="s2">introspection i would say a moment of</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.520" end="01:28:17.280" style="s2">reflection and so i think i i</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.800" end="01:28:19.040" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry if i misled you ben i i do not</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.280" end="01:28:21.040" style="s2">think that the flow state is</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.040" end="01:28:22.239" style="s2">the sole or exclusive practice we should</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.040" end="01:28:23.520" style="s2">be engaging in</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.239" end="01:28:25.920" style="s2">in order to respond to the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.520" end="01:28:28.000" style="s2">crisis i was using that as a particular</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.920" end="01:28:30.480" style="s2">as an exam as a particularly exemplary</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.000" end="01:28:33.120" style="s2">case i think we need to be doing lots of</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.480" end="01:28:34.639" style="s2">other practices other other wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.120" end="01:28:36.639" style="s2">conducive practices</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.639" end="01:28:38.560" style="s2">um and some of those are communal and</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.639" end="01:28:40.239" style="s2">some of them are extended across time</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.560" end="01:28:42.000" style="s2">and some of those involve training</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.239" end="01:28:44.800" style="s2">reflective training reflection</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.000" end="01:28:46.239" style="s2">and adjust the way you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.800" end="01:28:47.760" style="s2">so there are various kinds of journaling</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.239" end="01:28:49.760" style="s2">practices there are various kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.760" end="01:28:52.239" style="s2">biological practices with others</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.760" end="01:28:54.239" style="s2">that help you get into and help to</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.239" end="01:28:56.880" style="s2">enhance this reflective capacity</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.239" end="01:28:58.480" style="s2">so that you can situate those moments of</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.880" end="01:29:03.360" style="s2">enhanced connectivity that happen</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.480" end="01:29:06.719" style="s2">to you within a more expansive framework</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.360" end="01:29:08.480" style="s2">beautiful um</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.719" end="01:29:11.199" style="s2">let&#39;s see so there were some questions</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.480" end="01:29:15.120" style="s2">about intuition i i</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.199" end="01:29:16.239" style="s2">i would like to just put a pin in that</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.120" end="01:29:18.239" style="s2">really quickly because i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.239" end="01:29:18.880" style="s2">something that that&#39;s such a profound</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.239" end="01:29:20.960" style="s2">insight</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.880" end="01:29:22.159" style="s2">and that people really need to digest</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.960" end="01:29:25.440" style="s2">you said that that</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.159" end="01:29:26.239" style="s2">intuition can go wrong yes and i think</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.440" end="01:29:27.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.239" end="01:29:29.520" style="s2">that there is there&#39;s part of our</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.440" end="01:29:31.679" style="s2">culture that that really</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.520" end="01:29:33.360" style="s2">has fallen in love with intuition in</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.679" end="01:29:35.760" style="s2">some sense because we&#39;ve seen the</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.360" end="01:29:38.719" style="s2">limitations of reason as a system</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.760" end="01:29:41.040" style="s2">yes um and so perhaps the answer to if</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.719" end="01:29:43.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not reason then it&#39;s intuition but</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.040" end="01:29:44.239" style="s2">actually both share the same dangers and</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.440" end="01:29:47.360" style="s2">what people</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.239" end="01:29:48.400" style="s2">seem to realize is that that the dark</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.360" end="01:29:51.600" style="s2">side of intuition</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.400" end="01:29:53.120" style="s2">is stereotypes and yes yes</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.600" end="01:29:54.719" style="s2">and those are actually the same system</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.120" end="01:29:57.360" style="s2">in the brain and i and</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.719" end="01:29:59.199" style="s2">people who talk about implicit bias will</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.360" end="01:30:02.239" style="s2">say that intuition is everything</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.199" end="01:30:04.719" style="s2">and those two things are are are inca</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.239" end="01:30:06.080" style="s2">commensurate so i just wanted to really</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.719" end="01:30:06.560" style="s2">put a pin in that for people because i</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.080" end="01:30:08.320" style="s2">think it</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.560" end="01:30:09.760" style="s2">it&#39;s very powerful and it&#39;s really at</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.320" end="01:30:12.880" style="s2">the heart of your inside of</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.760" end="01:30:14.239" style="s2">how we have to build these systems that</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.880" end="01:30:17.760" style="s2">allow us to</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.239" end="01:30:20.000" style="s2">reciprocally use reason and intuition</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.760" end="01:30:21.280" style="s2">such that they work better over time</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.000" end="01:30:23.679" style="s2">that&#39;s what i meant about those</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.280" end="01:30:24.800" style="s2">relationships of complementarity between</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.679" end="01:30:28.400" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.800" end="01:30:30.000" style="s2">and those relationships of linking</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.400" end="01:30:31.520" style="s2">and layering all of that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.000" end="01:30:33.600" style="s2">done to get that massive</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.520" end="01:30:35.520" style="s2">kind of recursive self-correction so</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.600" end="01:30:38.080" style="s2">that we can optimize the whole</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.520" end="01:30:40.400" style="s2">because it&#39;s only in the optimization of</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.080" end="01:30:43.440" style="s2">the whole of our cognitive processes</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.400" end="01:30:44.719" style="s2">the full the fully the full brain fully</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.440" end="01:30:47.199" style="s2">embodied fully embedded</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.719" end="01:30:48.080" style="s2">that we have our best shot at overcoming</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.199" end="01:30:50.880" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.080" end="01:30:50.880" style="s2">and disconnection</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.360" end="01:30:56.719" style="s2">um so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.400" end="01:30:58.400" style="s2">we&#39;re about 40 minutes over uh how long</p>
