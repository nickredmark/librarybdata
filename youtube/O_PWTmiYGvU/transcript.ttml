<p begin="00:07:47.500" end="00:07:51.850" style="s2">tension and we&#39;ve talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.820" end="00:07:53.710" style="s2">before we started filming of the</p>

<p begin="00:07:57.070" end="00:08:01.720" style="s2">but this sense that that we have as</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.320" end="00:08:02.710" style="s2">people who&#39;ve done been very familiar</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.720" end="00:08:04.690" style="s2">with kind of different kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:08:04.690" end="00:08:08.700" style="s2">that actually there&#39;s another dimension</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.190" end="00:08:11.790" style="s2">that&#39;s needed as well and it&#39;s quite</p>

<p begin="00:08:14.530" end="00:08:19.450" style="s2">we&#39;re where we&#39;re in this this is part</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.740" end="00:08:20.530" style="s2">of the conversation that I think rebel</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.450" end="00:08:22.600" style="s2">wisdom is trying to have in particular</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.530" end="00:08:24.760" style="s2">is what are the different pieces that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.600" end="00:08:26.950" style="s2">need to bring together so I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.760" end="00:08:28.450" style="s2">and you you&#39;ve also talked about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.950" end="00:08:30.490" style="s2">this conversation is becoming a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.450" end="00:08:32.710" style="s2">self-aware and it&#39;s it certainly seems</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.490" end="00:08:34.240" style="s2">to have a direction to it what do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.710" end="00:08:37.599" style="s2">think where do you think it&#39;s at and</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.240" end="00:08:40.090" style="s2">where do you think it needs to go well</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.599" end="00:08:42.160" style="s2">one of the things that I appreciate most</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.090" end="00:08:44.589" style="s2">about what you&#39;ve done is that you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.160" end="00:08:46.480" style="s2">continued to be curious and stay as I</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.589" end="00:08:47.290" style="s2">said you have stayed interest more</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.480" end="00:08:52.440" style="s2">interested in what</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.290" end="00:08:54.730" style="s2">is emerging and what is new than simply</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.440" end="00:08:57.009" style="s2">tracking the implications of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.730" end="00:08:58.660" style="s2">already obvious which is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.009" end="00:09:01.300" style="s2">crucial because where things are moving</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.660" end="00:09:03.459" style="s2">very very fast and emergence is the name</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.300" end="00:09:06.550" style="s2">of the game I think if you deeply</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.459" end="00:09:12.279" style="s2">consider all of the data you come to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.550" end="00:09:13.649" style="s2">conclusion that we are caught in a</p>

<p begin="00:09:13.649" end="00:09:19.899" style="s2">nonlinear social transformation and that</p>

<p begin="00:09:19.899" end="00:09:25.600" style="s2">depend on profound maturity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.350" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">probably only going to be achievable at</p>

<p begin="00:09:33.310" end="00:09:37.029" style="s2">reinforced among limited numbers of</p>

<p begin="00:16:08.820" end="00:16:14.160" style="s2">obviously the rebel wisdom the channel</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.190" end="00:16:16.710" style="s2">sort of originated from the interest in</p>

<p begin="00:16:21.240" end="00:16:24.360" style="s2">intertwined and I&#39;m hugely impressed</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.250" end="00:16:28.350" style="s2">with this thinking as well I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.360" end="00:16:32.780" style="s2">dismiss that and then what I what I</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.350" end="00:16:35.430" style="s2">sensed with him was there was a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.780" end="00:16:39.090" style="s2">almost a theory of everything a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.430" end="00:16:40.560" style="s2">integral theory of everything which both</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.090" end="00:16:43.050" style="s2">of us admit familiar with from Ken</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.560" end="00:16:44.730" style="s2">Wilbur&#39;s work and interested in the sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.050" end="00:16:47.400" style="s2">of the dialogue between these two very</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.730" end="00:16:49.380" style="s2">very singular and very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.400" end="00:16:51.390" style="s2">visions of trying to bring lots of</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.380" end="00:16:53.370" style="s2">different wisdom traditions together and</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.390" end="00:16:55.140" style="s2">lots of different historical traditions</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.370" end="00:16:59.070" style="s2">obviously Jordan Peterson mainly focused</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.140" end="00:17:01.170" style="s2">on the mythopoetic the mythic tradition</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.070" end="00:17:03.420" style="s2">and the Christian tradition and can</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.170" end="00:17:06.240" style="s2">probably a bit more interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.420" end="00:17:08.300" style="s2">Eastern traditions of of wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.240" end="00:17:10.080" style="s2">Buddhism and bringing those together and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.300" end="00:17:12.000" style="s2">obviously you&#39;ve been in you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.080" end="00:17:13.950" style="s2">involved in the integral community for</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.000" end="00:17:16.920" style="s2">many years I&#39;d really love to get your</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.950" end="00:17:19.320" style="s2">take on on those two different visions</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.920" end="00:17:21.720" style="s2">where they interact maybe where they</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.320" end="00:17:23.280" style="s2">where you see the the shortcomings or</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.720" end="00:17:25.230" style="s2">where they don&#39;t where they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.280" end="00:17:27.030" style="s2">coincide but there&#39;s certainly a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.230" end="00:17:30.240" style="s2">interesting dialogue to be had between</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.030" end="00:17:34.350" style="s2">those two really amazing thinkers and</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.240" end="00:17:37.680" style="s2">amazing perspectives well my own</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.350" end="00:17:40.890" style="s2">background of spiritual practice is what</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.680" end="00:17:43.440" style="s2">I call a transcendental spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.890" end="00:17:44.520" style="s2">non-dual spirituality which is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.440" end="00:17:47.670" style="s2">much Ken&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.520" end="00:17:51.240" style="s2">history as well and this really has to</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.670" end="00:17:53.390" style="s2">do with waking up from false forms of</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.240" end="00:17:56.820" style="s2">separation false divisions waking up</p>

<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:24.600" style="s2">senior in a certain sense because the</p>

<p begin="00:37:02.300" end="00:37:06.800" style="s2">are coming from a very intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.560" end="00:37:09.619" style="s2">level and there&#39;s a sense of the systems</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.800" end="00:37:11.210" style="s2">thinkers and there&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.619" end="00:37:14.710" style="s2">an abandonment or there&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.210" end="00:37:17.030" style="s2">understanding of the the more embodied</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.710" end="00:37:18.680" style="s2">nature of the transformation that we</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.030" end="00:37:20.869" style="s2">need to go through and I think more and</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.680" end="00:37:23.240" style="s2">more people are kind of sensing that but</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.869" end="00:37:26.480" style="s2">I think key to that has to be some kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.240" end="00:37:31.790" style="s2">of techniques or practice or</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.480" end="00:37:33.380" style="s2">and yes some some way of interacting</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.790" end="00:37:35.510" style="s2">with our own in estates and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.380" end="00:37:37.130" style="s2">processing and maybe what what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.510" end="00:37:38.930" style="s2">attitude to practice and how important</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.130" end="00:37:41.109" style="s2">do you think that is for for the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.930" end="00:37:46.280" style="s2">transition that we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.109" end="00:37:50.180" style="s2">practice is at the center of my Dharma</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.280" end="00:37:52.730" style="s2">because in a sense practice is living</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.180" end="00:37:55.100" style="s2">intentionally it&#39;s intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.730" end="00:37:56.840" style="s2">cultivating what is best in ourselves or</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.100" end="00:37:59.359" style="s2">we can practice together practice isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.840" end="00:38:00.800" style="s2">only individual it can be collective you</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.359" end="00:38:03.820" style="s2">give some examples of practice just so</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.800" end="00:38:07.010" style="s2">we can kind of ground that well sure</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.820" end="00:38:11.140" style="s2">practices include meditation conscious</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.010" end="00:38:16.580" style="s2">exercise yoga Qigong psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.140" end="00:38:23.320" style="s2">medicine journeys they also it also</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.580" end="00:38:27.190" style="s2">includes just physical strengthening gym</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.320" end="00:38:30.200" style="s2">anything that we do any repeated</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.190" end="00:38:32.359" style="s2">activity that changes us and it</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.200" end="00:38:35.359" style="s2">cultivates new qualities we think we can</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.359" end="00:38:37.520" style="s2">call a practice and as we really deepen</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.359" end="00:38:39.800" style="s2">into an integral full understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.520" end="00:38:41.720" style="s2">what practice is we realized that just</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.800" end="00:38:43.760" style="s2">putting your time in on the cushion is</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.720" end="00:38:47.090" style="s2">not enough that you have to cultivate a</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.760" end="00:38:49.850" style="s2">body mind that is capable of conducting</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.090" end="00:38:52.480" style="s2">more energy and consciousness that it</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.850" end="00:38:55.040" style="s2">that it&#39;s a whole being</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.480" end="00:38:57.980" style="s2">multi-dimensional matter and that every</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.040" end="00:39:00.140" style="s2">moment of life involves choices where we</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.980" end="00:39:01.910" style="s2">fall unconsciously into patterns by</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.140" end="00:39:04.160" style="s2">tendency and where we can make different</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.910" end="00:39:05.869" style="s2">and better choices so that really all of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.160" end="00:39:09.050" style="s2">life is practice if it&#39;s rightly</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.869" end="00:39:12.560" style="s2">understood and in a moment in which we</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.050" end="00:39:15.200" style="s2">are all shaped to a very strong momentum</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.560" end="00:39:18.500" style="s2">of human culture that&#39;s growth based and</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.200" end="00:39:21.170" style="s2">competition based and those patterns are</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.500" end="00:39:23.470" style="s2">tending to become self terminating we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.170" end="00:39:26.680" style="s2">asked to go through a collective</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.470" end="00:39:29.540" style="s2">transformation and that transformation</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.680" end="00:39:31.670" style="s2">ideally would involve us bringing our</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.540" end="00:39:34.100" style="s2">intentions together in a whole different</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.670" end="00:39:37.430" style="s2">way so collective practice is also</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.100" end="00:39:40.170" style="s2">obligatory and the conversation among</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.430" end="00:39:45.540" style="s2">practitioners might go something</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.170" end="00:39:47.819" style="s2">like gosh I&#39;m feeling really great</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.540" end="00:39:49.290" style="s2">because my consciousness is opening up</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.819" end="00:39:51.240" style="s2">in this way and this and that has</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.290" end="00:39:53.730" style="s2">changed in some of my relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.240" end="00:39:56.819" style="s2">man I feel like I&#39;m in a whole new level</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.730" end="00:39:59.670" style="s2">of my life right now my friend might</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.819" end="00:40:01.530" style="s2">respond yeah but you know you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.670" end="00:40:03.750" style="s2">little inflated in a certain way and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.530" end="00:40:05.309" style="s2">that enthusiasm almost bowls me over I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.750" end="00:40:07.710" style="s2">not sure there&#39;s room for you to really</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.309" end="00:40:11.640" style="s2">hear and feel me and take me in you seem</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.710" end="00:40:15.690" style="s2">so full of your own new insight and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.640" end="00:40:17.790" style="s2">might then learn from that and shift and</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.690" end="00:40:19.710" style="s2">take that person into account in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.790" end="00:40:22.079" style="s2">better way or in another moment I might</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.710" end="00:40:25.530" style="s2">share the place where I feel like I&#39;m up</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.079" end="00:40:28.680" style="s2">against something and my good</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.530" end="00:40:30.750" style="s2">practitioner friend might share not just</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.680" end="00:40:33.480" style="s2">you know we tend to tell our own stories</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.750" end="00:40:35.790" style="s2">to one another very very often we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.480" end="00:40:37.440" style="s2">engage real conversations we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.790" end="00:40:40.740" style="s2">moment now culturally where we actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.440" end="00:40:44.190" style="s2">have to hear listen take in one another</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.740" end="00:40:48.329" style="s2">care enough to actually engage that</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.190" end="00:40:50.099" style="s2">other and most human conversations are</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.329" end="00:40:53.220" style="s2">not even close to that level currently</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.099" end="00:40:55.500" style="s2">so we&#39;re cultivating a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.220" end="00:40:57.150" style="s2">fellowship and friendship as well so the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.500" end="00:41:01.290" style="s2">conversation among practitioners might</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.150" end="00:41:04.410" style="s2">also then be one in which we really seek</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.290" end="00:41:09.089" style="s2">to get each other this is something like</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.410" end="00:41:11.359" style="s2">circling and authentic communication but</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.089" end="00:41:15.230" style="s2">certainly an authentic communication</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.359" end="00:41:19.589" style="s2">rarely take as their prompt our</p>

<p begin="00:44:47.190" end="00:44:56.430" style="s2">made about Trump and because my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.369" end="00:44:58.770" style="s2">that Trump won&#39;t be voted out or the we</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.430" end="00:45:01.530" style="s2">won&#39;t see a shift there until the</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.770" end="00:45:04.380" style="s2">lessons of Trump are learned and I for</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.530" end="00:45:07.920" style="s2">me the lessons of Trump are that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.380" end="00:45:09.240" style="s2">liberal classes created this in somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.920" end="00:45:11.010" style="s2">the shadow of the liberal class has</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.240" end="00:45:13.349" style="s2">created this in some way with this sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.010" end="00:45:14.880" style="s2">of a tribalism that didn&#39;t want to admit</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.349" end="00:45:17.070" style="s2">that it was a tribalism we&#39;re so liberal</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.880" end="00:45:19.080" style="s2">we&#39;re so inclusive apart from the</p>

<p begin="00:45:19.080" end="00:45:23.730" style="s2">reaction to that and I don&#39;t see I when</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.589" end="00:45:26.760" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about practice and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.730" end="00:45:29.400" style="s2">talking about kind of seeing a deeper</p>

<p begin="00:45:29.400" end="00:45:34.170" style="s2">I see is the big problem is this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.910" end="00:45:36.150" style="s2">until we learn the lessons of Trump and</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.170" end="00:45:38.940" style="s2">I don&#39;t see real really any signs of</p>

<p begin="00:45:43.770" end="00:45:52.170" style="s2">that diagnosis partially I I do think</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.839" end="00:45:53.940" style="s2">that there is so let me tell you where I</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.170" end="00:45:59.369" style="s2">don&#39;t disagree first where I disagree</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.940" end="00:46:01.700" style="s2">first there&#39;s a great deal of corruption</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.369" end="00:46:04.980" style="s2">right now in the Republican Party and</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.700" end="00:46:07.330" style="s2">there are there</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.980" end="00:46:10.390" style="s2">we are under pressure we are under</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.330" end="00:46:12.310" style="s2">stress and under stress dysfunction</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.390" end="00:46:15.970" style="s2">comes forward and there&#39;s a fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.310" end="00:46:18.460" style="s2">of psychopathy in every society and that</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.970" end="00:46:21.340" style="s2">psychopathy has concentrated and become</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.460" end="00:46:23.500" style="s2">pretty you know very significant</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.340" end="00:46:26.080" style="s2">majority of it is concentrated on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.500" end="00:46:28.510" style="s2">right in supporting the Republican Party</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.080" end="00:46:30.730" style="s2">and so there is something that simply</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.510" end="00:46:34.570" style="s2">has to be resisted so I&#39;m sympathetic</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.730" end="00:46:36.700" style="s2">with aspects of the left side of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.570" end="00:46:38.680" style="s2">polarization there is there are two</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.700" end="00:46:42.460" style="s2">things I absolutely am against</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.680" end="00:46:49.780" style="s2">psychopathy and cynicism my politics are</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.460" end="00:46:52.900" style="s2">anti psychopathic and anti cynical there</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.780" end="00:46:55.330" style="s2">there are there are all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.900" end="00:46:58.480" style="s2">dysfunctions operative on the left but</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.330" end="00:47:00.430" style="s2">what I see in maybe a typical Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.480" end="00:47:03.100" style="s2">candidate like Cory Booker is something</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.430" end="00:47:06.070" style="s2">a heck of a lot more healthy so I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.100" end="00:47:09.220" style="s2">not alarmed by Cory Booker in anything</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.070" end="00:47:13.360" style="s2">like the way I&#39;m alarmed by what I see</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.220" end="00:47:16.120" style="s2">in Donald Trump and therefore I do think</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.360" end="00:47:18.400" style="s2">that there is a little bit of a good guy</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.120" end="00:47:20.410" style="s2">bad guy dynamic at work there and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.400" end="00:47:23.110" style="s2">happy to be with the Democrats in that</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.410" end="00:47:26.050" style="s2">particular polar polarity because I</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.110" end="00:47:34.590" style="s2">think it&#39;s important however I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.050" end="00:47:34.590" style="s2">that the demonization of racism and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.610" end="00:47:44.620" style="s2">the superiority that successful coastal</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.590" end="00:47:48.250" style="s2">elites feel to the Trump voters in</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.620" end="00:47:49.900" style="s2">flyover country are definitely a big</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.250" end="00:47:51.820" style="s2">part of what has created the Trump</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.900" end="00:47:53.620" style="s2">phenomenon and I didn&#39;t I agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.820" end="00:47:55.570" style="s2">that there&#39;s not nearly enough self</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.620" end="00:47:57.820" style="s2">awareness about those limitations I</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.570" end="00:48:01.060" style="s2">think a different level of compassion</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.820" end="00:48:02.710" style="s2">and respect is necessary but very often</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.060" end="00:48:04.690" style="s2">you know the people who are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.710" end="00:48:06.220" style="s2">convene trans partisan conversations</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.690" end="00:48:07.510" style="s2">find that it&#39;s a lot easier to get</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.220" end="00:48:09.190" style="s2">people on the Left who want to have</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.510" end="00:48:14.730" style="s2">those conversations than people on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.190" end="00:48:15.890" style="s2">right and that&#39;s that&#39;s a sign of</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.730" end="00:48:18.230" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.890" end="00:48:21.319" style="s2">and and it doesn&#39;t speak well to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.230" end="00:48:24.079" style="s2">on the right so in my view of things</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.319" end="00:48:26.029" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re kind of ought to be and</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.079" end="00:48:27.890" style="s2">I hope there will be a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.029" end="00:48:30.680" style="s2">repudiation of Trump in the next</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.890" end="00:48:32.930" style="s2">election and I think that will open an</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.680" end="00:48:37.460" style="s2">opportunity because the people who come</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.930" end="00:48:40.400" style="s2">together to try to oppose him will have</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.460" end="00:48:43.130" style="s2">some commonality out of which some of</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.400" end="00:48:46.220" style="s2">these healthier expressions and some of</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.130" end="00:48:49.609" style="s2">the important critiques of the excesses</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.220" end="00:48:52.249" style="s2">of post-modernism can be surfaced and</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.609" end="00:48:55.720" style="s2">maybe we can you know we have some</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.249" end="00:48:58.759" style="s2">opportunities to coalesce aspects of the</p>

<p begin="00:51:24.670" end="00:51:30.040" style="s2">scan for me and I know won&#39;t scan for a</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.550" end="00:51:31.720" style="s2">lot of people is saying that people on</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.040" end="00:51:33.580" style="s2">the left are more open to conversation</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.720" end="00:51:36.610" style="s2">and people on the right I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.580" end="00:51:38.020" style="s2">a certainly I mean something Eric</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.610" end="00:51:39.790" style="s2">Weinstein talks about a lot Brett</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.020" end="00:51:41.740" style="s2">Weinstein talks about a lot that</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.790" end="00:51:44.050" style="s2">actually they found much more openness</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.740" end="00:51:46.870" style="s2">to have discussions especially about hot</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.050" end="00:51:48.730" style="s2">topics on among the center right and</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.870" end="00:51:50.380" style="s2">they do among the left because those</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.730" end="00:51:52.560" style="s2">conversations often shut down with</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.380" end="00:51:55.540" style="s2">accusations of bigotry or whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.560" end="00:51:57.010" style="s2">and that feels true to me like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.540" end="00:51:59.590" style="s2">certain things that can be discussed in</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.010" end="00:52:02.920" style="s2">the media and in academia I think that</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.590" end="00:52:05.020" style="s2">that uh that the force of censorship I</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.920" end="00:52:07.030" style="s2">do feel is coming more from the left and</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.020" end="00:52:10.480" style="s2">from the right so I wonder whether</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.030" end="00:52:12.940" style="s2">actually I agree with you I think I was</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.480" end="00:52:17.320" style="s2">talking more about my own experience</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.940" end="00:52:20.530" style="s2">with individuals there are environments</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.320" end="00:52:22.600" style="s2">particularly the academies and certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.530" end="00:52:26.560" style="s2">activist circles in the urban centers</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.600" end="00:52:30.010" style="s2">where the left is very closed and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.560" end="00:52:31.630" style="s2">and just suppressive that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.010" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">been from the left that we&#39;ve seen so</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.630" end="00:52:40.240" style="s2">many attacks on free speech but that</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:42.370" style="s2">doesn&#39;t not nonetheless we I I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.240" end="00:52:42.950" style="s2">have an opportunity to scale the</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.370" end="00:52:45.950" style="s2">beginnings</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.950" end="00:52:50.210" style="s2">the kind of movement we want to see in</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.950" end="00:52:51.950" style="s2">many areas of culture which are you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.210" end="00:52:55.250" style="s2">some of them very important ones are on</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.950" end="00:52:56.930" style="s2">the center-right but I&#39;d say the larger</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.250" end="00:52:58.970" style="s2">population is more toward the left</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.930" end="00:53:02.500" style="s2">although there are elements the left</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.970" end="00:53:02.500" style="s2">that are going to fight it to the man</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.760" end="00:53:11.539" style="s2">rebel wisdom is a new sense making</p>
