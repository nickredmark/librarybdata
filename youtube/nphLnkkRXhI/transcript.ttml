<p begin="00:00:03.750" end="00:00:07.680" style="s2">right we&#39;ve done five other ones and</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.700" end="00:00:10.349" style="s2">this is our one on labor and what is</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.680" end="00:00:11.490" style="s2">raising is its we spend I&#39;m just going</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.349" end="00:00:14.250" style="s2">to meet you for a second marks might be</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.490" end="00:00:16.980" style="s2">yours that&#39;s chirping at me we spend an</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.250" end="00:00:19.410" style="s2">hour having a conversation to generate</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.980" end="00:00:21.630" style="s2">solutions for a specific area to spend</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.410" end="00:00:23.250" style="s2">15 minutes talking about what it looks</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.630" end="00:00:24.750" style="s2">like right now in society this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.250" end="00:00:26.340" style="s2">normally what we concentrate on it</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.750" end="00:00:28.529" style="s2">clearly takes a lot longer than 15</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.340" end="00:00:30.779" style="s2">minutes to figure out what&#39;s good and</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.529" end="00:00:34.680" style="s2">bad about transportation or in this case</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.779" end="00:00:36.329" style="s2">labor but because we concentrate on it</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.680" end="00:00:38.430" style="s2">so much in society I just get 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.329" end="00:00:41.640" style="s2">to kind of recap what we all all know</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.430" end="00:00:43.020" style="s2">and think about it with the pandemic and</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.640" end="00:00:44.760" style="s2">can sometimes take a little longer than</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.020" end="00:00:46.950" style="s2">15 minutes because things have changed</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.760" end="00:00:48.420" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not the same old same old we</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.950" end="00:00:51.600" style="s2">talked about and then we spend 15</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.420" end="00:00:53.399" style="s2">minutes talking about our version of an</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.600" end="00:00:55.739" style="s2">amazing future however foreign that in</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.399" end="00:00:58.170" style="s2">the distance you need to be five ten a</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.739" end="00:00:59.940" style="s2">hundred years and then we spend the vast</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.170" end="00:01:02.219" style="s2">majority the time the 30 minutes talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.940" end="00:01:04.320" style="s2">about what is an adjacent possible what</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.219" end="00:01:07.740" style="s2">is something we could do right now if we</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:10.439" style="s2">had 10,000 people and $100,000 that</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.740" end="00:01:13.799" style="s2">would help us in this case in the area</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.439" end="00:01:15.810" style="s2">of labor so I will unmute you now mark</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.799" end="00:01:18.750" style="s2">and I&#39;ll let Alejandra onion herself</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.810" end="00:01:20.640" style="s2">wants to and if you want to know what do</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.750" end="00:01:28.500" style="s2">you see happening right now with labor</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:31.799" style="s2">mark well it&#39;s I see a lot of fear I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.500" end="00:01:34.890" style="s2">been on a couple of meditation groups</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.799" end="00:01:36.840" style="s2">and there was a couple of people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.890" end="00:01:43.079" style="s2">were actually you could see them their</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.840" end="00:01:45.240" style="s2">face they were terrified about the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.079" end="00:01:47.369" style="s2">possibility that they wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.240" end="00:01:51.420" style="s2">money coming in next week to pay for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.369" end="00:01:56.490" style="s2">rest their new stuff so I I definitely</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.420" end="00:02:01.700" style="s2">come at the other end of the spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.490" end="00:02:06.930" style="s2">I see like a manufacturer in kitchener</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.700" end="00:02:12.450" style="s2">mobilizing to retool laser cutters and</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.930" end="00:02:13.250" style="s2">3d printers to make face masks reusable</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.450" end="00:02:18.170" style="s2">face masks</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.250" end="00:02:23.660" style="s2">- the doctor specifications and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.170" end="00:02:26.240" style="s2">making something like 8,000 a day now so</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.660" end="00:02:30.290" style="s2">and they&#39;re employing people from all</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.240" end="00:02:34.730" style="s2">over so that that mean there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.290" end="00:02:35.959" style="s2">there there&#39;s an opportunity there and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.730" end="00:02:37.640" style="s2">of course they&#39;re making money but he</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.959" end="00:02:42.350" style="s2">talked about he talked about making</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.640" end="00:02:44.930" style="s2">money in an almost apologetic way as if</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.350" end="00:02:45.709" style="s2">to say well this has to be good for</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.930" end="00:02:49.970" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.709" end="00:02:52.790" style="s2">and I really like the sound of that to</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.970" end="00:02:58.430" style="s2">me that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of like the answer</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.790" end="00:03:00.350" style="s2">to the to the what is the fear and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.430" end="00:03:04.610" style="s2">feeling of hopelessness that I see from</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.350" end="00:03:08.060" style="s2">some of the people is these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.610" end="00:03:11.560" style="s2">novel solutions where the people who</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.060" end="00:03:15.320" style="s2">create the company or the corporation</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.560" end="00:03:18.350" style="s2">have kind of like an internal guide that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.320" end="00:03:22.790" style="s2">says we only need to make this much</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.350" end="00:03:24.620" style="s2">money as a matter of fact we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.790" end="00:03:28.790" style="s2">to make any more money if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.620" end="00:03:33.049" style="s2">possibility that we can employ others</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.790" end="00:03:34.910" style="s2">and this our solution will go viral no</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.049" end="00:03:37.190" style="s2">matter what it is it&#39;ll go viral</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.910" end="00:03:40.610" style="s2">people will see it&#39;s sustainable and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.190" end="00:03:45.500" style="s2">growing and good for everyone and want</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.610" end="00:03:50.780" style="s2">to get in the cause so I see that as an</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.500" end="00:03:53.480" style="s2">opportunity like lately but I need some</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.780" end="00:03:56.030" style="s2">notes because some sometimes they do</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.480" end="00:03:57.829" style="s2">sometimes they don&#39;t and so like I said</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.030" end="00:03:59.870" style="s2">like before I started these solution</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.829" end="00:04:03.049" style="s2">raisings and slightly a coke in nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.870" end="00:04:04.549" style="s2">free world where although it was still</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.049" end="00:04:06.260" style="s2">happy in Japan of Japan</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.549" end="00:04:10.850" style="s2">I&#39;m so happy in China and it was spread</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.260" end="00:04:13.489" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t um yet as as close to us in</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.850" end="00:04:15.380" style="s2">North America as it is now and so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.489" end="00:04:16.880" style="s2">been thinking about labor for years of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.380" end="00:04:19.430" style="s2">the things that I&#39;m gonna mention aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:22.190" style="s2">necessarily related to to the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.430" end="00:04:23.810" style="s2">but at the same time they are because</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.190" end="00:04:27.370" style="s2">they&#39;re why everyone is so stressed</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.810" end="00:04:29.960" style="s2">right now and why we have to that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.370" end="00:04:33.050" style="s2">labor right now is basically trading</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.960" end="00:04:36.229" style="s2">your time for money and so you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.050" end="00:04:37.460" style="s2">your own you have to find a job trade</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.229" end="00:04:38.960" style="s2">your time for money and then you use</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.460" end="00:04:40.310" style="s2">that money to get your needs met to put</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:42.379" style="s2">a roof over your head and food on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.310" end="00:04:46.129" style="s2">table where you and your family</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.379" end="00:04:50.389" style="s2">CL Hendra and now has her join her back</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.129" end="00:04:52.729" style="s2">in and even people who are working</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.389" end="00:04:55.270" style="s2">extremely hard can&#39;t seem to make ends</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.729" end="00:04:57.830" style="s2">meet and yet there&#39;s people who have</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.270" end="00:04:59.690" style="s2">useless jobs who make millions and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.830" end="00:05:01.009" style="s2">millions of dollars who their the thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.690" end="00:05:02.690" style="s2">they are doing isn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.009" end="00:05:05.270" style="s2">contributing to society in any real way</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.690" end="00:05:07.159" style="s2">about making anything up with new</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.270" end="00:05:09.610" style="s2">inventions they&#39;re just trading digits</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.159" end="00:05:12.080" style="s2">they&#39;re speculating on the market or</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.610" end="00:05:13.669" style="s2">feeding off of other people&#39;s labor and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.080" end="00:05:15.560" style="s2">they&#39;re not they&#39;re not able and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.669" end="00:05:19.490" style="s2">really truly or not employed people</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.560" end="00:05:20.870" style="s2">they&#39;re just it isn&#39;t fair like people</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.490" end="00:05:22.250" style="s2">some people have to trade their time for</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.870" end="00:05:24.680" style="s2">money and other people entrepreneurs or</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.250" end="00:05:27.050" style="s2">take high risks to make money and now</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.680" end="00:05:28.909" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing that falling apart too with</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.050" end="00:05:31.280" style="s2">the people who are high risk tolerance</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.909" end="00:05:32.990" style="s2">they don&#39;t have money saves they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.280" end="00:05:34.849" style="s2">make payroll they can&#39;t pay their leases</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.990" end="00:05:36.710" style="s2">I can&#39;t so all of these businesses are</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.849" end="00:05:41.479" style="s2">going under and you&#39;re losing jobs and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.710" end="00:05:42.860" style="s2">everyone&#39;s seen how our jobs are the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.479" end="00:05:44.389" style="s2">we get all of our needs met</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.860" end="00:05:48.139" style="s2">it&#39;s the way we have our sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.389" end="00:05:50.210" style="s2">purpose and there isn&#39;t enough to go</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.139" end="00:05:51.830" style="s2">around especially right now right</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.210" end="00:05:53.960" style="s2">there&#39;s only so many essential services</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.830" end="00:05:55.759" style="s2">they can employ people and yet everyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.960" end="00:06:00.250" style="s2">still has rents everyone still has all</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.759" end="00:06:00.250" style="s2">of these um all of these expenses to pay</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.729" end="00:06:06.409" style="s2">stage and you see me move in my head</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.460" end="00:06:08.840" style="s2">it&#39;s just I&#39;m trying to tilt it back and</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.409" end="00:06:11.000" style="s2">forth I&#39;m not responding I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.840" end="00:06:12.620" style="s2">yeah I know it&#39;s already you first got</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.000" end="00:06:14.990" style="s2">my note cuz it&#39;s like a mirror it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.620" end="00:06:17.330" style="s2">mirror effect and so Alejandra do you</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.990" end="00:06:19.069" style="s2">have anything to add to what Labour</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.330" end="00:06:23.360" style="s2">currently looks like for you or in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.069" end="00:06:24.830" style="s2">world whether pre Kovac or Korea yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.360" end="00:06:28.009" style="s2">this is also something that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.830" end="00:06:30.610" style="s2">thinking about for a while and I lived</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.009" end="00:06:33.740" style="s2">in Europe for every time in Holland and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.610" end="00:06:35.839" style="s2">where things were very good and I live</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.740" end="00:06:40.060" style="s2">in and I am from Argentina and now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.839" end="00:06:42.730" style="s2">here in Ghana status from since 2011</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.060" end="00:06:46.600" style="s2">reality so I&#39;m sort of in contact with</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.730" end="00:06:48.700" style="s2">both realities and and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.600" end="00:06:51.639" style="s2">that I&#39;ve started seeing already when I</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.700" end="00:06:54.490" style="s2">was in Holland and is that okay you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.639" end="00:06:57.370" style="s2">have organized labor and in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.490" end="00:06:59.889" style="s2">that it works for mostly everybody that</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.370" end="00:07:02.620" style="s2">there is not enough work or they were to</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.889" end="00:07:06.820" style="s2">go around for everybody but you can have</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.620" end="00:07:11.050" style="s2">some sort of system that keeps that</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.820" end="00:07:14.560" style="s2">order in place when you come to Latin</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.050" end="00:07:16.240" style="s2">America that is not there and and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.560" end="00:07:19.180" style="s2">you have people at work</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.240" end="00:07:20.830" style="s2">a structural poverty and and an other</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.180" end="00:07:23.020" style="s2">type of social plan doesn&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.830" end="00:07:25.389" style="s2">put in place in order to contain them</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.020" end="00:07:28.450" style="s2">their problem we already see that there</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.389" end="00:07:31.360" style="s2">is not enough for everybody because of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.450" end="00:07:33.180" style="s2">the way that is structured and and there</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.360" end="00:07:36.729" style="s2">is also something out there and I see is</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.180" end="00:07:42.060" style="s2">that in any to that point that you were</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.729" end="00:07:46.720" style="s2">making there is a mismatch between money</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.060" end="00:07:49.960" style="s2">value and wealth so those concepts are</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.720" end="00:07:53.320" style="s2">sometimes used as placeholders for one</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.960" end="00:07:55.000" style="s2">another but they are not the same so you</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.320" end="00:07:58.090" style="s2">get money from some service that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.000" end="00:08:01.210" style="s2">provide and that service or that good</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.090" end="00:08:03.400" style="s2">that you provide might have value or not</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.210" end="00:08:07.330" style="s2">and what we see is a lot of money the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.400" end="00:08:10.120" style="s2">import into things that do not represent</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.330" end="00:08:11.860" style="s2">real value for the people or society so</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.120" end="00:08:13.600" style="s2">it&#39;s just like you know the financial</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.860" end="00:08:18.940" style="s2">and creating more money for money and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.600" end="00:08:20.950" style="s2">and that is also not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.940" end="00:08:24.310" style="s2">representative of the wealth that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.950" end="00:08:25.960" style="s2">might have as as a person because the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.310" end="00:08:30.039" style="s2">wealth is also represented by your</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.960" end="00:08:34.620" style="s2">network but your the quantity of the air</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.039" end="00:08:38.440" style="s2">that you breathe and all other things so</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.620" end="00:08:40.390" style="s2">where labor comes in is in one specific</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.440" end="00:08:44.890" style="s2">area that is the means in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.390" end="00:08:48.820" style="s2">the what what do you need to cover your</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.890" end="00:08:50.830" style="s2">needs not only the physical and material</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.820" end="00:08:52.820" style="s2">needs but also a psychological emotional</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.830" end="00:08:55.970" style="s2">and self-realization</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.820" end="00:08:58.310" style="s2">so I see that as as there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.970" end="00:09:01.910" style="s2">broken system but we know that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.310" end="00:09:04.790" style="s2">is not sustainable in time the gig</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.910" end="00:09:09.590" style="s2">economy is also not a good solution for</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.790" end="00:09:12.830" style="s2">that it has to slowly start drifting to</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.590" end="00:09:16.220" style="s2">a different paradigm which now has been</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.830" end="00:09:18.200" style="s2">accelerated by the whole crisis and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.220" end="00:09:22.870" style="s2">whole crisis what is producing and also</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.200" end="00:09:27.100" style="s2">not this crisis but also the the whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.870" end="00:09:29.450" style="s2">scalable age that is already coming and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.100" end="00:09:34.220" style="s2">now it&#39;s being sort of catalyzed by the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.450" end="00:09:36.950" style="s2">corona crisis is this this new way of</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.220" end="00:09:39.320" style="s2">collaboration that also produces a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.950" end="00:09:41.300" style="s2">of displacement and the sectors that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.320" end="00:09:45.050" style="s2">displaced are not necessarily the ones</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.300" end="00:09:48.500" style="s2">that are easier to absorb so is this</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.050" end="00:09:52.130" style="s2">very very tricky situation in which were</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.500" end="00:09:54.350" style="s2">in that this long time coming is in my</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.130" end="00:09:56.060" style="s2">eyes is not new but now it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.350" end="00:09:58.610" style="s2">accelerated and that&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.060" end="00:10:01.340" style="s2">that worries me the most about this</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.610" end="00:10:04.010" style="s2">whole new situation because we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.340" end="00:10:06.110" style="s2">see the effects of these coming in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.010" end="00:10:09.950" style="s2">next few months and it will last for a</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.110" end="00:10:12.740" style="s2">long time and they need to be solutions</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.950" end="00:10:16.100" style="s2">in place to start absorbing and</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.740" end="00:10:19.760" style="s2">redirecting labor into in ways that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.100" end="00:10:28.550" style="s2">sustainable and and useful for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.760" end="00:10:29.780" style="s2">so that&#39;s why I&#39;m I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.550" end="00:10:31.460" style="s2">mention we only have a few more minutes</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.780" end="00:10:32.870" style="s2">to discuss this portion so now we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.460" end="00:10:36.350" style="s2">still open up now that everyone&#39;s had a</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.870" end="00:10:37.670" style="s2">reason a chance to share my brain is not</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.350" end="00:10:39.440" style="s2">on point today but I wanted to share</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.670" end="00:10:41.930" style="s2">this picture that I drew I drew that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.440" end="00:10:45.170" style="s2">drew this I draw this picture a lot it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.930" end="00:10:46.760" style="s2">when I&#39;ve sat with with forum so for</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.170" end="00:10:48.650" style="s2">something to get done in our society you</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.760" end="00:10:50.270" style="s2">need one individual to have all three of</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.650" end="00:10:52.730" style="s2">these things the desire to do the task</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.270" end="00:10:54.170" style="s2">the awareness to do the task and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.730" end="00:10:56.000" style="s2">skill to do it right the wareness of</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.170" end="00:10:58.550" style="s2">this that the task needs to get done and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.000" end="00:11:00.080" style="s2">in society the only one we really care</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.550" end="00:11:01.910" style="s2">about is that people don&#39;t desire to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.080" end="00:11:04.190" style="s2">the task so we pay them to do it but it</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.910" end="00:11:06.460" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actually get them the same level</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.190" end="00:11:06.460" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.720" end="00:11:10.860" style="s2">Venis that if they had truly desired to</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.089" end="00:11:12.810" style="s2">do the task without being paid for it</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.860" end="00:11:14.639" style="s2">the other two are much easier to deal</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.810" end="00:11:17.939" style="s2">with I&#39;m just gonna put this down now if</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.639" end="00:11:19.560" style="s2">you&#39;re not skilled in the task you just</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.939" end="00:11:21.990" style="s2">need training and the one that our</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.560" end="00:11:23.939" style="s2">society doesn&#39;t focus on at all is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.990" end="00:11:25.560" style="s2">if you both want to do the task and are</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.939" end="00:11:27.149" style="s2">trained to do the task which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.560" end="00:11:28.199" style="s2">happening right now in the world or</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.149" end="00:11:29.790" style="s2">people are like I know how to make</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.199" end="00:11:32.639" style="s2">respirator masks I know how to do 3d</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.790" end="00:11:33.779" style="s2">printing I am aware this thing needs to</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.639" end="00:11:35.519" style="s2">get done but I don&#39;t know where to put</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.779" end="00:11:37.470" style="s2">it and and that can be an easy</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:40.230" style="s2">technological fix something that is just</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.470" end="00:11:42.199" style="s2">a platform of hey this task needs to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.230" end="00:11:44.850" style="s2">done do you have the skill of the desire</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.199" end="00:11:47.509" style="s2">here is the awareness that is it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.850" end="00:11:50.310" style="s2">getting done because I think with labor</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.509" end="00:11:52.079" style="s2">there&#39;s the - there&#39;s the economic part</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.310" end="00:11:54.389" style="s2">that we need things done and I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.079" end="00:11:56.399" style="s2">seen what what truly is an essential</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.389" end="00:11:58.740" style="s2">service that needs to happen in our</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.399" end="00:12:00.720" style="s2">economies for our economies to function</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.740" end="00:12:02.639" style="s2">for our world to function and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.720" end="00:12:04.350" style="s2">there&#39;s the individual piece which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.639" end="00:12:06.540" style="s2">like we want to have a sense of purpose</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.350" end="00:12:10.769" style="s2">and get our needs met right we need food</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.540" end="00:12:13.079" style="s2">we need we need and so to some degree I</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.769" end="00:12:14.730" style="s2">like teasing those two apart to say how</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.079" end="00:12:20.699" style="s2">do we get those both met without it all</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.730" end="00:12:22.980" style="s2">being this complex menagerie of I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.699" end="00:12:24.720" style="s2">know complexity but that it falls apart</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.980" end="00:12:27.629" style="s2">it&#39;s like wait not everyone&#39;s job is</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:29.759" style="s2">necessary but people are necessary they</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.629" end="00:12:38.610" style="s2">still need to get fed they still need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.759" end="00:12:39.130" style="s2">get clothed and housed so yeah anyone</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.610" end="00:12:40.900" style="s2">else having</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.130" end="00:12:42.850" style="s2">rapping up thoughts for this section on</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.900" end="00:12:45.520" style="s2">how the world currently works before we</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.850" end="00:12:47.170" style="s2">get to shift into the beautiful version</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.520" end="00:12:49.450" style="s2">of the future that doesn&#39;t need to match</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.170" end="00:12:51.430" style="s2">but can be anything we want it to be in</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.450" end="00:12:54.580" style="s2">this in this realm of getting stuff done</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.430" end="00:12:57.340" style="s2">in our economy and individually well</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.580" end="00:13:01.090" style="s2">I&#39;ll say one thing I&#39;ve been involved in</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.340" end="00:13:04.120" style="s2">a couple of creating initiatives I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.090" end="00:13:07.150" style="s2">involved on Barney&#39;s business unit here</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.120" end="00:13:07.630" style="s2">in Moose Jaw they do a neo flight</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.150" end="00:13:09.430" style="s2">training</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.630" end="00:13:12.190" style="s2">that&#39;s what countries from all over the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.430" end="00:13:17.200" style="s2">world calling the important Britain and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.190" end="00:13:20.560" style="s2">Italy that are in NATO and they they</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.200" end="00:13:23.830" style="s2">came out with this achieving excellence</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.560" end="00:13:26.170" style="s2">program as a way to engage their</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.830" end="00:13:28.210" style="s2">employees and it was it was really well</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.170" end="00:13:31.110" style="s2">researched it was just not well</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.210" end="00:13:33.610" style="s2">delivered so was as if they were</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.110" end="00:13:36.430" style="s2">recognizing that a better way to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.610" end="00:13:40.950" style="s2">things was to create an awareness and a</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.430" end="00:13:45.190" style="s2">desire in their in their employees and</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.950" end="00:13:47.770" style="s2">and leverage that with the company&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.190" end="00:13:49.480" style="s2">mission and vision but there was some</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.770" end="00:13:51.640" style="s2">disconnect they couldn&#39;t quite do it</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.480" end="00:13:54.790" style="s2">there they didn&#39;t get the buy-in and</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.640" end="00:13:56.650" style="s2">when they rolled it out they it was as</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.790" end="00:14:00.220" style="s2">if the people who were rolling it out</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.650" end="00:14:03.250" style="s2">were saying this is something we need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.220" end="00:14:04.810" style="s2">do to please the bosses because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.250" end="00:14:07.510" style="s2">getting graded on this so there was a</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.810" end="00:14:10.840" style="s2">disconnect but I was surprised but left</p>

<p begin="00:14:10.840" end="00:14:18.190" style="s2">connected the dots just to say that</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.300" end="00:14:22.030" style="s2">somebody has to see where their work</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.190" end="00:14:24.850" style="s2">matters they they have to know that</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.030" end="00:14:31.120" style="s2">they&#39;re being listened to and there has</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.850" end="00:14:35.080" style="s2">to be a way of a robust way of gathering</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.120" end="00:14:38.980" style="s2">all of that information and kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.080" end="00:14:42.250" style="s2">active listening way put it back to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.980" end="00:14:44.830" style="s2">employee so it was it was like a great</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.250" end="00:14:47.650" style="s2">great idea but the execution was flawed</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.830" end="00:14:49.839" style="s2">so to me it&#39;s like there&#39;s that new way</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.650" end="00:14:51.460" style="s2">of being is in there it&#39;s already in</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.839" end="00:14:52.430" style="s2">there people recognize it they just</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.460" end="00:14:58.510" style="s2">don&#39;t recognize it</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.430" end="00:15:01.399" style="s2">level I&#39;ll say the worth of a machine</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.510" end="00:15:03.350" style="s2">you know what they don&#39;t quite they</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.399" end="00:15:08.750" style="s2">haven&#39;t quite raised it to that level so</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.350" end="00:15:11.149" style="s2">to me that&#39;s promising you have any</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.750" end="00:15:14.120" style="s2">closing thoughts for this section on how</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.149" end="00:15:15.740" style="s2">the world currently works and no</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.120" end="00:15:18.170" style="s2">actually I would say I thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.740" end="00:15:21.470" style="s2">really interesting the graph that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.170" end="00:15:23.750" style="s2">showed about skill and desire and which</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.470" end="00:15:28.250" style="s2">is another and the other side of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.750" end="00:15:30.459" style="s2">echo and you have value money and wealth</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.250" end="00:15:32.839" style="s2">and then you on the other side of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.459" end="00:15:35.120" style="s2">sort of like the structural situation</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.839" end="00:15:38.180" style="s2">then from the perspective of the person</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.120" end="00:15:40.940" style="s2">having the skill the desire and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.180" end="00:15:43.010" style="s2">awareness and and also that led me to</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.940" end="00:15:44.930" style="s2">think about the connection it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.010" end="00:15:48.320" style="s2">when you have the desire when you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.930" end="00:15:51.890" style="s2">the this cure and the awareness why</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.320" end="00:15:53.660" style="s2">don&#39;t what can&#39;t you get the job so that</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.890" end="00:15:56.080" style="s2">filter there it&#39;s like right now we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.660" end="00:15:58.490" style="s2">people that have all that meet all these</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.080" end="00:16:01.400" style="s2">qualities but they need to go through</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.490" end="00:16:04.400" style="s2">this funnel in order to be placed in</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.400" end="00:16:08.420" style="s2">different and different positions so</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.400" end="00:16:09.760" style="s2">that&#39;s one one one thing that came into</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.420" end="00:16:11.570" style="s2">my mind when you were talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.760" end="00:16:14.750" style="s2">right thank you</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.570" end="00:16:17.390" style="s2">so now we can switch into our beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.750" end="00:16:20.240" style="s2">version of the future in your ideal</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.390" end="00:16:22.339" style="s2">world what would labor look like either</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.240" end="00:16:25.400" style="s2">for you for the account for the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.339" end="00:16:27.650" style="s2">the economy or for both sever would like</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.400" end="00:16:30.200" style="s2">to start I have lots of thoughts on this</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.650" end="00:16:33.070" style="s2">as well which is why I&#39;ve been sitting</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.200" end="00:16:33.070" style="s2">with this for so haha</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.250" end="00:16:41.630" style="s2">go ahead Ben alright to me my version of</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.350" end="00:16:45.980" style="s2">the future doesn&#39;t tie it together our</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.630" end="00:16:48.140" style="s2">knee our needs and our desire to do to</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.980" end="00:16:50.510" style="s2">contribute in the world I want every</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.140" end="00:16:52.490" style="s2">human beings needs to be met and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.510" end="00:16:54.440" style="s2">makes sure that they are fed and clothed</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.490" end="00:16:56.990" style="s2">and housed and educated and connected</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.440" end="00:16:59.029" style="s2">while at the same time fine you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.990" end="00:17:01.279" style="s2">their unique contribution to the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.029" end="00:17:02.690" style="s2">that may or may not be profitable may or</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.279" end="00:17:04.250" style="s2">may not be something that other people</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.690" end="00:17:07.490" style="s2">value to put money on right</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.250" end="00:17:09.890" style="s2">you might be a teacher teaching someone</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.490" end="00:17:15.380" style="s2">who can&#39;t afford the the tuition and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.890" end="00:17:17.510" style="s2">separating the individuals needs making</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.380" end="00:17:20.420" style="s2">sure those are met and then making sure</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.510" end="00:17:23.630" style="s2">also that everything gets done within</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.420" end="00:17:26.089" style="s2">society is dealing with that graph it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.630" end="00:17:27.800" style="s2">instead of paying people finding the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.089" end="00:17:30.290" style="s2">people who wants to do the work if</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.800" end="00:17:32.660" style="s2">someone wants to do the work they are</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.290" end="00:17:34.010" style="s2">willing to do it for free if their needs</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.660" end="00:17:36.440" style="s2">are met they don&#39;t need to necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.010" end="00:17:38.200" style="s2">get paid if they want to if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.440" end="00:17:40.490" style="s2">have enough skilled people to do it</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.200" end="00:17:42.590" style="s2">making sure there&#39;s enough people going</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.490" end="00:17:45.470" style="s2">through the education system for that</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.590" end="00:17:47.120" style="s2">specific task and if they just aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.470" end="00:17:49.190" style="s2">aware that the task needs to get done</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.120" end="00:17:51.500" style="s2">that is the simplest one as I said and</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.190" end="00:17:55.520" style="s2">then where we&#39;ve concentrated on that</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.500" end="00:17:57.230" style="s2">we&#39;ve let people have their they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.520" end="00:17:59.090" style="s2">calling their unique contribution and</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.230" end="00:18:00.620" style="s2">stuff just doesn&#39;t get done like we look</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.090" end="00:18:03.320" style="s2">at the world when potholes aren&#39;t filled</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.620" end="00:18:05.750" style="s2">then you start doing external motivation</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.320" end="00:18:07.280" style="s2">and incentivization hopefully beyond</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.750" end="00:18:08.870" style="s2">money in my perfect world where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.280" end="00:18:10.580" style="s2">maybe like you get a concert to your</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.870" end="00:18:12.530" style="s2">favorite artists they they&#39;re sponsoring</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.580" end="00:18:14.360" style="s2">pothole filling and people help fill</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.530" end="00:18:16.250" style="s2">potholes or just asking what would get</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.360" end="00:18:18.440" style="s2">you to want to fill a pothole what would</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.250" end="00:18:20.480" style="s2">how many is it making it fun having</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.440" end="00:18:22.850" style="s2">music live events there knowing how to</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.480" end="00:18:24.140" style="s2">do it doing it one time in one time only</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.850" end="00:18:26.960" style="s2">you&#39;re becoming skilled at it that</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.140" end="00:18:28.250" style="s2">everyone has their unique sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.960" end="00:18:29.750" style="s2">in that like what would bring it what</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.250" end="00:18:33.980" style="s2">would make it fulfilling for them to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.750" end="00:18:37.460" style="s2">those things and so for me I I want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.980" end="00:18:40.370" style="s2">untie this this time exchanging your</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.460" end="00:18:42.230" style="s2">time for money and instead having it be</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.370" end="00:18:44.210" style="s2">a world where you&#39;re choosing what to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.230" end="00:18:45.440" style="s2">with your time which I think does bring</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.210" end="00:18:47.600" style="s2">you into your highest calling and</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.440" end="00:18:50.030" style="s2">contribution and then your needs are</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.600" end="00:18:53.300" style="s2">also being met efficiently with groups</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.030" end="00:18:55.160" style="s2">of people and like I said incentive I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.300" end="00:18:56.600" style="s2">seen externally when needed but not</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.160" end="00:18:58.160" style="s2">starting they&#39;re not starting at that</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.600" end="00:18:59.450" style="s2">place once the systems in place as</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.160" end="00:19:00.920" style="s2">clearly this is in a world like we</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.450" end="00:19:03.170" style="s2">couldn&#39;t do this right now in this world</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.920" end="00:19:04.520" style="s2">but it is happening like right now there</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.170" end="00:19:05.780" style="s2">are so many people doing good in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.520" end="00:19:07.460" style="s2">world and they&#39;re doing it for free</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.780" end="00:19:08.900" style="s2">they&#39;re you know artists that make</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.460" end="00:19:10.100" style="s2">millions of dollars or putting on live</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.900" end="00:19:11.810" style="s2">concert so in their living room because</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.100" end="00:19:13.580" style="s2">what they want to do with their time and</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.810" end="00:19:15.920" style="s2">teachers who are you know putting out</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.580" end="00:19:17.260" style="s2">videos to to teach even if they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.920" end="00:19:19.210" style="s2">doing that beforehand now that</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.260" end="00:19:21.580" style="s2">you have the time and they already had</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.210" end="00:19:23.920" style="s2">the skill they&#39;re willing to to step</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.580" end="00:19:26.020" style="s2">into that into that role and so that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.920" end="00:19:32.290" style="s2">a bit of my vision of what I would like</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.020" end="00:19:34.750" style="s2">to see in 10 to 20 years and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.290" end="00:19:37.390" style="s2">know if I&#39;ve you good people okay I can</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.750" end="00:19:43.740" style="s2">I meet you and then I think mark metered</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.390" end="00:19:43.740" style="s2">himself right I have seen your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.400" end="00:19:48.760" style="s2">before you go they don&#39;t need to match</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.900" end="00:19:50.560" style="s2">so you don&#39;t need to like this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.760" end="00:19:51.730" style="s2">impossible for mine it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.560" end="00:19:56.440" style="s2">version of the future what is your</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.730" end="00:19:59.590" style="s2">vision of the future I that&#39;s great that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.440" end="00:20:03.940" style="s2">you mention it just like it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.590" end="00:20:07.450" style="s2">that that I had similar thoughts in</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.940" end="00:20:10.830" style="s2">terms of decoupling these money from</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.450" end="00:20:13.780" style="s2">from meeting the needs in my ideal world</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.830" end="00:20:16.030" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t have to worry about shelter</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.780" end="00:20:19.300" style="s2">and clothing and they&#39;ve got basic cost</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.030" end="00:20:21.100" style="s2">of education and making you know the end</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.300" end="00:20:23.410" style="s2">of the month and groceries and things</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.100" end="00:20:27.870" style="s2">like that like your needs should be met</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.410" end="00:20:32.350" style="s2">and with whatever means necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.870" end="00:20:34.840" style="s2">that should free you up to to think what</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.350" end="00:20:36.790" style="s2">and and feel what what is right for you</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.840" end="00:20:39.100" style="s2">what is your unique capacity I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.790" end="00:20:42.390" style="s2">that is very very connected to education</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.100" end="00:20:46.300" style="s2">which with how you brought up and what</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.390" end="00:20:48.610" style="s2">what your possibilities hard to explore</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.300" end="00:20:51.280" style="s2">and discover what is actually fulfilling</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.610" end="00:20:54.180" style="s2">to you what you can do what you want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.280" end="00:20:58.150" style="s2">do and you skill to know and bring that</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.180" end="00:21:01.900" style="s2">to offer to other people in society and</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.150" end="00:21:06.970" style="s2">that you don&#39;t need to get paid for that</p>

<p begin="00:21:06.970" end="00:21:12.220" style="s2">will be ideal and then you can also</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.160" end="00:21:14.440" style="s2">choose to collaborate way when you see</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.220" end="00:21:16.390" style="s2">the need in and this idea brings of</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.440" end="00:21:20.260" style="s2">actions they know this idea of passion</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.390" end="00:21:21.880" style="s2">and then many people talk about you</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.260" end="00:21:23.710" style="s2">should do well when you&#39;re passionate</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.880" end="00:21:25.060" style="s2">about and that doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.710" end="00:21:27.760" style="s2">something that makes you necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.060" end="00:21:30.640" style="s2">happy or completely fulfilled</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.760" end="00:21:33.130" style="s2">sometimes passion is the drive to solve</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.640" end="00:21:34.840" style="s2">that you believe in for example I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.130" end="00:21:36.940" style="s2">that we should you know clean up this</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.840" end="00:21:40.540" style="s2">river is something that you like to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.940" end="00:21:41.800" style="s2">in reality like picking out garbage or</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.540" end="00:21:46.810" style="s2">things like that no but something that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.800" end="00:21:48.660" style="s2">you really believe in so and that is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.810" end="00:21:51.940" style="s2">other thing so it&#39;s like having your</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.660" end="00:21:54.550" style="s2">your needs met being able to choose</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.940" end="00:21:57.130" style="s2">without having to think about money or</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.550" end="00:21:59.020" style="s2">making it to the end of month what you</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.130" end="00:22:02.290" style="s2">want to do and how you want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.020" end="00:22:06.310" style="s2">collaborate and that is more or less</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.290" end="00:22:08.770" style="s2">what my ideal looks like that with their</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.310" end="00:22:10.360" style="s2">opportunity to keep on learning to</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.770" end="00:22:15.000" style="s2">always keep on learning improving</p>

<p begin="00:22:15.000" end="00:22:19.240" style="s2">contrast with what you might have now</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.440" end="00:22:20.890" style="s2">that it&#39;s like you kind of stuck in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.240" end="00:22:23.490" style="s2">road and and and then it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.890" end="00:22:26.320" style="s2">difficult to switch and that flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.490" end="00:22:29.620" style="s2">when you decouple it from from from</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.320" end="00:22:31.810" style="s2">money and having to to earn a paycheck</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.620" end="00:22:34.110" style="s2">that opens up a whole world of new</p>

<p begin="00:23:04.430" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">I&#39;ve done that for a little bit it</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.770" end="00:23:13.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of negative things that</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:16.320" style="s2">come out of that just are not good for</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.950" end="00:23:19.170" style="s2">anyone there are some good things I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.320" end="00:23:23.100" style="s2">there&#39;s something to be said for you</p>

<p begin="00:23:36.690" end="00:23:39.810" style="s2">thought was possible</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.950" end="00:23:43.800" style="s2">I think there&#39;s something to be said for</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.810" end="00:23:47.790" style="s2">that but just the system of the way it</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.800" end="00:23:52.020" style="s2">is now produces this this huge</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.790" end="00:23:55.040" style="s2">inequalities and then just so I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.020" end="00:23:59.460" style="s2">there has to be a different driver and</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.040" end="00:24:04.100" style="s2">for me the the drivers that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.460" end="00:24:09.420" style="s2">resonate for me is wanting to move</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.100" end="00:24:15.780" style="s2">society forward wanting the best for me</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.420" end="00:24:18.570" style="s2">my future sells my community and the</p>

<p begin="00:24:32.270" end="00:24:36.180" style="s2">become the richest person in the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.290" end="00:24:38.790" style="s2">and everybody else is starving outside</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.180" end="00:24:39.410" style="s2">me that&#39;s not my miss best experience in</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.790" end="00:24:42.720" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.410" end="00:24:46.230" style="s2">there really isn&#39;t you can feel it I can</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.720" end="00:24:47.940" style="s2">just feel it in my body so I I would</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.230" end="00:24:51.070" style="s2">like to see the generator where it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.940" end="00:24:52.509" style="s2">that there is</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.070" end="00:24:57.880" style="s2">fell sensing your body like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.509" end="00:25:02.049" style="s2">participatory knowing that that person</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.880" end="00:25:04.029" style="s2">who is homeless may have the solution</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.049" end="00:25:09.039" style="s2">that helps us get through the next mess</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.029" end="00:25:12.149" style="s2">period so it&#39;s not like I feel I said a</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.039" end="00:25:17.289" style="s2">conscious a consciousness thing or a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.149" end="00:25:20.320" style="s2">conscience it&#39;s like I know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.289" end="00:25:21.580" style="s2">something that is risking my future in</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.320" end="00:25:26.429" style="s2">my children&#39;s future</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.580" end="00:25:30.159" style="s2">if I let somebody start to death and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.429" end="00:25:33.970" style="s2">fail to bring their brilliant potential</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.159" end="00:25:38.220" style="s2">into the world so I&#39;d like to see that</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.970" end="00:25:42.190" style="s2">be the driver of and understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.220" end="00:25:44.860" style="s2">the world needs to look like what you</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.190" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">both just described but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.860" end="00:25:58.389" style="s2">understanding that it needs to be that</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:26:04.179" style="s2">way for our best experience so if if</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.389" end="00:26:08.129" style="s2">that was a generator then people would</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.179" end="00:26:14.799" style="s2">find a way to make sure that that person</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.129" end="00:26:18.730" style="s2">has the best opportunity to bring their</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.799" end="00:26:22.330" style="s2">brilliance to the world while making</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.730" end="00:26:31.570" style="s2">sure that everyone&#39;s fed and taken care</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.330" end="00:26:34.990" style="s2">of so then that generator would I guess</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.570" end="00:26:37.240" style="s2">some things the way of the living would</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.990" end="00:26:41.080" style="s2">emerge out of that making sure</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.240" end="00:26:43.870" style="s2">everything is taken care of so in my</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.080" end="00:26:46.960" style="s2">perfect world everybody has that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.870" end="00:26:50.529" style="s2">awareness that if I see somebody in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.960" end="00:26:52.240" style="s2">street that is struggling there is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.529" end="00:26:54.879" style="s2">potential risk that that might be the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.240" end="00:26:59.710" style="s2">one grain of sand that tips the scales</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.879" end="00:27:01.600" style="s2">towards hell rather than towards you</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.710" end="00:27:03.730" style="s2">know just kind of paradise on earth that</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.600" end="00:27:04.429" style="s2">where everybody&#39;s able to do the work</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.730" end="00:27:09.659" style="s2">that thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.429" end="00:27:16.679" style="s2">the that reflects their best self I</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.659" end="00:27:18.600" style="s2">guess so to me that that world of that</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.679" end="00:27:22.169" style="s2">would under girl the undergird of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.600" end="00:27:26.399" style="s2">word the world of labour and allow all</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.169" end="00:27:29.549" style="s2">those things to happen anyways I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.399" end="00:27:35.639" style="s2">know it&#39;s kind of out in left field</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.549" end="00:27:37.379" style="s2">maybe but that&#39;s for me that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.639" end="00:27:39.480" style="s2">the basic said that was the basics</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.379" end="00:27:40.769" style="s2">behind when I looked at Bombardier as</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.480" end="00:27:43.649" style="s2">achieving excellence that&#39;s the way I</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.769" end="00:27:47.549" style="s2">looked at it when I chaired meetings</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.649" end="00:27:49.620" style="s2">like I often would go to someone and ask</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.549" end="00:27:54.299" style="s2">them if they had a dissenting opinion</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.620" end="00:27:57.690" style="s2">trying to get to the heart of what was</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.299" end="00:27:59.940" style="s2">behind their dissenting opinion with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.690" end="00:28:05.279" style="s2">idea that this person might be the one</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.940" end="00:28:07.830" style="s2">helping us to avoid disaster so then if</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.279" end="00:28:10.980" style="s2">if we looked at everyone like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.830" end="00:28:14.100" style="s2">especially the artists the artists you</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.980" end="00:28:15.570" style="s2">can&#39;t monetize what they brave but you</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.100" end="00:28:17.340" style="s2">want them to bring it even though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.570" end="00:28:20.070" style="s2">different from your vision you want them</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.340" end="00:28:23.490" style="s2">to bring it because they might give you</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.070" end="00:28:28.259" style="s2">something that you you know no other way</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.490" end="00:28:29.269" style="s2">about of achieving enemies I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.259" end="00:28:31.500" style="s2">of anything</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.269" end="00:28:35.039" style="s2">spark you added a lot and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.500" end="00:28:38.009" style="s2">that is a good you know the future is</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.039" end="00:28:41.000" style="s2">where we do see the value in other human</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.009" end="00:28:45.389" style="s2">beings every human being has Worth and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.000" end="00:28:47.159" style="s2">even if I&#39;m acting selfishly the best</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.389" end="00:28:49.440" style="s2">thing I can do for myself and my child</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.159" end="00:28:51.210" style="s2">is to make sure everyone is looked after</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.440" end="00:28:54.299" style="s2">for exactly the reason you said they</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.210" end="00:28:56.820" style="s2">could be the solution and right now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.299" end="00:28:58.860" style="s2">seeing a lot of extreme ableism and</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.820" end="00:29:01.200" style="s2">ageism of like well we can&#39;t shut down</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.860" end="00:29:02.250" style="s2">the economy for the people over 85 and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.200" end="00:29:03.779" style="s2">like whatever they already have</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.250" end="00:29:07.950" style="s2">pre-existing conditions already putting</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.779" end="00:29:10.440" style="s2">a lot of money into them and I believe</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.950" end="00:29:11.909" style="s2">that those very people the the elders of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.440" end="00:29:13.830" style="s2">course have knowledge because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.909" end="00:29:16.500" style="s2">been here for longer than anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.830" end="00:29:17.730" style="s2">but including the people who have</p>

<p begin="00:29:17.730" end="00:29:23.070" style="s2">and and such have a different life</p>

<p begin="00:29:31.680" end="00:29:39.690" style="s2">and so to lose that that what we look at</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.930" end="00:29:41.580" style="s2">is the weak portion of our society when</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.690" end="00:29:43.500" style="s2">in reality they&#39;re they might be</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.580" end="00:29:45.210" style="s2">physically weak their immune system</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.500" end="00:29:47.610" style="s2">might be weak their lungs might be weak</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.210" end="00:29:49.740" style="s2">but they are not weak and they have so</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.610" end="00:29:52.410" style="s2">much to give and they&#39;re theirs</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.740" end="00:29:54.330" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna lose a lot I am gonna lose a</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.410" end="00:29:56.160" style="s2">lot by other people you are gonna lose a</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.330" end="00:29:57.750" style="s2">lot by other people dying who might</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.160" end="00:29:59.100" style="s2">either people who solve cancer might be</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.750" end="00:30:00.270" style="s2">the people who know how to clean up the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.100" end="00:30:01.980" style="s2">ocean it might be the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.270" end="00:30:04.410" style="s2">just there for us and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.980" end="00:30:07.470" style="s2">through a hard time and to honor that</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.410" end="00:30:09.930" style="s2">that every human being has potential and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.470" end="00:30:15.510" style="s2">to allow that to to emerge is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.930" end="00:30:17.340" style="s2">a part of my beautiful future anything</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.510" end="00:30:20.610" style="s2">you&#39;d like to add Alejandra or mark</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.340" end="00:30:26.220" style="s2">before we go on to the ten the adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.610" end="00:30:29.160" style="s2">possible right now I also feel to say</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.220" end="00:30:32.940" style="s2">the same way in that respect like the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.160" end="00:30:35.520" style="s2">police they raelia that it has to be the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.940" end="00:30:42.750" style="s2">best the best possible situation for</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.520" end="00:30:45.990" style="s2">everybody and no I don&#39;t like compassion</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.750" end="00:30:49.310" style="s2">for an empathy for other people and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.990" end="00:30:52.080" style="s2">also like if we have to collaborate on</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.310" end="00:30:55.860" style="s2">everybody all together the better we</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.080" end="00:30:58.590" style="s2">collectively are the better we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.860" end="00:31:01.140" style="s2">progress together this is the part of</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.590" end="00:31:03.300" style="s2">that scalability of the system like and</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.140" end="00:31:06.480" style="s2">exponential technologies and exponential</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.300" end="00:31:10.140" style="s2">problems and we have to consider the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.480" end="00:31:12.290" style="s2">whole and in this single person more</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.140" end="00:31:14.730" style="s2">than could be like the tipping point it</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.290" end="00:31:16.890" style="s2">could be that that person that has the</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.730" end="00:31:20.880" style="s2">solution but that person is also very</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.890" end="00:31:22.950" style="s2">good in and of itself and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.880" end="00:31:25.650" style="s2">that&#39;s very very powerful what she said</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.950" end="00:31:27.210" style="s2">mark and then I often think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.650" end="00:31:29.520" style="s2">interesting this idea of wait and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.210" end="00:31:31.190" style="s2">because they they agreed and we struggle</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.520" end="00:31:33.700" style="s2">and it helped us</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.190" end="00:31:35.990" style="s2">calm maybe there is some other way maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.700" end="00:31:38.900" style="s2">maybe they the world lies imagine it</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.990" end="00:31:41.150" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s ideal but it&#39;s not perfect</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.900" end="00:31:45.770" style="s2">so there is always the potential for</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.150" end="00:31:47.990" style="s2">transformation and and and and me maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.770" end="00:31:53.690" style="s2">there is struggle but it doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.990" end="00:31:56.240" style="s2">be such a difficult one or not not the</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.690" end="00:31:59.270" style="s2">level of difficulty and cruelty that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:32:01.310" style="s2">might experience right now but I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.270" end="00:32:05.810" style="s2">they we said something to be said about</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.310" end="00:32:09.050" style="s2">quit and and and this related to to push</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.810" end="00:32:12.890" style="s2">through something and come out better</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.050" end="00:32:17.170" style="s2">and so that&#39;s something that I I take as</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.890" end="00:32:17.170" style="s2">well to think about them and consider</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.560" end="00:32:22.970" style="s2">thank you we both unmuted you at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.810" end="00:32:25.040" style="s2">same time er there&#39;s a little there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.970" end="00:32:26.720" style="s2">little chirp on your ends when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.040" end="00:32:30.740" style="s2">not talking so that&#39;s why I keep muting</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.720" end="00:32:36.080" style="s2">music oh yeah I just wanted to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.740" end="00:32:39.290" style="s2">on what Alejandra said about there who</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.080" end="00:32:41.660" style="s2">needs to be that struggle but there</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.290" end="00:32:45.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to be added in the level</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.660" end="00:32:47.510" style="s2">Isis it&#39;s like allowing the caterpillar</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.260" end="00:32:50.360" style="s2">to break its way out of the chrysalis so</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.510" end="00:32:51.860" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t die if you help the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.360" end="00:32:53.510" style="s2">caterpillar to break out of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.860" end="00:32:54.860" style="s2">chrysalis its wings don&#39;t become strong</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.510" end="00:32:57.590" style="s2">enough and if the struggles and dies</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.860" end="00:32:59.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a horrifying thing but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.590" end="00:33:02.390" style="s2">time you don&#39;t want to pinch the</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.480" end="00:33:05.630" style="s2">chrysalis so much that that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.390" end="00:33:09.020" style="s2">butterfly never emerges so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.630" end="00:33:18.770" style="s2">an awareness of that not adding</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.020" end="00:33:21.380" style="s2">malevolence to to a natural somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.770" end="00:33:24.170" style="s2">natural journey which that happens every</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.380" end="00:33:27.370" style="s2">day we see malevolence in our way and</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.170" end="00:33:31.240" style="s2">and we inadvertently accurate like</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.370" end="00:33:34.550" style="s2">everyone does some more than others some</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.240" end="00:33:40.700" style="s2">but I think I like that drawing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.550" end="00:33:44.090" style="s2">distinction I think that&#39;s so now we can</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.700" end="00:33:44.870" style="s2">transition to the the last section which</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.090" end="00:33:47.840" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.870" end="00:33:49.730" style="s2">creating the adjacent possible so what</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.840" end="00:33:51.590" style="s2">could we create together that hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.730" end="00:33:54.050" style="s2">no single one of us could create it by</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.590" end="00:33:55.670" style="s2">ourselves like just the idea if we had</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.050" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">ten thousand people and a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.670" end="00:33:58.880" style="s2">thousand dollars and created something</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:02.270" style="s2">that was voluntary that was a natural</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.880" end="00:34:04.400" style="s2">attractor that wasn&#39;t about enforcing</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.270" end="00:34:06.050" style="s2">our desire for a perfect world on other</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.400" end="00:34:10.120" style="s2">people but something we could create</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.050" end="00:34:12.830" style="s2">that would bring bring people in and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.120" end="00:34:14.300" style="s2">think that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.830" end="00:34:19.310" style="s2">what could we create but 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.300" end="00:34:22.340" style="s2">and $100,000 that helps in this position</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.310" end="00:34:24.770" style="s2">either the the need for things to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.340" end="00:34:27.409" style="s2">done in the economy that jobs that are</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.770" end="00:34:31.159" style="s2">essential how do we get them done and or</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.409" end="00:34:33.620" style="s2">how do we get people to fulfill their</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.159" end="00:34:35.179" style="s2">purpose and their genius whether we</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.620" end="00:34:36.950" style="s2">wanted to use those things art or</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.179" end="00:34:38.419" style="s2">whether we want to and so it can be</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.950" end="00:34:40.610" style="s2">solutions to any of it with all the</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.419" end="00:34:42.440" style="s2">other solution raising it sound like we</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.610" end="00:34:44.720" style="s2">stuck to one solution it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.440" end="00:34:46.159" style="s2">popcorn this could be a possibility and</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.720" end="00:34:49.220" style="s2">this could be a possibility that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.159" end="00:34:51.050" style="s2">there for bird 10,000 people and</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.220" end="00:34:52.700" style="s2">$100,000 they could be people in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.050" end="00:34:55.970" style="s2">same city if that&#39;s necessary or they</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.700" end="00:34:58.730" style="s2">could be people around the world how did</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.970" end="00:35:01.010" style="s2">you come up with that number 10,000 um</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.730" end="00:35:03.530" style="s2">just cuz it&#39;s a doable number it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.010" end="00:35:06.880" style="s2">catastrophic ly huge but it&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.530" end="00:35:09.230" style="s2">that you could create that $100,000 is</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.880" end="00:35:11.300" style="s2">relatively easy it&#39;s not gonna be a high</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.230" end="00:35:14.300" style="s2">risk for any single individual there and</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.300" end="00:35:16.550" style="s2">it helps um like me coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.300" end="00:35:17.840" style="s2">$100,000 would be next to impossible but</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.550" end="00:35:19.490" style="s2">10,000 people coming up with a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.840" end="00:35:24.410" style="s2">thousand isn&#39;t and ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.490" end="00:35:26.870" style="s2">is not extreme it&#39;s not a pie in the sky</p>

<p begin="00:35:31.280" end="00:35:35.570" style="s2">is that it&#39;s like the starting point of</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.220" end="00:35:37.220" style="s2">something is if you had a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.570" end="00:35:39.560" style="s2">thousand of a million dollars I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.220" end="00:35:41.030" style="s2">even better but but it&#39;s it&#39;s starting</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.560" end="00:35:45.580" style="s2">from from this point what could you</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.030" end="00:35:45.580" style="s2">create hmm</p>

<p begin="00:36:22.339" end="00:36:32.970" style="s2">was an extended version of the the</p>

<p begin="00:37:38.730" end="00:37:44.520" style="s2">if we could show people right now how</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.900" end="00:37:49.710" style="s2">they might be useful right where they</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.520" end="00:37:51.960" style="s2">are and do that can continue that on</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.710" end="00:37:55.140" style="s2">into the future in such a way like that</p>

<p begin="00:38:52.170" end="00:38:57.059" style="s2">we don&#39;t and yet all of our current</p>

<p begin="00:39:50.519" end="00:39:55.049" style="s2">so a volunteer coordinating platform</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.309" end="00:39:58.849" style="s2">could be something we can absolutely do</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.049" end="00:40:03.029" style="s2">with 10,000 people and $100,000 or a</p>

<p begin="00:40:15.069" end="00:40:19.299" style="s2">of the other things I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.539" end="00:40:21.759" style="s2">Alejandra who talked about the gig</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.299" end="00:40:24.719" style="s2">economy and although right now during</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.759" end="00:40:26.739" style="s2">this crisis there is so much the</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.719" end="00:40:28.059" style="s2">transportation is still part of the gig</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.739" end="00:40:30.699" style="s2">economy right getting goods to people</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.059" end="00:40:33.400" style="s2">getting rest getting that stuff made but</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.699" end="00:40:35.380" style="s2">the profit doesn&#39;t go to the restaurant</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.400" end="00:40:36.670" style="s2">and in fact it costs restaurants a lot</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.380" end="00:40:38.709" style="s2">to have their food delivered and it</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.670" end="00:40:40.180" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go to the driver and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.709" end="00:40:44.079" style="s2">go to the person using it it goes to</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.180" end="00:40:47.819" style="s2">shareholders in uber in TaskRabbit in</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.079" end="00:40:50.469" style="s2">all these places creating a platform for</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.819" end="00:40:52.539" style="s2">10,000 people focusing on one industry</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.469" end="00:40:55.329" style="s2">and saying hey here&#39;s our platform for</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.539" end="00:40:58.359" style="s2">plumbers or our platform for post</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.329" end="00:41:03.219" style="s2">cleaners and coordinating it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.359" end="00:41:06.930" style="s2">that it both brings the the cost for the</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.219" end="00:41:09.489" style="s2">the consumer the user down and gives the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.930" end="00:41:12.849" style="s2">worker a higher wage or a higher</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.489" end="00:41:14.140" style="s2">resource capacity is what we can do</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.849" end="00:41:17.140" style="s2">together and we&#39;re not stuffing it off</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.140" end="00:41:19.930" style="s2">the profit for for shareholders so if we</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.140" end="00:41:21.400" style="s2">had a labor platform where when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.930" end="00:41:23.099" style="s2">part of it you&#39;re both self-employed</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.400" end="00:41:25.390" style="s2">right like I&#39;m my own employee you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.099" end="00:41:28.569" style="s2">housecleaning for someone else but I can</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.390" end="00:41:30.309" style="s2">also tap into a like a union of</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.569" end="00:41:31.719" style="s2">self-employed people right we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.309" end="00:41:34.059" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to go out and find your</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.719" end="00:41:35.499" style="s2">work we can find you work you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.059" end="00:41:36.999" style="s2">clean for all the houses in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.499" end="00:41:39.190" style="s2">neighborhood on this day so it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.999" end="00:41:40.930" style="s2">efficient and you&#39;re making 25 bucks an</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.190" end="00:41:42.459" style="s2">hour but you&#39;re making 25 bucks an hour</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.930" end="00:41:43.839" style="s2">right maybe you&#39;re paying five bucks a</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.459" end="00:41:46.690" style="s2">month to use the platform or something</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.839" end="00:41:51.489" style="s2">and so creating it in a way where it</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.690" end="00:41:52.900" style="s2">empowers the individual and also we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.489" end="00:41:55.299" style="s2">solve problems together but there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.900" end="00:41:56.979" style="s2">all this there there&#39;s a natural tension</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.299" end="00:41:58.989" style="s2">between someone giving the laborer and</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.979" end="00:42:02.170" style="s2">someone using the labor but the more</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.989" end="00:42:05.229" style="s2">that we can problem solve that together</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.170" end="00:42:06.579" style="s2">like hey if you want a house cleaner to</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.229" end="00:42:07.779" style="s2">come on your schedule you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.579" end="00:42:10.089" style="s2">to pay them a premium but if you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.779" end="00:42:11.619" style="s2">come on their schedule if you can you</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.089" end="00:42:12.729" style="s2">know be in their in your area on Mondays</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.619" end="00:42:15.069" style="s2">if you let them clean your house and</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.729" end="00:42:16.869" style="s2">Monday you get $1 per hour off or $5 per</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.069" end="00:42:18.069" style="s2">hour off and they&#39;re not having to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.869" end="00:42:21.249" style="s2">all this travel time but there&#39;s ways to</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.069" end="00:42:23.650" style="s2">coordinate labor and bring the cost down</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.249" end="00:42:26.019" style="s2">for the person needs the labor and</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.650" end="00:42:26.950" style="s2">bringing the hourly wage up for the</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.019" end="00:42:29.950" style="s2">person and</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.950" end="00:42:31.390" style="s2">I mean our buying power in a way where</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.950" end="00:42:32.650" style="s2">you could have medical insurance you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.390" end="00:42:33.820" style="s2">have dental you can have health you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.650" end="00:42:35.290" style="s2">have disability you can have all of</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.820" end="00:42:37.540" style="s2">these things because you&#39;re buying them</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.290" end="00:42:38.890" style="s2">together and making sure that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.540" end="00:42:41.400" style="s2">we&#39;re taking care of one another and</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.890" end="00:42:44.829" style="s2">then we already have a four of</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.400" end="00:42:47.320" style="s2">foundation of people to coordinate how</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.829" end="00:42:49.900" style="s2">do we bring down our cost of living but</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.320" end="00:42:52.510" style="s2">that&#39;s a little bit the previous section</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.900" end="00:42:53.800" style="s2">of like how do we feed ourselves for</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.510" end="00:42:55.900" style="s2">less and less money how do we close</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.800" end="00:42:58.210" style="s2">ourselves for less and less money which</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.900" end="00:43:00.760" style="s2">is the reason we&#39;re working but those</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.210" end="00:43:02.170" style="s2">are all different solution raisings like</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.760" end="00:43:11.320" style="s2">how do we how do we do those things</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.170" end="00:43:13.720" style="s2">without needing jobs yeah this very</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.320" end="00:43:15.790" style="s2">interesting there I think that like hey</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.720" end="00:43:18.160" style="s2">sorry I&#39;m I&#39;m speaking Spanglish now I</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.790" end="00:43:23.829" style="s2">just went a Widow&#39;s a few Spanish words</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.160" end="00:43:25.270" style="s2">and they they are like two things that</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.829" end="00:43:28.570" style="s2">could be done and they are very</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.270" end="00:43:32.910" style="s2">interesting both of them one is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.570" end="00:43:37.540" style="s2">volunteer area it&#39;s super interesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.910" end="00:43:40.329" style="s2">because it it helps people do things</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.540" end="00:43:43.210" style="s2">that they want to do and they feel that</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.329" end="00:43:46.930" style="s2">makes them feel useful and and and has</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.210" end="00:43:49.000" style="s2">like an emotional payoff even if there</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.930" end="00:43:50.650" style="s2">is no money there is no nothing else</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.000" end="00:43:52.089" style="s2">that you get the pay office and you did</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.650" end="00:43:55.329" style="s2">something that actually helps and</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.089" end="00:43:57.099" style="s2">provides value and that is very</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.329" end="00:44:01.300" style="s2">interesting if you can be scalable as</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.099" end="00:44:04.690" style="s2">Mark said and with connectors and local</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.300" end="00:44:09.130" style="s2">communities because has much more impact</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.690" end="00:44:11.680" style="s2">and and much more reach and that&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.130" end="00:44:14.079" style="s2">interesting to explore and see if that</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.680" end="00:44:16.510" style="s2">we time can be transformed into</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.079" end="00:44:20.380" style="s2">something that actually also provides a</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.510" end="00:44:23.650" style="s2">monetary payoff as well on the other</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.380" end="00:44:25.869" style="s2">hand they if you take that in</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.650" end="00:44:28.990" style="s2">transforming into something that</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.869" end="00:44:33.250" style="s2">actually pays and it&#39;s like a collective</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.990" end="00:44:37.569" style="s2">that can help workers and labor it would</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.250" end="00:44:38.950" style="s2">be a little bit more democratic so they</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.569" end="00:44:41.980" style="s2">get they get</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.950" end="00:44:45.250" style="s2">and the money that gets paid yet gets</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.980" end="00:44:48.700" style="s2">like to the laborer and and there there</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.250" end="00:44:50.829" style="s2">are no middleman and taking chunks of</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.700" end="00:44:52.930" style="s2">the pay paycheck and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.829" end="00:44:54.520" style="s2">that&#39;s super interesting as well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.930" end="00:44:57.160" style="s2">the only thing I see there is like it</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.520" end="00:44:59.980" style="s2">starts to get into a competition area</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.160" end="00:45:01.300" style="s2">like there are some tech platforms that</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.980" end="00:45:05.619" style="s2">work like that</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.300" end="00:45:08.560" style="s2">all have sort certain features and they</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.619" end="00:45:11.140" style="s2">they create these distension that it</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.560" end="00:45:13.359" style="s2">could be diffused by by say but not</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.140" end="00:45:15.520" style="s2">having sort of an optimizing algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.359" end="00:45:18.609" style="s2">that has like this person has the best</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.520" end="00:45:22.960" style="s2">rating and and and creating competition</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.609" end="00:45:25.510" style="s2">between people but facilitating the</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.960" end="00:45:27.490" style="s2">connections between the ones that has a</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.510" end="00:45:29.589" style="s2">task to be done and someone that</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.490" end="00:45:33.160" style="s2">actually has the skill and wants to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.589" end="00:45:34.359" style="s2">that and instead but that as an adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.160" end="00:45:38.320" style="s2">possibly it&#39;s very interesting not to</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.359" end="00:45:42.070" style="s2">get rid of all the problems but to start</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.320" end="00:45:45.550" style="s2">creating a safer environment for for</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.070" end="00:45:47.680" style="s2">people so if you go now to a regular</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.550" end="00:45:49.300" style="s2">platform like that&#39;s where I meet or at</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.680" end="00:45:51.810" style="s2">work and then you have to sell yourself</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.300" end="00:45:55.869" style="s2">and you have to do all these things and</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.810" end="00:45:58.420" style="s2">then that might still be needed but if</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.869" end="00:46:00.760" style="s2">you on the other hand can start building</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.420" end="00:46:02.109" style="s2">that capital to say okay so if you here</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.760" end="00:46:04.690" style="s2">we got to make sure that you have</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.109" end="00:46:07.000" style="s2">certain amount of work so it gets sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.690" end="00:46:09.599" style="s2">of evenly distributed somehow oh that</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.000" end="00:46:11.950" style="s2">you get a benefit for then - or like</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.599" end="00:46:15.130" style="s2">certain types of insurance so you get</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.950" end="00:46:17.290" style="s2">some perks that are not necessarily like</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.130" end="00:46:20.020" style="s2">monetary that give you play on this</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.290" end="00:46:22.599" style="s2">feeling safe because what we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.020" end="00:46:25.450" style="s2">sometimes is that feeling that is like</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.599" end="00:46:29.050" style="s2">you are on your own and belonging to a</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.450" end="00:46:31.210" style="s2">platform that a cat or a group that can</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.050" end="00:46:33.339" style="s2">help you in that respect I think it</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.210" end="00:46:35.349" style="s2">would be super valuable already know</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.339" end="00:46:37.869" style="s2">that you just have to go into a platform</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.349" end="00:46:39.880" style="s2">and try to get freelance gigs as much as</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.869" end="00:46:41.859" style="s2">you can because you cannot plan but easy</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.880" end="00:46:45.400" style="s2">give you gives you some peace of mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.859" end="00:46:48.490" style="s2">that so see some sense of security that</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.400" end="00:46:51.839" style="s2">is also already something really</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.490" end="00:46:58.150" style="s2">interesting to explore</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.839" end="00:47:01.599" style="s2">in these two aspects so two ideas could</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.150" end="00:47:04.599" style="s2">be connected as well or drive one into</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.599" end="00:47:06.519" style="s2">the other and it comes to my mind the</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.599" end="00:47:09.930" style="s2">big disruptions as well in the tech</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.519" end="00:47:12.190" style="s2">industry things like Wikipedia that</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.930" end="00:47:14.769" style="s2">before you had all the knowledge in</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.190" end="00:47:16.150" style="s2">Mexico BDS and botanic ethics like that</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.769" end="00:47:19.829" style="s2">a lot sort of people just for free</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.150" end="00:47:23.199" style="s2">started adding to these humongous</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.829" end="00:47:26.289" style="s2">library and then we we have all this</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.199" end="00:47:29.079" style="s2">knowledge is aligning collaboratively we</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.289" end="00:47:32.739" style="s2">keep it keep it updated and improve it</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.079" end="00:47:34.719" style="s2">so there is something there that people</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.739" end="00:47:37.859" style="s2">are willing to do without getting paid</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.719" end="00:47:40.630" style="s2">but actually we have a collective payoff</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.859" end="00:47:42.459" style="s2">I wonder if there is something there in</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.630" end="00:47:48.449" style="s2">the voluntary area that it could also</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.459" end="00:47:51.489" style="s2">and have some some impact in the labor</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.449" end="00:47:54.430" style="s2">area so if you start doing more more</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.489" end="00:47:58.359" style="s2">things get done for free then you need</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.430" end="00:48:01.799" style="s2">less money so in any way it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.359" end="00:48:04.599" style="s2">simplistic right what I&#39;m saying but but</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.799" end="00:48:08.859" style="s2">that&#39;s something to consider I&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.599" end="00:48:13.119" style="s2">very interesting to to explore and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.859" end="00:48:15.729" style="s2">don&#39;t have another idea to add I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.119" end="00:48:17.769" style="s2">I think it&#39;s very interesting these two</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.729" end="00:48:19.630" style="s2">things that came up my first idea was</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.769" end="00:48:22.059" style="s2">also like a platform where we can you</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.630" end="00:48:24.489" style="s2">know connect people but I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.059" end="00:48:27.009" style="s2">two dimensions especially the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.489" end="00:48:30.729" style="s2">connectors and amplifying that mark</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.009" end="00:48:33.420" style="s2">phone up and and these possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.729" end="00:48:38.430" style="s2">connecting volunteering work and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.420" end="00:48:41.680" style="s2">unpaid work are very interesting I love</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.430" end="00:48:42.969" style="s2">helping cuz I don&#39;t know my mine I know</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.680" end="00:48:44.140" style="s2">I&#39;m here to help create a world that</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.969" end="00:48:46.059" style="s2">works for everyone I know I&#39;m here to</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.140" end="00:48:46.930" style="s2">help tech cooperative but I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.059" end="00:48:48.699" style="s2">know how to put that into a job</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.930" end="00:48:51.640" style="s2">description I wouldn&#39;t know how to put</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.699" end="00:48:53.499" style="s2">that into what is what do I uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.640" end="00:48:56.229" style="s2">have to offer that could be compared to</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.499" end="00:48:58.900" style="s2">somebody else and so help in that help</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.229" end="00:49:00.849" style="s2">find you know what is like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.900" end="00:49:02.199" style="s2">running a team and you need a marketer</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.849" end="00:49:03.819" style="s2">you need this and you need that like</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.199" end="00:49:04.390" style="s2">putting those teams together so then</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.819" end="00:49:05.920" style="s2">they can</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.390" end="00:49:07.599" style="s2">move forward and create something a</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.920" end="00:49:11.049" style="s2">volunteer team of like tackling this</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.599" end="00:49:14.589" style="s2">problem and I&#39;m sorry mark are you gonna</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.049" end="00:49:19.480" style="s2">say no I was just gonna ask Alejandra if</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.589" end="00:49:22.329" style="s2">what she foresaw was a platform that</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.480" end="00:49:26.500" style="s2">could possibly grow into those things</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.329" end="00:49:29.019" style="s2">and so what when I envisioned it I</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.500" end="00:49:31.599" style="s2">envisioned like like a radical</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.019" end="00:49:36.460" style="s2">transparency so that people can see</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.599" end="00:49:47.680" style="s2">where every dollar is going right and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.460" end="00:49:52.990" style="s2">if there is if there is competition in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.680" end="00:49:57.190" style="s2">certain area they would have to also</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.990" end="00:50:03.180" style="s2">have this radical transparency and at</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.190" end="00:50:03.180" style="s2">some point if if somebody is going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.230" end="00:50:12.910" style="s2">sign up with somebody being able to see</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.599" end="00:50:17.440" style="s2">everywhere where your your dollar is</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.910" end="00:50:20.410" style="s2">going would force that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.440" end="00:50:22.839" style="s2">natural attractor for a game be control</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.410" end="00:50:24.490" style="s2">of it because I&#39;m gonna go to that</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.839" end="00:50:25.890" style="s2">company that&#39;s kind of helping the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.490" end="00:50:29.710" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.890" end="00:50:31.779" style="s2">taking a fair wage and if they&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.710" end="00:50:34.059" style="s2">the wages they&#39;re taking are too low</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.779" end="00:50:37.299" style="s2">they won&#39;t be able to survive so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.059" end="00:50:38.559" style="s2">want that I want to be able to I want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.299" end="00:50:40.509" style="s2">know that they&#39;re gonna have enough</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.559" end="00:50:43.900" style="s2">money to survive it attract the</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.509" end="00:50:48.700" style="s2">expertise without being too radically</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.900" end="00:50:53.799" style="s2">selfish but also the the idea that it</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.700" end="00:50:56.829" style="s2">could grow into bigger things by saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.799" end="00:51:03.490" style="s2">maybe this is this is what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.829" end="00:51:06.369" style="s2">connect to so we where we&#39;re open to</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.490" end="00:51:09.490" style="s2">blending in an open-source way with</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.369" end="00:51:13.000" style="s2">somebody who is willing to set up an</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.490" end="00:51:16.109" style="s2">insurance plan for us tell us what you</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.000" end="00:51:17.480" style="s2">have and we&#39;ll try and leverage our</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.109" end="00:51:22.369" style="s2">10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.480" end="00:51:28.310" style="s2">whatever is to give this insurance will</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.369" end="00:51:31.609" style="s2">financing or whatever else to meld with</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.310" end="00:51:33.770" style="s2">that is I was wondering if that is what</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.609" end="00:51:39.800" style="s2">Alejandra you were seeing or is that me</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.770" end="00:51:45.109" style="s2">this interpreting now yes I am I also</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.800" end="00:51:50.109" style="s2">saw my in my head it requires this total</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.109" end="00:51:53.119" style="s2">transparency and because then you have</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.109" end="00:51:57.200" style="s2">yeah you see all the mechanisms at work</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.119" end="00:51:59.270" style="s2">and what gets paid to where and why and</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.200" end="00:52:03.609" style="s2">then then you can be accountable for</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.270" end="00:52:07.280" style="s2">everything that happens there so that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.609" end="00:52:09.380" style="s2">it could be at the level of the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.280" end="00:52:12.650" style="s2">like the person that has a job to offer</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.380" end="00:52:14.300" style="s2">or it has to be done and and why is</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.650" end="00:52:16.880" style="s2">saying so much for these tasks and</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.300" end="00:52:19.160" style="s2">exactly how I do that works that also</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.880" end="00:52:21.080" style="s2">could be you such reference that it</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.160" end="00:52:23.180" style="s2">could be used for benchmarking and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.080" end="00:52:28.130" style="s2">say okay this is this is more or less</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.180" end="00:52:29.990" style="s2">what as a price regulation in a way what</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.130" end="00:52:32.450" style="s2">is the standard for these taxes like</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.990" end="00:52:35.990" style="s2">then if something proves to be very</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.450" end="00:52:39.590" style="s2">useful then you will also say hey why is</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.990" end="00:52:40.940" style="s2">he paying solo then I think what you</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.590" end="00:52:42.770" style="s2">said mark it&#39;s very interesting when you</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.940" end="00:52:44.750" style="s2">take it to a level of a company the</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.770" end="00:52:46.760" style="s2">company that is operating like this and</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.750" end="00:52:49.100" style="s2">you want them to survive you want them</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.760" end="00:52:52.940" style="s2">the rights to be high enough so they can</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.100" end="00:52:56.450" style="s2">they they can do well and and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.940" end="00:52:59.240" style="s2">want them to get all the the jobs</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.450" end="00:53:00.950" style="s2">because you also want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.240" end="00:53:02.480" style="s2">distribute them to facilitate the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.950" end="00:53:05.380" style="s2">distribution it&#39;s not something that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.480" end="00:53:07.340" style="s2">have to you can regulate manually and</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.380" end="00:53:11.960" style="s2">but that I think that it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.340" end="00:53:15.890" style="s2">important that in is part of these being</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.960" end="00:53:19.490" style="s2">radical trend radically transparent why</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.890" end="00:53:22.220" style="s2">do they the value comes to to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.490" end="00:53:23.570" style="s2">surface you say more you want them to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.220" end="00:53:27.350" style="s2">well because they are really providing</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.570" end="00:53:30.109" style="s2">value for for with whatever value we</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.350" end="00:53:31.230" style="s2">define is so it has to be good for</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.109" end="00:53:34.330" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.230" end="00:53:36.820" style="s2">the pain well you have to be responsible</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.330" end="00:53:40.180" style="s2">with the environment and I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.820" end="00:53:43.540" style="s2">that a competent loan there is one more</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.180" end="00:53:46.330" style="s2">thing that I wanted to say and in that</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.540" end="00:53:49.660" style="s2">something that Julie said about the</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.330" end="00:53:53.020" style="s2">groups of people task forces of people</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.660" end="00:53:55.510" style="s2">that can be put together and that is it</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.020" end="00:53:57.820" style="s2">reminded me to the model of some</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.510" end="00:54:02.560" style="s2">companies that do functional testing for</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.820" end="00:54:04.660" style="s2">example then they have sort of team</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.560" end="00:54:05.770" style="s2">leads that work with a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.660" end="00:54:09.810" style="s2">that are part of the plan that they</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.770" end="00:54:14.080" style="s2">can&#39;t get paid if they find bugs or they</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.810" end="00:54:16.990" style="s2">for a platform it&#39;s not necessarily as</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.080" end="00:54:19.840" style="s2">the Cure pay but you have a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.990" end="00:54:23.470" style="s2">chance of making some money if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.840" end="00:54:27.130" style="s2">participate on test if you are a</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.470" end="00:54:31.000" style="s2">certified learning curve and then you</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.130" end="00:54:32.620" style="s2">get sort of like the bad that you have</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.000" end="00:54:34.600" style="s2">you have this knowledge then you start</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.620" end="00:54:37.990" style="s2">getting assignments and you are free to</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.600" end="00:54:40.330" style="s2">take them or not taking them and these</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.990" end="00:54:43.240" style="s2">team leads are sort of like the enablers</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.330" end="00:54:44.980" style="s2">that they also teach you doing that</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.240" end="00:54:47.770" style="s2">first period of time where you&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.980" end="00:54:50.140" style="s2">of learning the ropes and and that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.770" end="00:54:51.880" style="s2">something that is another role that it</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.140" end="00:54:53.800" style="s2">would be interesting to explore because</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.880" end="00:54:57.340" style="s2">these people that can help other people</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.800" end="00:54:59.410" style="s2">finding their place in the team so these</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.340" end="00:55:01.300" style="s2">same elements like helping how do how do</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.410" end="00:55:02.800" style="s2">you present yourself especially in</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.300" end="00:55:04.720" style="s2">things that are more tricky like</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.800" end="00:55:07.180" style="s2">something that well I&#39;m here to help</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.720" end="00:55:09.670" style="s2">connect other people how do i express</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.180" end="00:55:13.480" style="s2">that how do I show that and how other</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.670" end="00:55:16.240" style="s2">people see that there is value and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.480" end="00:55:18.430" style="s2">then creating these these themes like</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.240" end="00:55:21.910" style="s2">this is this stuff to be done okay so</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.430" end="00:55:23.620" style="s2">what do we need for that you define sort</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.910" end="00:55:25.720" style="s2">of the initial requirements and then you</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.620" end="00:55:27.550" style="s2">gather the people open it up is one</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.720" end="00:55:29.830" style="s2">project then next time around it could</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.550" end="00:55:32.260" style="s2">be another set of people so this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.830" end="00:55:34.780" style="s2">keeping the rotation open if you have</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.260" end="00:55:37.090" style="s2">some sense of security and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.780" end="00:55:40.120" style="s2">some variety then you start getting a</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.090" end="00:55:42.010" style="s2">lot of movement and that&#39;s that it gets</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.120" end="00:55:43.440" style="s2">even more and more interesting as as</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.010" end="00:55:46.280" style="s2">more people John</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.440" end="00:55:48.750" style="s2">and I know it sounds a little bit maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.280" end="00:55:54.030" style="s2">disjointed this a lot of ideas flowing</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.750" end="00:55:56.069" style="s2">around here but also I like the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.030" end="00:55:58.740" style="s2">the radical transparency also because it</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.069" end="00:56:00.780" style="s2">helps us find niches to problem-solving</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.740" end="00:56:04.619" style="s2">as well like especially with the gig</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.780" end="00:56:07.710" style="s2">economy and especially with uber and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.619" end="00:56:09.089" style="s2">delivery ones they don&#39;t take into</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.710" end="00:56:11.160" style="s2">account that these people have to pay</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.089" end="00:56:12.839" style="s2">for gas have to pay mileage or if they</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.160" end="00:56:15.150" style="s2">do it&#39;s usually below the cost actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.839" end="00:56:17.250" style="s2">to upkeep their vehicle whereas if we</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.150" end="00:56:18.359" style="s2">were able to be transparent in that then</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.250" end="00:56:21.900" style="s2">we could both know that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.359" end="00:56:26.250" style="s2">paying enough to this person and also we</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.900" end="00:56:28.650" style="s2">could have like mechanics that are at</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.250" end="00:56:30.510" style="s2">cost right that are designed to bring</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.650" end="00:56:32.220" style="s2">like they&#39;re getting paid their labor to</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.510" end="00:56:33.690" style="s2">be part of the system and they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.220" end="00:56:35.790" style="s2">we can we can coordinate on a higher</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.690" end="00:56:37.319" style="s2">level we can bulk my cleaning supplies</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.790" end="00:56:39.569" style="s2">if you&#39;re a cleaner and you can see is</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.319" end="00:56:42.480" style="s2">it environmentally friendly what is we</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.569" end="00:56:44.550" style="s2">can crowdsource what is the best cleaner</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.480" end="00:56:47.040" style="s2">right what does what do you need less</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.550" end="00:56:48.510" style="s2">elbow grease for but is environmentally</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.040" end="00:56:50.760" style="s2">friendly and is going to clean this</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.510" end="00:56:53.579" style="s2">specific task and sharing the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.760" end="00:56:55.619" style="s2">to ensure in just doing a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.579" end="00:56:57.569" style="s2">busy work that a lot like if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.619" end="00:56:59.040" style="s2">house cleaner and you have to mark it</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.569" end="00:57:00.599" style="s2">and you have to coordinate and you have</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.040" end="00:57:02.790" style="s2">to you know get get this all together</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.599" end="00:57:04.290" style="s2">if the backend can do that for you if a</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.790" end="00:57:06.240" style="s2">platform is created for you to be able</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.290" end="00:57:08.369" style="s2">to do that you can more focus your time</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.240" end="00:57:10.170" style="s2">on the actual cleaning and get paid</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.369" end="00:57:15.210" style="s2">directly for every hour that your you</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.170" end="00:57:18.810" style="s2">are working something just occurred to</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.210" end="00:57:23.010" style="s2">me as you were saying that you were</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.810" end="00:57:26.640" style="s2">talking about crowdsourcing the cleaning</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.010" end="00:57:31.950" style="s2">material so I picture that as getting</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.640" end="00:57:36.810" style="s2">input in from people whose opinion you</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.950" end="00:57:38.550" style="s2">value and so that by itself has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.810" end="00:57:43.770" style="s2">power and leverage and it reminded me</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.550" end="00:57:46.530" style="s2">that of an idea I tried to vote a long</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.770" end="00:57:50.310" style="s2">time ago voice before it&#39;s time about</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.530" end="00:57:54.630" style="s2">this network green thing the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.310" end="00:57:57.100" style="s2">something could be good for the earth</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.630" end="00:58:04.570" style="s2">and financially stable it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.100" end="00:58:06.820" style="s2">and part of that was a way to audit</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.570" end="00:58:08.350" style="s2">companies because I get auditing for</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.820" end="00:58:11.290" style="s2">achieving excellence so I got some</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.350" end="00:58:15.940" style="s2">experience in that and auditing can have</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.290" end="00:58:20.140" style="s2">like what you would call it that it can</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.940" end="00:58:24.430" style="s2">be an attractor like ISO ISO 9000 rice</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.140" end="00:58:26.590" style="s2">or whatever it was that they paid people</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.430" end="00:58:31.930" style="s2">to come in and audit and they advertised</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.590" end="00:58:34.900" style="s2">how they were at that ISO level so that</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.930" end="00:58:38.800" style="s2">became an attractor for them to to</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.900" end="00:58:43.300" style="s2">create a quality system and to create</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.800" end="00:58:47.230" style="s2">processes and have a way of showing them</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.300" end="00:58:51.820" style="s2">and protecting you so I am I&#39;m ensuring</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.230" end="00:58:56.740" style="s2">that people use them so it would be cool</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.820" end="00:59:03.790" style="s2">if this if we could create a space that</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.740" end="00:59:07.930" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a tractor for kind of an omni</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.790" end="00:59:10.960" style="s2">beneficial way of operating so if we</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.930" end="00:59:13.360" style="s2">could incorporate into that and publish</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.960" end="00:59:16.390" style="s2">a magazine of anybody that had buying</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.360" end="00:59:19.870" style="s2">power to say these are the companies</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.390" end="00:59:23.740" style="s2">that you should invest in because just</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.870" end="00:59:26.890" style="s2">at a plain surface look and their</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.740" end="00:59:30.840" style="s2">behavior here is where they think they</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.890" end="00:59:37.270" style="s2">rave on this omni beneficial spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.840" end="00:59:39.130" style="s2">but if they are willing to pay for an</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.270" end="00:59:40.930" style="s2">auditor we will audit them fairly and</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.130" end="00:59:43.210" style="s2">you might come out with the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.930" end="00:59:45.730" style="s2">because audit will be the same price for</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.210" end="00:59:47.590" style="s2">everyone it might be lower for smaller</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.730" end="00:59:49.420" style="s2">companies yeah that&#39;s it it would be</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.590" end="00:59:53.020" style="s2">lowered something like that it would</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.420" end="00:59:54.720" style="s2">have to be a way that would not could</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.020" end="00:59:56.530" style="s2">not be influenced by money and</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.720" end="00:59:59.050" style="s2">everything would be asked to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.530" end="01:00:01.000" style="s2">radically transparent but it could</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.050" end="01:00:03.430" style="s2">create an attractor for on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.000" end="01:00:07.750" style="s2">beneficial behavior by a company by</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.430" end="01:00:11.010" style="s2">different companies yeah I&#39;d say like</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.750" end="01:00:13.180" style="s2">auditing is something that um</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.010" end="01:00:15.700" style="s2">the more transparent you are and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.180" end="01:00:18.310" style="s2">more willing you&#39;re able to speak truth</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.700" end="01:00:20.110" style="s2">the bigger advantage it gives you in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.310" end="01:00:21.670" style="s2">right system in the current system it</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.110" end="01:00:23.500" style="s2">doesn&#39;t because if you showcase that</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.670" end="01:00:25.420" style="s2">you&#39;re maybe not as environmentally</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.500" end="01:00:27.160" style="s2">friendly as you could be or as socially</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.420" end="01:00:28.690" style="s2">just as you could be they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.160" end="01:00:30.250" style="s2">anyone to compare that to say just</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.690" end="01:00:33.610" style="s2">assume you&#39;re worse than the competition</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.250" end="01:00:36.550" style="s2">but in a society where we we the</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.610" end="01:00:37.870" style="s2">consumer demands transparency then if</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.550" end="01:00:40.030" style="s2">you&#39;re not telling the truth and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.870" end="01:00:42.430" style="s2">not being transparent we assume worse</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.030" end="01:00:44.410" style="s2">than the truth right we&#39;d assume worse</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.430" end="01:00:46.930" style="s2">than the competition as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.410" end="01:00:49.060" style="s2">assuming you&#39;re better then right so I</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.930" end="01:00:52.000" style="s2">think auditing is a big part that and</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.060" end="01:00:54.550" style="s2">it&#39;s labor itself like I especially if</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.000" end="01:00:56.320" style="s2">we were able to have a algorithm and a</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.550" end="01:00:57.490" style="s2">spread sheet system to be able to help</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.320" end="01:00:59.890" style="s2">with that that&#39;s something I would enjoy</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.490" end="01:01:01.540" style="s2">doing is auditing something right and we</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.890" end="01:01:06.160" style="s2">could use to do it crowd-sourced</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.540" end="01:01:07.390" style="s2">where it&#39;s in orabeoni like 5-10 minutes</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.160" end="01:01:09.640" style="s2">here and there and you have a thousand</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.390" end="01:01:11.290" style="s2">people auditing you instead of one doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.640" end="01:01:13.030" style="s2">it really in an expert clash and it</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.290" end="01:01:16.810" style="s2">could be something that is that is more</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.030" end="01:01:18.520" style="s2">volunteer and more just depending on of</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.810" end="01:01:25.510" style="s2">course this is what you&#39;re auditing and</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.520" end="01:01:27.310" style="s2">how complex is yeah yeah I guess when</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.510" end="01:01:31.960" style="s2">there there&#39;s something to be said for a</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.310" end="01:01:34.630" style="s2">thousand opinions dirty there needs to</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.960" end="01:01:37.750" style="s2">be a way if we did that to make sure</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.630" end="01:01:43.240" style="s2">there most of them were well-intentioned</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.750" end="01:01:46.000" style="s2">and and not robots obviously but anyways</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.240" end="01:01:48.580" style="s2">it&#39;s just just an idea that create an</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.000" end="01:01:52.900" style="s2">attractor so this this group that&#39;s ten</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.580" end="01:02:01.510" style="s2">thousand that could be a thing that they</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.900" end="01:02:05.680" style="s2">they do as well is if they ten thousand</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.510" end="01:02:09.640" style="s2">people so ten thousand people well</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.680" end="01:02:14.320" style="s2">intentioned and so if if if we started</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.640" end="01:02:18.070" style="s2">with a hundred and each person brought</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.320" end="01:02:19.720" style="s2">in ten from their network and did it</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.070" end="01:02:24.140" style="s2">that way you could you couldn&#39;t build up</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.720" end="01:02:25.940" style="s2">to ten thousand quite easily and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.140" end="01:02:33.970" style="s2">we assume they&#39;re all well-intentioned</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.940" end="01:02:33.970" style="s2">then the if if you leverage their</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.230" end="01:02:43.870" style="s2">perspectives or their ability based on a</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.460" end="01:02:43.870" style="s2">performance scale that you make up to</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.280" end="01:02:52.070" style="s2">rate certain companies based on what</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.450" end="01:02:54.320" style="s2">their experiences with those companies</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.070" end="01:02:58.610" style="s2">then you could produce something that</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.320" end="01:03:00.140" style="s2">could be published through those ten</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.610" end="01:03:02.060" style="s2">thousand and others that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.140" end="01:03:08.150" style="s2">associated with so the reach could be</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.060" end="01:03:12.110" style="s2">easily scale up to a million or more and</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.150" end="01:03:14.900" style="s2">then that might create the attractors</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.110" end="01:03:19.960" style="s2">for the companies to want to be audited</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.900" end="01:03:25.970" style="s2">want to change and change their behavior</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.960" end="01:03:29.420" style="s2">anyways it&#39;s yeah that&#39;s all I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.970" end="01:03:30.860" style="s2">say about that is anyway we&#39;re past the</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.420" end="01:03:32.930" style="s2">hour mark does anyone have any closing</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.860" end="01:03:35.030" style="s2">statements on what they would like to</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.930" end="01:03:36.710" style="s2">say I just wanted to quickly say that</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.030" end="01:03:38.780" style="s2">when you talk about going from 100 to</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.710" end="01:03:40.220" style="s2">10,000 and then you were like we could</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.780" end="01:03:43.280" style="s2">get to a million that actually is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.220" end="01:03:46.600" style="s2">same factor going from a hundred to ten</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.280" end="01:03:49.670" style="s2">thousands which is the doable amount is</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.600" end="01:03:50.930" style="s2">the same right you you hundred people</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.670" end="01:03:52.100" style="s2">bring in ten people you have a thousand</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.930" end="01:03:53.480" style="s2">bring in ten people you have ten</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.100" end="01:03:54.920" style="s2">thousand and then of course it goes to a</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.480" end="01:03:57.110" style="s2">hundred thousand a million so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.920" end="01:03:58.670" style="s2">the same factor difference and so if you</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.110" end="01:04:02.050" style="s2">can get from a hundred to ten thousand</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.670" end="01:04:02.050" style="s2">you can get to a million just as easily</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.790" end="01:04:10.670" style="s2">either if you have any closing thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.660" end="01:04:18.710" style="s2">before we say goodbye to YouTube no I</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.670" end="01:04:20.990" style="s2">think exactly great great exercise all</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.710" end="01:04:22.280" style="s2">right do you have any closing closing</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.990" end="01:04:26.300" style="s2">thoughts Park I can&#39;t even speak anymore</p>
