<p begin="00:00:37.520" end="00:00:39.760" style="s2">like it&#39;s kind of a universal thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.040" end="00:00:42.000" style="s2">right</p>

<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:12.880" style="s2">for example today</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.720" end="00:01:15.119" style="s2">the future this is of course what</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.880" end="00:01:17.600" style="s2">cerakus is now working on</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.119" end="00:01:19.040" style="s2">we&#39;re working on digital we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.600" end="00:01:21.360" style="s2">on a global</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.040" end="00:01:22.400" style="s2">we&#39;re working on all the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.360" end="00:01:23.920" style="s2">needed today</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.400" end="00:01:25.680" style="s2">for the proper exodus to save the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.920" end="00:01:27.040" style="s2">fucking planet so we&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.680" end="00:01:28.240" style="s2">equatopianism we&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.040" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2">cosmopolitanism</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.240" end="00:01:31.439" style="s2">we&#39;re also working on reinstituting</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.000" end="00:01:33.200" style="s2">religion properly with the border</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.439" end="00:01:35.360" style="s2">absolutes it starts working again</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.200" end="00:01:37.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s religion about maturity and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.360" end="00:01:38.159" style="s2">about adultification</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.040" end="00:01:40.000" style="s2">all the things religion should be</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.159" end="00:01:41.600" style="s2">concerned with so we&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.000" end="00:01:43.360" style="s2">looking through all of the history of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.600" end="00:01:44.799" style="s2">religions to find out a pattern here</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.360" end="00:01:46.960" style="s2">that actually makes sense today</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.799" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">so we cannot go for the pop version this</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.960" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">time but go for the proper full-on</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:51.920" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:52.560" style="s2">that requires maturity deep studies and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.920" end="00:01:54.880" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.560" end="00:01:56.719" style="s2">and devotion but only minority will</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.880" end="00:01:58.240" style="s2">accept it we are not prepared for</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.719" end="00:01:59.680" style="s2">anything else we&#39;re not going to go for</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.240" end="00:02:01.360" style="s2">the pop numbers like</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.680" end="00:02:02.719" style="s2">islam and christianity and american</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.360" end="00:02:04.880" style="s2">culture does all the time</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.719" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">we&#39;re going to go for a slow graduate</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.880" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">growth and few people</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:09.360" style="s2">who understand what&#39;s going on and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:11.680" style="s2">going to present them with the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">there&#39;s an exodus that is available</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.680" end="00:02:15.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not literally from one territory to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:17.520" style="s2">the next it&#39;s in exodus</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.040" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">out of physical into the digital realm</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.520" end="00:02:20.879" style="s2">to then revisit physical</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.040" end="00:02:23.360" style="s2">from the digital realm and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.879" end="00:02:26.800" style="s2">exactly what we&#39;re looking at</p>

<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:33.840" style="s2">phenomena just like</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.239" end="00:02:35.360" style="s2">if you look at twitter they there are a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.840" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">few superstars that&#39;s what everybody</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.360" end="00:02:38.720" style="s2">else follows it looks exactly like</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:40.640" style="s2">television it&#39;s act like mass media</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.720" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">it looks exactly like any damn broadway</p>

<p begin="00:02:46.959" end="00:02:50.239" style="s2">the first thing you view religion</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.400" end="00:02:51.040" style="s2">properly is you forget about quantity go</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.239" end="00:02:52.560" style="s2">for equality</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.040" end="00:02:54.879" style="s2">this is exactly what you do if you&#39;re a</p>

<p begin="00:03:01.360" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">create a monotheistic society</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.879" end="00:03:06.879" style="s2">to make to see if that works this is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">beginning of nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.879" end="00:03:10.480" style="s2">and what zoroaster did in persia was</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:13.040" style="s2">that he inspired people to to</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.480" end="00:03:15.280" style="s2">to go for an idea of imperialism now</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.040" end="00:03:17.040" style="s2">this is stretching the human imagination</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.280" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">way beyond the clan of the tribe they</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.040" end="00:03:21.200" style="s2">were born to be comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.360" end="00:03:23.360" style="s2">but today sacred chambers are pagan</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.200" end="00:03:25.040" style="s2">they&#39;re only clans and at best strikes</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.360" end="00:03:26.519" style="s2">the lynch mobs are not in the clans that</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.040" end="00:03:27.760" style="s2">are the best tribes it&#39;s called</p>

<p begin="00:03:27.760" end="00:03:30.879" style="s2">it&#39;s pretending that the different echo</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.440" end="00:03:32.400" style="s2">chambers have a shared goal</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.879" end="00:03:34.799" style="s2">they don&#39;t they only have a shared</p>

<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:05.439" style="s2">so anybody who comes alongside and</p>

<p begin="00:12:56.000" end="00:12:58.880" style="s2">what the tibetans and the persians have</p>

<p begin="00:13:00.560" end="00:13:03.600" style="s2">there&#39;s one religion for the priests</p>

<p begin="00:13:10.480" end="00:13:13.760" style="s2">dragon and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.760" end="00:13:15.360" style="s2">he sets the humanity free and therefore</p>

<p begin="00:13:16.079" end="00:13:18.880" style="s2">and then you got the matriarchal</p>

<p begin="00:13:41.839" end="00:13:45.440" style="s2">but i would say that&#39;s a possibility for</p>

<p begin="00:13:45.440" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">and young men today will go kill</p>

<p begin="00:20:36.000" end="00:20:39.760" style="s2">uh in for the rest of the history of</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.919" end="00:20:42.240" style="s2">humanity and uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.760" end="00:20:44.799" style="s2">yeah i think it&#39;s it&#39;s it it fits in</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.240" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">this eventology idea right so that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.799" end="00:20:48.799" style="s2">that you uh you have these events that</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">create uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.799" end="00:20:52.559" style="s2">create um yeah that have huge</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">consequences</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.559" end="00:20:58.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t know about uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.600" end="00:21:00.000" style="s2">you know the messiah thinking around ai</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.640" end="00:21:01.840" style="s2">and things like that i mean i&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.000" end="00:21:02.400" style="s2">like very pragmatic about it for the</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.840" end="00:21:04.320" style="s2">time being</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:05.760" style="s2">it is the relationship again it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.320" end="00:21:08.960" style="s2">relationship with the mana machine that</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.760" end="00:21:10.720" style="s2">is messianic not the machine itself</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.960" end="00:21:12.240" style="s2">again relationships can we do with that</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.720" end="00:21:14.799" style="s2">image i mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.240" end="00:21:15.520" style="s2">okay so we can say that but okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.799" end="00:21:17.919" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.520" end="00:21:19.919" style="s2">we all know we all know that nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.919" end="00:21:21.280" style="s2">fusion power is an incredibly famously</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.919" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">difficult engineering project to</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.280" end="00:21:23.679" style="s2">undertake</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:25.200" style="s2">we know if you would succeed with it</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.679" end="00:21:27.280" style="s2">calculations show that if</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.200" end="00:21:29.280" style="s2">it occurs within the next 60 to 80 years</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.280" end="00:21:30.240" style="s2">we will solve all the major problems for</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.280" end="00:21:32.720" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.240" end="00:21:34.400" style="s2">connected to climate change today you</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.720" end="00:21:37.520" style="s2">could actually even</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.400" end="00:21:39.679" style="s2">water the deserts and the old you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.520" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">the old dream of cosmopotamia like</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.679" end="00:21:43.200" style="s2">you could drown everything in the river</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:45.360" style="s2">and everything can grow everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.200" end="00:21:46.799" style="s2">that that fantasy can become true so we</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.360" end="00:21:48.240" style="s2">could solve all the problems current</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.799" end="00:21:48.960" style="s2">problems of climate change if we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.240" end="00:21:51.120" style="s2">access to</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.960" end="00:21:52.960" style="s2">cheap abundant electricity forever which</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.120" end="00:21:55.440" style="s2">is the nuclear fission power promises</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.960" end="00:21:57.360" style="s2">but the complexity of the engineering</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.440" end="00:21:58.320" style="s2">not only is incredibly expensive to</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:22:00.080" style="s2">build</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.320" end="00:22:01.919" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to take a long time to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.080" end="00:22:04.480" style="s2">to request god to do that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.919" end="00:22:06.320" style="s2">hey no ai could speed up that process</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.480" end="00:22:08.720" style="s2">easily with decades at least</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.320" end="00:22:10.880" style="s2">and any engineer would agree to that so</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.720" end="00:22:13.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a perfect sample way i could do</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.880" end="00:22:14.720" style="s2">because it&#39;s all about saving time and</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.440" end="00:22:17.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what saviors do</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.720" end="00:22:18.000" style="s2">they save us time they they take us into</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.280" end="00:22:21.039" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.000" end="00:22:23.440" style="s2">now and jump</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.039" end="00:22:24.640" style="s2">the jump into the future is to jump into</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.440" end="00:22:26.559" style="s2">the promised land</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.640" end="00:22:28.720" style="s2">so that the problems we&#39;re stuck with</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.559" end="00:22:30.640" style="s2">here are gone and we can survive</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.720" end="00:22:32.240" style="s2">that&#39;s fundamental too so man versus</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.640" end="00:22:34.320" style="s2">machine but but about</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.240" end="00:22:35.919" style="s2">about how we construct the abject</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.320" end="00:22:36.960" style="s2">there&#39;s one word we&#39;re missing here and</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.919" end="00:22:38.480" style="s2">that&#39;s martyr</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.960" end="00:22:40.880" style="s2">how do you pronounce that in american</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.480" end="00:22:42.640" style="s2">english be murder murder yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.880" end="00:22:44.720" style="s2">uh we we actually what was that</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.640" end="00:22:47.520" style="s2">self-sacrifice or murder george</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.720" end="00:22:47.919" style="s2">george floyd was turning to murder right</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.520" end="00:22:50.559" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.919" end="00:22:51.919" style="s2">he&#39;s not a scapegoat he&#39;s a martyr so</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.559" end="00:22:52.559" style="s2">and that&#39;s interesting because the</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.919" end="00:22:55.760" style="s2">murders</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:57.520" style="s2">is what lynch mobs thrive on because</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.760" end="00:22:58.320" style="s2">because lynchpots pretend that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.520" end="00:23:00.000" style="s2">leaderless</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.320" end="00:23:02.240" style="s2">again they pretend the an object does</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:05.360" style="s2">not exist because there&#39;s nobody there</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.240" end="00:23:06.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just a shared idea that they thrive</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.360" end="00:23:07.760" style="s2">on right</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.000" end="00:23:09.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s the anarchic because the an</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.760" end="00:23:11.760" style="s2">object is there</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.200" end="00:23:13.200" style="s2">they all that happens is that they then</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.760" end="00:23:15.440" style="s2">become completely dependent on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.200" end="00:23:17.039" style="s2">martyrs</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.440" end="00:23:18.400" style="s2">because they cannot have a sign of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.039" end="00:23:19.679" style="s2">leader when they walk forward say this</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.400" end="00:23:22.880" style="s2">is how later we follow him</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.679" end="00:23:24.159" style="s2">or her no instead they take the mothers</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.880" end="00:23:25.600" style="s2">and put them on the plaque cards and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.159" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">then they got to demonstrate and have</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.600" end="00:23:28.159" style="s2">the martyrs everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.720" end="00:23:30.240" style="s2">and they want to have george floyd</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.159" end="00:23:32.559" style="s2">statues and george floyd birthdays and</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.240" end="00:23:34.640" style="s2">george floyd mostly go into the calendar</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.559" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">and all the heroes have to be removed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.640" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">be replaced by the martyr</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.400" end="00:23:41.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s why the martyr is something</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.080" end="00:23:43.200" style="s2">we should explore further</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.440" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">er before we take our next study because</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.200" end="00:23:45.919" style="s2">and the difference between the murder</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:48.240" style="s2">and maybe the saint right</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.919" end="00:23:49.760" style="s2">no yeah exactly because the martyr will</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:50.720" style="s2">be tied to the anoject ejected the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.760" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">tyrant</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.720" end="00:23:56.640" style="s2">in that sense whereas the saint</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.760" end="00:23:58.530" style="s2">would be tied to the savior and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.640" end="00:23:59.919" style="s2">lesser gods</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.530" end="00:24:01.760" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.919" end="00:24:03.279" style="s2">because the saints most of the christian</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.760" end="00:24:05.039" style="s2">saints are supposed to be martyrs of</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.279" end="00:24:06.720" style="s2">some are many of them are</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.039" end="00:24:08.000" style="s2">martyrs of some kind well these are</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.720" end="00:24:08.960" style="s2">problematic with words you always</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.000" end="00:24:11.039" style="s2">discover they probably</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.960" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">but the martyrs of christianity martus</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.039" end="00:24:14.240" style="s2">prior to becoming saints</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:15.600" style="s2">then they become saints and when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.240" end="00:24:17.039" style="s2">saints they&#39;re acknowledged as lesser</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.600" end="00:24:18.559" style="s2">gods you can pray to them</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.039" end="00:24:20.240" style="s2">and the beauty of catholicism is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.559" end="00:24:22.400" style="s2">they it has the lesser gods</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.240" end="00:24:23.679" style="s2">therefore just like zoroastrianism it</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.400" end="00:24:25.600" style="s2">has a polytheistic</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.679" end="00:24:26.880" style="s2">bottoms up religion called iconology at</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.600" end="00:24:30.000" style="s2">the bottom which is for</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.880" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">what which is not martyrdom yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.000" end="00:24:34.559" style="s2">i think so you got the saints lesser</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:35.919" style="s2">gods then you&#39;ve got the superior gods</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.559" end="00:24:37.600" style="s2">but they&#39;re only for the priests and</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.919" end="00:24:39.760" style="s2">possibly for the military</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.600" end="00:24:41.440" style="s2">and the superior gods are vague and</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.760" end="00:24:43.360" style="s2">abstract and they&#39;re really pointing</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.440" end="00:24:47.360" style="s2">towards the one god</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.360" end="00:24:49.520" style="s2">so top monotheism elitist</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.360" end="00:24:50.799" style="s2">only for the league and of course the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.520" end="00:24:52.960" style="s2">monotheism should be</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.799" end="00:24:55.039" style="s2">locked up behind the bard absolute and</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.960" end="00:24:57.520" style="s2">people should gladly have enjoyed all</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.039" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">the lesser gods in their iconology</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.520" end="00:25:01.360" style="s2">that is what india did that&#39;s the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:02.960" style="s2">religion if you want a religion to</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.360" end="00:25:04.480" style="s2">survive for 5 000 years and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.960" end="00:25:05.679" style="s2">another 5 000 years coming</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.480" end="00:25:08.320" style="s2">that would be hinduism and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.679" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">exactly what hinduism operates</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.320" end="00:25:12.799" style="s2">if so asterism did the same thing except</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:14.799" style="s2">that prioritized monophthous elite</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.799" end="00:25:16.400" style="s2">sweden so people could aspire</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.799" end="00:25:18.159" style="s2">it&#39;s precisely because they created the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.400" end="00:25:19.840" style="s2">mentality so people could aspire to a</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.159" end="00:25:22.000" style="s2">better world which india never did</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.840" end="00:25:22.880" style="s2">this is the shift between iran and india</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.000" end="00:25:25.760" style="s2">but they</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.880" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">so rasta was wise enough to allow the</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.760" end="00:25:29.520" style="s2">folk religion to prosper</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:31.039" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly why the soros invented</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.520" end="00:25:32.320" style="s2">universal human rights because you could</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.039" end="00:25:35.360" style="s2">have any religion like</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.320" end="00:25:37.120" style="s2">astonishing on the iconological level</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.360" end="00:25:38.960" style="s2">you expect women and children to worship</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:40.720" style="s2">astrology no problem right</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.960" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">but you expect boys to worship</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.720" end="00:25:43.120" style="s2">conspiracies no problem you can have</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:46.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.120" end="00:25:46.960" style="s2">as long as the leadership the chieftain</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.240" end="00:25:49.919" style="s2">the priests</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.960" end="00:25:51.760" style="s2">operate within the realm of the one god</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.919" end="00:25:53.840" style="s2">and the one god is the phallus that</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.760" end="00:25:55.840" style="s2">split</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.840" end="00:25:59.600" style="s2">only dictators want to unify the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.840" end="00:25:59.600" style="s2">followers and that&#39;s when they fail</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.919" end="00:26:08.159" style="s2">but martyrs yeah that&#39;s next</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.000" end="00:26:11.360" style="s2">that&#39;s next i think that the history of</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.159" end="00:26:13.279" style="s2">heresies is also very interesting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.360" end="00:26:15.360" style="s2">so i mean you can kind of see like like</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.279" end="00:26:16.240" style="s2">we have like 2000 years of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.360" end="00:26:18.080" style="s2">right and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.240" end="00:26:19.440" style="s2">so there&#39;s all these discussions about</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:21.200" style="s2">uh you know people think of these are</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.440" end="00:26:23.200" style="s2">very arcane issues and</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.200" end="00:26:24.640" style="s2">they&#39;re very you know not related to any</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.200" end="00:26:26.080" style="s2">real world issues but</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.640" end="00:26:28.080" style="s2">but it&#39;s not correct actually i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.080" end="00:26:29.760" style="s2">can you can see that these heresies even</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.080" end="00:26:30.640" style="s2">though they look kind of silly why are</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.760" end="00:26:32.960" style="s2">they you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.640" end="00:26:34.880" style="s2">why are they arguing about this this</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.960" end="00:26:37.039" style="s2">arcane aspect of religion but</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.880" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">but it had real effects in real life</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.039" end="00:26:39.760" style="s2">right so so you could actually see like</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:41.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:43.039" style="s2">something growing here that will go in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.600" end="00:26:44.159" style="s2">direction that we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.039" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">so there are all these there are all</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.159" end="00:26:48.080" style="s2">these for example there was this</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:51.279" style="s2">i think pelagius so this was a guy who</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.080" end="00:26:53.360" style="s2">uh so at some point the christians were</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.279" end="00:26:55.279" style="s2">were forced to hand in their bibles by</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.360" end="00:26:57.120" style="s2">some roman emperor right</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.279" end="00:26:58.960" style="s2">and then and then there was this sect</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.120" end="00:26:59.840" style="s2">that said like and every christian who</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.960" end="00:27:02.240" style="s2">did that</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.840" end="00:27:03.360" style="s2">is going to hell so those people are not</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.240" end="00:27:05.600" style="s2">true christians</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.360" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">and then there was another another uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.600" end="00:27:08.720" style="s2">group of christians who said no we</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:11.200" style="s2">should forgive them</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.720" end="00:27:13.039" style="s2">and it&#39;s so and it&#39;s the last uh group</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.200" end="00:27:14.320" style="s2">that won</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.039" end="00:27:15.919" style="s2">so and you have a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.320" end="00:27:17.520" style="s2">discussions going on in the history of</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.919" end="00:27:18.159" style="s2">christianity it&#39;s very interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.520" end="00:27:20.320" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.159" end="00:27:22.000" style="s2">how uh how the the modern day</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.320" end="00:27:24.159" style="s2">christianity is basically the result of</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.000" end="00:27:24.720" style="s2">this of this 2000 year conversation</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.159" end="00:27:26.320" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.720" end="00:27:28.559" style="s2">and a lot of things that that we think</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.320" end="00:27:30.320" style="s2">are oh this is absolutely essential to</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.559" end="00:27:30.960" style="s2">christianity no this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.320" end="00:27:33.840" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.960" end="00:27:35.520" style="s2">made up by some guy in the 11th century</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.840" end="00:27:37.200" style="s2">and that then spread so the first</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.520" end="00:27:37.919" style="s2">thousand years this was totally not on</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.200" end="00:27:39.840" style="s2">the table</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.919" end="00:27:41.520" style="s2">so this is very interesting so actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.840" end="00:27:44.080" style="s2">looking at your religion as</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.520" end="00:27:45.679" style="s2">a process which it is right that that</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.080" end="00:27:47.360" style="s2">tells you a lot i think that that also</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.679" end="00:27:48.159" style="s2">keeps it sane right you can kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.360" end="00:27:50.240" style="s2">that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.159" end="00:27:51.360" style="s2">there&#39;s no absolute truth here that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.240" end="00:27:52.720" style="s2">very good point you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.360" end="00:27:54.720" style="s2">actually something that constantly</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.720" end="00:27:56.799" style="s2">constantly evolves and that&#39;s why i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.720" end="00:27:58.399" style="s2">i am very i mean i christianity i find</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.799" end="00:28:00.399" style="s2">it super interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.399" end="00:28:02.080" style="s2">study it and also do certain christian</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.399" end="00:28:02.720" style="s2">practices and read the bible and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.080" end="00:28:04.880" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.720" end="00:28:06.240" style="s2">i mean you you learn a lot from it uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.880" end="00:28:07.760" style="s2">and and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.240" end="00:28:09.520" style="s2">basically i think the trick is to get</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.760" end="00:28:10.720" style="s2">but many of the great christians like</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.520" end="00:28:13.120" style="s2">meister eckert were</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.720" end="00:28:14.399" style="s2">were considered uh you know heretics too</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.120" end="00:28:17.279" style="s2">i mean also oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.399" end="00:28:18.320" style="s2">hey i love meister eckhart like i could</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.279" end="00:28:20.640" style="s2">read him for</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.320" end="00:28:23.120" style="s2">days it&#39;s just so beautiful but but he</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.640" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">was a heretic and so was uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.120" end="00:28:26.640" style="s2">most of the great medieval saints were</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.720" end="00:28:28.880" style="s2">sort of heretics weren&#39;t they or</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.640" end="00:28:30.640" style="s2">many of the great any free thinker was</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.880" end="00:28:32.320" style="s2">always a heretic heretic is just having</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.640" end="00:28:33.039" style="s2">a different opinion than popular opinion</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.320" end="00:28:35.840" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.039" end="00:28:36.880" style="s2">okay if popular opinion is the anobject</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.840" end="00:28:39.760" style="s2">which it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.880" end="00:28:40.720" style="s2">then anybody poses the analytic the ana</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.760" end="00:28:43.600" style="s2">and objectives by</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.720" end="00:28:45.360" style="s2">the vulgar is the heritage so heresy is</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.600" end="00:28:47.039" style="s2">just another name for plurality</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.360" end="00:28:49.360" style="s2">yeah but they had sensors and they would</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.039" end="00:28:52.640" style="s2">go through all of oh of course</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.360" end="00:28:54.320" style="s2">eckerd&#39;s so do we today underline</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.640" end="00:28:56.559" style="s2">things that you know okay what the fuck</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.320" end="00:28:58.640" style="s2">is the platforming the platforming is</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.559" end="00:29:00.080" style="s2">going after the heretics it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.640" end="00:29:01.200" style="s2">fucking shit all over again</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.080" end="00:29:03.440" style="s2">it&#39;s the people who are totally</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.200" end="00:29:04.159" style="s2">intolerant and won&#39;t allow the different</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.440" end="00:29:06.480" style="s2">opinion</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.159" end="00:29:07.760" style="s2">they expose their weakness by going</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.480" end="00:29:10.240" style="s2">after you so anybody</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.760" end="00:29:11.200" style="s2">kills heretics is exposed exposing a</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.240" end="00:29:13.600" style="s2">weakness</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.200" end="00:29:15.279" style="s2">now there are instances in history where</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.600" end="00:29:16.799" style="s2">maybe killing a few of them like killing</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.279" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">a nazi or something is at least</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.799" end="00:29:20.240" style="s2">excusable or killing an islamic state</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:22.240" style="s2">warrior is excusable</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.240" end="00:29:23.600" style="s2">uh the sorastian thought so in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.240" end="00:29:24.080" style="s2">assassin of the empire because they</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.600" end="00:29:26.559" style="s2">found the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.080" end="00:29:27.679" style="s2">gnostics to be problematic when</p>

<p begin="00:29:27.679" end="00:29:30.640" style="s2">moved out of being something pillar</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:31.919" style="s2">since practice in the woods that became</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.640" end="00:29:33.919" style="s2">mass movements</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.919" end="00:29:35.760" style="s2">they were terrified of the master kites</p>

<p begin="00:29:46.880" end="00:29:51.600" style="s2">like spinoza who believes in</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:13.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a worldview but of course you want</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.919" end="00:30:16.000" style="s2">to be challenged but</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.279" end="00:30:17.120" style="s2">at least now we appreciate the heretics</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.000" end="00:30:19.200" style="s2">except</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.120" end="00:30:21.200" style="s2">the social justice warriors don&#39;t but at</p>

<p begin="00:36:16.640" end="00:36:20.000" style="s2">i mean we can be against that</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.640" end="00:36:21.359" style="s2">but but it&#39;s also very interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.000" end="00:36:22.160" style="s2">see well what kind of what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.359" end="00:36:24.720" style="s2">dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.160" end="00:36:26.079" style="s2">are are are being developed what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.720" end="00:36:27.599" style="s2">what kind of groups are being</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.079" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">formed what&#39;s happening and like this</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.599" end="00:36:31.119" style="s2">bigger picture right and then you you</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:32.880" style="s2">quickly see that you that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.119" end="00:36:35.040" style="s2">the the funny thing is that these this</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.880" end="00:36:37.040" style="s2">hype these hyper modern times</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.040" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">and these these all this ai and these</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.040" end="00:36:41.040" style="s2">computers and these networks</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.640" end="00:36:41.920" style="s2">they basically bring back ancient</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.040" end="00:36:44.400" style="s2">humanity</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.920" end="00:36:45.839" style="s2">ancient patterns of behavior that that</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.400" end="00:36:48.000" style="s2">were on the way out</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.839" end="00:36:49.760" style="s2">and that are suddenly exploding and we</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.000" end="00:36:50.240" style="s2">people don&#39;t know what to do with them</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.760" end="00:36:51.839" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.240" end="00:36:53.440" style="s2">they don&#39;t have any religion to guide</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.839" end="00:36:55.280" style="s2">them through it anymore so</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.440" end="00:36:56.560" style="s2">they basically go back to very very</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.280" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">ancient patterns</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.560" end="00:37:00.240" style="s2">and they do it on on 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:01.119" style="s2">technology which is kind of a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.240" end="00:37:03.680" style="s2">scary</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.119" end="00:37:05.119" style="s2">situation yeah and it because the</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.680" end="00:37:08.240" style="s2">technology itself</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.119" end="00:37:09.680" style="s2">creates the sense of now now now now and</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.240" end="00:37:11.119" style="s2">that&#39;s precise we need to step back and</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.680" end="00:37:12.800" style="s2">say wait this is only something</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.119" end="00:37:14.240" style="s2">technology is doing to me and it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.800" end="00:37:15.200" style="s2">to everybody else okay then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.240" end="00:37:17.040" style="s2">stupidity</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.200" end="00:37:18.400" style="s2">it&#39;s mass stupidity that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.040" end="00:37:20.640" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about if you want to go into</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.400" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">the future going to the past</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.640" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">what&#39;s the first thing you do when you</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:26.560" style="s2">realize that now is overhyped</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:28.320" style="s2">yeah meaning any little change that</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.560" end="00:37:30.720" style="s2">happens in the news is overhyped</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.320" end="00:37:32.720" style="s2">constantly over-hyped over represent</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.720" end="00:37:34.720" style="s2">represented so you tear down a statue</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.720" end="00:37:36.160" style="s2">somebody built an empire 300 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.720" end="00:37:38.720" style="s2">to replace it with somebody who just</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.160" end="00:37:41.119" style="s2">happened to be a guy somebody talked</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.720" end="00:37:42.640" style="s2">about in the gossip yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:44.800" style="s2">as if that would be the equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.640" end="00:37:46.960" style="s2">statue that that that that lack of</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.800" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">historicity is enormous at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.960" end="00:37:52.560" style="s2">yeah my my what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:54.320" style="s2">because we&#39;re submerged in the now right</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.560" end="00:37:55.920" style="s2">where we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.320" end="00:37:58.079" style="s2">like there&#39;s a constant attack of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.920" end="00:37:59.680" style="s2">now right oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.079" end="00:38:02.160" style="s2">so we need to get out of the now right</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.680" end="00:38:04.000" style="s2">yeah and get in and now the worst</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.160" end="00:38:05.920" style="s2">is exactly what&#39;s called feminine</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.000" end="00:38:07.839" style="s2">hysteria it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.920" end="00:38:09.680" style="s2">women want to be there they are there</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.839" end="00:38:11.200" style="s2">they are intermediate</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.680" end="00:38:13.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a mindfulness and all these</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.200" end="00:38:15.520" style="s2">things are female as the women say</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.440" end="00:38:17.119" style="s2">i got to feel it in and i got to see if</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.520" end="00:38:18.880" style="s2">i got a lost or not about it and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.119" end="00:38:20.320" style="s2">i&#39;ll decide if i do it but if i do it</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.880" end="00:38:21.119" style="s2">i&#39;m committed that&#39;s what women do</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.320" end="00:38:24.000" style="s2">brilliantly</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.119" end="00:38:26.079" style="s2">that&#39;s okay but if women do that and men</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.000" end="00:38:28.000" style="s2">try to mimic that</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.079" end="00:38:29.359" style="s2">rather than go into deep studies of</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.000" end="00:38:31.760" style="s2">history and then look way</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.359" end="00:38:34.800" style="s2">into the future for visions then what</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.760" end="00:38:34.800" style="s2">the fuck are men for</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.119" end="00:38:38.720" style="s2">that&#39;s what the priest and the chieftain</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.880" end="00:38:40.320" style="s2">that&#39;s what the master and the hood are</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.720" end="00:38:42.400" style="s2">about it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.320" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">gaining the ground to then go into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.400" end="00:38:46.160" style="s2">future and look forward</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:47.440" style="s2">this is what ironically here again</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.160" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">compare religions the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.440" end="00:38:52.079" style="s2">dao in taoism yeah well the zen arrow</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.320" end="00:38:54.240" style="s2">goes both directions right yeah and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.079" end="00:38:56.160" style="s2">asha in zoroastrianism is of course the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:38:59.280" style="s2">way in christianity too</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.160" end="00:39:02.320" style="s2">christ says i am truth i am way</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:05.680" style="s2">and i&#39;m life the truth</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.320" end="00:39:08.240" style="s2">the way and the life are connected okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.680" end="00:39:09.839" style="s2">they exist together in christianity too</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.240" end="00:39:11.440" style="s2">so they are one of the same things i</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.839" end="00:39:13.200" style="s2">would say there are two truths we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.440" end="00:39:15.760" style="s2">talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.200" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">again priest and chieftain different</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.760" end="00:39:21.760" style="s2">this goes for the truth as a fact</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:23.680" style="s2">that&#39;s what we call logos factual truth</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.760" end="00:39:25.359" style="s2">but the other truth is transcendental</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.680" end="00:39:27.920" style="s2">truth which is truth as an</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.359" end="00:39:28.640" style="s2">act which my students go after him about</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.920" end="00:39:30.160" style="s2">all the time</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.640" end="00:39:32.560" style="s2">this is the concept we discussed in</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.160" end="00:39:34.320" style="s2">synthesism it&#39;s truth as an action which</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.560" end="00:39:36.640" style="s2">points towards the future</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.320" end="00:39:37.520" style="s2">and of course when i act with truth as a</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:39.359" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.520" end="00:39:41.200" style="s2">for example when i go to the court of</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.359" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">law which is a very priestly thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.200" end="00:39:44.880" style="s2">when i look at the theological</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.720" end="00:39:46.000" style="s2">philosophical matter when i look into</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.880" end="00:39:48.079" style="s2">scientific matter</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.000" end="00:39:49.599" style="s2">i look all into the past i look all for</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.079" end="00:39:50.320" style="s2">the facts because facts are all about</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.599" end="00:39:52.960" style="s2">the past</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.320" end="00:39:55.359" style="s2">this is about truth finding facts</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.960" end="00:39:58.079" style="s2">meaning finding fact from the past</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.359" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">meaning getting history correct why does</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.079" end="00:40:01.520" style="s2">this mineral exist today</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:03.359" style="s2">how does it operate how did it come</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.520" end="00:40:05.200" style="s2">about what can we do with it</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.359" end="00:40:07.440" style="s2">all those things are truth as a fact and</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.200" end="00:40:09.520" style="s2">that is the priestly truth</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.440" end="00:40:11.040" style="s2">but the transcendental truth that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.520" end="00:40:14.000" style="s2">king or the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.040" end="00:40:14.800" style="s2">uh chieftain personifies is truth as an</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.000" end="00:40:16.640" style="s2">act</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.800" end="00:40:18.000" style="s2">and that is i don&#39;t have perfect</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.640" end="00:40:19.680" style="s2">knowledge about everything</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.000" end="00:40:21.440" style="s2">but at least i know where i&#39;m going and</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.680" end="00:40:22.960" style="s2">i need i&#39;m going to the right place and</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.440" end="00:40:25.040" style="s2">i&#39;ve got the direction set</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.960" end="00:40:27.200" style="s2">and i therefore make the best possible</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.040" end="00:40:28.400" style="s2">strategy i could make with the resources</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.200" end="00:40:31.920" style="s2">i have access to</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.400" end="00:40:34.079" style="s2">to then make the impossible possible</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.920" end="00:40:34.960" style="s2">this is why christianity speaks about</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.079" end="00:40:38.240" style="s2">the truth</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.960" end="00:40:41.280" style="s2">and the way and life and this</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.240" end="00:40:44.720" style="s2">in so astronomism is repeated as asha</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.280" end="00:40:46.240" style="s2">and asha where asha is just truth as</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.720" end="00:40:48.960" style="s2">things suffer also literally means</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.240" end="00:40:49.680" style="s2">how things will work but ah is how</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.960" end="00:40:53.040" style="s2">things work</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.680" end="00:40:53.760" style="s2">with the direction added that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.040" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.760" end="00:40:57.119" style="s2">act yeah that&#39;s why it&#39;s a state of mind</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:41:00.079" style="s2">whereas</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.119" end="00:41:02.560" style="s2">it&#39;s an ethical imperative so also is</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.079" end="00:41:05.440" style="s2">that i want to personify</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.560" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">truth with the direction which is i i am</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.440" end="00:41:08.560" style="s2">based in</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:09.119" style="s2">truth ingrained in truth to go towards</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.560" end="00:41:11.200" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.119" end="00:41:12.240" style="s2">and you realize now the cult of the now</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.200" end="00:41:15.280" style="s2">that we live at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.240" end="00:41:16.640" style="s2">has no capacity for truth at all it only</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.280" end="00:41:19.680" style="s2">has capacity one thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.640" end="00:41:21.200" style="s2">my feelings that&#39;s why it&#39;s a crowd</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.680" end="00:41:24.240" style="s2">obsessed what it feels</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.200" end="00:41:25.040" style="s2">as if what it felt was truth that is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.240" end="00:41:28.319" style="s2">ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:31.119" style="s2">dangerous pagan lynch mob that ignores</p>

<p begin="00:41:36.319" end="00:41:40.160" style="s2">so i think speaking makes sense towards</p>

<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:44.880" style="s2">a lot of sense right</p>

<p begin="00:42:38.079" end="00:42:43.280" style="s2">um uh there&#39;s like one is</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.839" end="00:42:45.440" style="s2">the they&#39;re called the three bodies of</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.280" end="00:42:47.200" style="s2">the buddha and and so so one is</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.440" end="00:42:48.800" style="s2">one is the the the appearance of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.200" end="00:42:51.440" style="s2">buddha like the the buddha</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.800" end="00:42:52.240" style="s2">and the other is is the subtle you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.440" end="00:42:54.000" style="s2">uh non</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.240" end="00:42:55.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the subtle aspect it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.000" end="00:42:56.720" style="s2">pure thought and then and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.680" end="00:43:00.079" style="s2">the third which is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.720" end="00:43:02.960" style="s2">non-dual which is um beyond the causal</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.079" end="00:43:03.920" style="s2">on some level but um i i always i&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:43:07.680" end="00:43:11.359" style="s2">fact right of objective fact and then</p>

<p begin="00:43:22.400" end="00:43:26.880" style="s2">the buddhist texts when i noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.359" end="00:43:27.440" style="s2">whitehead was talking about the same</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.880" end="00:43:30.000" style="s2">thing but</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.440" end="00:43:31.920" style="s2">in a lot more well accessible way to me</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.000" end="00:43:34.000" style="s2">and also very evolved you know very</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.920" end="00:43:35.839" style="s2">systematic and including signs and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.000" end="00:43:37.040" style="s2">like that so but there&#39;s actually a guy</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.839" end="00:43:39.119" style="s2">who wrote the book about</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.040" end="00:43:40.240" style="s2">the the connection between whitehead and</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.119" end="00:43:43.040" style="s2">uh and</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.240" end="00:43:44.720" style="s2">buddhism uh an australian guy is a very</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.040" end="00:43:46.480" style="s2">interesting book</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.720" end="00:43:48.800" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting do you remember the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.480" end="00:43:53.040" style="s2">title yeah i have it here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.800" end="00:43:55.760" style="s2">um it&#39;s a guy called peter paul</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.040" end="00:43:56.319" style="s2">something i have it here somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.760" end="00:43:58.000" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.319" end="00:44:00.440" style="s2">red airling is challenging me of course</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.000" end="00:44:03.760" style="s2">they were working on a model for</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.440" end="00:44:05.200" style="s2">pre-process so pre-relation meaning also</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.760" end="00:44:07.359" style="s2">pre-physics</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.200" end="00:44:08.960" style="s2">uh and and whitey was concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.359" end="00:44:10.400" style="s2">this and you can&#39;t ignore it because</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.960" end="00:44:12.240" style="s2">that would be the dharmakaya then if</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.400" end="00:44:13.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not potential must exist before</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.240" end="00:44:15.599" style="s2">actuality exists but</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.920" end="00:44:17.119" style="s2">for us at least afraid elegant i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.599" end="00:44:19.839" style="s2">working on is the potential</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.119" end="00:44:21.839" style="s2">is pre-process and pre-relation suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.839" end="00:44:23.760" style="s2">relation occurs and the way i&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.839" end="00:44:24.400" style="s2">at it is like in the membrane theory so</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.760" end="00:44:26.079" style="s2">you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.400" end="00:44:28.079" style="s2">say fields of potential that no</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.079" end="00:44:31.359" style="s2">connection one another whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.079" end="00:44:32.560" style="s2">but when they collide things happen</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.359" end="00:44:34.400" style="s2">that&#39;s relation</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.560" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">and relation and kick starts processing</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.400" end="00:44:37.920" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of going away from the white</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:41.599" style="s2">hadian agenda right because then you</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.920" end="00:44:44.079" style="s2">you kind of don&#39;t put relations as</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.599" end="00:44:44.800" style="s2">as fundamental but you i think i know</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.079" end="00:44:47.280" style="s2">why did</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.800" end="00:44:49.200" style="s2">whiter dealt with relations was</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.280" end="00:44:50.800" style="s2">fundamental to the world as we know it</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.200" end="00:44:52.560" style="s2">so the world he discussed from plato</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.800" end="00:44:53.839" style="s2">forward was some was a word where he put</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.560" end="00:44:56.000" style="s2">relations at the center</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.839" end="00:44:57.920" style="s2">therefore he&#39;s heraclitus responding to</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.000" end="00:45:01.280" style="s2">plato in the way he works</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.920" end="00:45:04.560" style="s2">but it&#39;s uh there is</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.280" end="00:45:05.359" style="s2">states of there are states of potential</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.560" end="00:45:08.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.359" end="00:45:10.240" style="s2">we call antique but not actual</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.800" end="00:45:11.680" style="s2">now it gets really weird here right it</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.240" end="00:45:13.200" style="s2">gets real domestic a lot of that but</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.680" end="00:45:14.880" style="s2">david bowm dealt with this why to deal</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.200" end="00:45:17.119" style="s2">with us and it&#39;s inescapable</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.880" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">you can&#39;t really do an emergence vector</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.119" end="00:45:21.119" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:22.960" style="s2">on to remove the primacy of physics or</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.119" end="00:45:23.599" style="s2">remove the primacy of consciousness in</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.960" end="00:45:25.359" style="s2">either end</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.599" end="00:45:27.200" style="s2">so you see the reductionism of reverse</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.359" end="00:45:29.359" style="s2">reductions you want to get rid of both</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.200" end="00:45:31.280" style="s2">by making all emergence vectors neutral</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.359" end="00:45:33.599" style="s2">to one another so each emergence vector</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.280" end="00:45:35.119" style="s2">is discussed on its own merits it then</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.599" end="00:45:37.359" style="s2">turns out the physics doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.119" end="00:45:39.440" style="s2">need to be prior to chemistry biology</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.359" end="00:45:41.599" style="s2">you can even discuss an emergency sector</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.440" end="00:45:43.200" style="s2">prior to physics called subphysics</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.599" end="00:45:44.640" style="s2">i work with hypertime and i work with</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.200" end="00:45:46.960" style="s2">hyperspace in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.640" end="00:45:48.880" style="s2">if for example the big bounce occurred</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.960" end="00:45:49.599" style="s2">and space time then is created after the</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.880" end="00:45:52.400" style="s2">big bounce</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.599" end="00:45:52.880" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously something prior to</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.400" end="00:45:55.440" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.880" end="00:45:57.599" style="s2">time we cannot think of it any other way</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.440" end="00:45:58.720" style="s2">we need the hyper time axis to do that</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.599" end="00:46:01.200" style="s2">it has to happen in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.720" end="00:46:03.760" style="s2">hyperspace to occur now</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.200" end="00:46:05.839" style="s2">we can leave aside what hyperspace and</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.760" end="00:46:07.280" style="s2">hypertime is for now that&#39;s a much later</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.839" end="00:46:07.760" style="s2">question to solve if ever it could be</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.280" end="00:46:10.160" style="s2">solved</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.760" end="00:46:12.160" style="s2">but we have to pathetically state that</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.160" end="00:46:13.280" style="s2">that to me means there are fields of</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.160" end="00:46:15.359" style="s2">potentials</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:16.319" style="s2">that don&#39;t have to respect space time as</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.359" end="00:46:18.240" style="s2">we know it</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.319" end="00:46:19.680" style="s2">and these fields of potential can then</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.240" end="00:46:21.440" style="s2">collide</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.680" end="00:46:22.960" style="s2">and when they collide we get existence</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.440" end="00:46:23.520" style="s2">as we know it and that&#39;s how relations</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.960" end="00:46:25.520" style="s2">kick in</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.520" end="00:46:26.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s why anything meaningful to us</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.520" end="00:46:28.880" style="s2">that we discuss</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.560" end="00:46:30.160" style="s2">is process any meaningful task that we</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.880" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">discuss is relations</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.160" end="00:46:33.599" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t have to start with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:35.119" style="s2">lashes or start the process</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.599" end="00:46:36.720" style="s2">because we&#39;re going to remove the whole</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.119" end="00:46:40.800" style="s2">idea at the start</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.720" end="00:46:43.200" style="s2">is important the start is not the event</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.800" end="00:46:45.200" style="s2">if you create a radical emergence vector</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.200" end="00:46:47.280" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.200" end="00:46:49.280" style="s2">because then it becomes more important</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.280" end="00:46:51.599" style="s2">this is this is getting very close to</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.280" end="00:46:53.280" style="s2">to science right i mean you you&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.599" end="00:46:54.240" style="s2">to get a physicist on the team i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.280" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">afraid and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.240" end="00:46:58.000" style="s2">read these there&#39;s there&#39;s a book where</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:47:00.720" style="s2">they basically explain how uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.000" end="00:47:03.040" style="s2">how whitehead&#39;s uh metaphysics fits</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.720" end="00:47:05.760" style="s2">perfectly on on quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.040" end="00:47:07.440" style="s2">yeah so um so i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.760" end="00:47:08.079" style="s2">very ambitious program something like</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.440" end="00:47:10.560" style="s2">that um</p>

<p begin="00:47:10.560" end="00:47:14.400" style="s2">it it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.920" end="00:47:15.280" style="s2">listen as long as it doesn&#39;t challenge</p>

<p begin="00:47:19.760" end="00:47:22.400" style="s2">moving and makes them even more possible</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.520" end="00:47:24.480" style="s2">and likely</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.400" end="00:47:26.000" style="s2">which is a good sign uh it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.480" end="00:47:29.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole point this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.000" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">try or to or outside of or external too</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.520" end="00:47:33.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s speculation and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.200" end="00:47:35.839" style="s2">philosophers are allowed to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.520" end="00:47:37.680" style="s2">and if they&#39;re good at it they have some</p>

<p begin="00:47:37.680" end="00:47:40.880" style="s2">years later come along and said hey</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.280" end="00:47:42.400" style="s2">this is something i could try it could</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.880" end="00:47:44.160" style="s2">make sense here locally</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.400" end="00:47:46.800" style="s2">for example edward witton&#39;s membrane</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.160" end="00:47:48.240" style="s2">theory if superstring theory is not that</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:49.839" style="s2">interesting to put it in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.240" end="00:47:51.119" style="s2">put it away somewhere and see if we ever</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.839" end="00:47:51.760" style="s2">need it in the future maybe we can look</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.119" end="00:47:53.280" style="s2">at it again</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.760" end="00:47:55.280" style="s2">because we got stuck with it but</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.280" end="00:47:56.880" style="s2">membrane theory is interesting as an</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.280" end="00:47:59.599" style="s2">idea of universes</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.880" end="00:48:01.359" style="s2">existing to begin with and i could then</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.599" end="00:48:03.119" style="s2">think of membrane theory</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.359" end="00:48:04.800" style="s2">the other way around like it&#39;s only when</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.119" end="00:48:05.839" style="s2">the universe that we&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.800" end="00:48:07.920" style="s2">the member of theater could be</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.839" end="00:48:10.480" style="s2">interesting when we are</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.920" end="00:48:12.079" style="s2">approaching the problem that for an</p>

<p begin="00:48:14.960" end="00:48:19.119" style="s2">which is an unavoidable question in</p>

<p begin="00:48:19.119" end="00:48:22.880" style="s2">and if you&#39;re gonna not gonna have the</p>

<p begin="00:48:31.119" end="00:48:34.960" style="s2">we&#39;re getting towards something where</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.200" end="00:48:36.720" style="s2">the big balance is probably going to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.960" end="00:48:37.520" style="s2">the winning solution today and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.720" end="00:48:39.520" style="s2">going to change</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.520" end="00:48:41.440" style="s2">physics radically when it happens and by</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.520" end="00:48:44.079" style="s2">preparing the subphysics that actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.440" end="00:48:46.319" style="s2">embraces that idea</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.079" end="00:48:47.599" style="s2">with a really weird concept of</p>

<p begin="00:48:47.599" end="00:48:50.960" style="s2">almost close to something worse circular</p>

<p begin="00:48:50.960" end="00:48:57.440" style="s2">interestingly enough see where that goes</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.040" end="00:48:58.960" style="s2">how far becomes stretched thinking-wise</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.440" end="00:49:00.400" style="s2">brady and elon and i obviously are great</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.960" end="00:49:01.680" style="s2">with sort of challenging other ways we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.400" end="00:49:02.880" style="s2">love to involve in those conversations</p>

<p begin="00:49:02.880" end="00:49:06.160" style="s2">but we&#39;re really stretching each other</p>

<p begin="00:49:06.160" end="00:49:09.760" style="s2">because uh boom and whitehead they are</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.800" end="00:49:13.040" style="s2">they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.760" end="00:49:14.640" style="s2">quite different right yeah but they they</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.040" end="00:49:16.720" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re asking the right</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.640" end="00:49:19.599" style="s2">questions in a way towards</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.720" end="00:49:22.000" style="s2">the natural sciences as friends of</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.599" end="00:49:22.559" style="s2">natural sciences willing to extend their</p>

<p begin="00:49:22.559" end="00:49:25.920" style="s2">at least philosophically speaking i</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.280" end="00:49:27.920" style="s2">think that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.920" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">bomb is basically a hindu and white is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.920" end="00:49:31.760" style="s2">buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:34.480" style="s2">exactly yes yes you can divide the world</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.760" end="00:49:37.920" style="s2">into the hindus and buddhists right</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.480" end="00:49:38.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the it&#39;s like the big division</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.920" end="00:49:40.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.400" end="00:49:42.160" style="s2">the hindu after all sort of lovey-dovey</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.640" end="00:49:44.880" style="s2">and the buddhists are like</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.160" end="00:49:47.599" style="s2">well to you guys too guys okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.880" end="00:49:49.839" style="s2">origin of eventology is of course to try</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.599" end="00:49:52.400" style="s2">to get off the wheel of the eternal</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.839" end="00:49:54.240" style="s2">recurrence of the same to begin with so</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.400" end="00:49:56.480" style="s2">buddha&#39;s first attempt there is just can</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.240" end="00:49:58.720" style="s2">i just get off</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.480" end="00:49:59.920" style="s2">uh whereas our asterisk that says why</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.720" end="00:50:02.559" style="s2">get off</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.920" end="00:50:03.680" style="s2">why not use it why not create an event</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.559" end="00:50:05.760" style="s2">well that&#39;s trunk</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.680" end="00:50:07.680" style="s2">as well i mean that&#39;s yeah in tantra you</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.760" end="00:50:09.280" style="s2">get that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.680" end="00:50:11.839" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not getting off the wheel</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.280" end="00:50:13.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a very nice</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.839" end="00:50:14.720" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;m saying you can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.200" end="00:50:16.000" style="s2">speak or certain speakers or asterisks</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.720" end="00:50:16.960" style="s2">and buddhism separate religions in that</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.000" end="00:50:20.000" style="s2">sense they&#39;re different schools are</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.960" end="00:50:21.760" style="s2">thought in one and each</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.000" end="00:50:23.680" style="s2">and the ultimate extreme is of course to</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.760" end="00:50:26.400" style="s2">take the most follicle religious rasters</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.680" end="00:50:26.960" style="s2">and put it opposed to jainism and peter</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.400" end="00:50:28.400" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.960" end="00:50:30.000" style="s2">he&#39;s really interested around here he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.400" end="00:50:32.160" style="s2">really just in jainism at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.000" end="00:50:34.160" style="s2">yes he&#39;s proud his father is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.160" end="00:50:36.000" style="s2">fatherly rebellion against me i guess to</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.160" end="00:50:38.400" style="s2">dig into giants and see what he can find</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.000" end="00:50:39.520" style="s2">but it&#39;s interesting he&#39;s a character</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.400" end="00:50:40.960" style="s2">that actually would make a really good</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.520" end="00:50:42.720" style="s2">giant this month to be honest about it</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.960" end="00:50:46.480" style="s2">it fits his personality perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.720" end="00:50:48.720" style="s2">and and walk around naked</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.480" end="00:50:50.720" style="s2">well if yeah if the big bounce turns out</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.720" end="00:50:51.680" style="s2">to be true the giants and wins the war</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.720" end="00:50:53.599" style="s2">of the religious</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.680" end="00:50:55.280" style="s2">we have to go back and study it properly</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.599" end="00:50:58.000" style="s2">because obviously we have</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.280" end="00:50:59.680" style="s2">amounts of time and eons of universes</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.000" end="00:51:01.359" style="s2">and hypertimes and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.680" end="00:51:03.520" style="s2">that we have to deal with once we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.359" end="00:51:04.640" style="s2">there and it&#39;s looking increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.520" end="00:51:05.200" style="s2">likely we&#39;re going to end up with that</p>

<p begin="00:51:05.200" end="00:51:09.119" style="s2">so we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see where that</p>

<p begin="00:52:37.520" end="00:52:40.240" style="s2">fine that&#39;s why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.800" end="00:52:42.640" style="s2">environmentalists and that&#39;s when men</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.240" end="00:52:44.400" style="s2">dream about becoming a ketokians</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.640" end="00:52:45.359" style="s2">and together echotopianism</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.400" end="00:52:46.559" style="s2">environmentalism just majestic</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.359" end="00:52:50.319" style="s2">zoroastrians and buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.559" end="00:52:53.599" style="s2">they&#39;re complementary antagonists</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.319" end="00:52:57.040" style="s2">complementary antagonists yeah like that</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.599" end="00:52:58.559" style="s2">yeah but one thing that is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.040" end="00:53:00.160" style="s2">interesting is that so in india they</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.559" end="00:53:02.559" style="s2">seem to be very good at having</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.160" end="00:53:03.520" style="s2">these different religions uh living next</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.559" end="00:53:05.040" style="s2">to each other</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.520" end="00:53:07.200" style="s2">and people people seem to be very very</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.040" end="00:53:07.520" style="s2">flexible so in europe of course we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.200" end="00:53:10.480" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.520" end="00:53:10.960" style="s2">uh less success with that i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.480" end="00:53:12.960" style="s2">know like</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.960" end="00:53:14.400" style="s2">uh we had these these wars between</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.960" end="00:53:16.800" style="s2">protestants and catholics</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.400" end="00:53:17.680" style="s2">that went on for a long time and uh so</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.800" end="00:53:20.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a it would</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.680" end="00:53:21.920" style="s2">also be interesting to look into why why</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.000" end="00:53:24.319" style="s2">is this is this uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.920" end="00:53:25.680" style="s2">why is there this religious pluralism in</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.319" end="00:53:27.599" style="s2">india with relatively</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.680" end="00:53:29.599" style="s2">well the persian empire had it for 1400</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.599" end="00:53:31.599" style="s2">years too before islam came along so</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.599" end="00:53:32.640" style="s2">and china has practiced for most of its</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.599" end="00:53:34.640" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.640" end="00:53:36.480" style="s2">it is because you separate simply you</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.640" end="00:53:38.960" style="s2">separate religion</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.480" end="00:53:39.680" style="s2">from state because you separate priests</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.960" end="00:53:42.000" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.680" end="00:53:43.280" style="s2">king but then king and priests are both</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.000" end="00:53:45.359" style="s2">part of the religion</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.280" end="00:53:47.520" style="s2">so there&#39;s an overarching religion and</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.359" end="00:53:49.599" style="s2">beneath that you can have iconology</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.520" end="00:53:51.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t say politicism it&#39;s iconology</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.599" end="00:53:53.359" style="s2">the worship of the lesser gods</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.440" end="00:53:55.440" style="s2">but because we don&#39;t have iconology it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.359" end="00:53:59.119" style="s2">in protestant europe a protestant north</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.440" end="00:54:02.319" style="s2">america we invented celebrity worship</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.119" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">which requests terrible iconology</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.319" end="00:54:05.520" style="s2">celebrities take tons of drugs and die</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.160" end="00:54:07.200" style="s2">when they&#39;re young what the fuck</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.520" end="00:54:08.800" style="s2">they&#39;re not good role models but those</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.200" end="00:54:11.119" style="s2">are the girls yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.800" end="00:54:11.119" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.000" end="00:54:17.920" style="s2">but that&#39;s what we do people cannot live</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.920" end="00:54:21.040" style="s2">without the lesser gods they they go</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.920" end="00:54:23.119" style="s2">crazy so they will invent lesser gothic</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.040" end="00:54:24.400" style="s2">sacrifice celebrity culture is just bad</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.119" end="00:54:26.079" style="s2">religion it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.400" end="00:54:28.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just again we&#39;re not atheistic</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.079" end="00:54:30.240" style="s2">at all we just replaced christianity</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.240" end="00:54:32.559" style="s2">with with this sort of pagan religion</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.240" end="00:54:33.839" style="s2">full of idol worship and the idols we</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.559" end="00:54:35.440" style="s2">worship our civil liberties and of</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.839" end="00:54:36.240" style="s2">course the celebrities are even tired of</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.440" end="00:54:38.079" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.240" end="00:54:39.680" style="s2">they walk off television they walk off</p>

<p begin="00:54:44.480" end="00:54:46.880" style="s2">longer</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.960" end="00:54:48.720" style="s2">nobody wants to be in the limelight any</p>

<p begin="00:54:48.720" end="00:54:54.400" style="s2">why would you put yourself through such</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.799" end="00:54:54.400" style="s2">horrors as being a celebrity</p>

<p begin="00:55:17.440" end="00:55:20.319" style="s2">online world because you can go into</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.119" end="00:55:21.920" style="s2">smaller audience</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.319" end="00:55:23.440" style="s2">you can go into people who really are</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.920" end="00:55:25.280" style="s2">interested in what you do that&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.440" end="00:55:26.079" style="s2">more natural way of communicating to</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.280" end="00:55:28.240" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.079" end="00:55:29.520" style="s2">than just sending mass television with</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.240" end="00:55:31.680" style="s2">crappy commercials</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.520" end="00:55:33.040" style="s2">sending ice cream in huge packages to</p>

<p begin="00:55:34.960" end="00:55:37.920" style="s2">online world where you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.000" end="00:55:39.359" style="s2">specialize and people just go away go</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.920" end="00:55:40.079" style="s2">somewhere else if they don&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.359" end="00:55:42.799" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.079" end="00:55:44.559" style="s2">i i find that democratization of media</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.799" end="00:55:46.319" style="s2">incredible</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.559" end="00:55:48.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s much more similar to having</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.319" end="00:55:49.839" style="s2">monasteries where you can go and study</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.400" end="00:55:51.440" style="s2">so you immerse yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.839" end="00:55:52.640" style="s2">this is what i really want to study and</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.440" end="00:55:53.280" style="s2">this is the teacher that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.640" end="00:55:54.319" style="s2">have and</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.280" end="00:55:56.480" style="s2">if i can have a teacher i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.319" end="00:55:59.599" style="s2">immerse myself and stay there for years</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.480" end="00:56:02.319" style="s2">to study rather just</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.599" end="00:56:04.000" style="s2">surf around across everything and say</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.319" end="00:56:04.960" style="s2">the same stupid things that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.000" end="00:56:07.359" style="s2">else does because</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.960" end="00:56:09.359" style="s2">it&#39;s precisely the surfing and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.359" end="00:56:11.280" style="s2">quoting of the skin quotes from the</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.359" end="00:56:14.319" style="s2">same celebrities that creates the</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.280" end="00:56:16.160" style="s2">current lynch mob culture</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.319" end="00:56:17.599" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s only togetherness on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.160" end="00:56:19.599" style="s2">surface there&#39;s nothing deep to it</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.599" end="00:56:21.200" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing profound to it at all</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.599" end="00:56:23.680" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to join and it&#39;s strictly</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.200" end="00:56:26.960" style="s2">emotional and demands nothing of you</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.680" end="00:56:26.960" style="s2">except you must stay with the group</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.839" end="00:56:33.839" style="s2">yeah this</p>

<p begin="00:56:56.640" end="00:57:00.400" style="s2">because i knew when i started doing pop</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.720" end="00:57:01.760" style="s2">culture the pop culture was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.400" end="00:57:03.119" style="s2">incredibly important</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.760" end="00:57:04.400" style="s2">the internet came along and knew yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.119" end="00:57:06.000" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be important for the first</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.400" end="00:57:08.160" style="s2">30 years</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.000" end="00:57:10.160" style="s2">after that we will cut it will count for</p>

<p begin="00:57:29.520" end="00:57:32.720" style="s2">all along</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.960" end="00:57:34.880" style="s2">the rockstar was just a crappy lesser</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.720" end="00:57:36.960" style="s2">god and then most of them killed</p>

<p begin="00:57:40.400" end="00:57:44.559" style="s2">healthy thing at all</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.839" end="00:57:46.079" style="s2">and iconology is is what people create</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.559" end="00:57:48.400" style="s2">whether it&#39;s there or not</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.079" end="00:57:50.319" style="s2">so it must be respected as a folk</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.400" end="00:57:51.200" style="s2">religion and with all the force that</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.319" end="00:57:53.680" style="s2">goes with it</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.200" end="00:57:54.799" style="s2">and the mystery religion i was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.680" end="00:57:56.240" style="s2">think about this because you when you</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.799" end="00:57:56.640" style="s2">were talking about you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.240" end="00:58:00.720" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.640" end="00:58:03.760" style="s2">um you know as if it was a a lesser</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.720" end="00:58:05.760" style="s2">thing but it is lesser in one sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.760" end="00:58:07.280" style="s2">lesser but it&#39;s also powerful it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.760" end="00:58:10.559" style="s2">no no no no no no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.280" end="00:58:12.720" style="s2">not it&#39;s not just no shit no no no</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.559" end="00:58:15.280" style="s2">no it says lesser lesser means it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.720" end="00:58:17.520" style="s2">closer to you because you&#39;re human</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.280" end="00:58:19.520" style="s2">a lesser god is a god who&#39;s closer to</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.520" end="00:58:21.680" style="s2">you as humans you like it might be not</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.520" end="00:58:22.400" style="s2">real in an ultimate sense but it&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.680" end="00:58:25.440" style="s2">in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.400" end="00:58:27.520" style="s2">it&#39;s somebody you can mimic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.440" end="00:58:28.319" style="s2">somebody it&#39;s sutra it&#39;s somebody you</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.520" end="00:58:31.839" style="s2">can mimic</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.319" end="00:58:33.359" style="s2">you can&#39;t mimic an abstract almighty</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.839" end="00:58:36.000" style="s2">universal god you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.359" end="00:58:36.960" style="s2">mimic spinosus god the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.000" end="00:58:39.359" style="s2">spinoza is</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.960" end="00:58:40.400" style="s2">is modernism is completely monotheistic</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.359" end="00:58:42.400" style="s2">with no</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.400" end="00:58:44.240" style="s2">room for an iconology that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.400" end="00:58:45.359" style="s2">spin-off system was never religion</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.240" end="00:58:47.200" style="s2">that&#39;s why i&#39;m also saying that</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.359" end="00:58:48.640" style="s2">synthesis as we wrote it will not be</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.200" end="00:58:50.240" style="s2">practiced as a religion</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.640" end="00:58:52.640" style="s2">because you&#39;re basically building the</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.240" end="00:58:53.359" style="s2">hegelian version of the spinosist</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.640" end="00:58:54.720" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.359" end="00:58:57.119" style="s2">but that&#39;s where we have to start to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.720" end="00:58:59.760" style="s2">metaphysics and philosophy properly</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.119" end="00:59:01.359" style="s2">to create the religion of the elite you</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.760" end="00:59:05.040" style="s2">write in the system book this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.359" end="00:59:07.359" style="s2">not a handbook for a world religion no</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.040" end="00:59:08.640" style="s2">this is philosophy this is metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.359" end="00:59:10.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s espinoza that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.640" end="00:59:12.720" style="s2">feminism never became a religion at all</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.400" end="00:59:14.480" style="s2">you can&#39;t have a church or spinal cell</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.720" end="00:59:16.319" style="s2">because the only gods people can relate</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.480" end="00:59:17.760" style="s2">to gods they can mimic the vast majority</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.319" end="00:59:18.079" style="s2">people just want to god they can relate</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.760" end="00:59:20.480" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.079" end="00:59:21.440" style="s2">like an old grandmother who died or</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.480" end="00:59:24.640" style="s2">possibly</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.440" end="00:59:26.319" style="s2">uh somebody for somebody ahead of you</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.640" end="00:59:28.240" style="s2">who&#39;s not here yet</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.319" end="00:59:29.760" style="s2">he&#39;s so old somebody from the future</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.240" end="00:59:31.280" style="s2">somebody from the past you worship</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.760" end="00:59:32.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s a lesser god that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.280" end="00:59:34.079" style="s2">called lesser god lester god it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.480" end="00:59:35.440" style="s2">beautiful term for somebody you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.079" end="00:59:37.440" style="s2">relate to</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.440" end="00:59:38.640" style="s2">the higher gods you cannot relate to</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.440" end="00:59:40.880" style="s2">that that&#39;s the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.640" end="00:59:42.559" style="s2">monotheistic religion is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.880" end="00:59:44.160" style="s2">catholicism at least through the saints</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.559" end="00:59:46.079" style="s2">in there and i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.160" end="00:59:48.160" style="s2">all the catholics go worship the saints</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.079" end="00:59:50.160" style="s2">they have their own saint of their own</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.160" end="00:59:51.599" style="s2">archetype or the city where they live</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.160" end="00:59:54.079" style="s2">who they go worship</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.599" end="00:59:55.359" style="s2">talk to and then the saint must talk to</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.079" end="00:59:58.240" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.359" end="00:59:58.240" style="s2">in that order</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.359" end="01:00:02.799" style="s2">have a lot of um right so well the</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.040" end="01:00:04.960" style="s2">deities right is is you you</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.799" end="01:00:06.240" style="s2">you uh in generation phase you generate</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.960" end="01:00:09.599" style="s2">the deity like you generate</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.240" end="01:00:12.079" style="s2">images of the deity it&#39;s sort of like um</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.599" end="01:00:14.160" style="s2">it&#39;s like why people watch movies right</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.079" end="01:00:17.119" style="s2">you you get totally immersed in this</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.160" end="01:00:18.720" style="s2">um world it&#39;s not ultimately true you it</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.119" end="01:00:20.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s ultimately true</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.720" end="01:00:22.079" style="s2">it&#39;s archetypes but it&#39;s but you get you</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.880" end="01:00:24.160" style="s2">you immerse yourself</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.079" end="01:00:26.240" style="s2">in it and it&#39;s as true as it can be for</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.160" end="01:00:28.799" style="s2">you in that</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.240" end="01:00:30.640" style="s2">moment and then eventually you get you</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.799" end="01:00:33.520" style="s2">go through stages right you go</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.640" end="01:00:35.920" style="s2">the different stages of of of uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.520" end="01:00:38.799" style="s2">religion at the highest stage the whole</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.920" end="01:00:39.359" style="s2">house of cards collapsed right right</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.799" end="01:00:41.839" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.359" end="01:00:43.520" style="s2">zen when they say that um you know you</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.839" end="01:00:44.880" style="s2">know you kill the buddha or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.520" end="01:00:46.960" style="s2">that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.880" end="01:00:48.400" style="s2">the final stage but but in the b but</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.960" end="01:00:49.760" style="s2">then there&#39;s all these what they call in</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.400" end="01:00:51.839" style="s2">buddhism skillful means</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.760" end="01:00:53.440" style="s2">you know there&#39;s all kinds of skillful</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.839" end="01:00:56.400" style="s2">means all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.440" end="01:00:58.240" style="s2">kind of you know experimental um</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.400" end="01:00:58.960" style="s2">projects that you you know you work</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.240" end="01:01:01.119" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.960" end="01:01:02.079" style="s2">for various reasons and and that leads</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.119" end="01:01:04.799" style="s2">to various</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.079" end="01:01:06.240" style="s2">you know results and because religious</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.799" end="01:01:07.520" style="s2">about your personal journey through life</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.240" end="01:01:08.559" style="s2">that&#39;s what religion ultimately is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.520" end="01:01:11.359" style="s2">not about god</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.559" end="01:01:12.240" style="s2">the ultimate god is always spinoza&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.359" end="01:01:14.000" style="s2">universe or</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.240" end="01:01:16.240" style="s2">the zhurvan of the servanites or</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.000" end="01:01:18.480" style="s2">astranism or the brahman so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.240" end="01:01:21.040" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the breath of the universe and</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.480" end="01:01:23.920" style="s2">time passing is processed that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.040" end="01:01:25.760" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing beneath that but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.920" end="01:01:29.680" style="s2">a god that doesn&#39;t care about us</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.760" end="01:01:30.400" style="s2">but that&#39;s god so that kind of abstract</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.680" end="01:01:33.440" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.400" end="01:01:35.040" style="s2">is abstract concept yeah sure and hegel</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.440" end="01:01:36.720" style="s2">says it&#39;s just an abstract concept it</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.040" end="01:01:38.400" style="s2">cannot be understood any other way by</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.720" end="01:01:42.000" style="s2">humanity but if you want a god</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.400" end="01:01:44.799" style="s2">that&#39;s god that&#39;s why atheism is just</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.000" end="01:01:47.839" style="s2">the silliest idea ever why not believe</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.799" end="01:01:49.440" style="s2">in something you don&#39;t even understand</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.839" end="01:01:51.040" style="s2">why spend time not believing something</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.440" end="01:01:52.640" style="s2">you haven&#39;t even taken the time to</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.040" end="01:01:54.559" style="s2">understand that&#39;s essentially what the</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.640" end="01:01:56.480" style="s2">atheism is</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.559" end="01:01:58.720" style="s2">so the question is just for your place</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.480" end="01:01:59.839" style="s2">god and what kind of god on what level</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.720" end="01:02:02.400" style="s2">is important to you and</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.839" end="01:02:07.359" style="s2">as soon as you have a master you follow</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.400" end="01:02:10.559" style="s2">in any way that&#39;s a god</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.359" end="01:02:11.599" style="s2">sure sure yeah the parent is the lesser</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.559" end="01:02:13.359" style="s2">god to the child</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.599" end="01:02:15.280" style="s2">so the parent can then go off and pray</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.359" end="01:02:16.880" style="s2">to sink in the church so the parent can</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.280" end="01:02:19.680" style="s2">have a lesser god to follow</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.880" end="01:02:20.799" style="s2">and the lesser god has a protective</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.680" end="01:02:22.079" style="s2">saint of why</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.799" end="01:02:24.160" style="s2">because the protective saints is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.079" end="01:02:25.200" style="s2">ultimate archetype of the archetype you</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.160" end="01:02:26.480" style="s2">belong to</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.200" end="01:02:28.799" style="s2">with where you for example your</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.480" end="01:02:30.160" style="s2">profession and your the kind of man or</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.799" end="01:02:31.200" style="s2">the kind of woman you are where that</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.160" end="01:02:33.599" style="s2">belongs so</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.200" end="01:02:35.039" style="s2">you go into your mode of being you have</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.599" end="01:02:36.400" style="s2">somebody you can follow mimic and we</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.039" end="01:02:38.000" style="s2">want to mimic and if we can</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.400" end="01:02:40.079" style="s2">make all the way to where we want to get</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.000" end="01:02:41.280" style="s2">that&#39;s fine the only problem is that</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.079" end="01:02:43.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a point where</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.280" end="01:02:45.520" style="s2">mimicking no longer pays off and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.200" end="01:02:48.480" style="s2">in moving to the realm of novelty</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.520" end="01:02:48.960" style="s2">and neuron on innovation the the realm</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.480" end="01:02:52.000" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.960" end="01:02:53.200" style="s2">the completely new the event yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.000" end="01:02:55.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s what eventuality is</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.200" end="01:02:58.240" style="s2">interested in novelty and novelty cannot</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.760" end="01:03:00.079" style="s2">happen through mimicking</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.240" end="01:03:01.839" style="s2">it can happen if you mimic and make a</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.079" end="01:03:03.359" style="s2">mistake and suddenly realize you made it</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.839" end="01:03:05.039" style="s2">differently than what you try to mimic</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.359" end="01:03:06.640" style="s2">so it doesn&#39;t have to be on purpose it</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.039" end="01:03:07.119" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be you have to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.640" end="01:03:09.039" style="s2">conscious</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.119" end="01:03:10.960" style="s2">but the fact that you do something in a</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.039" end="01:03:12.480" style="s2">way that nobody&#39;s ever done it before</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.960" end="01:03:13.039" style="s2">you come up with a word that nobody ever</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.480" end="01:03:14.640" style="s2">thought of</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.039" end="01:03:16.720" style="s2">you had an idea nobody ever thought</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.640" end="01:03:18.559" style="s2">before that&#39;s novelty the only way to do</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.720" end="01:03:19.440" style="s2">it is to stop mimicking and start</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.559" end="01:03:22.000" style="s2">thinking freely</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.440" end="01:03:24.079" style="s2">and that&#39;s a crazy wisdom and it means</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.000" end="01:03:25.920" style="s2">maybe it means a bit of heresy here and</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.079" end="01:03:27.280" style="s2">you know you have to kind of yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.920" end="01:03:29.760" style="s2">yeah we were talking about heresy</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.280" end="01:03:29.760" style="s2">earlier</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.440" end="01:03:35.200" style="s2">you know smashing icons or well the</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.839" end="01:03:37.200" style="s2">crazy wisdom teachers</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.200" end="01:03:38.960" style="s2">obviously destroys the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.200" end="01:03:40.400" style="s2">mimic so that&#39;s the ultimate format of</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.960" end="01:03:41.599" style="s2">mimicking as we talked about before</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.400" end="01:03:43.680" style="s2">that&#39;s why the crazy western</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.599" end="01:03:45.520" style="s2">teaching is wonderful and it&#39;s behind</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.680" end="01:03:46.400" style="s2">the bar absolute necessary that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.520" end="01:03:48.240" style="s2">a shocking</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.400" end="01:03:50.960" style="s2">and challenging place to be in but</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.240" end="01:03:53.839" style="s2">you&#39;re right the heretic</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.960" end="01:03:55.599" style="s2">or the antagonist you&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.839" end="01:03:58.400" style="s2">challenge you to think differently</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.599" end="01:04:00.319" style="s2">so at least for yourself you become new</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.400" end="01:04:03.520" style="s2">because the heretic is not somebody</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.319" end="01:04:05.280" style="s2">you copy or mimic then it&#39;s a tyrant no</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.520" end="01:04:07.119" style="s2">the heretic somebody you listen to and</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.280" end="01:04:07.920" style="s2">you react to it&#39;s like i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.119" end="01:04:09.680" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.920" end="01:04:11.119" style="s2">but okay i&#39;m going to challenge my own</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.680" end="01:04:12.559" style="s2">status quo so i&#39;m going to challenge my</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.119" end="01:04:14.079" style="s2">state by listening to you</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.559" end="01:04:16.160" style="s2">and see if you might challenge me or</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.079" end="01:04:17.920" style="s2">maybe we&#39;re both wrong but i can only</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.160" end="01:04:18.799" style="s2">expose the rebel throne by listening to</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.920" end="01:04:20.480" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.799" end="01:04:21.920" style="s2">which is another which is a dialectical</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.480" end="01:04:22.319" style="s2">term the third alternative could be</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.920" end="01:04:24.319" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.319" end="01:04:27.359" style="s2">i can only see it by being challenged by</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.319" end="01:04:29.839" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s a heretic</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.359" end="01:04:31.200" style="s2">all of that is part of antagonism which</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.839" end="01:04:31.760" style="s2">i think is the word we should use now</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.200" end="01:04:35.039" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.760" end="01:04:38.720" style="s2">creative fruitful expansive debate</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.039" end="01:04:40.640" style="s2">and argumentation and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.720" end="01:04:42.160" style="s2">these places of integrity are the</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.640" end="01:04:43.920" style="s2">monasteries we&#39;re looking for to replace</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.160" end="01:04:47.200" style="s2">academia</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.920" end="01:04:49.119" style="s2">yeah it has the word agony in it too</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.200" end="01:04:50.240" style="s2">is it which is because it is it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.119" end="01:04:54.799" style="s2">agonizing process</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.240" end="01:04:54.799" style="s2">it&#39;s an ant agony it&#39;s antioch</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.280" end="01:05:04.400" style="s2">right yeah antagonic</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.319" end="01:05:06.160" style="s2">thank you for an antagonic conversation</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.400" end="01:05:08.799" style="s2">brother yeah awesome yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.160" end="01:05:10.000" style="s2">thomas do you have any last uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.799" end="01:05:14.000" style="s2">reflections or</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.000" end="01:05:16.400" style="s2">things things to say because you&#39;re um</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.000" end="01:05:17.599" style="s2">yeah we touched upon a lot of ideas</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.400" end="01:05:19.119" style="s2">again that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.599" end="01:05:20.720" style="s2">more than two hours i might have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.119" end="01:05:22.400" style="s2">divide this this one at you</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.720" end="01:05:24.000" style="s2">i think that there&#39;s there&#39;s also a team</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.400" end="01:05:26.079" style="s2">of integration right there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.000" end="01:05:27.920" style="s2">thinkers that that have not really been</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.079" end="01:05:29.599" style="s2">brought into contact with each other you</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.920" end="01:05:30.880" style="s2">know we haven&#39;t for example there is</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.599" end="01:05:33.200" style="s2">nietzsche there&#39;s gerard</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.880" end="01:05:34.960" style="s2">there&#39;s whitehead and so so i think</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.200" end="01:05:37.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of work ahead to</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.960" end="01:05:38.079" style="s2">to take the most valuable ideas and kind</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.520" end="01:05:40.240" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.079" end="01:05:41.280" style="s2">apply them in the right way um because</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.240" end="01:05:43.440" style="s2">nietzsche so</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.280" end="01:05:45.359" style="s2">i think that gerard&#39;s critique of nature</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.440" end="01:05:47.440" style="s2">for example is very spot-on</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.359" end="01:05:50.079" style="s2">i think he really i think there are some</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.440" end="01:05:52.240" style="s2">some definitely some blind spots in in</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.079" end="01:05:53.200" style="s2">in nietzsche that that girard uh exposed</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.240" end="01:05:54.640" style="s2">but on the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.200" end="01:05:56.480" style="s2">nietzsche understands something that</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.640" end="01:05:57.680" style="s2">girard doesn&#39;t understand because</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.480" end="01:05:58.960" style="s2">because nietzsche can work with the</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.680" end="01:06:01.200" style="s2">dionysian which</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.960" end="01:06:02.640" style="s2">which girard purely sees as a problem</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.200" end="01:06:04.480" style="s2">which it isn&#39;t because that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.640" end="01:06:05.280" style="s2">what you basically learn in tantra right</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.480" end="01:06:07.280" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.280" end="01:06:09.280" style="s2">this dionysian is actually also very</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.280" end="01:06:10.640" style="s2">very valuable so i think that</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.280" end="01:06:12.160" style="s2">this these conversations are very</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.640" end="01:06:13.200" style="s2">interesting because because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.160" end="01:06:14.480" style="s2">basically also just</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.200" end="01:06:16.480" style="s2">engaging with a lot of different</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.480" end="01:06:18.319" style="s2">thinkers that have not been been put</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.480" end="01:06:20.559" style="s2">into contact with each other</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.319" end="01:06:21.920" style="s2">or at least not to not to the to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.559" end="01:06:24.559" style="s2">extent that uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.920" end="01:06:26.079" style="s2">that that we need them i agree</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.559" end="01:06:28.400" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.079" end="01:06:29.839" style="s2">that&#39;s why i i call myself hey gail in</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.400" end="01:06:31.520" style="s2">the sense that i built from hegel</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.839" end="01:06:33.119" style="s2">because he was the last major thinker of</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.520" end="01:06:34.640" style="s2">systems and i would have a system at the</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.119" end="01:06:38.079" style="s2">end of the day</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.640" end="01:06:39.680" style="s2">so but all these guys we talk about are</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.079" end="01:06:42.160" style="s2">the sons of hegel</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.680" end="01:06:43.760" style="s2">to me and i i think what i&#39;m adamant</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.160" end="01:06:45.839" style="s2">about is that the break between content</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.760" end="01:06:47.359" style="s2">hegel is the real revolution we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.839" end="01:06:48.880" style="s2">dealing with we&#39;ve only begun to</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.359" end="01:06:51.119" style="s2">understand that revolution</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.880" end="01:06:52.480" style="s2">and and that&#39;s on a par i think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.119" end="01:06:55.760" style="s2">going to argue in the book that</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.480" end="01:06:57.440" style="s2">sorastar&#39;s invention of eventology</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.760" end="01:06:59.200" style="s2">and the shift between content hegel are</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.440" end="01:07:01.200" style="s2">to me philosophically speaking</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.200" end="01:07:03.119" style="s2">the two most dramatic things that have</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.200" end="01:07:05.440" style="s2">happened in the history of thinking as i</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.119" end="01:07:05.440" style="s2">know it</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.520" end="01:07:11.119" style="s2">and maybe we caught up with the ontology</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.720" end="01:07:15.599" style="s2">and finally began to understood it fully</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.119" end="01:07:17.440" style="s2">with a shift from con to hegel</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.599" end="01:07:18.640" style="s2">but it&#39;s um that&#39;s where i&#39;m at say the</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.440" end="01:07:20.000" style="s2">shift from christianity to</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.640" end="01:07:21.680" style="s2">post-christianity not</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.000" end="01:07:23.920" style="s2">back to christianity but to</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.680" end="01:07:26.559" style="s2">post-christianity it&#39;s also again kant</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.920" end="01:07:28.240" style="s2">to hegel well you know it will be</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.559" end="01:07:28.559" style="s2">interesting where christianity goes from</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.240" end="01:07:30.079" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.559" end="01:07:32.160" style="s2">christianity has been evolving for it</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.079" end="01:07:33.920" style="s2">for 2000 years right i mean there is no</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.160" end="01:07:36.000" style="s2">such thing as christianity i mean</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.920" end="01:07:38.000" style="s2">if christianity wants to survive and i</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.000" end="01:07:40.319" style="s2">think it uh it wants that</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.000" end="01:07:42.160" style="s2">then it will have to deal with the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.319" end="01:07:44.559" style="s2">modern society and</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.160" end="01:07:46.000" style="s2">and and become relevant or become</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.559" end="01:07:47.760" style="s2">relevant again</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.000" end="01:07:49.200" style="s2">yeah and that and i would then suggest</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.760" end="01:07:50.880" style="s2">she become relevant by being ahead of</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.200" end="01:07:54.000" style="s2">the time instead of trying to catch up</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.880" end="01:07:55.440" style="s2">yeah i i totally agree since 1960 mark</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.000" end="01:07:56.880" style="s2">stallman is right about this but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.440" end="01:07:58.720" style="s2">1961 where they</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.880" end="01:08:00.400" style="s2">threw a latin out and took in local</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.720" end="01:08:02.000" style="s2">language it&#39;s just been imitating bad</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.400" end="01:08:03.920" style="s2">protestantism and again</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.000" end="01:08:07.200" style="s2">it&#39;s protestantism that has celebrity</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.920" end="01:08:09.039" style="s2">worship catholicism has kept the saints</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.200" end="01:08:10.559" style="s2">that&#39;s acceptable catholic cultures do</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.039" end="01:08:12.400" style="s2">not have the celebrity problem</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.559" end="01:08:13.520" style="s2">the way we have it in american europe</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.400" end="01:08:16.400" style="s2">that&#39;s why they will have to have the</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.520" end="01:08:18.400" style="s2">same lynch mobs that we do</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.400" end="01:08:20.480" style="s2">catholicism is to certain extent immune</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.400" end="01:08:22.080" style="s2">to that simply because they have already</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.480" end="01:08:23.759" style="s2">structured in place that&#39;s very stable</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.080" end="01:08:24.400" style="s2">over time and they can always return to</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.759" end="01:08:25.839" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.400" end="01:08:27.920" style="s2">i think the catholic church is also an</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.839" end="01:08:28.960" style="s2">amazing institution when it comes to</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.920" end="01:08:30.960" style="s2">power and scope</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.960" end="01:08:32.719" style="s2">that should not be underplayed here</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.960" end="01:08:33.839" style="s2">because when you go into periods of</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.719" end="01:08:36.400" style="s2">chaos</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.839" end="01:08:37.279" style="s2">big institutions that are stuck and have</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.400" end="01:08:40.319" style="s2">resources</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.279" end="01:08:42.239" style="s2">and can weather things survive and</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.319" end="01:08:43.759" style="s2">protestantism has none of those places</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.239" end="01:08:44.799" style="s2">because it lacks a center</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.759" end="01:08:46.719" style="s2">and because it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.799" end="01:08:47.440" style="s2">decentralized and essentially a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.719" end="01:08:49.279" style="s2">cults with</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.440" end="01:08:51.199" style="s2">sort of strong leaders that are no</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.279" end="01:08:52.000" style="s2">longer strong or even respected i think</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.199" end="01:08:54.960" style="s2">protestantism</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.000" end="01:08:56.400" style="s2">will go away before catholicism goes</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.960" end="01:08:58.159" style="s2">well a lot of people are moving back to</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.400" end="01:08:59.600" style="s2">the orthodox</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.159" end="01:09:01.359" style="s2">that&#39;s true yeah which i find</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.600" end="01:09:03.040" style="s2">interesting because i find the orthodox</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.359" end="01:09:06.159" style="s2">to be more into symbolism which is</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.040" end="01:09:09.440" style="s2">closer to uh vagina</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.159" end="01:09:11.600" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s closer to judaism for sure</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.440" end="01:09:12.880" style="s2">yeah and closer to sarasota&#39;s too it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.600" end="01:09:14.880" style="s2">historically so</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.880" end="01:09:17.040" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m not surprised that people are</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.880" end="01:09:19.600" style="s2">going into deep history</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.040" end="01:09:20.080" style="s2">men are going to the root of the phallus</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.600" end="01:09:21.839" style="s2">which means</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.080" end="01:09:23.279" style="s2">where is my line is where do i come from</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.839" end="01:09:24.560" style="s2">and go deeper and deeper and deeper into</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.279" end="01:09:25.920" style="s2">that that&#39;s exactly why the only thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.560" end="01:09:27.120" style="s2">i&#39;ve got with girard is to go even</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.920" end="01:09:29.279" style="s2">deeper than gerard did</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.120" end="01:09:30.799" style="s2">that means going into egypt and persia a</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.279" end="01:09:33.120" style="s2">division he doesn&#39;t discuss</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.799" end="01:09:34.560" style="s2">he starts with christianity and that</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.120" end="01:09:37.920" style="s2">daddy does fine</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.560" end="01:09:37.920" style="s2">no no no no no no no no</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.640" end="01:09:41.839" style="s2">absolute beginning so he has a theory of</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.799" end="01:09:44.400" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.839" end="01:09:46.480" style="s2">that is also um that also depends on</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.400" end="01:09:50.239" style="s2">builds on the victimization mechanism so</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.480" end="01:09:52.080" style="s2">she write um definitely looks at at the</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.239" end="01:09:54.000" style="s2">absolute beginning yeah but he jumps</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.080" end="01:09:55.040" style="s2">from there straight on to christianity</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.000" end="01:09:57.040" style="s2">and even freud</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.040" end="01:09:59.280" style="s2">does not discuss persian the persian</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.040" end="01:10:01.280" style="s2">heritage so when freud sits in moses and</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.280" end="01:10:04.080" style="s2">monotheism it talks about monopolism</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.280" end="01:10:05.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah moses was the leader of</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.080" end="01:10:07.920" style="s2">egyptian cult but it&#39;s not like the</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.520" end="01:10:09.920" style="s2">egyptians invented monotheism</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.920" end="01:10:11.360" style="s2">they mimicked it and did a bad version</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.920" end="01:10:12.640" style="s2">of it the original version was persian</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.360" end="01:10:15.760" style="s2">and we all know that by now</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.640" end="01:10:17.920" style="s2">but freud didn&#39;t in 1938. so even now</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.760" end="01:10:19.520" style="s2">only like 50 years later we know much</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.920" end="01:10:21.360" style="s2">more than these guys did</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.520" end="01:10:23.040" style="s2">and the problem with gerard is that he</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.360" end="01:10:25.520" style="s2">he</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.040" end="01:10:26.239" style="s2">but he then later discusses with the</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.520" end="01:10:28.560" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.239" end="01:10:30.640" style="s2">prior to that so there&#39;s like a big jump</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.560" end="01:10:32.880" style="s2">in gerard that&#39;s lacking that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.640" end="01:10:32.880" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.760" end="01:10:38.239" style="s2">it did write a book about uh brahmanism</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.239" end="01:10:40.560" style="s2">so that&#39;s on my to read list</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.239" end="01:10:41.840" style="s2">um great let&#39;s look into that together</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.560" end="01:10:43.520" style="s2">that could be really interesting yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.840" end="01:10:44.159" style="s2">that could fill the gap maybe it was</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.520" end="01:10:47.199" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.159" end="01:10:48.800" style="s2">early on like people read freud and</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.199" end="01:10:50.320" style="s2">they don&#39;t read taught them in taboo and</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.800" end="01:10:51.520" style="s2">they don&#39;t read moses and manifest and</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.320" end="01:10:53.360" style="s2">without those two books you don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.520" end="01:10:57.920" style="s2">the full freud</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.360" end="01:10:59.840" style="s2">it&#39;s impossible let&#39;s dig into that all</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.920" end="01:11:01.440" style="s2">right and the damn martyrs</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.840" end="01:11:03.520" style="s2">they&#39;re problematic what do we do with</p>
