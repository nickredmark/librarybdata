<p begin="00:00:02.449" end="00:00:07.869" style="s2">I&#39;m Dr.. Jordan B. [Peterson] a pSychology professor of the University of Toronto and Canada</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.660" end="00:00:12.369" style="s2">I&#39;m going to tell you the story behind the self authoring Suite Website.</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.490" end="00:00:19.240" style="s2">A few years ago, I realized that the students in my classes had written essays on all sorts of subjects in grade school and college</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.090" end="00:00:26.229" style="s2">However, they&#39;d never been asked to write thoughtfully about themselves about their own past experiences</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.080" end="00:00:29.109" style="s2">personalities and visions for their futures.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.080" end="00:00:31.520" style="s2">Upon reflection</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.520" end="00:00:35.110" style="s2">This lack of opportunity struck me as strange to say the least</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.720" end="00:00:40.029" style="s2">Since there&#39;s nothing more important to get straight than your own personal experience.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.690" end="00:00:46.749" style="s2">At the same time I was speaking with managers at various companies about how to hire more effective workers</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.690" end="00:00:53.260" style="s2">They were much more interested in how to improve the performance of poorly performing people they had already hired.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.560" end="00:01:02.439" style="s2">I didn&#39;t have much to tell them at the time because improving people is very difficult. Nonetheless the two problems stuck in my mind.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.369" end="00:01:11.919" style="s2">So I started to search for psychological interventions that could be used widely and practically to clarify and improve people&#39;s lives.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.250" end="00:01:20.349" style="s2">I already knew that people lived inside the stories they told about themselves and that they used those stories to interpret everything around them.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.860" end="00:01:25.599" style="s2">While considering this I came upon, Dr. James Pennebaker&#39;s research</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.540" end="00:01:28.599" style="s2">conducted at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.750" end="00:01:36.909" style="s2">Dr. Pennebaker tested Sigmund Freud&#39;s theory that the release of emotions related to traumatic events could be curative.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.310" end="00:01:43.750" style="s2">He had his students write for three days for 15 minutes a day about the most upsetting experiences of their lives</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.360" end="00:01:47.799" style="s2">while a control group wrote about ordinary daily activities.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.070" end="00:01:56.589" style="s2">Those in the former group experienced long-term improvements in their psychological and physical health after a brief dip in mood</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.560" end="00:02:00.760" style="s2">Not so much because of the expression of pent-up feelings however</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.490" end="00:02:04.119" style="s2">But because they drew more specific causal conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.909" end="00:02:06.909" style="s2">About what had happened to them in the past.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.700" end="00:02:14.560" style="s2">Dr. Laura King had her subjects write about their ideals and future goals instead, but they experienced the same benefits.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.270" end="00:02:22.219" style="s2">Our research team specifically tested the effects of the future authoring program part of the self authoring suite related to goal setting</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.620" end="00:02:28.490" style="s2">at McGill University in Montreal Canada and Erasmus University in Rotterdam, Holland.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:33.320" style="s2">Academically struggling McGill students increased their grades by</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.870" end="00:02:39.050" style="s2">25% in one year and decreased their dropout rates from 30% to zero</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.020" end="00:02:42.020" style="s2">the same thing happened at Erasmus University</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.660" end="00:02:44.839" style="s2">with more than 1,200 business students.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.080" end="00:02:48.499" style="s2">These effects do not just apply to students either</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.680" end="00:02:57.230" style="s2">Dr. Frank Schmidt, one of the world&#39;s outstanding industrial psychologists, has demonstrated that participating in such programs</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.900" end="00:03:02.060" style="s2">Makes all kinds of people substantially more effective or whatever they are doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.900" end="00:03:11.630" style="s2">People who complete such programs appear to benefit because the careful articulation of their experiences, past, present and future</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.780" end="00:03:15.649" style="s2">decreases misery related to threat and uncertainty and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.170" end="00:03:22.070" style="s2">Increases happiness and hope which people experience when they progress towards somewhere they truly want to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.370" end="00:03:29.840" style="s2">When complicated experiences are carefully put into words the manner in which they are represented in the brain changes</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.540" end="00:03:36.139" style="s2">They move from the areas associated with stressful emotion demanding constant physical readiness</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.570" end="00:03:39.769" style="s2">To the areas associated with detailed comprehension and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.220" end="00:03:43.880" style="s2">This makes articulate people less stressed and more</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.610" end="00:03:48.169" style="s2">informed about how to be successful now and in the future</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.200" end="00:03:53.600" style="s2">It is for these reasons that we developed the Self Authoring Suite a set of four</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.880" end="00:04:01.130" style="s2">interactive online writing programs and are offering them to anyone who wants to concentrate on improving his or her life.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.799" end="00:04:03.799" style="s2">If you want to understand yourself better</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.410" end="00:04:11.509" style="s2">Become less anxious and happier and commit yourself more firmly to your education career or your relationships</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.090" end="00:04:14.090" style="s2">these programs will help</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.340" end="00:04:15.959" style="s2">a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.959" end="00:04:22.159" style="s2">Each of the programs is composed of a series of interactive web pages that present you with specific personal questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.740" end="00:04:26.330" style="s2">This simplifies and guides the difficult process of personal writing</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.300" end="00:04:31.370" style="s2">Each program requires careful thought and takes several hours to complete</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.400" end="00:04:39.080" style="s2">It is better to write over a number of days so that you have time to think and because sleep aids the process</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.110" end="00:04:45.559" style="s2">The writing is challenging, but the experimentally documented benefits are worth it</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.550" end="00:04:54.950" style="s2">The past authoring program helps you write an autobiography. It will present you with pages like this introducing you to the program</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.700" end="00:05:00.210" style="s2">And providing psychologically sound advice and information</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:11.210" style="s2">It will then ask you to start writing dividing your life into seven epochs or sections and describing the important experiences of each</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.510" end="00:05:18.200" style="s2">The two present are three programs help you address your personality faults and capitalize on your virtues</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.050" end="00:05:23.690" style="s2">When you start either of these programs you will also be presented with instruction pages</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.330" end="00:05:31.580" style="s2">Then you&#39;ll be provided with a list of adjectives some of which will accurately define you and be asked to select six to nine</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.160" end="00:05:35.089" style="s2">Describing your faults if you&#39;re feeling up to a challenge</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.730" end="00:05:38.509" style="s2">Or your virtues if you could use a boost</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.900" end="00:05:43.609" style="s2">You will then be asked to rank order these adjectives and to write a paragraph</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.770" end="00:05:49.220" style="s2">describing a time when each had a specific effect on your life the future authoring program</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.770" end="00:05:52.609" style="s2">Helps you define the future that would work best for you</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.890" end="00:05:59.239" style="s2">Three to five Years down the road and just as importantly to describe the future you want to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.120" end="00:06:04.549" style="s2">It starts with some questions like these which will start you thinking in the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.050" end="00:06:20.430" style="s2">then it will ask you to write freely about what you want and don&#39;t want and about how to justify your decisions</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.800" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">and stay on the right track</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.500" end="00:06:27.119" style="s2">The programs contain much more detail than this brief summary presents</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.060" end="00:06:31.530" style="s2">Here are the sorts of additional questions you will be asked to consider</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.830" end="00:06:35.099" style="s2">What were your 10 most important experiences?</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.620" end="00:06:37.620" style="s2">Where they positive or negative?</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.720" end="00:06:41.699" style="s2">How did each experience change you or your view of other people?</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.760" end="00:06:45.660" style="s2">Were there things that you should have done differently?</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.600" end="00:06:49.919" style="s2">Are you the life of the party do you feel comfortable around people?</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.740" end="00:06:52.740" style="s2">Do you think before you act?</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.320" end="00:06:57.030" style="s2">Are you full of ideas? Are you a sensible person?</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.910" end="00:06:59.939" style="s2">Do you do things according to a plan?</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.850" end="00:07:02.850" style="s2">Are you too quiet around strangers?</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.000" end="00:07:06.000" style="s2">Do daydream too much?</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.330" end="00:07:09.330" style="s2">What is one thing that you could do better?</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.270" end="00:07:12.270" style="s2">What do you want to learn about?</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.210" end="00:07:15.689" style="s2">How should you handle your drinking or drug use?</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:19.440" style="s2">Describe your ideal social life</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.130" end="00:07:27.329" style="s2">You may choose to complete any or all of the four programs</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.510" end="00:07:33.779" style="s2">You will be given a confidential username and account password and your writing will be securely stored</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.110" end="00:07:41.669" style="s2">Once you have completed each program you&#39;ll receive an organized comprehensive email laying out the work that you have done</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.820" end="00:07:47.099" style="s2">You can return to the programs in the future to edit and update your work</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.180" end="00:07:54.090" style="s2">Many people do not understand who they are where they are or where they are going</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.760" end="00:08:00.059" style="s2">In consequence instead of attempting those actions that would make their lives as valuable as possible</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.940" end="00:08:02.940" style="s2">things just happen to them</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.190" end="00:08:05.190" style="s2">and they&#39;re often not good</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.190" end="00:08:11.820" style="s2">Carefully answering all the questions in the Self Authoring Suite in your own words will clear the fog from your vision</p>

<p begin="00:08:14.950" end="00:08:21.059" style="s2">and increase the chances that you will exist in a manner that justifies all the trouble that life inevitably presents</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.910" end="00:08:26.459" style="s2">This will help you be a good person for yourself and for other people</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.850" end="00:08:30.479" style="s2">Carve yourself a new and better you</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.570" end="00:08:37.320" style="s2">There&#39;s no sense slouching around miserably when you can aim for what you should have and get it</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.770" end="00:08:40.770" style="s2">Good luck with the programs</p>
