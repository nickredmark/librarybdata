<p begin="00:00:44.540" end="00:00:49.060" style="s2">The, sort of, finite boundedness of individual consciousness, and the...</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.400" end="00:00:56.620" style="s2">... incredible excess of the unbounded everywhere else.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.620" end="00:00:58.760" style="s2">Even including underneath that consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.760" end="00:01:03.240" style="s2">Because, of course, your individual consciousness depends on the function...</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.240" end="00:01:07.460" style="s2">... or is related to the function of things that are so complex you can&#39;t even understand it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.900" end="00:01:09.260" style="s2">So, there you are...</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.820" end="00:01:12.440" style="s2">Surrounded by some things that you understand...</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.440" end="00:01:15.720" style="s2">... in an ocean of things that you don&#39;t understand at all.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.960" end="00:01:18.040" style="s2">And, including things about yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.760" end="00:01:22.580" style="s2">And it&#39;s not obvious at all how people solve that problem because...</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.560" end="00:01:28.480" style="s2">In some sense it&#39;s not solvable: the fact that you don&#39;t have the cognitive resources...</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:34.820" style="s2">... or the conceptual resources to understand everything that you need to understand, in order to properly orient yourself in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.200" end="00:01:39.380" style="s2">Now, obviously, partly the way we deal with that, is that we cooperate with other people...</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.380" end="00:01:42.260" style="s2">... and, so, that radically multiplies our resources</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.260" end="00:01:44.440" style="s2">... incredibly multiplies our resources.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.900" end="00:01:45.640" style="s2">So...</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.340" end="00:01:49.300" style="s2">It&#39;s something to consider, always when...</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.740" end="00:01:53.520" style="s2">...you know, so much of the political dialogue that surrounds us now...</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.040" end="00:01:58.240" style="s2">... consists of a critique of cooperative societies</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.900" end="00:02:02.100" style="s2">... and an analysis of their oppressive nature.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.100" end="00:02:05.420" style="s2">And, of course that&#39;s true, because any cooperative system...</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.420" end="00:02:09.060" style="s2">... that specifies a certain end point.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.060" end="00:02:11.640" style="s2">... and produces a value hierarchy of some sort...</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.960" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">... also simoultaneously...</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.560" end="00:02:17.480" style="s2">... forces things into that value system, and then rank orders...</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.120" end="00:02:20.440" style="s2">... people, according to the value structure</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.440" end="00:02:22.640" style="s2">...and so, there is an oppressive element to it, but...</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.160" end="00:02:24.440" style="s2">... compared to...</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.300" end="00:02:27.140" style="s2">... being naked in chaos...</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.580" end="00:02:30.040" style="s2">... generally, it&#39;s better.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.060" end="00:02:33.600" style="s2">Now, it doesn&#39;t always have to be, because it can get murderous...</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.600" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">...but generally speaking, well look, we&#39;re social animals, it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.000" end="00:02:39.880" style="s2">Our evolutionary pathway has already taken us here.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.880" end="00:02:43.400" style="s2">So, we&#39;re individuals, but we are unbelievably social.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.560" end="00:02:45.460" style="s2">And so, that&#39;s that.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.700" end="00:02:49.260" style="s2">As far as I can tell, we&#39;d have to be completely different creatures not to...</p>

<p begin="00:02:50.900" end="00:02:55.500" style="s2">... not to take advantage of and fall prey to the problems with social being.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.120" end="00:02:57.160" style="s2">Alright, so...</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.580" end="00:03:02.740" style="s2">I think the way that...</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.780" end="00:03:08.040" style="s2">... the problem of complexity has been solved -- and this is the best argument I know of for...</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.520" end="00:03:11.640" style="s2">The truth of the Darwinian notion of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.640" end="00:03:17.040" style="s2">Now, I don&#39;t think that our models of evolution are complete by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.660" end="00:03:18.160" style="s2">I...</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.360" end="00:03:24.160" style="s2">I know they&#39;re not, partly because of recent work done in epigenetics, which suggest that you can...</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.740" end="00:03:27.220" style="s2">...you can inherit acquired traits.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.880" end="00:03:31.720" style="s2">And when I went to university -<br />When I started going to university in the 1980&#39;s...</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.180" end="00:03:34.700" style="s2">...that was heresy, really, like...</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.780" end="00:03:38.140" style="s2">&quot;No, you cannot inherit acquired traits&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.140" end="00:03:42.900" style="s2">But actually, you can inherit acquired traits; that&#39;s the field of epigenetics that studies that, and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.380" end="00:03:43.880" style="s2">that...</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.580" end="00:03:46.880" style="s2">That&#39;s a radical shift in perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.880" end="00:03:50.380" style="s2">Because we also don&#39;t know exactly what that means across any length of time.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.780" end="00:03:54.700" style="s2">When you&#39;re thinking about evolutionary lengths of time, you&#39;re thinking about three and a half billion years...</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.700" end="00:03:57.280" style="s2">... because that&#39;s the span of time over which life evolved.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.540" end="00:03:59.360" style="s2">So, even things that don&#39;t have a...</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.900" end="00:04:01.040" style="s2">... overwhelmingly ...</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:04.380" style="s2">... marked potency...</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.380" end="00:04:07.960" style="s2">... for one generation, can be unbelievably powerful across time.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.340" end="00:04:11.800" style="s2">And then there&#39;s also the issue of sexual selection, because...</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.180" end="00:04:18.920" style="s2">You know, you&#39;ll hear Darwinists continually describe the world, and the evolutionary world, as a place of randomness.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.920" end="00:04:22.420" style="s2">... and that&#39;s not true! And I don&#39;t know why they make that statement.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.420" end="00:04:27.140" style="s2">The mutations are random, or quasi random.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.140" end="00:04:29.460" style="s2">... because we don&#39;t understand mutations that well yet either,</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.460" end="00:04:31.200" style="s2">and most mutations are deadly, right...</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.200" end="00:04:34.840" style="s2">Most mutations are deadly, <br />there&#39;s a set of them that are harmful but not deadly,</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.840" end="00:04:37.940" style="s2">... and then there&#39;s a tiny, tiny proportion...</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.940" end="00:04:40.780" style="s2">...that could, in principle, produce some benefit.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.260" end="00:04:43.320" style="s2">.. to the next generation, assuming...</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.320" end="00:04:47.300" style="s2">...environmental shifts, say, in the direction of the mutation.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.780" end="00:04:48.280" style="s2">So..</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.880" end="00:04:51.420" style="s2">There&#39;s a randomness element to that, we know that...</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.420" end="00:04:52.780" style="s2">I mean, part of the reason that...</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.180" end="00:04:54.100" style="s2">... you mutate...</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.460" end="00:04:57.200" style="s2">... or your cells mutate, your DNA mutates, is because...</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.880" end="00:04:59.900" style="s2">... of background levels of radioactivity.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.960" end="00:05:02.720" style="s2">And a lot of that is a consequence of solar activity.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.720" end="00:05:05.200" style="s2">So, cosmic rays come zipping through the atmosphere...</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.240" end="00:05:06.940" style="s2">... and they nail your DNA, and...</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.940" end="00:05:10.100" style="s2">... produce minor alterations, and that&#39;s a mutation, and...</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.100" end="00:05:15.540" style="s2">... if you crank up the background radiation rate, like say around Chernobyl, then the mutation rate rises and...</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.720" end="00:05:18.060" style="s2">There&#39;s definitely a random element to that!</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.500" end="00:05:21.460" style="s2">It&#39;s necessary for there to be a random element because...</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.940" end="00:05:24.820" style="s2">As far as I can tell, the only way you can beat...</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.820" end="00:05:27.840" style="s2">... a random environment, is by producing random changes.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.040" end="00:05:28.920" style="s2">...right, so..</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.200" end="00:05:31.120" style="s2">You know the idea, basically, the...</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.420" end="00:05:37.040" style="s2">The environment isn&#39;t some static place that&#39;s selecting for higher and higher levels of fitness</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.340" end="00:05:38.960" style="s2">Or not in any-...</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.320" end="00:05:41.480" style="s2">It&#39;s certainly not doing that in any static way.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.620" end="00:05:43.940" style="s2">So, it&#39;s shifting around randomly</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.480" end="00:05:45.280" style="s2">And then...</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.740" end="00:05:47.520" style="s2">You know, you have a structure that&#39;s been-...</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.520" end="00:05:51.720" style="s2">Your species has a structure that&#39;s a consequence of this immense evolutionary journey.</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.720" end="00:05:55.520" style="s2">... and it&#39;s moderating itself randomly within certain parameters.</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.520" end="00:05:58.320" style="s2">The parameters being that most mutations will kill you.</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.320" end="00:06:02.120" style="s2">Alterations in your fundamental form generally tend to kill you, so they&#39;re incremental.</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.600" end="00:06:05.920" style="s2">So the mutations are random, and they match <br />-- hopefully --</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.920" end="00:06:10.560" style="s2">...they match the randomness in the environmental shift, so you can more or less keep up that way.</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.860" end="00:06:14.260" style="s2">But then there&#39;s additional complicating factors, and they&#39;re not trivial.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.260" end="00:06:16.360" style="s2">... and one of them is what ever epigenetics does.</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.380" end="00:06:17.940" style="s2">We don&#39;t know anything about that yet.</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.940" end="00:06:19.920" style="s2">But the second one is sexual selection.</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.160" end="00:06:22.540" style="s2">And sexual selection is no joke!</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.760" end="00:06:24.089" style="s2">It could be the primary thing-</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.089" end="00:06:27.100" style="s2">Certainly one of the primary things that has driven human evolution.</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.360" end="00:06:28.680" style="s2">And I think you can say that...</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.700" end="00:06:36.340" style="s2">You think about the environment...<br />Again, let&#39;s think about the environment.</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.520" end="00:06:37.020" style="s2">So...</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.680" end="00:06:40.500" style="s2">You have a dominance hierarchy.<br />And that&#39;s really an old structure,</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.500" end="00:06:41.280" style="s2">... the dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.280" end="00:06:42.940" style="s2">...it&#39;s three hundred million years old.</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:45.960" style="s2">Because it emerged, pretty much, whenever there was...</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.960" end="00:06:48.580" style="s2">Whenever there was an emergent nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.820" end="00:06:51.300" style="s2">... and whenever animals had occupied the same territory...</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.300" end="00:06:54.760" style="s2">...they automatically organized themselves into something approximating a dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.800" end="00:06:55.300" style="s2">So...</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.520" end="00:06:58.340" style="s2">It&#39;s a very, very, very, very old structure.</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.340" end="00:06:59.580" style="s2">It&#39;s older than trees!</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.720" end="00:07:01.400" style="s2">It&#39;s older than flowers!</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.620" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">It&#39;s OLD!</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.140" end="00:07:06.960" style="s2">And, as far as &quot;real&quot; goes, from a Darwinian sense:</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.360" end="00:07:09.340" style="s2">Permanent is real!</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.660" end="00:07:15.080" style="s2">You can say, you know, our arboreal ancestors adapted themselves to trees...</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.180" end="00:07:19.820" style="s2">So, the tree was around long enough to be a feature of the environment.</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.980" end="00:07:23.220" style="s2">But the dominance hierarchy has been around a lot longer than trees.</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.660" end="00:07:27.440" style="s2">And you can think of the dominance hierarchy both as an adaptation to the environment...</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.440" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">- because you&#39;d kinda of think about the dominance hierarchy as a cultural construct...</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.960" end="00:07:35.700" style="s2">... but if a cultural construct lasts long enough, then it becomes part of the environment.</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.820" end="00:07:36.420" style="s2">And, so...</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.420" end="00:07:38.360" style="s2">The dominance hierarchy is part of the environment.</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.360" end="00:07:39.480" style="s2">And what seems to happen...</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.560" end="00:07:41.000" style="s2">... roughly speaking...</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.000" end="00:07:43.540" style="s2">... and this is an over simplification, but we&#39;ll go with it...</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.840" end="00:07:46.840" style="s2">Males have a dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.420" end="00:07:52.240" style="s2">And there&#39;s a relatively small number of males that are relatively successful</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.240" end="00:07:55.600" style="s2">And those successful males have preferential access...</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.600" end="00:07:57.880" style="s2">... to female reproductive capacity.</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.880" end="00:08:00.920" style="s2">Either because the females actively choose the...</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.920" end="00:08:03.620" style="s2">... the more dominant males, which is very, very common...</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.620" end="00:08:08.840" style="s2">... or because the more dominant males chase all the less dominant males away, so that...</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.520" end="00:08:14.080" style="s2">... even if the females don&#39;t exercise choice, which they often do, then the only...</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.220" end="00:08:20.700" style="s2">... males left around, that can serve as reasonable mating partners, are the more powerful ones.</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.120" end="00:08:23.820" style="s2">And so, you think, you&#39;ve got two really radical...</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:26.820" style="s2">... determiners of evolution as a consequence of that;</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.820" end="00:08:27.760" style="s2">One is that...</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.920" end="00:08:29.720" style="s2">... each...</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.540" end="00:08:33.100" style="s2">I&#39;m not talking about female dominance hierarchies at the moment.</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.380" end="00:08:34.700" style="s2">I can talk about them, but...</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.940" end="00:08:36.940" style="s2">That&#39;s why this is an oversimplification, but...</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.340" end="00:08:38.600" style="s2">What happens is that...</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.860" end="00:08:42.480" style="s2">The males obviously are selected for their ability to move up dominance hierarchies.</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.880" end="00:08:43.680" style="s2">Obviously!</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.680" end="00:08:47.700" style="s2">Because the ones that are at the top of the dominance hierarchy reproduce preferentially...</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.860" end="00:08:52.820" style="s2">So that means the male dominance hierarchy becomes a method of selection.</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.820" end="00:08:53.520" style="s2">But then...</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.700" end="00:08:59.220" style="s2">Allied with that is the female proclivity for choice on whatever dimension...</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.220" end="00:09:01.460" style="s2">...the dominance hierarchy happens to be arranged.</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.460" end="00:09:05.340" style="s2">So then female sexual selection also becomes a radical...</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.560" end="00:09:06.200" style="s2">[ehm...]</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.600" end="00:09:08.760" style="s2">Non-random selector.</p>

<p begin="00:09:14.480" end="00:09:18.920" style="s2">So, I fail to see how any of that can be separated from the emergence ...</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.100" end="00:09:22.800" style="s2">... of complex nervous systems and mind, over the course of evolution.</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.800" end="00:09:26.200" style="s2">Because people aren&#39;t-...<br />Creatures aren&#39;t making random choices.</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.580" end="00:09:27.760" style="s2">They&#39;re not random at all!</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.540" end="00:09:29.040" style="s2">So...</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.900" end="00:09:31.680" style="s2">We even know such things like-...</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.120" end="00:09:33.800" style="s2">Imagine a peacocks tail.</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.980" end="00:09:34.560" style="s2">... you know...</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.560" end="00:09:36.920" style="s2">It&#39;s covered with eyes, which is quite interesting...</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.920" end="00:09:41.180" style="s2">... because eyes, of course, attract attention.<br />And lot&#39;s of animals have evolved eye-like markings.</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.180" end="00:09:45.560" style="s2">Like moths: There are moth&#39;s that, when they unfold their wings, they have two big eyes on the back of them...</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.560" end="00:09:49.060" style="s2">... and that&#39;s to keep birds from eating them, right. Because the birds don&#39;t like being stared at.</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.060" end="00:09:50.600" style="s2">... so they stay away from the moths.</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.980" end="00:09:53.380" style="s2">A peacocks tail is nothing but eyes!</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.380" end="00:09:55.560" style="s2">So it&#39;s very attractive, and it shimmers, and...</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.560" end="00:09:58.600" style="s2">... there&#39;s something about it that&#39;s beautiful, which is quite interesting too...</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.600" end="00:10:02.820" style="s2">The females have obviously been selecting the male peacocks for beauty;</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.840" end="00:10:04.680" style="s2">They have this insane tail!</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.820" end="00:10:05.620" style="s2">Well, so...</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.620" end="00:10:07.820" style="s2">The evolutionary biologists have thought:</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.900" end="00:10:10.740" style="s2">&quot;Well, what possible utility could that tail be?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.880" end="00:10:14.980" style="s2">Is it just: maybe the females got fixated on tail, <br />so to speak, and..</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:18.560" style="s2">You know, you&#39;ve got a Baldwin effect loop going there...</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.560" end="00:10:20.720" style="s2">... and the male peacocks just got bigger and bigger tails</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.720" end="00:10:22.520" style="s2">... and it&#39;s just like an evolutionary dead end.</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.520" end="00:10:26.180" style="s2">You know, it&#39;s a positive feedback system that&#39;s gone out of control</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.180" end="00:10:28.500" style="s2">But they have done things that look at...</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.840" end="00:10:31.720" style="s2">The symmetry and breadth, say, ...</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.880" end="00:10:34.300" style="s2">Or the symmetry and size...</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.300" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">... and the overall quality of the male peacocks tail...</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:38.940" style="s2">... as a marker for physical health.</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.940" end="00:10:41.160" style="s2">Reduce parasite load, for example</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.160" end="00:10:44.800" style="s2">And it does turn out that the healthier male peacocks have better tail display.</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.360" end="00:10:47.640" style="s2">and so what female seems to be doing is</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.640" end="00:10:50.220" style="s2">using some marker or some set of markers</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.440" end="00:10:53.220" style="s2">as a proxy indicator for</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.620" end="00:10:54.280" style="s2">for health.</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.640" end="00:10:57.120" style="s2">And I think, I think you could say</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.480" end="00:10:59.020" style="s2">with reasonable ...</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.020" end="00:11:00.320" style="s2">You could say reasonable...</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.340" end="00:11:02.120" style="s2">... reasonably that female</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.120" end="00:11:04.680" style="s2">...human beings do the same to the male human beings.</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.680" end="00:11:06.680" style="s2">And there&#39;s some of that vise versa, too.</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.680" end="00:11:08.980" style="s2">Like we evaluate each other for example, for symmetry,</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.020" end="00:11:10.680" style="s2">which is one of the element of beauty,</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.680" end="00:11:13.700" style="s2">because healthier people tend to be more symmetrical and</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.740" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">lots of animals use symmetry:</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:16.160" style="s2">Butterflies.</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.380" end="00:11:16.880" style="s2">If-</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.880" end="00:11:18.680" style="s2">Butterflies won&#39;t mate with another butterfly</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.680" end="00:11:21.040" style="s2">if it deviates from symmetry by the tiniest amounts.</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.040" end="00:11:22.120" style="s2">You can imagine.</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.120" end="00:11:24.120" style="s2">So symmetry is a marker. And ...</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.120" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">There&#39;s other markers, like...</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:28.140" style="s2">...shoulder width to waist width is one, and...</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.140" end="00:11:30.940" style="s2">waist width to hip width is another. That&#39;s usually what -</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.940" end="00:11:33.340" style="s2">Males use that to evaluate another females in part.</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.600" end="00:11:35.600" style="s2">So there&#39;s a lot of markers of health.</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.600" end="00:11:36.860" style="s2">Um, but...</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.860" end="00:11:38.860" style="s2">It also looks to me that the...</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.860" end="00:11:41.440" style="s2">the data world wide seems to indicate that women -</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.200" end="00:11:43.300" style="s2">So imagine that-</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.800" end="00:11:46.240" style="s2">Women made across dominant hierarchy and up</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.240" end="00:11:48.060" style="s2">,socioeconomically speaking, and</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.140" end="00:11:51.840" style="s2">on average across cultures women go for men who are four to five years older.</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.840" end="00:11:52.840" style="s2">You know, it varies.</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.840" end="00:11:55.320" style="s2">In the Scandinavian countries that shrunk a little bit...</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.320" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">but not that much.</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.600" end="00:11:58.180" style="s2">And in other countries it&#39;s bigger</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.180" end="00:12:00.120" style="s2">I would say that depends on some degree on...</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.120" end="00:12:02.780" style="s2">difficulty of establishing economic independence.</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.200" end="00:12:04.780" style="s2">Right, because in richer countries it&#39;s easier to...</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.780" end="00:12:07.160" style="s2">have enough economic independence if you are a male,</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.380" end="00:12:08.000" style="s2">to be...</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.240" end="00:12:09.300" style="s2">to be a useful...</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.620" end="00:12:11.980" style="s2">... participant in the process of having children.</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.260" end="00:12:12.900" style="s2">Um</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.300" end="00:12:15.080" style="s2">But, it doesn&#39;t matter cross culturally.</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.080" end="00:12:18.060" style="s2">It&#39;s still across and up where men made it across and down</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.060" end="00:12:20.240" style="s2">They don&#39;t care about socioeconomic status-</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.240" end="00:12:22.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be part of their...</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.240" end="00:12:23.280" style="s2">selection method...</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.280" end="00:12:25.280" style="s2">...generally speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.040" end="00:12:26.820" style="s2">So,</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.820" end="00:12:28.500" style="s2">So,</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.460" end="00:12:31.640" style="s2">I think that part of that is also that the ability of...</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.640" end="00:12:34.000" style="s2">...women to select for male health.</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.000" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">It&#39;s something like that, because-</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.700" end="00:12:36.540" style="s2">It is not only that...</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.540" end="00:12:38.600" style="s2">because if you are healthy and energetic</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.600" end="00:12:40.320" style="s2">you are more like to be successful.</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.320" end="00:12:42.980" style="s2">Because it&#39;s hard to be successful if you are ill, obviously.</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.980" end="00:12:44.540" style="s2">I mean, so...</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.540" end="00:12:46.700" style="s2">Because the competition&#39;s just too high.</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.700" end="00:12:48.500" style="s2">And both- both genders, both sexes...</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.500" end="00:12:50.180" style="s2">...select each other for attractiveness,</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.180" end="00:12:51.540" style="s2">...both selects for intelligence,</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.540" end="00:12:53.440" style="s2">...both selects for personality.</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.440" end="00:12:56.200" style="s2">Although there are differences there,</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.200" end="00:12:58.060" style="s2">... in terms of what&#39;s stressed.</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.560" end="00:12:59.060" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.760" end="00:13:00.720" style="s2">So,</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.720" end="00:13:03.680" style="s2">So, I think you can derive a couple of things out of this.</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.680" end="00:13:05.840" style="s2">And this is where I think people are different than...</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.180" end="00:13:06.960" style="s2">...than other animals.</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.960" end="00:13:08.320" style="s2">Importantly different, is that-</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.780" end="00:13:11.280" style="s2">So imagine that there&#39;s tremendous selection pressure...</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.300" end="00:13:13.180" style="s2">...to...</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.980" end="00:13:16.140" style="s2">... towards the production, let&#39;s say :</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.140" end="00:13:18.660" style="s2">of men who are good at climbing male dominance hierarchies,</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.040" end="00:13:21.600" style="s2">... or climbing the male dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.600" end="00:13:23.920" style="s2">But the thing that so interesting about the people is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.400" end="00:13:26.660" style="s2">We&#39;ve multiplied our dominace hierarchies.</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.020" end="00:13:28.460" style="s2">You know, if you take an animal that&#39;s...</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.460" end="00:13:30.740" style="s2">...got a rather static behavioral pattern</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.200" end="00:13:31.720" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.020" end="00:13:32.520" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.520" end="00:13:33.780" style="s2">there is single hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.780" end="00:13:35.720" style="s2">Elephant seals are good example of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.720" end="00:13:38.200" style="s2">So, elephant seals, the males are absolutely massive.</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.200" end="00:13:40.080" style="s2">They are way, way bigger than females.</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.080" end="00:13:42.520" style="s2">And they basically have harems, roughly speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.820" end="00:13:47.040" style="s2">And they use physical prowess as their marker of...</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.060" end="00:13:48.080" style="s2">status, essentially.</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.080" end="00:13:50.080" style="s2">And obviously size, is a huge part of that...</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.080" end="00:13:52.820" style="s2">because otherwise male elephant seals wouldn&#39;t be as-</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.820" end="00:13:54.220" style="s2">They&#39;re massive these things.</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.220" end="00:13:55.960" style="s2">They&#39;re absolutely enormous.</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.960" end="00:13:57.360" style="s2">And so, it&#39;s just power.</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.480" end="00:13:59.960" style="s2">.../health, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.960" end="00:14:01.720" style="s2">maybe aggression, something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.720" end="00:14:04.600" style="s2">It&#39;s whatever makes them more, um...</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.340" end="00:14:06.300" style="s2">... suitable,</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.300" end="00:14:08.109" style="s2">... for the kind of physical combat...</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.109" end="00:14:09.660" style="s2">...that elephant seals engage in.</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:10.820" style="s2">So,</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.060" end="00:14:11.940" style="s2">And,</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.940" end="00:14:14.160" style="s2">the degree to its power is associated with</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.160" end="00:14:15.000" style="s2">dominance</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.000" end="00:14:16.000" style="s2">status</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.000" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">in those sorts of situations seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:20.980" style="s2">associated with the size differential between</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.980" end="00:14:22.140" style="s2">males and females.</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.480" end="00:14:23.420" style="s2">So, the more</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.660" end="00:14:26.600" style="s2">power is an issue with regards to male competence,</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.600" end="00:14:28.620" style="s2">the larger the males are compared to the females,</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.620" end="00:14:29.660" style="s2">and the more likely,</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.660" end="00:14:32.620" style="s2">the males are gonna have harem relationships with the females.</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.620" end="00:14:34.400" style="s2">And you see that a little bit in the human beings,</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.400" end="00:14:35.680" style="s2">because men are bigger than women.</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.960" end="00:14:36.460" style="s2">They&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.780" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">overwhelmingly bigger, that&#39;s sexual dimorphism.</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.360" end="00:14:41.800" style="s2">And you know, there&#39;s some men that are smaller than some women.</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.800" end="00:14:43.400" style="s2">But on average men are taller and...</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.400" end="00:14:45.700" style="s2">...they have more upper body strength, and so forth.</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.740" end="00:14:48.280" style="s2">So there is a power element to male competition.</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.520" end="00:14:52.100" style="s2">But it&#39;s not as extended as it would be among animals...</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.100" end="00:14:53.720" style="s2">say, like elephant seals.</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.860" end="00:14:56.940" style="s2">So in the elephant seal, you see, maybe there is one...</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.380" end="00:14:59.380" style="s2">stable set of traits,</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.380" end="00:15:01.040" style="s2">that&#39;s been selected for</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.040" end="00:15:03.180" style="s2">that makes the male more likely to reproduce.</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.180" end="00:15:05.120" style="s2">But human beings, we are very weird creatures,</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.120" end="00:15:06.200" style="s2">because we are so...</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.400" end="00:15:07.960" style="s2">conceptually flexible.</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.960" end="00:15:09.620" style="s2">And so what seem to have happened,</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.620" end="00:15:10.320" style="s2">Maybe-</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.640" end="00:15:11.520" style="s2">We started...</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.500" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">Male started selecting each other</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.500" end="00:15:16.100" style="s2">for d... , in dominance competition</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.100" end="00:15:18.240" style="s2">for something like cognitive flexibility and</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.240" end="00:15:20.420" style="s2">and conscientiousness, something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.900" end="00:15:22.720" style="s2">So that would be...</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.720" end="00:15:24.780" style="s2">the ability to abstractly represent the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.780" end="00:15:27.680" style="s2">and then the ability to operate effectively within it,</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.680" end="00:15:29.760" style="s2">to represent yourself socially in a way</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.760" end="00:15:31.440" style="s2">and then to carry through with that,</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.440" end="00:15:33.160" style="s2">because that enables people to trust you.</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.440" end="00:15:35.440" style="s2">So it&#39;s something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.440" end="00:15:37.440" style="s2">And so, that produced ...</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.920" end="00:15:39.920" style="s2">cortical expansion and then women were</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.920" end="00:15:41.400" style="s2">selecting men who are good at that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.400" end="00:15:44.120" style="s2">and that produces cortical expansion and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.560" end="00:15:46.700" style="s2">there&#39;s arms race between women and men</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.700" end="00:15:49.180" style="s2">with regards to intelligence, so the women kept up</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.320" end="00:15:52.860" style="s2">or they certainly kept up with ... with intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.860" end="00:15:55.680" style="s2">as the evolutionary cycle continued.</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.280" end="00:15:57.040" style="s2">But</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.000" end="00:16:00.000" style="s2">one of the consequences of ...</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.000" end="00:16:02.000" style="s2">... selection for ...</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.000" end="00:16:05.380" style="s2">... cortical expansion and increased cognitive flexibility was that ...</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.620" end="00:16:07.620" style="s2">...the number of dominance hierarchies that...</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.620" end="00:16:09.920" style="s2">... human beings could produce started to multiply.</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.200" end="00:16:12.940" style="s2">Right? Because there&#39;s all sorts of way that you can be successful.</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.140" end="00:16:16.860" style="s2">There&#39;s- You think about how many ways you can be successful in modern culture.</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.860" end="00:16:21.120" style="s2">And you can be successful in dimensions that aren&#39;t really even associated with each other.</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.120" end="00:16:23.120" style="s2">So you can be successful socially,</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.120" end="00:16:25.120" style="s2">that&#39;s what an extrovert would do.</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.120" end="00:16:27.740" style="s2">You could be successful in terms of intimate relationships,</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.740" end="00:16:30.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what an agreeable person would do,</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.000" end="00:16:33.700" style="s2">a disagreeable person would more successful with regard to competition,</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.800" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">a person who&#39;s high in neuroticism would be...</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.340" end="00:16:39.600" style="s2">... would be try to protect themselves to establish some sort of security,</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.780" end="00:16:43.320" style="s2">an open person would be looking for a flexible creative environment.</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.320" end="00:16:45.320" style="s2">And so there&#39;s this multiplicity of ...</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.000" end="00:16:46.560" style="s2">... of ...</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.680" end="00:16:49.520" style="s2">... ways that you can establish a dominance hierarchy ...</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.520" end="00:16:50.960" style="s2">... and be successful in it.</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.960" end="00:16:53.780" style="s2">And if you are creative, you can come up with your own damn dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:16:56.780" style="s2">Which is exactly what you are doing if you are creative. Right?</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.780" end="00:16:58.820" style="s2">You spin up a game, that&#39;s your game.</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.320" end="00:17:01.100" style="s2">And then you make the rules.</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.100" end="00:17:03.900" style="s2">And that&#39;s hard, because if you make a new game with a new rules,</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.900" end="00:17:05.240" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to monetize it.</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.240" end="00:17:07.900" style="s2">But you could be the best playing that game.</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.900" end="00:17:11.260" style="s2">So that&#39;s huge advantage of being creative if you can pull it off.</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.860" end="00:17:12.460" style="s2">So then you think,</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.460" end="00:17:14.560" style="s2">well, what&#39;s happened among human beings is...</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.140" end="00:17:17.140" style="s2">... the multiplication of the set ...</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.480" end="00:17:20.840" style="s2">... of possible dominance hierarchies has become very broad,</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.840" end="00:17:23.880" style="s2">and then you can say, well what&#39;s driving selection now is</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.880" end="00:17:27.420" style="s2">the ability to be successful across multiple set of dominance hierarchies.</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.420" end="00:17:30.500" style="s2">And that accounts at least in part for our cognitive flexibility.</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.500" end="00:17:33.320" style="s2">So that&#39;s really what a human being is. A human being ...</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.560" end="00:17:36.460" style="s2">... is a creature that has high potential for succeeding ...</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.460" end="00:17:40.040" style="s2">... across a very wide range of potential human dominance hierarchies.</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.560" end="00:17:43.200" style="s2">And so that gives us our transformative phyche.</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.200" end="00:17:44.560" style="s2">That&#39;s the niche that,</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.560" end="00:17:48.240" style="s2">That&#39;s the niche that, we&#39;ve both produced and occupy.</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.240" end="00:17:52.200" style="s2">And I think it&#39;s out of that, that the hero mythology emerges, fundamentally.</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.200" end="00:17:53.786" style="s2">Because I think what the hero is,</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.786" end="00:17:54.940" style="s2">the mythological hero...</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.940" end="00:17:57.900" style="s2">...is a representation of that part of the phyche...</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.900" end="00:18:02.460" style="s2">...that&#39;s particularly good at being successful across sets of dominance hierarchies.</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.460" end="00:18:05.600" style="s2">That&#39;s very, very biological way of thinking about it.</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.600" end="00:18:08.520" style="s2">And I, I thought about this for a long time.</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.520" end="00:18:12.100" style="s2">I can&#39;t see anyway that that just can&#39;t be the case.</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.500" end="00:18:14.580" style="s2">And how else could it work?</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.760" end="00:18:17.740" style="s2">If we had a fixed behavioral pattern,</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.740" end="00:18:19.260" style="s2">like beavers, you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.260" end="00:18:21.800" style="s2">You are the most successful beaver if you build the best dam.</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.800" end="00:18:22.496" style="s2">It&#39;s like, fine.</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.496" end="00:18:24.540" style="s2">Then, you know what&#39;s going to be selected for.</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.540" end="00:18:25.900" style="s2">But, that isn&#39;t what people are like.</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.900" end="00:18:27.900" style="s2">And it&#39;s also why we&#39;re so multi-purposed.</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.900" end="00:18:28.500" style="s2">You know.</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.500" end="00:18:31.220" style="s2">We have hands. What&#39;s a hand for?</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.540" end="00:18:33.740" style="s2">What&#39;s the evolutionary function of a hand?</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.980" end="00:18:36.300" style="s2">Well, you can&#39;t specify that. You could say-</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.300" end="00:18:37.500" style="s2">It&#39;s something like-</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.500" end="00:18:40.520" style="s2">Well a hand is useful for doing a whole bunch of different things with.</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.120" end="00:18:41.620" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.800" end="00:18:44.080" style="s2">And mouth, tongue, same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.080" end="00:18:46.440" style="s2">What are words for? Well it&#39;s the same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.540" end="00:18:50.880" style="s2">They&#39;re for very, they&#39;re for communicating a very wide range of information.</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.200" end="00:18:51.900" style="s2">It&#39;s something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.920" end="00:18:54.840" style="s2">So we&#39;re, we&#39;re these weird general-purpose animals.</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.840" end="00:18:57.220" style="s2">You know, we&#39;re not great at any one thing.</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.640" end="00:19:01.680" style="s2">But, we can swim better than most terrestrial animals,</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.280" end="00:19:05.460" style="s2">you know, we can run faster than most animals,</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.460" end="00:19:07.060" style="s2">and we can certainly run longer.</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.060" end="00:19:10.160" style="s2">Like, a human being can run a horse to death over the course of a week.</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.160" end="00:19:11.700" style="s2">If they&#39;re in good shape.</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.080" end="00:19:14.080" style="s2">So, like we are really good at ...</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.420" end="00:19:17.560" style="s2">... being multi-purpose entity. Like a rat, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.800" end="00:19:20.760" style="s2">They call rats weedy species because they can be...</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.960" end="00:19:21.940" style="s2">anywhere.</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.280" end="00:19:23.900" style="s2">They don&#39;t have a specific niche like,</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.900" end="00:19:26.220" style="s2">you know, there&#39;s animals down in, in a...</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.220" end="00:19:29.360" style="s2">...the amazon, they&#39;re specialized for like, one tree.</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.360" end="00:19:29.920" style="s2">You know.</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.080" end="00:19:32.620" style="s2">Or one type of tree, in one tiny little area.</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.620" end="00:19:34.240" style="s2">That&#39;s not what human beings like.</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.240" end="00:19:36.320" style="s2">We&#39;re, We&#39;re like cockroaches or rats.</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.320" end="00:19:38.360" style="s2">Which is a nasty comparison, but...</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.360" end="00:19:39.920" style="s2">we can go anywhere and thrive.</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.380" end="00:19:41.160" style="s2">And so,</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.620" end="00:19:44.860" style="s2">And so being particularly good at that,</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.080" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">being particularly good at being able to go anywhere and thrive,</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.520" end="00:19:51.900" style="s2">also seems to me to be a canonical element of the hero mythology.</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.060" end="00:19:53.160" style="s2">So,</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.160" end="00:19:55.160" style="s2">So, okay, alright.</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.560" end="00:19:56.440" style="s2">Now,</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.680" end="00:20:02.580" style="s2">I started to introduce all those topics because I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.860" end="00:20:05.140" style="s2">trying to address the issue of how it is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.260" end="00:20:06.700" style="s2">we&#39;ve come to deal</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.700" end="00:20:10.120" style="s2">with the fact that the things are so complex that we can&#39;t deal with them.</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.640" end="00:20:14.280" style="s2">And so, a huge part of the answer to that is that Darwinian answer.</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.280" end="00:20:15.220" style="s2">So one is,</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.520" end="00:20:18.740" style="s2">well, you keep up with things you can&#39;t keep up with by changing unpredictably.</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.020" end="00:20:20.900" style="s2">So, here&#39;s an example.</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.600" end="00:20:22.180" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.580" end="00:20:24.220" style="s2">Sometimes if you are driving down the road</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.220" end="00:20:25.500" style="s2">and there&#39;s a dear on the road.</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.180" end="00:20:27.380" style="s2">Maybe you run into it and it&#39;ll,</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.380" end="00:20:29.980" style="s2">instead of jumping out of the way, it sort of jumps randomly.</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.980" end="00:20:31.220" style="s2">And then you run into it. You think:</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.220" end="00:20:33.320" style="s2">Well that&#39;s a pretty stupid strategy, it&#39;s like, ...</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.240" end="00:20:39.540" style="s2">Natural selection at work there, but it turns out that deer jump randomly when wolves are chasing them.</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.880" end="00:20:41.480" style="s2">Well, why would you do that?</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.680" end="00:20:43.400" style="s2">Well, because you can&#39;t predict it. Right?</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.720" end="00:20:45.660" style="s2">If, If something horrible is after you,</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.660" end="00:20:48.060" style="s2">acting unpredictably is actually pretty good strategy.</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.060" end="00:20:50.260" style="s2">And that&#39;s basically what mutation does.</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.420" end="00:20:50.980" style="s2">Means:</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.740" end="00:20:53.380" style="s2">The horrible thing that&#39;s after you,</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.380" end="00:20:56.260" style="s2">always is the rapid transformation of the environment.</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.460" end="00:21:00.720" style="s2">And the only thing you can possibly do in that case is capitalize on chance.</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.940" end="00:21:02.140" style="s2">Okay, so that&#39;s one thing.</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.480" end="00:21:06.040" style="s2">So that&#39;s probably why Darwinian story -I think- has to be right.</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.880" end="00:21:10.200" style="s2">Because the environment does move unpredictably.</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.800" end="00:21:14.960" style="s2">And the only way you can keep up with the unpredictable is to generate variance.</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.360" end="00:21:19.040" style="s2">And hope that one of them has drawn the lucky lottery card.</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.420" end="00:21:21.500" style="s2">But then there&#39;s these additional issues, which ...</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.580" end="00:21:24.900" style="s2">is that we also, we also seem to be tightly selected for...</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.660" end="00:21:27.420" style="s2">...the capacity to cooperate and compete,</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.420" end="00:21:29.560" style="s2">so that multiplies our cognitive ability,</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.560" end="00:21:30.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge part of it.</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.220" end="00:21:33.220" style="s2">And then, we are also,</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.220" end="00:21:36.340" style="s2">We also seem to have constructed ourselves, so to speak, ...</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.720" end="00:21:38.520" style="s2">... through sexual choice</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.520" end="00:21:40.720" style="s2">into this general problem-</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.720" end="00:21:42.720" style="s2">general purpose problem solving creatures.</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.160" end="00:21:46.140" style="s2">So we&#39;ve internalized some of the Darwinian process.</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.140" end="00:21:47.740" style="s2">So, you think, well</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.560" end="00:21:51.640" style="s2">Most animals will produce a variance of themselves physically.</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.920" end="00:21:53.920" style="s2">And then most of those variance die.</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.540" end="00:21:56.540" style="s2">But human beings have</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.540" end="00:21:59.720" style="s2">Built a lands... built a mechanism, let&#39;s say...</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.320" end="00:22:01.920" style="s2">that&#39;s like a game engine.</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.920" end="00:22:03.920" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a really good, you know how</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.920" end="00:22:06.800" style="s2">there are game engines now, that people have devised...</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.800" end="00:22:09.880" style="s2">their computational devises.</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.140" end="00:22:12.780" style="s2">And you can take a game engine and you can generate games with it.</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.780" end="00:22:14.780" style="s2">Like computer games. So...</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.580" end="00:22:17.840" style="s2">The game engine is a mechanism for producing games.</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.840" end="00:22:19.640" style="s2">That&#39;s what our brains are like.</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.640" end="00:22:22.080" style="s2">Our brains are game engines for producing games.</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.460" end="00:22:24.460" style="s2">So, what happens is that ...</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.660" end="00:22:26.940" style="s2">When you think, you produce an avatar of yourself, ...</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.660" end="00:22:30.700" style="s2">...you produce a fictional world in that avatar inhabits, ...</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.220" end="00:22:34.320" style="s2">and maybe you produce a multiple fictional worlds and multiple avatars,</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.320" end="00:22:38.260" style="s2">that&#39;s the you that could be tomorrow, which is what you are doing when you are planning,</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.400" end="00:22:41.920" style="s2">and you walk the avatar through its potential routes,</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.180" end="00:22:45.360" style="s2">and those who look good you keep, and those who look bad you kill.</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.920" end="00:22:47.920" style="s2">And so, you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.180" end="00:22:51.340" style="s2">Then you can embody the ideas that you keep and act those out,</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.340" end="00:22:54.100" style="s2">and hopefully the idea is, when you embody them,</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.100" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">you are successful and you don&#39;t get killed.</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.160" end="00:22:58.860" style="s2">And so we&#39;re select- ...</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.380" end="00:23:02.120" style="s2">When we&#39;ve been selecting each other for cognitive prowess,</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.420" end="00:23:05.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve been selecting ourselves for the ability to generate avatars ...</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.460" end="00:23:09.100" style="s2">... out of ourselves, and kill them instead of dying.</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.440" end="00:23:11.120" style="s2">Its unbeleivably brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.120" end="00:23:15.000" style="s2">And thats really akin to the human discovery of the future, right,</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.200" end="00:23:18.000" style="s2">the future is a place where variants of you could exist.</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.000" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">Its something like that.  And other Animals don&#39;t seem to be able to do that.</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.080" end="00:23:29.260" style="s2">So, and we&#39;re very sneaky.  And it doesnt seem to be working to badly, although we havn&#39;t been around for very long right.</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.260" end="00:23:35.300" style="s2">Human beings of our particular sub species, about 150 thousand years, something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.300" end="00:23:43.880" style="s2">Which is from an evolutionary time frame its like, its nothing, you know,  its 2000 80 year old men.</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.020" end="00:23:46.940" style="s2">Its not very long, if you think about it that way.</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.940" end="00:23:48.940" style="s2">Ok, so</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.720" end="00:24:07.160" style="s2">What I want to do is draw a relationship between that developmental process, that evolutionary process and the emergence of these underlying motivational systems</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.160" end="00:24:12.860" style="s2">Its something like this, so,  go back in time to the emergence of the development of nervous systems</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.860" end="00:24:17.020" style="s2">So,  there&#39;s cells that creatures use to</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.740" end="00:24:24.440" style="s2">to,  produce motor output and there&#39;s cells that creatures use to map the patterns around them onto themselves</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.440" end="00:24:29.520" style="s2">And so those... thats sensory, thats the sensory layer, so to speak.     Imagine.</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.060" end="00:24:31.360" style="s2">Sensory Layer</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.500" end="00:24:33.640" style="s2">Nervous Layer</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:35.000" style="s2">Motor Layer</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.440" end="00:24:38.540" style="s2">In simpler animals you just have sensory motor cells.</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.540" end="00:24:40.240" style="s2">Then they diversify.</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.460" end="00:24:41.500" style="s2">Sensory Layer.</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.740" end="00:24:42.660" style="s2">Nervous Layer</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.980" end="00:24:47.580" style="s2">Motor Layer.  In fact thats actually what you consist of when you are first developing in utero.</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.580" end="00:24:50.480" style="s2">After the blastocyte stage when the cells differentiate.</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">Thats the differentiation, sensory layer, nervous layer, motor layer.</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:24:56.880" style="s2">So you think, theres a sensory layer</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.600" end="00:24:59.600" style="s2">Now what&#39;s that sensory layer doing?</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.140" end="00:25:04.400" style="s2">Think about the world as consists, consisting of patterns.</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.880" end="00:25:10.080" style="s2">Of all sorts... like maybe theres an animal in the ocean and its being subjected to wave motion.</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.080" end="00:25:11.080" style="s2">And so,</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.080" end="00:25:14.780" style="s2">Its sensory systems map the wave motion onto the motor output</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.780" end="00:25:17.080" style="s2">so, if you look at a sponge for example,</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.080" end="00:25:21.620" style="s2">sponges are good examples cause they&#39;re sort of half uni-cellular animals and half multi-cellular animals</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.620" end="00:25:26.860" style="s2">You can take a sponge and run it though a collander and seperate it out into cells</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.860" end="00:25:30.680" style="s2">In say, salt water, and it&#39;ll assemble itself back into a sponge.</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.160" end="00:25:33.580" style="s2">So its sorta at the, yeah, amazing eh!</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.960" end="00:25:35.960" style="s2">Its kinda what you do in utero.</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.200" end="00:25:43.360" style="s2">The cells somehow know enough to communicate with one another to organise themselves into an organism.</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.040" end="00:25:46.680" style="s2">Its unbeleivable.  We have no idea how people do that because</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.680" end="00:25:51.840" style="s2">When your in the initial form, the blastocyte form all those cells are identical, genetically</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.840" end="00:25:55.820" style="s2">and all of a sudden they differentiate and they move to the places they are suposed to go</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.820" end="00:25:57.820" style="s2">we have no idea how that</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.820" end="00:26:00.360" style="s2">how the hell can that happen? These cells are all identical</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.360" end="00:26:02.360" style="s2">except for their position</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.360" end="00:26:07.240" style="s2">so they are obviously communicating with one another in some unbeleivably complicated way</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.240" end="00:26:11.660" style="s2">and saying, well you&#39;re this sort of cell and you&#39;re going to differentiate that way</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.660" end="00:26:13.020" style="s2">god only knows</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.020" end="00:26:15.440" style="s2">but anyway, sponges can do this... now</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.100" end="00:26:17.440" style="s2">a sponge</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.440" end="00:26:21.880" style="s2">isnt complicated enough to have the sensory layer and the nervous layer and the motor layer</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.880" end="00:26:26.360" style="s2">its just sensory motor cells if I remember correctly, but what the sponge is trying to figure out is..</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.360" end="00:26:31.780" style="s2">It wants to get water through its pores inside because that&#39;s how it eats and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.800" end="00:26:33.780" style="s2">There&#39;s wave motion constantly</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.780" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">and so what&#39;s happening is that the wave motion is a pattern and the sponge is reacting to that in a patterned way</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.100" end="00:37:14.560" style="s2">Nothing like an error to make you conscious</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.580" end="00:37:20.100" style="s2">Then you do a high resolution analysis of the space in which the error e merged.</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.100" end="00:37:23.900" style="s2">You rematch your motor output, your perceptions and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.900" end="00:37:25.540" style="s2">to make that error go away</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.540" end="00:37:26.820" style="s2">and away you go</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.820" end="00:37:28.820" style="s2">And so your consciousness is continually</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.820" end="00:37:33.120" style="s2">Your consciousness seems to continually building your unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.220" end="00:37:34.380" style="s2">Your procedural unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.840" end="00:37:37.800" style="s2">And so to some degree the purpose of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.800" end="00:37:40.240" style="s2">is to make you functional unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.960" end="00:37:42.700" style="s2">Right? Because that&#39;s way better</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.840" end="00:37:44.460" style="s2">You don&#39;t want to be conscious of most things</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.460" end="00:37:45.780" style="s2">because it&#39;s just...what are you gonna do,</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.780" end="00:37:47.460" style="s2">be conscious of your digestive processes?</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.460" end="00:37:48.580" style="s2">It&#39;s like, &quot;no.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.980" end="00:37:50.980" style="s2">If your good at something</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.080" end="00:37:53.200" style="s2">you hardly have to be conscious of it at all</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.200" end="00:37:57.740" style="s2">So consciousness is something like an error detection and rectification system.</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.740" end="00:37:59.240" style="s2">Something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.480" end="00:38:02.140" style="s2">And so you could say, well you could practice being conscious</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.280" end="00:38:05.500" style="s2">because what that means in some sense is you&#39;re always attending to your errors</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.500" end="00:38:07.900" style="s2">and that seems to be a really intelligent thing to do--</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.360" end="00:38:11.400" style="s2">if you don&#39;t take it too far and collapse yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.400" end="00:38:13.400" style="s2">because if you&#39;re always attending to your errors</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.780" end="00:38:17.380" style="s2">you&#39;re always improving your automated adaptability</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.380" end="00:38:18.840" style="s2">Something like that, right?</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.840" end="00:38:19.960" style="s2">Pay attention!</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.960" end="00:38:22.460" style="s2">See if things are working out the way that you want them to</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.460" end="00:38:27.320" style="s2">and if they&#39;re not modify your approach, your perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.420" end="00:38:29.420" style="s2">so you conserve these systems</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.380" end="00:38:35.460" style="s2">and system emerges to solve the problems of emergent complexity</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.460" end="00:38:39.060" style="s2">and you end up at birth with all of these conserved systems</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.180" end="00:38:42.660" style="s2">so those would be proclavities that would enable you to..</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.700" end="00:38:49.060" style="s2">manifest necessary realm of behaviours in social, natural human environment</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.060" end="00:38:51.880" style="s2">something like that... so you are basically prepared for that.</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.020" end="00:38:54.480" style="s2">and i told you.... ah.. we went through what those were last time and..</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.480" end="00:38:56.480" style="s2">and you can break them down into</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.920" end="00:39:01.700" style="s2">self maintanence motivations and self propagation motivations.. something like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.160" end="00:39:06.500" style="s2">so now okay the question is how do those manifest themselves?</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.500" end="00:39:10.780" style="s2">and that&#39;s where we get.. that&#39;s where we can make a shift ..say</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.780" end="00:39:16.140" style="s2">from evolutionary ideas and biological ideas to narrative ideas.</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.780" end="00:39:17.520" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.040" end="00:39:20.040" style="s2">i made  the case for you that</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.040" end="00:39:23.640" style="s2">you exist within this thing.. I never figured out exactly what to call it</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.640" end="00:39:26.860" style="s2">because you can call it a game or you can call it a frame of reference</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.860" end="00:39:28.860" style="s2">it&#39;s a pretty good one</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.860" end="00:39:30.220" style="s2">or you can call it a story</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.220" end="00:39:32.220" style="s2">or you can call it unitive perception</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.220" end="00:39:35.580" style="s2">and that&#39;s not exactly right because it&#39;s more than perception</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.580" end="00:39:39.740" style="s2">it&#39;s really.. what it is a micro personality</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.740" end="00:39:44.300" style="s2">it&#39;s your personality as it manifests itself</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.300" end="00:39:47.540" style="s2">at the highest possible resolutions. That&#39;s what this is.</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.540" end="00:39:49.540" style="s2">and so.. if I am</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.540" end="00:39:55.780" style="s2">say I set myself to the task of moving those keys from there to here</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.780" end="00:39:57.780" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.780" end="00:39:59.780" style="s2">my perceptual frame is</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.140" end="00:40:03.620" style="s2">it&#39;s this thing.. i think well what&#39;s the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.540" end="00:40:06.540" style="s2">everything else can be ignored</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.980" end="00:40:10.420" style="s2">I need to make an object out of my hand</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.260" end="00:40:14.700" style="s2">these keys that tiny spot on the table</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.380" end="00:40:20.960" style="s2">and my goal is to transform this pattern into that pattern</p>
