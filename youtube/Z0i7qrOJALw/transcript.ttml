<p begin="00:01:49.570" end="00:01:56.590" style="s2">towards the end this dialectic is a</p>

<p begin="00:02:50.350" end="00:03:01.000" style="s2">of being and then the idea is that this</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.060" end="00:03:04.540" style="s2">reaches a state in which a system of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.000" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">ideas emerges that grasps the</p>

<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:14.760" style="s2">exemplified Hegel believed in his own</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.670" end="00:03:17.800" style="s2">philosophy and this is the culmination</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.760" end="00:03:21.460" style="s2">the state of &#39;absolute Geist and if we</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.800" end="00:03:24.760" style="s2">remember that for Hegel the real is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.460" end="00:03:28.630" style="s2">rationale the rationale is the real what</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.760" end="00:03:30.610" style="s2">we get is that this development of the</p>

<p begin="00:03:30.610" end="00:03:33.910" style="s2">reality is also the development of</p>

<p begin="00:03:33.910" end="00:03:41.710" style="s2">and so this Co development of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.330" end="00:03:47.190" style="s2">and being is absolute spirit absolute</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.710" end="00:03:47.190" style="s2">mind this is Hegel&#39;s version of God a</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.700" end="00:03:57.850" style="s2">secularized non religious God we saw how</p>

<p begin="00:40:57.900" end="00:41:02.640" style="s2">pseudo religious ideologies is not only</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.479" end="00:41:06.799" style="s2">symptomatic of the meaning crisis it</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.640" end="00:41:10.890" style="s2">contributes to the meaning crisis by</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.799" end="00:41:13.190" style="s2">locking us in - or at least contributing</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.890" end="00:41:17.969" style="s2">to the way in which we are locked into</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.190" end="00:41:23.130" style="s2">this dilemma this aspect of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.969" end="00:41:27.019" style="s2">crisis in which we need a religion that</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.130" end="00:41:27.019" style="s2">is not a religion at all</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.130" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">so I mean I could continue on this</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.930" end="00:41:45.180" style="s2">history I could talk about great works</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.720" end="00:41:45.750" style="s2">of literature that struggle with this</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.180" end="00:41:48.630" style="s2">dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.750" end="00:41:51.450" style="s2">I think a fruitful way of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.630" end="00:41:53.339" style="s2">one of the great novels I consider one</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.450" end="00:41:56.430" style="s2">of the the greatest and certainly one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.339" end="00:41:59.180" style="s2">my favorite you know Moby Dick is about</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.430" end="00:41:59.180" style="s2">this dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.660" end="00:42:11.729" style="s2">I think you could make a good case for</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.460" end="00:42:14.279" style="s2">that you could talk about different</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.729" end="00:42:17.279" style="s2">aspects of popular culture you could see</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.279" end="00:42:18.930" style="s2">the zombie mythology as an articulation</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.279" end="00:42:22.880" style="s2">of this and aspects of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.930" end="00:42:22.880" style="s2">crisis but we&#39;ll come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.359" end="00:42:31.979" style="s2">because it&#39;s now time to move from the</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.809" end="00:42:34.200" style="s2">historical analysis from understanding</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.979" end="00:42:36.749" style="s2">the genealogy the collapse of the three</p>

<p begin="00:42:40.319" end="00:42:48.839" style="s2">emerges out of the attempt to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.089" end="00:42:54.749" style="s2">the collapse to the creation of pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.839" end="00:42:57.059" style="s2">religious ideologies it&#39;s time to pass</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.749" end="00:42:59.099" style="s2">from that historical analysis because we</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.059" end="00:43:01.019" style="s2">could continue it we could carry it like</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.099" end="00:43:03.390" style="s2">I said into an analysis of popular</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.019" end="00:43:04.559" style="s2">culture important works of art and</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.390" end="00:43:06.239" style="s2">literature we could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.559" end="00:43:10.319" style="s2">Dostoyevsky or as I&#39;ve mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.239" end="00:43:11.609" style="s2">Melville or Conrad and that that of</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.319" end="00:43:15.769" style="s2">course and it&#39;s not in any way an</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.609" end="00:43:15.769" style="s2">exhaustive list right</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.309" end="00:43:22.589" style="s2">but it&#39;s time I think now to turn to the</p>

<p begin="00:43:22.589" end="00:43:31.920" style="s2">to make we need to turn now to not a</p>

<p begin="00:44:18.549" end="00:44:30.279" style="s2">I propose that what we do is try to</p>

<p begin="00:45:16.449" end="00:45:23.229" style="s2">to the meeting crisis and the historical</p>

<p begin="00:45:56.589" end="00:46:07.690" style="s2">self-transcendence so the way to begin</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.789" end="00:46:10.069" style="s2">that is to just talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.690" end="00:46:12.079" style="s2">cognitive sciences antennae and of</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.069" end="00:46:13.670" style="s2">course I mean I&#39;m a cognitive scientist</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.079" end="00:46:14.779" style="s2">I teach cognitive science at the</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.670" end="00:46:16.250" style="s2">University of Toronto I teach the</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.779" end="00:46:18.319" style="s2">introduction to cognitive science I</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.250" end="00:46:20.270" style="s2">teach many courses I teach a course on</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.319" end="00:46:21.289" style="s2">Buddhism in cognitive science some of</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.270" end="00:46:23.890" style="s2">you may know about that</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.289" end="00:46:27.200" style="s2">I teach upper level courses on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.890" end="00:46:29.240" style="s2">cognitive science of consciousness and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.200" end="00:46:34.630" style="s2">teach also cognitive psychology where I</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.240" end="00:46:37.190" style="s2">do a lot of work on the MIS machinery of</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.630" end="00:46:39.529" style="s2">meaning-making and the machinery the</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.190" end="00:46:43.940" style="s2">cognitive machinery at work and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.529" end="00:46:49.609" style="s2">and self transcendence so what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.940" end="00:46:51.039" style="s2">do is present to you I mean I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.609" end="00:46:53.000" style="s2">laughing because I&#39;d like I have entire</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.039" end="00:46:54.380" style="s2">university courses in which I do this</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.000" end="00:46:56.720" style="s2">but I want to try and present to you or</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.380" end="00:46:58.789" style="s2">introduced you what is cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.720" end="00:47:01.400" style="s2">or a particular vision of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.789" end="00:47:03.200" style="s2">science because of course academics will</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.400" end="00:47:05.990" style="s2">disagree as to what cognitive science is</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.200" end="00:47:11.150" style="s2">and I&#39;m going to present what cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.990" end="00:47:13.700" style="s2">science is for me not in terms of my</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.150" end="00:47:15.740" style="s2">personal proclivities or taste but my</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.700" end="00:47:18.079" style="s2">argument for what I think is the best</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.740" end="00:47:22.039" style="s2">vision of what cognitive science should</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.079" end="00:47:24.079" style="s2">and can be doing and I want to present</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.039" end="00:47:29.170" style="s2">that in a way that is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.079" end="00:47:30.319" style="s2">interrelated with the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.170" end="00:47:35.059" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.319" end="00:47:37.549" style="s2">so cognitive science is a fairly recent</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.059" end="00:47:40.460" style="s2">discipline it really emerges only in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.549" end="00:47:41.359" style="s2">late 70s as an explicit academic</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.460" end="00:47:45.740" style="s2">discipline</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.359" end="00:47:52.069" style="s2">the early 80s and it&#39;s and it&#39;s born out</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.740" end="00:47:56.750" style="s2">of an important idea that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.069" end="00:48:00.349" style="s2">have multiple disciplines that are</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.750" end="00:48:03.640" style="s2">studying this thing called mind the</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.349" end="00:48:03.640" style="s2">organ of cognition</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.469" end="00:48:11.109" style="s2">so for example there are some people</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.640" end="00:48:13.390" style="s2">let&#39;s organize this this way we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.109" end="00:48:17.469" style="s2">about sort of levels of reality or</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.390" end="00:48:20.289" style="s2">levels of analysis right to keep contact</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.469" end="00:48:28.779" style="s2">and then we can talk talk about</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.289" end="00:48:33.190" style="s2">different disciplines all dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.779" end="00:48:38.229" style="s2">this phenomena and I want to show you</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.190" end="00:48:39.910" style="s2">how as the science is advancing its also</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.229" end="00:48:42.099" style="s2">contributing to the meaning crisis in</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.910" end="00:48:45.789" style="s2">the way it&#39;s fragmenting the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.099" end="00:48:49.749" style="s2">mind and attendant senses of identity</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.789" end="00:48:55.029" style="s2">and self so what do I mean so you have</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.749" end="00:48:59.979" style="s2">right the understanding of mind by</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.029" end="00:49:01.150" style="s2">understanding the brain and people</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.979" end="00:49:05.859" style="s2">should be more careful when they</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.150" end="00:49:08.519" style="s2">criticize this the brain is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.859" end="00:49:14.049" style="s2">terrifically complex and sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.519" end="00:49:15.759" style="s2">thing but what you do here is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.049" end="00:49:18.430" style="s2">gonna try and understand the mind by</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.759" end="00:49:20.979" style="s2">studying the brain studying patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.430" end="00:49:22.119" style="s2">neural activity and of course the</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.979" end="00:49:25.150" style="s2">discipline that studies this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.119" end="00:49:29.859" style="s2">neuroscience and right they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.150" end="00:49:32.289" style="s2">entities like neurons they neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.859" end="00:49:36.430" style="s2">they talk about neurons neural processes</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.289" end="00:49:39.969" style="s2">they use you know FMR eyes perhaps EEG</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.430" end="00:49:44.199" style="s2">right new new technologies for observing</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.969" end="00:49:46.420" style="s2">the brains behavior but of course</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.199" end="00:49:49.119" style="s2">there&#39;s another discipline that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.420" end="00:49:51.130" style="s2">talking about the mind cognition at a</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.119" end="00:49:53.170" style="s2">different level this is where you try to</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.130" end="00:49:57.059" style="s2">understand the mind in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.170" end="00:49:57.059" style="s2">information processing</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.250" end="00:50:04.950" style="s2">and here you&#39;re not so much talking</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.180" end="00:50:07.020" style="s2">about neurons you might be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.950" end="00:50:11.060" style="s2">neural networks but you&#39;re talking more</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.020" end="00:50:14.040" style="s2">like about like programs algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.060" end="00:50:16.710" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about ways in which we</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.040" end="00:50:20.579" style="s2">could potentially make artificial</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.710" end="00:50:22.260" style="s2">intelligence because you know computers</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.579" end="00:50:25.530" style="s2">and neural networks aren&#39;t made of</p>

<p begin="00:50:25.530" end="00:50:28.710" style="s2">different kinds of matter and so what</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.210" end="00:50:30.720" style="s2">we&#39;re not talking about the brain level</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.710" end="00:50:33.960" style="s2">now we&#39;re talking about information</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.720" end="00:50:36.750" style="s2">processing and you know this is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.960" end="00:50:39.650" style="s2">computer science but especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.750" end="00:50:41.700" style="s2">project of artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.650" end="00:50:43.440" style="s2">especially and we&#39;ll talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.700" end="00:50:46.470" style="s2">this means later artificial general</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.440" end="00:50:48.270" style="s2">intelligence where the what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.470" end="00:50:50.550" style="s2">to do is not just make machines that can</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.270" end="00:50:51.839" style="s2">do sort of sophisticated things but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.550" end="00:50:55.619" style="s2">trying to make machines that actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.839" end="00:50:58.710" style="s2">are cognitive agents and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.619" end="00:51:00.420" style="s2">talk a lot about AI and of course we</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.710" end="00:51:04.680" style="s2">know that AI is the potential to</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.420" end="00:51:06.630" style="s2">radically transform our self</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.680" end="00:51:10.609" style="s2">understanding and exacerbate the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.630" end="00:51:10.609" style="s2">crisis and it is doing so already</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.150" end="00:51:18.089" style="s2">but of course another way I study your</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.740" end="00:51:20.010" style="s2">mind is I study your behavior now notice</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.089" end="00:51:23.550" style="s2">here I&#39;m talking about what do I do here</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.010" end="00:51:26.250" style="s2">I don&#39;t cut out brains and slice like</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.550" end="00:51:30.480" style="s2">slice them under microscopes or run F</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.250" end="00:51:36.119" style="s2">MRIs III make simulations actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.480" end="00:51:39.869" style="s2">create programs or neural networks or</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.119" end="00:51:43.829" style="s2">various combinations so notice what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.869" end="00:51:45.390" style="s2">showing you each discipline is directed</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.829" end="00:51:47.849" style="s2">to a different level and it&#39;s using</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.390" end="00:51:50.700" style="s2">different language and it&#39;s using</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.849" end="00:51:52.560" style="s2">different methods of Investigation and</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.700" end="00:51:58.589" style="s2">it&#39;s amassing different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.560" end="00:51:59.670" style="s2">evidence so what&#39;s the what what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.589" end="00:52:02.700" style="s2">discipline that studies behavior of</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.670" end="00:52:04.380" style="s2">course well that&#39;s psychology or</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.700" end="00:52:10.099" style="s2">discipline that I I&#39;m privileged to</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.380" end="00:52:10.099" style="s2">practice at the University of Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.339" end="00:52:14.069" style="s2">and we talk about different things I</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.599" end="00:52:15.660" style="s2">mean psychologists sometimes talk about</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.069" end="00:52:17.519" style="s2">brains and they sometimes talk about</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.660" end="00:52:21.089" style="s2">this because cognitive psychology is</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.519" end="00:52:23.190" style="s2">very influenced by cognitive science but</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.089" end="00:52:24.329" style="s2">generally psychologists are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.190" end="00:52:26.099" style="s2">understand behavior and we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.329" end="00:52:29.279" style="s2">things like working memory and long-term</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.099" end="00:52:32.059" style="s2">memory right we talk about those kinds</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.279" end="00:52:34.619" style="s2">of things and what we do is we use</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.059" end="00:52:37.140" style="s2">experimentation on human beings and we</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.619" end="00:52:40.950" style="s2">gather statistical data demographic data</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.140" end="00:52:43.890" style="s2">etc and we try to understand so again a</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.950" end="00:52:46.829" style="s2">different level using different language</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.890" end="00:52:50.190" style="s2">different methods and different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.829" end="00:52:51.930" style="s2">evidence is that enough no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.190" end="00:52:54.119" style="s2">another discipline that talks about mind</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.930" end="00:52:56.220" style="s2">because of what I&#39;m doing right now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.119" end="00:53:01.190" style="s2">making noises come out of my face wall</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.220" end="00:53:04.410" style="s2">and you understand my mind language</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.190" end="00:53:08.160" style="s2">language seems to be in a really</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.410" end="00:53:11.099" style="s2">important way in which mind operates and</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.160" end="00:53:15.829" style="s2">mind communicates it&#39;s through language</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.099" end="00:53:15.829" style="s2">that mind minds are linked together</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.240" end="00:53:24.420" style="s2">until you get language here and this of</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.829" end="00:53:26.700" style="s2">course is studied by linguistics and</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.420" end="00:53:28.410" style="s2">here you don&#39;t talk about working memory</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.700" end="00:53:29.430" style="s2">and long-term memory you might if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.410" end="00:53:31.589" style="s2">linked them together in</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.430" end="00:53:33.839" style="s2">psycholinguistics and notice how there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.589" end="00:53:36.450" style="s2">this is constant wanting to link the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.839" end="00:53:38.819" style="s2">levels together in these new hybrid</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.450" end="00:53:40.769" style="s2">disciplines but generally in linguistics</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.819" end="00:53:42.089" style="s2">you talk about things like tree</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.769" end="00:53:44.240" style="s2">structures you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.089" end="00:53:46.589" style="s2">transformational grammar you do</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.240" end="00:53:49.349" style="s2">something like experiments but it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.589" end="00:53:52.289" style="s2">right where you&#39;re testing people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.349" end="00:53:54.750" style="s2">judgments about whether or not a certain</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.289" end="00:53:57.019" style="s2">uh pterence is grammatically acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.750" end="00:53:59.640" style="s2">makes sense so again different level</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.019" end="00:54:02.460" style="s2">different language different methods</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.640" end="00:54:04.440" style="s2">different kinds of evidence and as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.460" end="00:54:07.769" style="s2">said before long before the internet</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.440" end="00:54:14.009" style="s2">networked computers together culture was</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.769" end="00:54:17.400" style="s2">networking minds together because most</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.009" end="00:54:20.849" style="s2">of our problem-solving is done with</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.400" end="00:54:22.650" style="s2">distributed cognition and the discipline</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.849" end="00:54:25.340" style="s2">that studies that of course is</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.650" end="00:54:28.170" style="s2">anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.340" end="00:54:30.930" style="s2">an anthropology uses a different method</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.170" end="00:54:33.480" style="s2">it uses participant observation because</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.930" end="00:54:34.680" style="s2">listen to that language because culture</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.480" end="00:54:36.600" style="s2">is something you have to know in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.680" end="00:54:38.280" style="s2">participatory knowing fashion you have</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.600" end="00:54:41.100" style="s2">to go through the transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.280" end="00:54:43.560" style="s2">enculturation to know what a culture is</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.100" end="00:54:46.230" style="s2">and uses participant observation it</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.560" end="00:54:51.480" style="s2">generates ethnography so what am i</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.230" end="00:54:55.380" style="s2">showing you I&#39;m showing you right that</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.480" end="00:54:57.870" style="s2">this term doesn&#39;t refer in a univille</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.380" end="00:55:00.410" style="s2">fashion it&#39;s equivocal when I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.870" end="00:55:04.140" style="s2">mine it&#39;s not clear what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.410" end="00:55:07.470" style="s2">science is fragmenting what the word</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.140" end="00:55:15.270" style="s2">mind means and therefore it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.470" end="00:55:22.950" style="s2">fragmenting you who and what you are now</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.270" end="00:55:25.800" style="s2">here&#39;s the idea right we have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.950" end="00:55:29.670" style="s2">here we&#39;ll come back and about this if</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.800" end="00:55:31.980" style="s2">we don&#39;t get clear about how we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.670" end="00:55:33.720" style="s2">integrate these various different</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.980" end="00:55:37.350" style="s2">meanings of mine we&#39;re going to engage</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.720" end="00:55:39.960" style="s2">in it lots of equivocation I&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.350" end="00:55:42.600" style="s2">back and talk about that but here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.960" end="00:55:44.340" style="s2">other idea it&#39;s highly unlikely and</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.600" end="00:55:46.590" style="s2">already we&#39;ve seen that these different</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.340" end="00:55:48.570" style="s2">disciplines want a hybrid together it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.590" end="00:55:51.660" style="s2">highly unlikely that these various</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.570" end="00:55:54.270" style="s2">levels are not culturally I&#39;m sorry are</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.660" end="00:55:58.670" style="s2">not causally impacting and constraining</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.270" end="00:56:03.950" style="s2">each other in fact it&#39;s highly plausible</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.670" end="00:56:06.360" style="s2">that these various levels causally</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.950" end="00:56:08.360" style="s2">interpenetrate and deeply influence each</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.360" end="00:56:12.930" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.360" end="00:56:16.920" style="s2">so we need to capture the causal</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.930" end="00:56:19.950" style="s2">interaction between the levels how do we</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.920" end="00:56:21.870" style="s2">capture this causal interaction that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.950" end="00:56:24.090" style="s2">not being captured by any one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.870" end="00:56:26.370" style="s2">individual disciplines will we follow</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.090" end="00:56:28.530" style="s2">that impulse to hybridization but we</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.370" end="00:56:30.570" style="s2">pursue something more what we want to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.530" end="00:56:33.270" style="s2">is we want to get all of these</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.570" end="00:56:34.980" style="s2">disciplines talking to each other not in</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.270" end="00:56:37.260" style="s2">an equivocal fashion but in a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.980" end="00:56:41.390" style="s2">fashion talking to each other we</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.260" end="00:56:44.970" style="s2">a kind of theoretical integration</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.390" end="00:56:48.570" style="s2">because that integration of right these</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.970" end="00:56:50.310" style="s2">different languages and ontology z&#39; for</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.570" end="00:56:53.670" style="s2">each one of these disciplines is how</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.310" end="00:56:56.340" style="s2">we&#39;re going to capture the missing</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.670" end="00:57:00.030" style="s2">causal interaction between the levels</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.340" end="00:57:03.660" style="s2">and avoid equivocating and it also holds</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.030" end="00:57:07.740" style="s2">this potential because if we can get a</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.660" end="00:57:09.540" style="s2">discipline that does that then we will</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.740" end="00:57:12.140" style="s2">also not only have a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.540" end="00:57:14.700" style="s2">scientific advance we will start to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.140" end="00:57:20.670" style="s2">responding to the fragmentation of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.700" end="00:57:25.280" style="s2">mind now a discipline that helps to</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.670" end="00:57:30.140" style="s2">bridge between different ontologies</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.280" end="00:57:31.859" style="s2">discourses methods ways of theorizing</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.140" end="00:57:33.890" style="s2">bringing evidence together the</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.859" end="00:57:39.270" style="s2">discipline that does that is philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.890" end="00:57:43.680" style="s2">right so what you want is you want some</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.270" end="00:57:45.570" style="s2">philosophical training in how discourses</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.680" end="00:57:50.310" style="s2">and I mean it&#39;s very deeply how</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.570" end="00:57:53.310" style="s2">disciplines ways of theorizing observer</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.310" end="00:57:55.320" style="s2">observing studying reality these</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.310" end="00:57:58.550" style="s2">different levels of the reality of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.320" end="00:58:01.160" style="s2">mind right you need a discipline that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.550" end="00:58:04.109" style="s2">capable of trying to bridge between</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.160" end="00:58:09.330" style="s2">those vocabularies and that&#39;s philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.109" end="00:58:11.010" style="s2">now if I take this philosophy and I so I</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.330" end="00:58:15.000" style="s2">get training in this and I get training</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.010" end="00:58:17.940" style="s2">in these and I start to try to bridge</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.000" end="00:58:21.210" style="s2">between the disciplines to avoid the</p>
