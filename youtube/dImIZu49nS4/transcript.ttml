<p begin="00:00:06.870" end="00:00:12.300" style="s2">don&#39;t think that necessarily is one apt</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.809" end="00:00:14.450" style="s2">necessarily certainly one out</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.300" end="00:00:19.740" style="s2">necessarily it&#39;s a lot of necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.450" end="00:00:28.740" style="s2">but having a way to track what we choose</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.740" end="00:00:35.550" style="s2">to buy what that creates myspace harder</p>

<p begin="00:00:49.559" end="00:00:53.010" style="s2">talking about that now this was a</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.670" end="00:00:54.449" style="s2">different thing but oh so I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.010" end="00:00:56.129" style="s2">recycle I try to recycle everything I</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.449" end="00:00:57.719" style="s2">can in my compost but it goes to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.129" end="00:01:01.379" style="s2">city for composting I don&#39;t compost in</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.719" end="00:01:03.059" style="s2">my backyard and I try to minimize that a</p>

<p begin="00:01:04.470" end="00:01:09.630" style="s2">what it gets made into you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.710" end="00:01:13.200" style="s2">being able to track that be able to say</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.630" end="00:01:17.220" style="s2">okay if I have this object what went</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.200" end="00:01:19.350" style="s2">into it how long do I have to own it to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.220" end="00:01:21.540" style="s2">justify owning it what I mean by that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.350" end="00:01:23.939" style="s2">people talk about having like you have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.540" end="00:01:27.150" style="s2">to-go container for coffee versus your</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.939" end="00:01:28.829" style="s2">own coffee cup using it every day it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.150" end="00:01:31.979" style="s2">clearly better to have the coffee cup</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.829" end="00:01:34.140" style="s2">that you can reuse but if you forget it</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.979" end="00:01:36.750" style="s2">and you&#39;re oh is it better to buy a new</p>

<p begin="00:01:36.750" end="00:01:45.409" style="s2">and how many cups of the to go have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.920" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">go into the permanent one or usable one</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.409" end="00:01:56.009" style="s2">to equal the energy the human time the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.360" end="00:01:59.100" style="s2">resources to go into it to equal just</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.009" end="00:02:00.899" style="s2">getting it to go to go cup sometimes it</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.100" end="00:02:02.430" style="s2">probably is a better option so being</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.899" end="00:02:06.630" style="s2">able to see that being able to see how</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.430" end="00:02:07.649" style="s2">our choices and what we buy based on</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.630" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">what they&#39;re created out of and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.649" end="00:02:12.629" style="s2">they can be what they can become is what</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:13.150" style="s2">that means so we can follow the charge</p>
