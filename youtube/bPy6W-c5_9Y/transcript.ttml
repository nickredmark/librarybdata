<p begin="00:00:49.829" end="00:00:56.160" style="s2">I&#39;d like to start is what&#39;s a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:00:56.160" end="00:01:03.329" style="s2">religion and spirituality are yeah so if</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.210" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">we look at something like just modernism</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.329" end="00:01:09.330" style="s2">tends to have this in a way pejorative</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:11.580" style="s2">notion of what religion is because it</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.330" end="00:01:14.400" style="s2">looks back at the traditional or just</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.580" end="00:01:18.090" style="s2">the immediately pre-modern definition it</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.400" end="00:01:20.820" style="s2">says okay these large popular mythic</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.090" end="00:01:23.070" style="s2">membership groups with cosmological</p>

<p begin="00:01:24.900" end="00:01:30.329" style="s2">tries to distinguish itself from that</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.790" end="00:01:32.909" style="s2">right zoom out and you look at modern</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.329" end="00:01:34.409" style="s2">pre-modern postmodern archaic and you</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.909" end="00:01:36.869" style="s2">line them up next to each other you say</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.409" end="00:01:39.780" style="s2">what was religion doing in all of these</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.869" end="00:01:41.490" style="s2">paradigms was it functioning well what</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.780" end="00:01:43.200" style="s2">can we elicit from all of them and how</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.490" end="00:01:45.240" style="s2">do we get them to complement each other</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.200" end="00:01:46.740" style="s2">going forward right they get a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.240" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">different view and a few that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.740" end="00:01:50.729" style="s2">amenable to science I think well you</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:53.880" style="s2">know that of course I&#39;m an agreement</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.729" end="00:01:57.509" style="s2">with you I should mention to viewers</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.880" end="00:01:59.460" style="s2">that layman and I have had several</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.509" end="00:02:01.290" style="s2">conversations already around these</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:03.329" style="s2">topics and that&#39;s precisely why I</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.290" end="00:02:05.820" style="s2">invited him on I&#39;ve often found what he</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.329" end="00:02:09.149" style="s2">had to say I&#39;m extremely insightful and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.820" end="00:02:11.970" style="s2">a provocative of my own thinking so what</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.149" end="00:02:13.990" style="s2">would you say like what would you say</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.970" end="00:02:15.820" style="s2">what definition if</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.990" end="00:02:17.200" style="s2">if that&#39;s even the right word I I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.820" end="00:02:21.070" style="s2">kind of a little bit of a bit continued</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.200" end="00:02:23.710" style="s2">in fear of definitions so what would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.070" end="00:02:26.170" style="s2">the the best characterization I will</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.710" end="00:02:28.210" style="s2">allow me a looser term for religion that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.170" end="00:02:30.550" style="s2">is more encompassing of this broader</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.210" end="00:02:33.660" style="s2">historical and functional scope that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.550" end="00:02:38.500" style="s2">put your finger on sure loose definition</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.660" end="00:02:40.710" style="s2">and obviously it encompasses a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.500" end="00:02:43.090" style="s2">things it&#39;s more like a flotilla</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.710" end="00:02:45.910" style="s2">different functions right I would say</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.090" end="00:02:48.010" style="s2">very generally that it&#39;s the it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.910" end="00:02:50.050" style="s2">cultural version of what spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.010" end="00:02:51.880" style="s2">practice is mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.050" end="00:02:55.060" style="s2">and that involves bringing together</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.880" end="00:02:57.760" style="s2">different genres different functions of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.060" end="00:02:59.890" style="s2">human social experience and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.760" end="00:03:02.800" style="s2">integrate and coordinate them to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.890" end="00:03:05.440" style="s2">point where a numinous excess is</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.800" end="00:03:06.850" style="s2">produced where a gestalt coherence you</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.440" end="00:03:09.250" style="s2">know we&#39;re getting more than the sum of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.850" end="00:03:11.740" style="s2">the parts out of our social practice and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.250" end="00:03:14.320" style="s2">then that becomes an additional energy</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.740" end="00:03:16.750" style="s2">that&#39;s capable of sacral izing people</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.320" end="00:03:19.120" style="s2">relationships cultural rituals things</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.750" end="00:03:21.370" style="s2">like that so I think when it&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.120" end="00:03:24.100" style="s2">that&#39;s what it does and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.370" end="00:03:25.720" style="s2">organizations and the style that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.100" end="00:03:28.510" style="s2">characterizes different religions</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.720" end="00:03:30.250" style="s2">that&#39;s an output of that process I see</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.510" end="00:03:31.960" style="s2">so let me make sure I&#39;ve understood you</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.250" end="00:03:35.550" style="s2">because I think that&#39;s really cool so</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.960" end="00:03:37.960" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about religion ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.550" end="00:03:39.610" style="s2">in cultural terms that was the adjective</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.960" end="00:03:42.160" style="s2">you first invoked and then you talked</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.610" end="00:03:45.220" style="s2">about social practices that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.160" end="00:03:46.630" style="s2">analogous to like what like individuals</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.220" end="00:03:48.520" style="s2">do a bunch of things that fall under</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.630" end="00:03:50.470" style="s2">this loose umbrella of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.520" end="00:03:51.310" style="s2">practices things that in which they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.470" end="00:03:54.670" style="s2">trying to bring about substantial</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.310" end="00:03:56.590" style="s2">transformation a forward aspiration come</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.670" end="00:03:58.150" style="s2">into a more reliable continuity of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.590" end="00:04:00.610" style="s2">contact with what&#39;s they what they&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.150" end="00:04:02.260" style="s2">most real what they&#39;re ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.610" end="00:04:03.790" style="s2">concerned with that sort of thing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.260" end="00:04:06.040" style="s2">then there&#39;s what you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.790" end="00:04:08.740" style="s2">there&#39;s analogous social practices that</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.040" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">are performing simple similar functions</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.740" end="00:04:13.540" style="s2">and when you get in it when they form</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:16.510" style="s2">I&#39;ll use this from like a dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.540" end="00:04:19.180" style="s2">system that gets some emergent excess so</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.510" end="00:04:22.150" style="s2">that the system tends to be present to</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.180" end="00:04:23.650" style="s2">people rather than just a foreground I</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.150" end="00:04:25.240" style="s2">sort of rather than just a background</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.650" end="00:04:27.490" style="s2">system of constraints that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.240" end="00:04:29.110" style="s2">operating within it sort of presents</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.490" end="00:04:30.490" style="s2">self to them phenomenologically they get</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.110" end="00:04:31.539" style="s2">us you say I believe you use the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.490" end="00:04:35.139" style="s2">adjective numinous</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.539" end="00:04:36.910" style="s2">right they get some sense of an excess</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.139" end="00:04:38.380" style="s2">that it&#39;s going beyond that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.910" end="00:04:40.150" style="s2">affording more than it could before it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.380" end="00:04:42.580" style="s2">taking on a life of its own is that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.150" end="00:04:44.710" style="s2">that a fair representation of your point</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.580" end="00:04:46.990" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s very fair it&#39;s love</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.710" end="00:04:49.930" style="s2">you know the social machinery of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.990" end="00:04:52.449" style="s2">apotheosis right function and when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.930" end="00:04:54.490" style="s2">performing that function well then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.449" end="00:04:57.160" style="s2">really religion izing it&#39;s really doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.490" end="00:04:58.210" style="s2">its job as opposed to it might not be</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.160" end="00:04:59.440" style="s2">you might have a group of people who</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.210" end="00:05:01.090" style="s2">think they&#39;re religious and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.440" end="00:05:02.740" style="s2">performing that function so you got to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.090" end="00:05:04.960" style="s2">use the definition apart and I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.740" end="00:05:06.970" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely essential</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.960" end="00:05:08.560" style="s2">culturally because it&#39;s what brings</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.970" end="00:05:11.229" style="s2">people together in this numinous excess</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.560" end="00:05:12.729" style="s2">it&#39;s not just an aesthetic pleasure that</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.229" end="00:05:14.979" style="s2">we take in thinking of something as</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.729" end="00:05:17.590" style="s2">transcendentally wonderful it&#39;s also our</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.979" end="00:05:19.479" style="s2">mobilisation energy all right brings us</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.590" end="00:05:22.090" style="s2">together mobilizes us which we need in</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.479" end="00:05:24.099" style="s2">order to face crises that we have right</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.090" end="00:05:26.080" style="s2">and if we don&#39;t do that then we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.099" end="00:05:28.270" style="s2">degenerate yeah that&#39;s where I would</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.080" end="00:05:30.639" style="s2">that&#39;s my generalized definition of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.270" end="00:05:33.909" style="s2">nihilism nihilism like not in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.639" end="00:05:35.680" style="s2">specific idea that you know we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.909" end="00:05:37.330" style="s2">the thought of being by focusing on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.680" end="00:05:39.159" style="s2">metaphysics of the beings or that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.330" end="00:05:41.530" style="s2">walking around saying I have no beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.159" end="00:05:44.800" style="s2">not that kind of nihilism but a much</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.530" end="00:05:47.139" style="s2">more general process of self</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.800" end="00:05:49.810" style="s2">neutralization or of the of the nothing</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.139" end="00:05:51.639" style="s2">izing of our practices and our values so</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.810" end="00:05:56.259" style="s2">that we begin to regress because we lose</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.639" end="00:05:58.690" style="s2">the ones that we attain great so yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.259" end="00:06:01.180" style="s2">that that the two points here the one is</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.690" end="00:06:03.669" style="s2">that that notion that it&#39;s not just an</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.180" end="00:06:06.819" style="s2">aesthetic response but actually an</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.669" end="00:06:09.340" style="s2">enabling and energizing phenomena that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.819" end="00:06:12.190" style="s2">that reminds me of stones work in</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.340" end="00:06:13.330" style="s2">minimal a minimalist account of</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.190" end="00:06:14.889" style="s2">transcendence I think he calls at</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.330" end="00:06:17.229" style="s2">minimal transcendence where he&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.889" end="00:06:18.580" style="s2">to give stone has been consistent about</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.229" end="00:06:19.690" style="s2">trying to explain phenomena like</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.580" end="00:06:22.210" style="s2">transcendence and completely</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.690" end="00:06:24.849" style="s2">naturalistic terms and he points to that</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.210" end="00:06:26.919" style="s2">fact he he but he adds it adds an</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.849" end="00:06:28.599" style="s2">element to it he&#39;s like you he says it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.919" end="00:06:30.669" style="s2">not just aesthetic but it has to afford</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.599" end="00:06:32.650" style="s2">it has to it&#39;s almost like an insight</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.669" end="00:06:34.780" style="s2">the way it makes it you know Boden&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.650" end="00:06:36.190" style="s2">idea of an insight that it allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.780" end="00:06:39.099" style="s2">do things that you couldn&#39;t previously</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.190" end="00:06:40.840" style="s2">do so it&#39;s energizing and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.099" end="00:06:42.700" style="s2">insightful but I</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.840" end="00:06:44.620" style="s2">take your point at a social level but he</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.700" end="00:06:47.290" style="s2">also points out it also has a normative</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.620" end="00:06:49.210" style="s2">aspect to us it challenges us it</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.290" end="00:06:51.700" style="s2">challenges us to kinds of self criticism</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.210" end="00:06:53.770" style="s2">and self correction that we otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.700" end="00:06:55.540" style="s2">would not be capable of are you keep are</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.770" end="00:06:58.150" style="s2">you happy with outing that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.540" end="00:07:01.330" style="s2">nominate very good I think that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.150" end="00:07:04.150" style="s2">part of what it becomes over time you</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.330" end="00:07:06.370" style="s2">know as if this process is occurring and</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.150" end="00:07:09.130" style="s2">it moves forward through history then it</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.370" end="00:07:11.680" style="s2">begins to gather to itself a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.130" end="00:07:13.720" style="s2">skills and insights and also acts like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.680" end="00:07:15.880" style="s2">memory of a variety of practices and</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.720" end="00:07:17.979" style="s2">skills it moves that forth it wants to</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.880" end="00:07:21.490" style="s2">keep itself going so it has to remember</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.979" end="00:07:23.020" style="s2">how to do those things right so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.490" end="00:07:26.350" style="s2">other point I wanted to pick up on is</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.020" end="00:07:28.330" style="s2">the you made a distinction between sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.350" end="00:07:30.190" style="s2">of different conceptions of nihilism and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.330" end="00:07:32.260" style="s2">the one that you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.190" end="00:07:35.800" style="s2">sounded it sounds very similar or</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.260" end="00:07:38.410" style="s2">overlaps to a significant degree with my</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.800" end="00:07:42.040" style="s2">notion of the meaning crisis is it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.410" end="00:07:44.290" style="s2">that a fair interpretation sure I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.040" end="00:07:46.780" style="s2">meaning crisis has sort of two aspects</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.290" end="00:07:50.800" style="s2">one is there have always been meaning</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.780" end="00:07:53.020" style="s2">crises that society wasn&#39;t doing its job</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.800" end="00:07:54.550" style="s2">getting up to date on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.020" end="00:07:56.740" style="s2">there&#39;s maybe something peculiar about</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.550" end="00:08:00.520" style="s2">the current moment yes but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.740" end="00:08:02.530" style="s2">objectively but the meaning crisis to me</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.520" end="00:08:03.729" style="s2">why is it a crisis it&#39;s because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.530" end="00:08:05.860" style="s2">not getting a handle on it</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.729" end="00:08:07.840" style="s2">we&#39;re not working it properly to get the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.860" end="00:08:09.820" style="s2">results we want and therefore if the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.840" end="00:08:12.760" style="s2">practices that we need in order to</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.820" end="00:08:14.889" style="s2">produce the capacitance to give us the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.760" end="00:08:18.550" style="s2">capacity to handle that those practices</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.889" end="00:08:20.889" style="s2">are absent right and so the result of</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.550" end="00:08:22.840" style="s2">the absence of those practices is what I</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.889" end="00:08:25.690" style="s2">would call nihilism in general yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.840" end="00:08:30.660" style="s2">regress rather than progress right right</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.690" end="00:08:32.860" style="s2">that makes sense so that what then is</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.660" end="00:08:34.300" style="s2">best you a similar question in other</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.860" end="00:08:36.400" style="s2">contexts and you often gave me really</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.300" end="00:08:39.640" style="s2">interesting in what then is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.400" end="00:08:42.370" style="s2">relationship because now there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.640" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">three things in my mind that have come</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.370" end="00:08:46.690" style="s2">up in the discussion there&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:48.940" style="s2">calling individual spirituality and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.690" end="00:08:51.640" style="s2">think of that as some kind of overall</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.940" end="00:08:54.610" style="s2">enhancement of a capacity for self</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.640" end="00:08:57.130" style="s2">transcending and enhancing religio</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.610" end="00:08:59.350" style="s2">sense of connectedness that is so</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.130" end="00:09:01.839" style="s2">fundamental to meaning in life right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.350" end="00:09:03.940" style="s2">that&#39;s the third so the spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.839" end="00:09:05.050" style="s2">religio and then of course that religio</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.940" end="00:09:07.440" style="s2">is connected to what you&#39;re calling</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.050" end="00:09:10.029" style="s2">religion and we&#39;ve been you&#39;ve given me</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.440" end="00:09:11.740" style="s2">this so social analog which I really</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.029" end="00:09:13.720" style="s2">like by the way this is very cool so of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.740" end="00:09:16.149" style="s2">course these are they both touch on</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.720" end="00:09:17.529" style="s2">religio and therefore there has to be an</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.149" end="00:09:21.010" style="s2">important way in which individual</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.529" end="00:09:23.230" style="s2">spirituality and social religion relate</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.010" end="00:09:26.920" style="s2">to each other what&#39;s the nature of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.230" end="00:09:28.959" style="s2">relationship between them when they</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.920" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">bring that up is maybe you want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.959" end="00:09:33.670" style="s2">criticize this but many people today</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:36.010" style="s2">self designate in the face of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.670" end="00:09:38.589" style="s2">meeting crisis as spiritual but not</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.010" end="00:09:40.690" style="s2">religious so they try to they see these</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.589" end="00:09:43.600" style="s2">almost in the serial or at least</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.690" end="00:09:45.190" style="s2">oppositional terms and yet what you seem</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.600" end="00:09:46.990" style="s2">to be saying because you&#39;ve drawn a very</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.190" end="00:09:48.730" style="s2">strong analogy and they and they</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.990" end="00:09:50.800" style="s2">converge on religio they seem to</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.730" end="00:09:52.720" style="s2">actually be deeply interdependent in an</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.800" end="00:09:55.060" style="s2">important way so that&#39;s that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.720" end="00:09:59.290" style="s2">trying to provoke you to yeah yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.060" end="00:10:00.820" style="s2">mean if I&#39;m thinking of religion as as</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.290" end="00:10:03.250" style="s2">something that integrates all these</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.820" end="00:10:06.010" style="s2">different kinds of dimensions of social</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.250" end="00:10:08.019" style="s2">practice one of those is spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.010" end="00:10:09.550" style="s2">so there&#39;s that part of the definition</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.019" end="00:10:13.269" style="s2">but at the same time there is this</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.550" end="00:10:16.240" style="s2">analogy where people today in in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.269" end="00:10:18.040" style="s2">meeting crisis have a very they still</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:20.380" style="s2">have a pretty good sense from their own</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.040" end="00:10:22.810" style="s2">internal life that there are practices</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.380" end="00:10:24.370" style="s2">that they could do to grow to feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.810" end="00:10:26.019" style="s2">better to have transcended experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.370" end="00:10:28.110" style="s2">they&#39;re pretty confident in that but</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.019" end="00:10:30.730" style="s2">they&#39;re not confident that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.110" end="00:10:32.769" style="s2">functioning analog in the society in</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.730" end="00:10:35.620" style="s2">which they live they don&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.769" end="00:10:38.050" style="s2">coherence the sacredness of the social</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.620" end="00:10:40.750" style="s2">system so I would say that the current</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.050" end="00:10:43.209" style="s2">society isn&#39;t up to speed in that same</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.750" end="00:10:45.550" style="s2">way right we don&#39;t we need to put there</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.209" end="00:10:47.920" style="s2">arguing that there has to be a religion</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.550" end="00:10:49.269" style="s2">that incorporates the current situation</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.920" end="00:10:51.690" style="s2">and they&#39;re looking around and they see</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.269" end="00:10:54.579" style="s2">religions that maybe are the residual</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.690" end="00:10:56.199" style="s2">incorporation of previous situations but</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.579" end="00:10:58.360" style="s2">not something that handles the current</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.199" end="00:11:00.040" style="s2">situation right right so part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.360" end="00:11:02.230" style="s2">that you just focus on yourself when you</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.040" end="00:11:04.870" style="s2">don&#39;t see the social thing working right</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.230" end="00:11:07.580" style="s2">now I&#39;ve argued that that has dangers</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.870" end="00:11:09.350" style="s2">associated with it autodidact ism</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.580" end="00:11:11.420" style="s2">you know bubble echo-chamber ring and</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.350" end="00:11:14.120" style="s2">bubble chambering and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.420" end="00:11:16.010" style="s2">do you think I get the critique I get</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.120" end="00:11:19.040" style="s2">the critique that the nuns NO NES are</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.010" end="00:11:21.790" style="s2">making that there and you make it you</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.040" end="00:11:23.870" style="s2">make it sound interruptive I miss</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.790" end="00:11:25.399" style="s2">misrepresenting you that you think</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.870" end="00:11:27.649" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a needed functional</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.399" end="00:11:29.420" style="s2">relationship between the societal</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.649" end="00:11:30.920" style="s2">practices and the individual practices</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.420" end="00:11:33.110" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for them</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.920" end="00:11:35.779" style="s2">and and they&#39;re not finding them rather</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.110" end="00:11:38.029" style="s2">than there saying I don&#39;t need them like</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.779" end="00:11:39.350" style="s2">there&#39;s I&#39;m sorry I know that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.029" end="00:11:40.820" style="s2">like a nuance but there&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.350" end="00:11:41.870" style="s2">difference there there&#39;s a difference my</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.820" end="00:11:43.940" style="s2">things that you&#39;re like well what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.870" end="00:11:46.310" style="s2">saying is people who make that claim</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.940" end="00:11:47.750" style="s2">about themselves they&#39;re making the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.310" end="00:11:49.430" style="s2">critique yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.750" end="00:11:51.079" style="s2">they&#39;re saying I looked around and</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.430" end="00:11:53.690" style="s2">didn&#39;t find it it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.079" end="00:11:55.130" style="s2">adequate right and you know part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.690" end="00:11:57.050" style="s2">that&#39;s your own responsibility you</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.130" end="00:11:59.029" style="s2">should try to conceive of the religion</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.050" end="00:12:01.040" style="s2">that you could get behind not the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.029" end="00:12:06.050" style="s2">religion that you think other idiots are</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.040" end="00:12:09.350" style="s2">doing but it isn&#39;t largely there right</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.050" end="00:12:11.060" style="s2">there isn&#39;t the engine of social</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.350" end="00:12:12.920" style="s2">coherence to the degree that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.060" end="00:12:15.800" style="s2">producing a shared experience of</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.920" end="00:12:17.810" style="s2">apotheosis that gives us a sense of the</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.810" end="00:12:22.579" style="s2">situation that we face people are</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.790" end="00:12:24.740" style="s2">suffering that lack and so I&#39;m spiritual</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.740" end="00:12:28.070" style="s2">into flow States I know there&#39;s meaning</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.480" end="00:12:30.800" style="s2">in my life and I know there&#39;s practices</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.070" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">that will help I don&#39;t see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.800" end="00:12:34.550" style="s2">success on the social front so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.720" end="00:12:36.709" style="s2">withdrawing I&#39;m skeptical and making</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.550" end="00:12:38.390" style="s2">that critique but I think the point of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.709" end="00:12:40.459" style="s2">that critique is that they are looking</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.390" end="00:12:42.140" style="s2">to it they&#39;re longing for it I think you</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.459" end="00:12:44.000" style="s2">know it&#39;s need yeah I think the data</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.140" end="00:12:45.980" style="s2">bears that out the problem of course</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.000" end="00:12:48.829" style="s2">when you have that you know that atomic</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.980" end="00:12:50.810" style="s2">spirituality is the meaning that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.829" end="00:12:52.699" style="s2">meaning that this existential meaning</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.810" end="00:12:55.160" style="s2">has virtually no impact on your</p>

<p begin="00:12:55.160" end="00:12:59.149" style="s2">could or you or your communal meaning so</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.560" end="00:13:01.790" style="s2">these meanings that should be deeply</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.149" end="00:13:03.470" style="s2">inter penetrating into reporting become</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.790" end="00:13:06.740" style="s2">segregated from each other in kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.470" end="00:13:09.170" style="s2">dysfunctional way uh so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.740" end="00:13:11.180" style="s2">here&#39;s the question then that I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.170" end="00:13:14.720" style="s2">immediately comes to mind well two</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.180" end="00:13:16.970" style="s2">questions that one is one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.720" end="00:13:19.820" style="s2">I&#39;ve said that social systems are not</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.970" end="00:13:21.790" style="s2">providing us that would tend to stitch</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.820" end="00:13:25.250" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.790" end="00:13:28.010" style="s2">the individual and the social our wisdom</p>

<p begin="00:13:28.010" end="00:13:34.700" style="s2">any of those in the West in in any kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.720" end="00:13:37.190" style="s2">of way that is consonant with other</p>

<p begin="00:13:37.190" end="00:13:41.870" style="s2">systems like you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.930" end="00:13:44.690" style="s2">obviously science that makes epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.870" end="00:13:47.899" style="s2">as epistemic claims on us that cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.690" end="00:13:50.540" style="s2">ignored I&#39;m not offering scientism I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.899" end="00:13:54.260" style="s2">saying that you know you you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.540" end="00:13:56.750" style="s2">pretend that science isn&#39;t important in</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.260" end="00:13:58.519" style="s2">your epistemic life you can&#39;t pretend</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.750" end="00:14:00.290" style="s2">without engaging in self-deception you</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.519" end="00:14:02.329" style="s2">have the market of course that you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.290" end="00:14:03.890" style="s2">and Thomas Bjorkman is made of a really</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.329" end="00:14:06.529" style="s2">good case that that&#39;s now become our</p>

<p begin="00:14:08.149" end="00:14:12.260" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing right now in the current</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.290" end="00:14:14.829" style="s2">crisis the co vid crisis that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.260" end="00:14:17.390" style="s2">markets useless for this incredibly</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.390" end="00:14:22.550" style="s2">pointing out it needs a socio-cultural</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.649" end="00:14:24.680" style="s2">response not just the social cultural</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.550" end="00:14:27.140" style="s2">political response not just a market</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.680" end="00:14:30.500" style="s2">response so you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve got that</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.140" end="00:14:31.850" style="s2">we don&#39;t have the wisdom traditions that</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.500" end="00:14:34.610" style="s2">have the Qing same kind of normative</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.850" end="00:14:38.930" style="s2">status as the market or science for</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.610" end="00:14:42.709" style="s2">example or the political arena and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.930" end="00:14:44.660" style="s2">we also have perhaps exacerbating that</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.709" end="00:14:46.760" style="s2">or interacting with that is we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.660" end="00:14:48.279" style="s2">a very pluralistic world now</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.760" end="00:14:51.079" style="s2">I mean this is part of what went into</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.279" end="00:14:52.899" style="s2">the many different and they shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.079" end="00:14:55.579" style="s2">conflated but the many different</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.899" end="00:14:58.579" style="s2">postmodern critiques often priests</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.579" end="00:15:01.070" style="s2">suppose I&#39;m in a very powerful way a</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.579" end="00:15:04.430" style="s2">deep kind of epistemic and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.070" end="00:15:07.100" style="s2">even ontological pluralism and so the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.430" end="00:15:08.720" style="s2">question is without so what the two</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.100" end="00:15:10.990" style="s2">together without you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.720" end="00:15:14.570" style="s2">well-established wisdom traditions and</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.990" end="00:15:17.720" style="s2">without and with within an increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.570" end="00:15:20.209" style="s2">pluralistic world how do we get that</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.720" end="00:15:21.980" style="s2">social cohesion that is so central to</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.209" end="00:15:24.680" style="s2">religion sorry that was a long question</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.980" end="00:15:27.199" style="s2">but it was there&#39;s a lot I wanted to put</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.680" end="00:15:30.020" style="s2">into it sure it&#39;s a long question and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.199" end="00:15:31.310" style="s2">it&#39;s a huge topic yeah I think the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.020" end="00:15:33.290" style="s2">answers will come from all different</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.310" end="00:15:34.910" style="s2">kinds of directions one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.290" end="00:15:36.830" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.910" end="00:15:38.930" style="s2">the relationship between modern systems</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.830" end="00:15:41.260" style="s2">and the different kinds of postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.930" end="00:15:43.760" style="s2">intelligences that have arisen over time</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.260" end="00:15:45.590" style="s2">one of the things I think obviously</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.760" end="00:15:47.930" style="s2">culturally that we&#39;re suffering from is</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.590" end="00:15:50.240" style="s2">our institutions aren&#39;t up to the level</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.930" end="00:15:52.580" style="s2">of our insights at the moment yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.240" end="00:15:55.280" style="s2">modern institutions have given us a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.580" end="00:15:57.860" style="s2">of really good things but they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.280" end="00:15:58.760" style="s2">handle accumulating dangers and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.860" end="00:16:01.940" style="s2">surprises</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.760" end="00:16:03.500" style="s2">right our current kind of democracy in</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.940" end="00:16:05.840" style="s2">our current kind of economic market</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.500" end="00:16:07.760" style="s2">can&#39;t prepare for an asteroid strike yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.840" end="00:16:09.740" style="s2">have difficulty preparing for pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.760" end="00:16:12.700" style="s2">it&#39;s not handling the ecological thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.740" end="00:16:15.890" style="s2">so there needs to be an upgrade of our</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.700" end="00:16:17.600" style="s2">governance and social systems to get on</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.890" end="00:16:19.760" style="s2">board with some kind of progressive</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.600" end="00:16:21.260" style="s2">insight that that&#39;s sort of the bare</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.760" end="00:16:24.740" style="s2">minimum we need to do collectively</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.260" end="00:16:27.020" style="s2">and I think a lot of people&#39;s passion</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.740" end="00:16:29.900" style="s2">for progressive politics when they get</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.020" end="00:16:32.000" style="s2">into that it is a sign of a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.900" end="00:16:34.040" style="s2">quasi religious awakening they know</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.000" end="00:16:36.320" style="s2">there&#39;s something down that road we</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.040" end="00:16:39.740" style="s2">could get to if we could get our systems</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.320" end="00:16:41.000" style="s2">in line with our best insights now but</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.740" end="00:16:45.020" style="s2">the other part of what you said was the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.000" end="00:16:49.190" style="s2">science part and I think religion has</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.020" end="00:16:51.890" style="s2">always in folded science and the modern</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.190" end="00:16:53.480" style="s2">critique was that pre-modern science is</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.890" end="00:16:56.570" style="s2">not adequate and that&#39;s an absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.480" end="00:16:58.880" style="s2">appropriate modern critique yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.570" end="00:17:01.130" style="s2">know shamanism Paleolithic shamanism</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.880" end="00:17:02.930" style="s2">involved Paleolithic science traditional</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.130" end="00:17:04.850" style="s2">religion involved traditional science</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.930" end="00:17:07.189" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a reason there was such a</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.850" end="00:17:09.709" style="s2">strong solidarity between Aristotle in</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.189" end="00:17:11.180" style="s2">the church you know right now that was</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.709" end="00:17:12.740" style="s2">the science they could get behind and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.180" end="00:17:17.300" style="s2">they cultivated and protected that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.740" end="00:17:18.410" style="s2">science so at every stage of social and</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.300" end="00:17:20.870" style="s2">technological and knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.410" end="00:17:22.790" style="s2">sophistication we have a new thing to</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.870" end="00:17:24.740" style="s2">integrate into our definition of</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.790" end="00:17:26.839" style="s2">religious cohesion at that level right</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.740" end="00:17:28.910" style="s2">right oh if we&#39;re not doing that now</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.839" end="00:17:31.220" style="s2">then we&#39;re not getting religion ization</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.910" end="00:17:33.800" style="s2">of the current cultural knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.220" end="00:17:35.300" style="s2">situation that we have mm-hmm so then of</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.800" end="00:17:37.790" style="s2">course we&#39;re not producing the extra</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.300" end="00:17:39.790" style="s2">then we&#39;re not internalizing the extra</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.790" end="00:17:42.200" style="s2">we&#39;re not being mobilised by the extra</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.790" end="00:17:45.140" style="s2">it&#39;s not happening if we&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.200" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">folding science that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.140" end="00:17:49.980" style="s2">point now that that that again</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:53.580" style="s2">I want to throw in the mix that very</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.980" end="00:17:55.830" style="s2">often especially your example Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.580" end="00:17:58.260" style="s2">in the church philosophy has played an</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.830" end="00:18:00.720" style="s2">important mediating role between the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.260" end="00:18:03.450" style="s2">science and the religion in getting that</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.720" end="00:18:04.650" style="s2">envelop meant to occur and that this</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.450" end="00:18:06.870" style="s2">again is where I&#39;m concerned that</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.650" end="00:18:09.350" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have wisdom traditions</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.870" end="00:18:12.090" style="s2">and we don&#39;t have people cultivating a</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.350" end="00:18:14.580" style="s2">capacity for insight and innovation at</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.090" end="00:18:16.890" style="s2">you know a metaphysical or ontological</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.580" end="00:18:18.390" style="s2">level that that unfoldment you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.890" end="00:18:22.590" style="s2">talking about is very very challenging</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.390" end="00:18:24.030" style="s2">for us so what I typically see with</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.590" end="00:18:26.549" style="s2">response to the scientific worldview</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.030" end="00:18:27.870" style="s2">from religious people one is denial and</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.549" end="00:18:30.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of fundamentalism or</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.870" end="00:18:34.140" style="s2">literalism and I think that&#39;s a dead end</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.000" end="00:18:35.820" style="s2">that&#39;s not going to go anywhere uh and</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.140" end="00:18:38.400" style="s2">then I think and then I see people</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.820" end="00:18:39.929" style="s2">adopting a kind of romanticism while</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.400" end="00:18:42.240" style="s2">science deals with the facts and</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.929" end="00:18:43.620" style="s2">religion deals with feelings or meaning</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.240" end="00:18:45.299" style="s2">and there&#39;s some truth to that but</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.620" end="00:18:47.460" style="s2">that&#39;s not going to get what you want</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.299" end="00:18:51.750" style="s2">it&#39;s not gonna get that mutual enfold</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.460" end="00:18:54.110" style="s2">Minh and then I see you know people</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.750" end="00:18:57.150" style="s2">within the theological and philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.110" end="00:18:58.830" style="s2">arena trying to do what you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.150" end="00:19:00.570" style="s2">trying to figure an art do there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.830" end="00:19:02.850" style="s2">ways in which my work is trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.570" end="00:19:05.880" style="s2">that how can we get a spirituality that</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.850" end="00:19:08.160" style="s2">is consonant and can unfold you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.880" end="00:19:11.730" style="s2">follow from and unfold that scientific</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.160" end="00:19:14.460" style="s2">worldview and and the difficulty I see</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.730" end="00:19:16.440" style="s2">with that is there seems to be less a</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.460" end="00:19:18.540" style="s2">critique that&#39;s often made of my work so</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.440" end="00:19:19.710" style="s2">I use my work as an example but I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.540" end="00:19:21.540" style="s2">it would apply to the other people and</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.710" end="00:19:24.960" style="s2">referring to is there&#39;s a scalability</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.540" end="00:19:27.179" style="s2">issue that these attempts to see that</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.960" end="00:19:29.250" style="s2">what Christianity brilliantly did you</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.179" end="00:19:30.150" style="s2">know you know between you know a couple</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.250" end="00:19:32.970" style="s2">of geniuses</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.150" end="00:19:35.220" style="s2">you know Agustin on one end and Aquinas</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.970" end="00:19:37.230" style="s2">on the other is they they figured out</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.220" end="00:19:40.320" style="s2">how to do that unfold meant but do it in</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.230" end="00:19:44.070" style="s2">a way that could plug into you know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.320" end="00:19:45.660" style="s2">the cultural permutation and / you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.070" end="00:19:49.620" style="s2">the and and the way the culture</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.660" end="00:19:52.500" style="s2">permeates you know lives at all</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.620" end="00:19:54.840" style="s2">different scales and and make that work</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.500" end="00:19:56.760" style="s2">and so the the challenge and then again</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.840" end="00:19:58.530" style="s2">here&#39;s where the pluralism you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.760" end="00:19:59.940" style="s2">makes it difficult right because at</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.530" end="00:20:01.020" style="s2">least the church had christened them to</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.940" end="00:20:04.770" style="s2">work with</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.020" end="00:20:06.870" style="s2">right is how do we get that mutual</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.770" end="00:20:08.250" style="s2">unfoldment which I agree with you I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.870" end="00:20:10.140" style="s2">obviously I do that my little series is</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.250" end="00:20:12.330" style="s2">around it in some ways how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.140" end="00:20:14.250" style="s2">that involvement to work in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.330" end="00:20:16.740" style="s2">scalable this is you know one of Paul</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.250" end="00:20:19.110" style="s2">bender clays ongoing and completely</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.740" end="00:20:21.870" style="s2">legitimate criticisms of me how do we</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.110" end="00:20:24.540" style="s2">make it scalable especially scalable</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.870" end="00:20:26.930" style="s2">within a multi-cultural kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.540" end="00:20:30.420" style="s2">situation because we can&#39;t rely on</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.930" end="00:20:34.440" style="s2">background cultural framework to do the</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.420" end="00:20:38.420" style="s2">scaffolding for us yeah how do we make</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.440" end="00:20:41.640" style="s2">it scalable and scalable at a tempo</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.420" end="00:20:43.800" style="s2">adequate to meet our needs yes yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.640" end="00:20:46.860" style="s2">well Christianity was scalable but it</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.800" end="00:20:48.360" style="s2">took a thousand years yeah yeah yes and</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.860" end="00:20:50.550" style="s2">this is Jordan halls point again and</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.360" end="00:20:53.610" style="s2">again and again right it&#39;s not only that</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.550" end="00:20:55.140" style="s2">things are happening more quickly the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.610" end="00:20:58.140" style="s2">rate at which they&#39;re happening more</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.140" end="00:21:01.380" style="s2">quickly is also speeding up right so</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.140" end="00:21:05.310" style="s2">it&#39;s got to be whatever it is has to go</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.380" end="00:21:07.590" style="s2">fast enough and also be updatable enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.310" end="00:21:10.020" style="s2">to go faster if it needs to yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.590" end="00:21:13.770" style="s2">one of the things we look at our systems</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.020" end="00:21:16.980" style="s2">failing we&#39;re constantly electing people</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.770" end="00:21:18.480" style="s2">who say that they understand the problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.980" end="00:21:19.800" style="s2">and are going to address it but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.480" end="00:21:21.840" style="s2">going to do it in moderate or</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.800" end="00:21:24.930" style="s2">incremental forms and that sounds very</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.840" end="00:21:26.700" style="s2">reasonable yeah balanced people it</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.930" end="00:21:29.100" style="s2">sounds true that&#39;s what you want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.700" end="00:21:31.620" style="s2">at the same time if you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.100" end="00:21:33.360" style="s2">moderately bail out a boat and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.620" end="00:21:35.010" style="s2">filling up with water faster than you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.360" end="00:21:38.460" style="s2">bailing it out then that&#39;s not even a</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.010" end="00:21:40.650" style="s2">plan yet no no it&#39;s a matter of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.460" end="00:21:43.650" style="s2">tempo being adequate to the moment and</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.650" end="00:21:45.630" style="s2">and the scale of the aspiration has to</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.650" end="00:21:48.030" style="s2">be the starting point I think oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.630" end="00:21:49.560" style="s2">not even saying that we want to address</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.030" end="00:21:51.870" style="s2">it at that scale then we&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.560" end="00:21:54.240" style="s2">get anywhere right but then the problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.870" end="00:21:57.360" style="s2">of actually scaling up remains right</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.240" end="00:21:59.280" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of individual attempts</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:22:02.220" style="s2">right and science is full of people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.280" end="00:22:04.650" style="s2">are spiritual about their science yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.220" end="00:22:07.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of interpersonal practice</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.650" end="00:22:10.590" style="s2">methodologies there&#39;s a lot of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.770" end="00:22:12.420" style="s2">about how you refine systems to be more</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.590" end="00:22:14.700" style="s2">intelligent and I think that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.420" end="00:22:17.660" style="s2">where you need to go right</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.700" end="00:22:19.890" style="s2">smarter voting system you need a smarter</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.660" end="00:22:22.130" style="s2">legislature you need a smarter market</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.890" end="00:22:25.380" style="s2">you need something whose objective</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.130" end="00:22:28.050" style="s2">interpersonal sophistication parallels</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.380" end="00:22:29.490" style="s2">the intensity of the shared mutual</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.050" end="00:22:32.910" style="s2">experience that we&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.490" end="00:22:35.850" style="s2">right right oh how do you implement that</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.910" end="00:22:38.460" style="s2">he&#39;d have a lot of shared interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.850" end="00:22:39.630" style="s2">confidence to get a movement going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.460" end="00:22:41.790" style="s2">make that change</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.630" end="00:22:43.290" style="s2">who&#39;s leverage would scale the system up</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.790" end="00:22:45.750" style="s2">to a degree that would match that</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.290" end="00:22:47.640" style="s2">interpersonal experience that was really</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.750" end="00:22:49.320" style="s2">good the point you made about you the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.640" end="00:22:53.250" style="s2">way you need this tight connection</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.320" end="00:22:54.240" style="s2">correspondence between you said</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.250" end="00:22:57.390" style="s2">something like your interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.240" end="00:23:00.300" style="s2">sophistication right and um the you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.390" end="00:23:02.970" style="s2">the the overflow that you&#39;re seeking</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.300" end="00:23:04.280" style="s2">that would give people so the it feels</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.970" end="00:23:07.110" style="s2">like a bit of a chicken and egg problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.280" end="00:23:08.970" style="s2">it feels like people are gonna have the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.110" end="00:23:10.800" style="s2">confidence when they get the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.970" end="00:23:12.840" style="s2">the overflow but they won&#39;t get the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.800" end="00:23:15.000" style="s2">sense of overflow until they have the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.840" end="00:23:16.430" style="s2">confidence and that&#39;s kind of it feels</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.000" end="00:23:18.300" style="s2">like that&#39;s the kind of the catch-22</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.430" end="00:23:19.710" style="s2">that we&#39;re about that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.300" end="00:23:22.410" style="s2">trying to do this religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.710" end="00:23:25.200" style="s2">religion it&#39;s trying to use you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.410" end="00:23:28.620" style="s2">trying to break that catch-22 in an</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.200" end="00:23:31.440" style="s2">important way yeah absolutely and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.620" end="00:23:33.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason why it hasn&#39;t happened</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.440" end="00:23:35.310" style="s2">yet yeah it&#39;s because it has that</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.750" end="00:23:36.030" style="s2">structure it&#39;s not easy you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.310" end="00:23:38.130" style="s2">where to start</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.030" end="00:23:39.390" style="s2">right and when you&#39;re starting over here</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.130" end="00:23:40.980" style="s2">it&#39;s forwarding you here if you start</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.390" end="00:23:43.140" style="s2">over there it&#39;s thwarting you here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.980" end="00:23:44.760" style="s2">yeah yeah lots of people have to make</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.140" end="00:23:47.130" style="s2">attempts to start from a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.760" end="00:23:48.570" style="s2">different angles yes time in order to</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.130" end="00:23:50.880" style="s2">see if we can get that momentum going</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.570" end="00:23:53.850" style="s2">and religion without a religion is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.880" end="00:23:56.960" style="s2">terrific project and in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.850" end="00:23:59.310" style="s2">what religion has always been yeah mine</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.960" end="00:24:01.350" style="s2">90% of all religions didn&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.310" end="00:24:04.730" style="s2">themselves as religions we call them</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.350" end="00:24:08.040" style="s2">that in hindsight yes yes they were</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.730" end="00:24:10.050" style="s2">collective spiritualizing attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.040" end="00:24:12.000" style="s2">grapple with the world that they lived</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.050" end="00:24:14.520" style="s2">in successfully and more than</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.000" end="00:24:16.530" style="s2">successfully so that it paid them back</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.520" end="00:24:22.200" style="s2">in a sense of transcendental meaning</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.530" end="00:24:23.580" style="s2">yeah so I I suppose this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.200" end="00:24:25.830" style="s2">self-promotional but it nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.580" end="00:24:27.660" style="s2">seems independently relevant the project</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.830" end="00:24:28.440" style="s2">I&#39;m engaging in with you know Jordan</p>

<p begin="00:24:31.800" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">and also we do we&#39;ve had a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.570" end="00:24:37.350" style="s2">around this the whole deal logos project</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:40.260" style="s2">about trying to bring back dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.350" end="00:24:42.450" style="s2">precisely because it was a you know a</p>

<p begin="00:24:42.450" end="00:24:46.230" style="s2">there was an individual spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.950" end="00:24:47.760" style="s2">component of self transcendence that was</p>

<p begin="00:24:50.340" end="00:24:54.060" style="s2">would cut which would activate you know</p>

<p begin="00:24:58.350" end="00:25:04.740" style="s2">collective wisdom so I see the project</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.190" end="00:25:07.110" style="s2">that the dialectic that affords dia</p>

<p begin="00:27:12.710" end="00:27:16.580" style="s2">what Agnes kahlert says about aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.510" end="00:27:20.870" style="s2">you have to be drawn into it by a kind</p>

<p begin="00:27:48.550" end="00:27:55.700" style="s2">my my proposal is one significant way of</p>

<p begin="00:28:12.950" end="00:28:17.420" style="s2">and and i know you&#39;ve read or at least</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.500" end="00:28:19.700" style="s2">the chapter that Chris and I have</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.420" end="00:28:22.850" style="s2">written and I wonder like is that that</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.700" end="00:28:24.020" style="s2">is that something that you see as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.850" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">not trying to call you into advertising</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.020" end="00:28:29.030" style="s2">I want an honest answer from you this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:31.190" style="s2">a discussion like do you see how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.030" end="00:28:32.720" style="s2">trying to situate this and how I know</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.190" end="00:28:35.300" style="s2">what I want some sort of reflective</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.720" end="00:28:39.440" style="s2">comment on that project and the degree</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.300" end="00:28:41.150" style="s2">to which you it might be useful some</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.440" end="00:28:42.770" style="s2">pitfalls surrounding it ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.150" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t claim it&#39;s exhaustive</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.770" end="00:28:45.800" style="s2">so obviously what needs to supplement it</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:47.510" style="s2">what needs to go around it</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.800" end="00:28:50.420" style="s2">sorry that was another big question but</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.510" end="00:28:52.850" style="s2">you know this is very slight eek I talk</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.420" end="00:28:55.820" style="s2">to catch-22 problem I take the catch-22</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.850" end="00:28:57.950" style="s2">problem and the intensification</p>

<p begin="00:29:09.070" end="00:29:13.729" style="s2">here&#39;s what I would say is I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.690" end="00:29:16.039" style="s2">think that&#39;s in some ways the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.729" end="00:29:19.999" style="s2">project for the technological moment</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.039" end="00:29:21.409" style="s2">right a lot of this goes back to McLuhan</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.999" end="00:29:24.489" style="s2">and the fact that we&#39;re transitioning</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.409" end="00:29:27.259" style="s2">away from the book culture to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.489" end="00:29:29.960" style="s2">interaction digital interaction culture</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.259" end="00:29:32.629" style="s2">that has to be the premise now rather</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.960" end="00:29:34.609" style="s2">than I agree about the book it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.629" end="00:29:36.049" style="s2">an exchange based culture because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.609" end="00:29:38.239" style="s2">what we&#39;re immersed in so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.049" end="00:29:40.940" style="s2">appropriate to that but it&#39;s also I</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.239" end="00:29:43.340" style="s2">agree it&#39;s a large part of what the wise</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.940" end="00:29:46.190" style="s2">the wisdom friends were doing back in</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.340" end="00:29:48.409" style="s2">the day right and so there does need to</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.190" end="00:29:51.289" style="s2">be this process where faith is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.409" end="00:29:53.539" style="s2">output not the initial requirements</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.289" end="00:29:56.149" style="s2">right you show up to get you show up to</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.539" end="00:29:58.460" style="s2">religion to get faithful not because you</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.149" end="00:30:00.739" style="s2">already can prove your faith right right</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.460" end="00:30:03.049" style="s2">you need to be seduced in right there</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.739" end="00:30:05.029" style="s2">has to be a low barrier to entry same as</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.049" end="00:30:07.129" style="s2">a video game yeah I people are working</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.029" end="00:30:09.799" style="s2">on video games which is I&#39;m gonna give</p>

<p begin="00:30:12.830" end="00:30:16.429" style="s2">to sell it to you we have to make it</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.239" end="00:30:19.460" style="s2">easy well yeah the boardroom try to</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.429" end="00:30:21.559" style="s2">figure out how to get you in right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.460" end="00:30:23.659" style="s2">voting could be done that way too if we</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.559" end="00:30:25.999" style="s2">really wanted people to vote yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.659" end="00:30:27.979" style="s2">so there&#39;s a series of practices where</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.999" end="00:30:30.789" style="s2">it&#39;s got to be really easy upfront and</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.979" end="00:30:34.999" style="s2">at the and at some point you are</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.789" end="00:30:37.249" style="s2">accumulating faithfulness mmm and down</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.999" end="00:30:41.450" style="s2">the line you have to be able to output</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.249" end="00:30:43.159" style="s2">that into systems and practices to some</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.450" end="00:30:45.859" style="s2">degree right it&#39;s got to make that shift</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.159" end="00:30:47.570" style="s2">from I&#39;m having personal experience</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.859" end="00:30:49.249" style="s2">we&#39;re having interpersonal experience</p>

<p begin="00:30:49.249" end="00:30:54.409" style="s2">that translate into structures okay to</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.919" end="00:30:57.979" style="s2">verify your level of sophistication we</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.409" end="00:31:01.399" style="s2">need in our systems now the the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.979" end="00:31:03.590" style="s2">caution in my mind is to make sure we</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.399" end="00:31:07.190" style="s2">don&#39;t mistake the interests objective</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.590" end="00:31:09.810" style="s2">for the sacral izing per se right right</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.190" end="00:31:11.430" style="s2">because yep</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.810" end="00:31:14.310" style="s2">because there&#39;s an us doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.430" end="00:31:17.370" style="s2">there&#39;s an i thou mode yet yeah the I</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.310" end="00:31:19.860" style="s2">thou mode is a we are actually producing</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.370" end="00:31:22.230" style="s2">this extra quality within the US and</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.860" end="00:31:25.770" style="s2">that same extra quality can be produced</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.230" end="00:31:28.980" style="s2">subjectively or with objects right I can</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.770" end="00:31:31.380" style="s2">consecrate my experience of things so</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.980" end="00:31:33.180" style="s2">it&#39;s not that we&#39;re trapped in the I it</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.380" end="00:31:34.530" style="s2">relationship and looking at objects and</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.180" end="00:31:36.900" style="s2">we have to escape that into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.530" end="00:31:39.180" style="s2">interpersonal domain all of these</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.900" end="00:31:40.980" style="s2">domains need to be studied in such a</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.180" end="00:31:44.700" style="s2">ways that they can be brought up to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.980" end="00:31:47.430" style="s2">level of its production and then the use</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.700" end="00:31:49.770" style="s2">of the produced numinous quality right</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.430" end="00:31:54.270" style="s2">that&#39;s fantastic that&#39;s very good point</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.770" end="00:31:55.800" style="s2">and this goes towards something that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.270" end="00:31:57.150" style="s2">and I talked about last time I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.800" end="00:32:01.200" style="s2">you&#39;re alluding to it you know the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.150" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">concern about when this is really</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.200" end="00:32:05.430" style="s2">working as opposed to when people are in</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:07.020" style="s2">some sense faking it now we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.430" end="00:32:08.610" style="s2">careful about this because you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.020" end="00:32:11.100" style="s2">people often have to fake it to make it</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.610" end="00:32:12.810" style="s2">kind of saying they have to play in</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.100" end="00:32:15.120" style="s2">order before they have to do serious</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.810" end="00:32:17.190" style="s2">play before they could actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.120" end="00:32:19.170" style="s2">make the transformation so we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.190" end="00:32:21.900" style="s2">very careful about that but like I heard</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.170" end="00:32:23.070" style="s2">that that implicit critique in what you</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.900" end="00:32:25.140" style="s2">were just saying and you&#39;ve made it</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.070" end="00:32:26.220" style="s2">explicitly to me before maybe you want</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.140" end="00:32:28.260" style="s2">to address that too because I know</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.220" end="00:32:31.410" style="s2">you&#39;ve also you&#39;ve got you know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.260" end="00:32:34.980" style="s2">got you&#39;ve expressed concerns about and</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.410" end="00:32:38.940" style="s2">I I agree with them because not only is</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.980" end="00:32:41.420" style="s2">there an analogue to sort of individual</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.940" end="00:32:43.860" style="s2">spirituality at the collective level</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.420" end="00:32:46.200" style="s2">there&#39;s an analog to self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.860" end="00:32:50.220" style="s2">right and people there&#39;s ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.200" end="00:32:51.300" style="s2">these group dynamics can fall in yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.220" end="00:32:53.490" style="s2">you know you have diffusion of</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.300" end="00:32:56.150" style="s2">responsibility is a classic example of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.490" end="00:32:58.170" style="s2">how collective systems can really</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.150" end="00:33:00.540" style="s2">maladaptive ly make their individual</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.170" end="00:33:02.670" style="s2">members perform things like that so we</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.540" end="00:33:04.350" style="s2">know about a lot of negative biasing</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.670" end="00:33:06.480" style="s2">effects that also exist at the</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.350" end="00:33:07.860" style="s2">collective level and and I&#39;m bringing</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.480" end="00:33:09.840" style="s2">this up on your behalf because you</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.860" end="00:33:12.690" style="s2">actually made this point to me which was</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.840" end="00:33:16.620" style="s2">well what what are we gonna like how do</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.690" end="00:33:19.200" style="s2">we take care of the shepherding and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.620" end="00:33:23.370" style="s2">curating and cultivating of the overflow</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.200" end="00:33:23.610" style="s2">and and as you said it&#39;s got extend out</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.370" end="00:33:26.070" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.610" end="00:33:28.680" style="s2">to many of our existential dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.070" end="00:33:30.780" style="s2">not just the interest objective but</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.680" end="00:33:32.400" style="s2">totally onboard with that but that just</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.780" end="00:33:35.190" style="s2">sort of ramps up the question which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.400" end="00:33:39.150" style="s2">okay then we got to be really careful</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.190" end="00:33:41.670" style="s2">about also sensitizing ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.150" end="00:33:43.890" style="s2">collective patterns of self deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.670" end="00:33:46.710" style="s2">self-destructive behavior and I know</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.890" end="00:33:48.840" style="s2">that was a concern you expressed quite</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.710" end="00:33:50.370" style="s2">powerfully to me last time so I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.840" end="00:33:53.430" style="s2">to give you a chance to address that</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.370" end="00:33:56.270" style="s2">well whether or not I remember what I</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.430" end="00:33:57.510" style="s2">said last time is an open question but</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.270" end="00:33:59.760" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.510" end="00:34:03.000" style="s2">upfront fake it till you make it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.760" end="00:34:06.240" style="s2">a lot of flexibility and openness in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.000" end="00:34:08.370" style="s2">foyer of the process on board and you</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.240" end="00:34:10.020" style="s2">know the less you require of them</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.370" end="00:34:12.780" style="s2">upfront the more you can get them into</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.020" end="00:34:15.690" style="s2">that system and to scale up it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.780" end="00:34:17.670" style="s2">really easy for people to get in yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.690" end="00:34:20.130" style="s2">otherwise it&#39;ll remain you know an</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.670" end="00:34:22.050" style="s2">esoteric Enclave yeah yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.130" end="00:34:26.220" style="s2">a very good point so there&#39;s that aspect</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.050" end="00:34:28.890" style="s2">but there&#39;s also the aspect of not</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.220" end="00:34:30.690" style="s2">fooling ourselves with intersubjective</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.890" end="00:34:31.830" style="s2">epiphany because they&#39;re very real and</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.690" end="00:34:33.210" style="s2">they&#39;re very important and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.830" end="00:34:34.110" style="s2">something people should be working on</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.210" end="00:34:36.540" style="s2">doing more of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.110" end="00:34:39.020" style="s2">we should be getting depth skill in that</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.540" end="00:34:43.730" style="s2">area right we shouldn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.020" end="00:34:47.400" style="s2">mistake inter subjective epiphany for</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.730" end="00:34:49.680" style="s2">capacity to enact things as a group ah I</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.400" end="00:34:50.550" style="s2">say that&#39;s that was a point heart yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.680" end="00:34:52.830" style="s2">that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.550" end="00:34:55.260" style="s2">that was the point now I&#39;m glad I posed</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.830" end="00:34:56.850" style="s2">my very long I think I&#39;ve had this</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.260" end="00:34:58.920" style="s2">experience maybe you have is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.850" end="00:35:01.410" style="s2">lots of really interesting practices</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.920" end="00:35:03.210" style="s2">where people can get together and they</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.410" end="00:35:04.890" style="s2">can work through their stuff in a way</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.210" end="00:35:07.290" style="s2">and they move around they get a</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.890" end="00:35:10.920" style="s2">collective hi and I think they</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.290" end="00:35:13.170" style="s2">legitimately are sharing a transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.920" end="00:35:15.960" style="s2">together yeah but they don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.170" end="00:35:18.030" style="s2">solve a problem they don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.960" end="00:35:20.310" style="s2">change it doesn&#39;t necessarily become a</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.030" end="00:35:22.230" style="s2">new way of living yeah that&#39;s what has</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.310" end="00:35:24.810" style="s2">to happen for it to affect the outside</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.230" end="00:35:26.700" style="s2">world while we know that there are</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.810" end="00:35:28.950" style="s2">different ways of organizing groups of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.700" end="00:35:31.110" style="s2">people where you can get results that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.950" end="00:35:32.760" style="s2">are smarter than the individuals in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.110" end="00:35:34.440" style="s2">group or results that are much worse</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.760" end="00:35:36.990" style="s2">than the individuals in the group and</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.440" end="00:35:39.900" style="s2">often that&#39;s somewhat into</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.990" end="00:35:42.119" style="s2">pennant of how they feel a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.900" end="00:35:44.340" style="s2">have schemes for solving problems that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.119" end="00:35:48.030" style="s2">involve everybody feeling terrible and</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.340" end="00:35:50.970" style="s2">dissociated not ideal but it does happen</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.030" end="00:35:52.980" style="s2">right so there&#39;s there&#39;s a difference</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.970" end="00:35:56.910" style="s2">between these two and we have to respect</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.980" end="00:35:59.160" style="s2">them observe their distinction tease</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.910" end="00:36:01.650" style="s2">them apart in order to think about how</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.160" end="00:36:04.530" style="s2">they can be better interactive together</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.650" end="00:36:05.910" style="s2">you know that was excellent I&#39;m glad I</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.530" end="00:36:07.890" style="s2">asked the question because that not</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.910" end="00:36:09.690" style="s2">really first of all that&#39;s what you said</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.890" end="00:36:12.119" style="s2">last time and then you I think you</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.690" end="00:36:14.430" style="s2">actually explicate it very concisely and</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.119" end="00:36:16.320" style="s2">clearly now this has been one of my</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.430" end="00:36:17.940" style="s2">standing critiques and it&#39;s been well</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.320" end="00:36:21.030" style="s2">received by the way by people like Dai</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.940" end="00:36:22.710" style="s2">and there&#39;s that a lot of these interest</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.030" end="00:36:24.930" style="s2">objective interpersonal communication</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.710" end="00:36:28.230" style="s2">practices are all about sort of getting</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.930" end="00:36:30.540" style="s2">that enhanced flow the collective flow</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.230" end="00:36:33.090" style="s2">state and bringing about all of what you</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.540" end="00:36:35.700" style="s2">said but there&#39;s no problem there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.090" end="00:36:38.240" style="s2">topic there&#39;s no problem and this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.700" end="00:36:42.140" style="s2">what I say that often the follow the</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.240" end="00:36:44.160" style="s2">follow Sofia is missing right there</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.140" end="00:36:45.480" style="s2">we&#39;re not talking about like a technical</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.160" end="00:36:47.490" style="s2">problem like you know should we buy more</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.480" end="00:36:49.200" style="s2">eggs or something like that well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.490" end="00:36:52.109" style="s2">talking about you know the deep problems</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:54.770" style="s2">like you say about ways of life like</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.109" end="00:36:58.109" style="s2">bringing out in a philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.770" end="00:37:00.510" style="s2">problematic form ways of life ways of</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.109" end="00:37:02.070" style="s2">being and wrestling with those problems</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.510" end="00:37:03.720" style="s2">a lot of these problems it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.070" end="00:37:05.850" style="s2">property it&#39;s not proper to say you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.720" end="00:37:07.650" style="s2">solve them because they&#39;re there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.850" end="00:37:10.530" style="s2">there issues about the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.650" end="00:37:13.859" style="s2">nature of human being in the face of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.530" end="00:37:16.200" style="s2">mystery of of being and so but what we</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.859" end="00:37:18.660" style="s2">can get is we can get we can wrestle</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.200" end="00:37:20.190" style="s2">with these problems the way we see you</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.660" end="00:37:22.410" style="s2">know Socrates and Plato wrestling with</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.190" end="00:37:24.330" style="s2">them or the Buddha wrestling with them</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.410" end="00:37:28.109" style="s2">or perhaps even Jesus of Nazareth&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.330" end="00:37:29.609" style="s2">wrestling with them because right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.109" end="00:37:34.109" style="s2">it reminds me that the word Israel</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.609" end="00:37:41.730" style="s2">actually means to wrestle with God so</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.109" end="00:37:45.080" style="s2">that that we as you say we are coming up</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.730" end="00:37:47.130" style="s2">with deep responses you know trance</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.080" end="00:37:49.410" style="s2">transformations in our ways of being</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.130" end="00:37:50.820" style="s2">that we can make deep commitments dude</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.410" end="00:37:53.100" style="s2">that&#39;s the word I&#39;m looking for</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.820" end="00:37:55.050" style="s2">not so much that we get uh you know a</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.100" end="00:37:57.030" style="s2">final solution and I use that term</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.050" end="00:37:58.530" style="s2">explicitly because I want I want the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.030" end="00:38:00.330" style="s2">dangers associated with that term</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.530" end="00:38:02.160" style="s2">remembered now that we get a final</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.330" end="00:38:03.960" style="s2">solution to these problem</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.160" end="00:38:06.180" style="s2">the you know the deep problems of human</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.960" end="00:38:09.060" style="s2">being and ways of being but that we get</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.180" end="00:38:11.250" style="s2">a way of life to which we can make a</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.060" end="00:38:14.070" style="s2">concerted commitment that will at least</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.250" end="00:38:15.960" style="s2">address the particular you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.070" end="00:38:19.020" style="s2">derivative problems that we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.960" end="00:38:21.570" style="s2">that&#39;s what I see in fact as I see that</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.020" end="00:38:24.290" style="s2">was present in ancient dialectic that</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.570" end="00:38:27.120" style="s2">problematization that philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.290" end="00:38:29.370" style="s2">analysis and by the way Nora is doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.120" end="00:38:31.530" style="s2">that with her warm data labs right where</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.370" end="00:38:33.390" style="s2">she has you know the various groups I</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.530" end="00:38:34.800" style="s2">really like the machinery there you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.390" end="00:38:36.810" style="s2">this you have the small groups and</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.800" end="00:38:38.490" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about a topic they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.810" end="00:38:40.170" style="s2">problematizing it in this sense like</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.490" end="00:38:42.420" style="s2">health for example is and then people</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.170" end="00:38:44.400" style="s2">can move between conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.420" end="00:38:46.740" style="s2">disrupt and transform and so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.400" end="00:38:48.090" style="s2">you basically if you enact a dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.740" end="00:38:50.310" style="s2">small world network that&#39;s constantly</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.090" end="00:38:51.990" style="s2">restructuring but it&#39;s not just about</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.310" end="00:38:55.620" style="s2">the interest in your subjective flow</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.990" end="00:38:58.020" style="s2">it&#39;s about trying to bring about you</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.620" end="00:39:00.510" style="s2">know these these existential insights</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.020" end="00:39:02.790" style="s2">that allow people to have a more deeper</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.510" end="00:39:04.560" style="s2">response to the reality at hand and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.790" end="00:39:06.030" style="s2">think that is that the kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.560" end="00:39:08.760" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about because I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.030" end="00:39:10.230" style="s2">there are people out there I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.760" end="00:39:12.390" style="s2">address that I see Nora trying to do set</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.230" end="00:39:14.670" style="s2">a guy wants to take circling in great</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.390" end="00:39:17.220" style="s2">what he calls circling 2.0 in which</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.670" end="00:39:19.170" style="s2">right one of my good friends encircling</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.220" end="00:39:20.550" style="s2">Taylor he&#39;s getting people doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.170" end="00:39:22.260" style="s2">circling and then they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.550" end="00:39:24.570" style="s2">running experiments where they then drop</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.260" end="00:39:27.300" style="s2">a topic into the circle and their circle</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.570" end="00:39:29.070" style="s2">you know pursues the topic so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.300" end="00:39:32.070" style="s2">lot of people that I think are really</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.070" end="00:39:34.230" style="s2">cognizant of that important critical</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.070" end="00:39:36.410" style="s2">point you just made that we&#39;ve got it</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.230" end="00:39:41.040" style="s2">we&#39;ve got it we&#39;ve got it we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.410" end="00:39:43.260" style="s2">couple the inter subjective flow - you</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.040" end="00:39:45.260" style="s2">know philosophy a-- in some profound an</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.260" end="00:39:47.970" style="s2">important way i think that&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.260" end="00:39:49.980" style="s2">yeah i mean once you have like we were</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.970" end="00:39:51.750" style="s2">talking about this I mean this process</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.980" end="00:39:53.970" style="s2">with this low bar to entry but somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.750" end="00:39:55.890" style="s2">along the way these additional concerns</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.970" end="00:39:57.600" style="s2">have to come into play right and there</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.890" end="00:39:59.790" style="s2">have to be people there to put that in</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.600" end="00:40:01.080" style="s2">our mind and a lot of these people who</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.790" end="00:40:02.610" style="s2">are doing these projects and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.080" end="00:40:04.710" style="s2">over there&#39;s a lot of people doing good</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.610" end="00:40:06.540" style="s2">work and there&#39;s been decades</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.710" end="00:40:08.790" style="s2">people experimenting with these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.540" end="00:40:10.710" style="s2">practices and then reflecting on those</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.790" end="00:40:12.330" style="s2">experiments and a note saying where</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.710" end="00:40:15.060" style="s2">there might be shortcomings and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.330" end="00:40:17.070" style="s2">trying to tweak circling 2.0 for example</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.060" end="00:40:20.849" style="s2">yeah yeah exactly though the more people</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.070" end="00:40:23.609" style="s2">who try that and are able to share</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.849" end="00:40:26.280" style="s2">conclusions if there&#39;s a common set of</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.609" end="00:40:28.290" style="s2">principles or conclusions coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.280" end="00:40:30.960" style="s2">that that will be very powerful to start</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.290" end="00:40:33.290" style="s2">something going socially yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.960" end="00:40:36.390" style="s2">you you do need to start in a very</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.290" end="00:40:37.680" style="s2">open-ended way up front yep and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.390" end="00:40:39.599" style="s2">people who are doing this like Nora</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.680" end="00:40:42.000" style="s2">she&#39;s got a lot of experience already</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.599" end="00:40:43.800" style="s2">she&#39;s way down that chain yeah very much</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.000" end="00:40:45.630" style="s2">so people are gonna come in and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.800" end="00:40:47.310" style="s2">gonna do with practices and practices</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.630" end="00:40:50.450" style="s2">and move them along to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.310" end="00:40:52.650" style="s2">they start taking responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.450" end="00:40:54.830" style="s2">solving things and changing their lives</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.650" end="00:40:57.510" style="s2">and I do agree that that&#39;s largely what</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.830" end="00:41:00.420" style="s2">the exemplars of the ancient wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.510" end="00:41:03.390" style="s2">tradition we&#39;re doing yeah Socrates&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.420" end="00:41:05.820" style="s2">dialogues don&#39;t end in a final solution</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.390" end="00:41:09.000" style="s2">to any particular problem but they</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.820" end="00:41:11.609" style="s2">demonstrate his way of life he changes</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.000" end="00:41:15.780" style="s2">the people around him and it also gives</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.609" end="00:41:17.580" style="s2">you a sense of something we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.780" end="00:41:19.560" style="s2">experiencing that super meaningful that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.580" end="00:41:20.940" style="s2">we can use to validate or critique</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.560" end="00:41:23.820" style="s2">systems yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.940" end="00:41:25.950" style="s2">when Plato looks at society when they</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.820" end="00:41:28.740" style="s2">talk in the Republic they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.950" end="00:41:31.339" style="s2">bouncing the organization of society off</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.740" end="00:41:33.990" style="s2">the achieved personal and interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.339" end="00:41:36.869" style="s2">successes exactly what goes with that</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.990" end="00:41:37.140" style="s2">yes oh that&#39;s a beautiful way of putting</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.869" end="00:41:40.920" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.140" end="00:41:42.599" style="s2">excellent excellent layman yes bouncing</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.920" end="00:41:45.900" style="s2">it off and getting that what goes with</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.599" end="00:41:48.960" style="s2">it you know a resonance between the</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.900" end="00:41:51.750" style="s2">overflow state and that you know a</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.960" end="00:41:54.330" style="s2">particular reconceptualization of a new</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.750" end="00:41:56.510" style="s2">way of being and that and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.330" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">the more specific you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.510" end="00:42:01.170" style="s2">socio-political consequences that might</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:03.690" style="s2">have exactly that is beautifully put</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.170" end="00:42:05.010" style="s2">well put I&#39;m gonna pause it right here</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.690" end="00:42:06.359" style="s2">layman I just need to go do something</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.010" end="00:42:08.310" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry I just don&#39;t want us to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.359" end="00:42:10.230" style="s2">interrupted I&#39;ll be back in one second</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.310" end="00:42:12.780" style="s2">I&#39;ll just okay we&#39;re recording</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.230" end="00:42:17.070" style="s2">again thank you for that little</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.780" end="00:42:18.370" style="s2">intervention so um I think that point</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.070" end="00:42:21.160" style="s2">you&#39;ve just made that</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.370" end="00:42:24.220" style="s2">sort of that idea you know you get into</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.160" end="00:42:26.110" style="s2">the overflow state and then there you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.220" end="00:42:28.450" style="s2">looking for resonance and rebound and</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.110" end="00:42:31.240" style="s2">resounding between and you know about</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.450" end="00:42:32.230" style="s2">your you know your speculations in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.240" end="00:42:34.540" style="s2">good sense of the word where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.230" end="00:42:37.030" style="s2">trying to see speculate you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.540" end="00:42:39.850" style="s2">see a you know in an aspirational sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.030" end="00:42:41.650" style="s2">an alternative way of being and what</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.850" end="00:42:44.320" style="s2">that might look like in terms of socio</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.650" end="00:42:47.020" style="s2">political and cultural Reformation and</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.320" end="00:42:48.790" style="s2">the Republic is a great example I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.020" end="00:42:51.880" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a really powerful point</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.790" end="00:42:53.740" style="s2">that you made so thank you for doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.880" end="00:42:56.350" style="s2">that yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.740" end="00:42:58.420" style="s2">I mean involves two things you have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.350" end="00:43:01.510" style="s2">be up to speed on what the world is like</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.420" end="00:43:03.910" style="s2">so you have that to validate and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.510" end="00:43:06.010" style="s2">you have to be really friendly with you</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.910" end="00:43:08.530" style="s2">have to be the filo of Sofia right</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.010" end="00:43:10.630" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to be really familiar with an</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.530" end="00:43:14.170" style="s2">appreciative a few good friends with</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.630" end="00:43:16.360" style="s2">this yeah experience you can do that</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.170" end="00:43:18.490" style="s2">comparison right in a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.360" end="00:43:22.570" style="s2">traditions whether it&#39;s interpersonal or</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.490" end="00:43:24.370" style="s2">personal involved contemplatively inand</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.570" end="00:43:27.010" style="s2">feeling into and becoming a better</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.370" end="00:43:29.170" style="s2">friend to that the benevolent form of</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.010" end="00:43:32.640" style="s2">overflow I think that&#39;s that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.170" end="00:43:36.220" style="s2">well said yeah that&#39;s really well said</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.640" end="00:43:39.280" style="s2">so yeah getting up to speed to it and we</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.220" end="00:43:42.240" style="s2">do that with minds to write like I&#39;ve I</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.280" end="00:43:46.270" style="s2">have I produced by practices or by grace</p>

<p begin="00:43:46.270" end="00:43:52.060" style="s2">delightful um then I can think about</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.270" end="00:43:54.130" style="s2">that I can test my thoughts against it</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.060" end="00:43:57.010" style="s2">that&#39;s a system right or then I can test</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.130" end="00:43:58.750" style="s2">it against my relationships I can test</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.010" end="00:44:00.820" style="s2">it against no we&#39;re organizing our</p>

<p begin="00:44:05.350" end="00:44:09.700" style="s2">about you know that that sense of beauty</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.330" end="00:44:12.760" style="s2">doing that for us and scary in her book</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.700" end="00:44:15.250" style="s2">talks about how you know the scent the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.760" end="00:44:18.490" style="s2">way Beauty sort of prepares us for</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.250" end="00:44:20.470" style="s2">insight and it prepares us for something</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.490" end="00:44:23.020" style="s2">outside of our egocentric framework</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.470" end="00:44:26.410" style="s2">challenging us and drawing us and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.020" end="00:44:28.630" style="s2">and like and so it even prepares us for</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.410" end="00:44:30.540" style="s2">you know treating things with a just</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.630" end="00:44:31.660" style="s2">kind of attention because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.540" end="00:44:32.920" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.660" end="00:44:35.470" style="s2">spirits of beauty rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.920" end="00:44:38.109" style="s2">desire or pleasure like you you get a</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.470" end="00:44:40.299" style="s2">sense of you are almost obligated to</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.109" end="00:44:42.339" style="s2">give this a certain kind of attention</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.299" end="00:44:43.690" style="s2">and it&#39;s drawing me beyond myself and</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.339" end="00:44:45.220" style="s2">it&#39;s making me think about things in</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.690" end="00:44:48.609" style="s2">ways I wouldn&#39;t have done on my own and</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.220" end="00:44:50.049" style="s2">so that&#39;s why it tends to act as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.609" end="00:44:51.400" style="s2">normative touchstone for us the way</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.049" end="00:44:54.190" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about we can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.400" end="00:44:56.470" style="s2">bounce things off against that if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.190" end="00:45:00.460" style="s2">allow me that dynamic beauty that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.470" end="00:45:04.839" style="s2">unfolding in the overflow so the</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.460" end="00:45:08.380" style="s2">question then becomes I suppose what do</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.839" end="00:45:09.880" style="s2">you do with them sorry this question as</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.380" end="00:45:12.220" style="s2">it was forming in my mouth was</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.880" end="00:45:13.359" style="s2">ridiculously pretentious so I try I want</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.220" end="00:45:16.420" style="s2">to answer I want to ask this question</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.359" end="00:45:17.980" style="s2">with tremendous respect and the people</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.420" end="00:45:19.809" style="s2">that I&#39;m in dialogue especially within</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.980" end="00:45:24.730" style="s2">the religious communities know the deep</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.809" end="00:45:30.250" style="s2">respect I hold their commitment to their</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.730" end="00:45:31.660" style="s2">faith but what do we do still hesitant</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.250" end="00:45:36.789" style="s2">what do we do with the existing</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.660" end="00:45:39.220" style="s2">religions that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s a dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.789" end="00:45:43.150" style="s2">question but it&#39;s but it&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.220" end="00:45:45.579" style="s2">question we have to ask and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.150" end="00:45:49.920" style="s2">sense in which it doesn&#39;t matter right</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.579" end="00:45:52.750" style="s2">which is to say healthy developmental</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.920" end="00:45:55.270" style="s2">successful practices individually and</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.750" end="00:45:58.079" style="s2">interpersonally are happening where</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.270" end="00:46:02.829" style="s2">people think they are in a tradition yes</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.079" end="00:46:05.799" style="s2">they are not in a tradition yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.829" end="00:46:08.109" style="s2">teasing apart success and non success of</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.799" end="00:46:09.220" style="s2">practices and you might think you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.109" end="00:46:11.980" style="s2">religious you might think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.220" end="00:46:15.039" style="s2">religious it&#39;s not encoded at the level</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.980" end="00:46:17.410" style="s2">of mental self categorization right</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.039" end="00:46:19.150" style="s2">right right right and between any two</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.410" end="00:46:20.589" style="s2">Christians between a two Muslims</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.150" end="00:46:22.990" style="s2">one of them is doing it one of them</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.589" end="00:46:26.109" style="s2">isn&#39;t same is he too faithless</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.990" end="00:46:28.150" style="s2">secularists it&#39;s the same thing right so</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.109" end="00:46:31.539" style="s2">we need to appreciate I think religion</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.150" end="00:46:33.910" style="s2">at a deeper level than our nominal self</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.539" end="00:46:37.619" style="s2">categorization and the surface level of</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.910" end="00:46:39.819" style="s2">our traditions yes within any set of</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.619" end="00:46:42.520" style="s2">cultural constructs and mental</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.819" end="00:46:45.680" style="s2">constructs there&#39;s depth and success if</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.520" end="00:46:48.000" style="s2">you do it but not if you don&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.680" end="00:46:49.590" style="s2">so I think that&#39;s a good question I</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.000" end="00:46:51.930" style="s2">think that was a good answer to my</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.590" end="00:46:53.970" style="s2">question I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.930" end="00:46:56.580" style="s2">really good so there&#39;s two things that</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.970" end="00:46:58.170" style="s2">come to mind one is you know I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.580" end="00:47:00.180" style="s2">privileged to have an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.170" end="00:47:03.120" style="s2">discussion recently with Andrew Sweeney</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.180" end="00:47:04.970" style="s2">and Zach Stein in response to is his</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.120" end="00:47:07.740" style="s2">really good essay on the war in heaven</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.970" end="00:47:09.680" style="s2">and I brought up with Zach he Pro he</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.740" end="00:47:12.330" style="s2">brought up this notion of convergence</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.680" end="00:47:14.430" style="s2">and a different kind of perennialism</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.330" end="00:47:16.470" style="s2">he&#39;s not talking about the aldous huxley</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.430" end="00:47:20.280" style="s2">perennialism he&#39;s talking about you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.470" end="00:47:24.030" style="s2">a potential of a place of convergence</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.280" end="00:47:25.350" style="s2">kind of a sacral Commons you know how at</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.030" end="00:47:28.140" style="s2">the university they have the Commons</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.350" end="00:47:29.760" style="s2">right so the sacral Commons where people</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.140" end="00:47:32.130" style="s2">can come in and where convergence is</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.760" end="00:47:34.770" style="s2">possible but you&#39;re not trying to you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.130" end="00:47:37.110" style="s2">not trying to enforce conversion you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.770" end="00:47:40.050" style="s2">trying to enforce convergence so that</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.110" end="00:47:42.300" style="s2">you know we can talk and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.050" end="00:47:44.100" style="s2">afford I&#39;m thinking about the way you</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.300" end="00:47:45.750" style="s2">know in within cognitive science that</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.100" end="00:47:48.300" style="s2">the psychologist isn&#39;t trying to convert</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.750" end="00:47:49.320" style="s2">the neuroscientist into psychology but</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.300" end="00:47:51.930" style="s2">they&#39;re what they&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.320" end="00:47:53.760" style="s2">afford convergence between and so you</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.930" end="00:47:55.560" style="s2">get deep learning you get convergence</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.760" end="00:47:56.970" style="s2">and then you get variation through their</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.560" end="00:47:58.980" style="s2">disciplines and you get convergence and</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.970" end="00:48:01.110" style="s2">variation and I think I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.980" end="00:48:02.760" style="s2">propose that as an alternative to we</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.110" end="00:48:05.310" style="s2">have to you know you have to we have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.760" end="00:48:07.260" style="s2">have the same religion right it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.310" end="00:48:08.460" style="s2">like no no part of what the religion</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.260" end="00:48:11.250" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion is know that</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.460" end="00:48:13.260" style="s2">people will belong to many established</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.250" end="00:48:15.270" style="s2">religions or none and yet if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.260" end="00:48:19.350" style="s2">committed to convergence and not</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.270" end="00:48:21.270" style="s2">conversion then we can get what zach is</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.350" end="00:48:24.330" style="s2">talking about and I think there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.270" end="00:48:25.650" style="s2">of people like you said within leads I</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.330" end="00:48:27.960" style="s2">know because I get to talk to them</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.650" end="00:48:30.390" style="s2">they&#39;re amazing people I have good faith</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.960" end="00:48:32.730" style="s2">enriched dialogues where you know with</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.390" end="00:48:35.490" style="s2">all of Android clay and you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.730" end="00:48:37.110" style="s2">Jonathan pazzo and Mary Cohen and JP</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.490" end="00:48:39.000" style="s2">Marceau you that might might have seen</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.110" end="00:48:42.210" style="s2">some of them and though I think those</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.000" end="00:48:43.620" style="s2">are all really valuable so I know that</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.210" end="00:48:45.060" style="s2">there are people of good faith within</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.620" end="00:48:47.430" style="s2">the faith so if you don&#39;t tell me that</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.060" end="00:48:48.540" style="s2">who are capable I think of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.430" end="00:48:52.500" style="s2">talking about because I see them</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.540" end="00:48:53.850" style="s2">enacting it but I do worry and and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.500" end="00:48:57.480" style="s2">want to try and make it more a little</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.850" end="00:48:58.770" style="s2">bit more timely the way in which we are</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.480" end="00:48:59.430" style="s2">you know we&#39;re getting sort of something</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.770" end="00:49:01.260" style="s2">like Dom</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.430" end="00:49:03.000" style="s2">side and culture shock within our</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.260" end="00:49:04.770" style="s2">culture the way we&#39;re getting a</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.000" end="00:49:07.020" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing our lives are sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.770" end="00:49:09.900" style="s2">of collapsing down the way we have this</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.020" end="00:49:12.180" style="s2">nebulous ubiquitous thing out there</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.900" end="00:49:13.890" style="s2">that&#39;s almost demonic and that it might</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.180" end="00:49:16.740" style="s2">be striking us and it might not and</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.890" end="00:49:18.630" style="s2">we&#39;re falling into purity codes lots of</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.740" end="00:49:20.130" style="s2">purity code thinking in order to deal</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.630" end="00:49:22.890" style="s2">with it and people are starting to</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.130" end="00:49:25.200" style="s2">invoke now Zack had a really good take</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.890" end="00:49:27.599" style="s2">on this but people are invoking a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.200" end="00:49:29.970" style="s2">religious language to talk about this my</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.599" end="00:49:33.210" style="s2">worry is another kind of religion is</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.970" end="00:49:37.290" style="s2">going to be potentially one that is</p>

<p begin="00:49:42.420" end="00:49:49.619" style="s2">of religion right that won&#39;t like your</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.290" end="00:49:52.650" style="s2">answer in fact would rather you be an</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.619" end="00:49:56.220" style="s2">atheist then give the answer you gave</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.650" end="00:49:58.410" style="s2">right I think I&#39;m being very careful</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.220" end="00:50:00.690" style="s2">here I&#39;ve clearly distinguished I am NOT</p>

<p begin="00:50:13.890" end="00:50:18.240" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me a pejorative use of</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.480" end="00:50:22.819" style="s2">this title sort of old testament way you</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.240" end="00:50:25.380" style="s2">know that right you know a demonic deity</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.819" end="00:50:27.390" style="s2">demanding purity codes and absolute</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.380" end="00:50:30.329" style="s2">adherence I think that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.390" end="00:50:32.460" style="s2">temptation right now and I&#39;m using that</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.329" end="00:50:34.230" style="s2">word because of its bullet of its</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.460" end="00:50:37.470" style="s2">biblical overtones I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.230" end="00:50:43.640" style="s2">tremendous temptation for that right now</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.470" end="00:50:47.280" style="s2">and I see that like those people deeply</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.640" end="00:50:48.900" style="s2">almost you know violently opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.280" end="00:50:52.700" style="s2">what you just said to what do you look</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.900" end="00:50:55.230" style="s2">what&#39;s your response to that challenge</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.700" end="00:50:58.349" style="s2">that&#39;s an old concern it&#39;s happened many</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.230" end="00:51:00.540" style="s2">times right yes yeah right the Sufis</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.349" end="00:51:02.760" style="s2">have always had to hide out within his</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.540" end="00:51:04.740" style="s2">life to some degree in within all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.760" end="00:51:07.290" style="s2">faith cultures there have been people</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.740" end="00:51:09.329" style="s2">who were being more open and progressive</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.290" end="00:51:12.869" style="s2">with it and people who were closing down</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.329" end="00:51:15.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s not just the</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.869" end="00:51:17.640" style="s2">Berkeley religious no people who think</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.119" end="00:51:20.579" style="s2">their secular can I&#39;d also be moving</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.640" end="00:51:24.930" style="s2">into a stress based fall in line purity</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.579" end="00:51:26.759" style="s2">code mentality yep yep and maybe we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.930" end="00:51:28.079" style="s2">little bit safer because so many people</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.759" end="00:51:29.519" style="s2">will be doing it in so many different</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.079" end="00:51:33.359" style="s2">ways that they&#39;ll get in each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.519" end="00:51:35.160" style="s2">way yeah yeah yeah but I&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.359" end="00:51:37.319" style="s2">all of that under the rubric of my</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.160" end="00:51:39.299" style="s2">generalized notion of what Neal ISM is</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.319" end="00:51:41.460" style="s2">right right right there these are</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.299" end="00:51:44.279" style="s2">regressions and under stress people tend</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.460" end="00:51:47.579" style="s2">to regress yes and if there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.279" end="00:51:50.339" style="s2">functional religiosity at our current</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.579" end="00:51:52.980" style="s2">level of sophistication then people will</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.339" end="00:51:54.900" style="s2">regress to the last time they saw</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.980" end="00:51:57.240" style="s2">something like that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.900" end="00:51:59.460" style="s2">it&#39;s very understandable it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.240" end="00:52:01.259" style="s2">unhealthy in the sense that health sort</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.460" end="00:52:03.269" style="s2">of stabilizes you where you are and</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.259" end="00:52:07.650" style="s2">affords you the opportunity to move</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.269" end="00:52:08.910" style="s2">forward yes so these are Neal isms right</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.650" end="00:52:10.680" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna run into things where they</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.910" end="00:52:13.200" style="s2">no longer care about a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.680" end="00:52:16.319" style="s2">things those things count as nothingness</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.200" end="00:52:20.039" style="s2">all right and roll back toward a simpler</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.319" end="00:52:22.589" style="s2">framework and try to stabilize there and</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.039" end="00:52:24.450" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s absolutely what a species or</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.589" end="00:52:27.150" style="s2">an organism or a group of people should</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.450" end="00:52:29.489" style="s2">do in a way if they don&#39;t have better</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.150" end="00:52:31.710" style="s2">affordances roll back to the previous</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.489" end="00:52:33.450" style="s2">ones that worked we&#39;re gonna lose a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.710" end="00:52:35.940" style="s2">of things but we&#39;re already losing a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.450" end="00:52:37.619" style="s2">of things so it&#39;s it&#39;s understandable</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.940" end="00:52:39.239" style="s2">that that would happen and I think it</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.619" end="00:52:43.319" style="s2">almost certainly will happen if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.239" end="00:52:47.999" style="s2">no better alternative so we have to try</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.319" end="00:52:49.380" style="s2">to create the richness of the religion</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.999" end="00:52:52.499" style="s2">that isn&#39;t the religion of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.380" end="00:52:54.660" style="s2">interfaith and trans interfaith sacred</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.499" end="00:52:56.549" style="s2">Commons you have a new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.660" end="00:52:59.069" style="s2">religiosity and hope and get these</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.549" end="00:53:01.170" style="s2">things going these systems and the way</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.069" end="00:53:04.079" style="s2">that systems interact with interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.170" end="00:53:06.569" style="s2">epiphanies but a lot of that to me is</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.079" end="00:53:08.480" style="s2">framed I think like it was for Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.569" end="00:53:09.599" style="s2">it&#39;s framed around the idea of Health</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.480" end="00:53:11.730" style="s2">mmm</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.599" end="00:53:14.339" style="s2">the more we know about health the more</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.730" end="00:53:16.170" style="s2">we can be on guard right so that people</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.339" end="00:53:17.999" style="s2">say to someone who is falling into that</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.170" end="00:53:21.329" style="s2">mode ego you know that&#39;s not good for</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.999" end="00:53:23.190" style="s2">you Jim you&#39;re doing a disservice to</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.329" end="00:53:25.499" style="s2">yourself and your relationships and we</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.190" end="00:53:26.460" style="s2">have these you know we have the doctors</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.499" end="00:53:28.650" style="s2">we have the Nutri</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.460" end="00:53:31.260" style="s2">we have the therapist we have all these</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.650" end="00:53:33.900" style="s2">people throughout our society and their</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.260" end="00:53:36.690" style="s2">job in a way should be to keep people</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.900" end="00:53:39.990" style="s2">from regressing under the impact of</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.690" end="00:53:42.420" style="s2">stresses dealing with traumatized people</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.990" end="00:53:44.130" style="s2">all the time we have some tools at our</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.420" end="00:53:44.820" style="s2">disposal and if we mobilize them</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.130" end="00:53:46.619" style="s2">correctly</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.820" end="00:53:49.020" style="s2">that&#39;s a buffer against a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.619" end="00:53:51.140" style="s2">right people come back from the war and</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.020" end="00:53:54.900" style="s2">their brains are messed up but we have</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.140" end="00:53:56.550" style="s2">physical mental you know neuroelectric</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.900" end="00:54:00.140" style="s2">scans we can work on their brain</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.550" end="00:54:03.660" style="s2">patterns the more technology and</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.140" end="00:54:05.430" style="s2">dispersal of Health protocols we have I</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.660" end="00:54:08.630" style="s2">think the more we can buffer that and</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.430" end="00:54:11.430" style="s2">the buffering may give us the time to</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.630" end="00:54:13.560" style="s2">grow the kind of religiosity that will</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.430" end="00:54:15.780" style="s2">provide a progressive alternative to</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.560" end="00:54:17.869" style="s2">regressive religion because I need one</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.780" end="00:54:20.609" style="s2">way or the other that&#39;s really cool</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.869" end="00:54:22.920" style="s2">because I&#39;ve been largely because of</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.609" end="00:54:25.619" style="s2">Hans work right I&#39;ve been largely</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.920" end="00:54:28.140" style="s2">critical of the fetishization of health</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.619" end="00:54:30.510" style="s2">in our society because it&#39;s often served</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.140" end="00:54:34.050" style="s2">the heat points out it&#39;s served you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.510" end="00:54:36.480" style="s2">the function of as a God for us and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.050" end="00:54:38.580" style="s2">it&#39;s it has this huge narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.480" end="00:54:40.920" style="s2">element to it but what I hear you doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.580" end="00:54:43.050" style="s2">and what really caught my attention is</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.920" end="00:54:46.260" style="s2">you&#39;re actually you&#39;re proposing a</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.050" end="00:54:49.980" style="s2">reformulation of what health means and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.260" end="00:54:53.660" style="s2">like this idea of right that part of</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.980" end="00:54:56.099" style="s2">what ill-health means this ease means is</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.660" end="00:54:58.800" style="s2">when people regress because of stress</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.099" end="00:55:00.780" style="s2">because of scarcity or stress or because</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.800" end="00:55:03.119" style="s2">also the opposite there&#39;s a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.780" end="00:55:05.820" style="s2">positive affordance so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.119" end="00:55:08.520" style="s2">famine of affordance and there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.820" end="00:55:10.440" style="s2">scarcity right of other things in their</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.520" end="00:55:13.530" style="s2">life scarcity of meaning making for</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.440" end="00:55:16.380" style="s2">example and the idea that what we should</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.530" end="00:55:18.330" style="s2">do is because we&#39;ve already committed so</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.380" end="00:55:21.480" style="s2">much and with good reason but by the way</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.330" end="00:55:24.119" style="s2">a to health if we could shift it off the</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.480" end="00:55:26.490" style="s2">narcissistic health image you know the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.119" end="00:55:28.320" style="s2">eternal youth that the goal of Health is</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.490" end="00:55:30.270" style="s2">the eternal youth that will not suffer</p>

<p begin="00:55:44.510" end="00:55:48.110" style="s2">that way if we could get our</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.980" end="00:55:50.060" style="s2">understanding of health we could use the</p>

<p begin="00:55:52.850" end="00:55:57.710" style="s2">into considering meaning in life and</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.210" end="00:56:00.560" style="s2">right not regressing in the face of</p>

<p begin="00:56:00.560" end="00:56:04.430" style="s2">because it&#39;s precisely a place to get</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.750" end="00:56:06.710" style="s2">back to an earlier point where the</p>

<p begin="00:56:09.110" end="00:56:13.070" style="s2">notion of health that you&#39;re proposing I</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.020" end="00:56:14.240" style="s2">think that&#39;s brilliant I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.070" end="00:56:17.420" style="s2">brilliant layman I think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.240" end="00:56:20.570" style="s2">brilliant I have a kind of typical</p>

<p begin="00:56:22.370" end="00:56:27.920" style="s2">right which is to say from my way of</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.430" end="00:56:31.280" style="s2">thinking we can put an expansive</p>

<p begin="00:56:39.830" end="00:56:44.510" style="s2">science to mean I don&#39;t just mean 19th</p>

<p begin="00:56:44.510" end="00:56:48.290" style="s2">of every other valuable part of life I</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.310" end="00:56:50.090" style="s2">mean the science that incorporates</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.290" end="00:56:52.280" style="s2">everything we think is important and</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.090" end="00:56:54.650" style="s2">true and the religion that does that and</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.280" end="00:56:57.740" style="s2">the health that does that and health is</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.650" end="00:56:59.780" style="s2">in some ways uniquely situated if we</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.740" end="00:57:02.390" style="s2">treat it in a positive expansive way</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.780" end="00:57:05.930" style="s2">yeah because it&#39;s at the intersection of</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.390" end="00:57:08.530" style="s2">of individual and society and ecology</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.930" end="00:57:11.000" style="s2">and meaning right it&#39;s meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.530" end="00:57:13.640" style="s2">ecologically resonant individual and</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.000" end="00:57:15.440" style="s2">cultural value of some kinds when we</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.640" end="00:57:18.080" style="s2">when we do it right but that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.440" end="00:57:21.020" style="s2">a sweet spot that accesses a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.080" end="00:57:23.000" style="s2">things yeah so so tying health more</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.020" end="00:57:25.480" style="s2">deeply to what Bishop calls well-being</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.000" end="00:57:28.250" style="s2">right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.480" end="00:57:31.400" style="s2">I mean in the Nietzschean senses what</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.250" end="00:57:35.900" style="s2">about the great health yeah you have to</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.400" end="00:57:38.240" style="s2">have your needs met now in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.900" end="00:57:41.990" style="s2">these overflows yes totally</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.240" end="00:57:44.540" style="s2">totally yeah totally I just and the way</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.990" end="00:57:46.900" style="s2">you rift on your insight was also</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.540" end="00:57:50.410" style="s2">wonderful yeah that that strategy of</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.900" end="00:57:52.460" style="s2">reformulations where the mere rejection</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.410" end="00:57:53.780" style="s2">and there&#39;s a sense of which meta</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.460" end="00:57:57.320" style="s2">modernism as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.780" end="00:57:59.000" style="s2">is trying to do that it takes postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.320" end="00:58:01.580" style="s2">is it takes it takes seriously the</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.000" end="00:58:04.340" style="s2">postmodern critique of modernity right</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.580" end="00:58:06.560" style="s2">but then it it proposes not being</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.340" end="00:58:09.020" style="s2">satisfied with rejection but doing what</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.560" end="00:58:11.240" style="s2">you just did you exemplify the meta</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.020" end="00:58:13.220" style="s2">modernist attitude there no no take the</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.240" end="00:58:16.430" style="s2">critique seriously from somebody like</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.220" end="00:58:19.520" style="s2">Han for example but in the face of it</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.430" end="00:58:21.530" style="s2">reformulate it in a way that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.520" end="00:58:24.320" style="s2">viable for us once again I thought that</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.530" end="00:58:26.780" style="s2">was excellent yeah I think that&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.320" end="00:58:27.950" style="s2">heart of the meta mater and the intrud</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.780" end="00:58:30.410" style="s2">all the yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.950" end="00:58:33.290" style="s2">there&#39;s a dozen different ways to frame</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.410" end="00:58:37.210" style="s2">what this new bigger perspective is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.290" end="00:58:40.340" style="s2">but it&#39;s really the critique is</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.210" end="00:58:42.890" style="s2">assimilated as the precondition for the</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.340" end="00:58:44.750" style="s2">correct definition yes it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.890" end="00:58:47.420" style="s2">it&#39;s faulty because we critiqued it the</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.750" end="00:58:49.250" style="s2">critique is specifying what the new</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.420" end="00:58:51.440" style="s2">version should be the one that meets</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.250" end="00:58:53.690" style="s2">those critiques right right right</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.440" end="00:58:55.760" style="s2">well said very well said and that of</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.690" end="00:58:58.010" style="s2">course just to doing some advertising</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.760" end="00:58:59.570" style="s2">again that&#39;s that&#39;s a dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.010" end="00:59:01.640" style="s2">process that&#39;s exactly what a</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.570" end="00:59:05.270" style="s2">dialectical process is it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.640" end="00:59:06.770" style="s2">simply oppositional argumentation it is</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.270" end="00:59:09.290" style="s2">a process in which you can internalize</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.770" end="00:59:11.710" style="s2">critique in a way that transforms it</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.290" end="00:59:14.300" style="s2">into a virtual engine that generates</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.710" end="00:59:18.530" style="s2">affordances of you know a reformulation</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.300" end="00:59:22.010" style="s2">a renewal insight transformation exactly</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.530" end="00:59:24.830" style="s2">I think that&#39;s exactly the point where</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.010" end="00:59:26.900" style="s2">where critique is welcomed as part of</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.830" end="00:59:29.210" style="s2">the way in which you bring about the</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.900" end="00:59:31.820" style="s2">opponent processing that gives you the</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.210" end="00:59:33.470" style="s2">self correction that affords self</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.820" end="00:59:35.690" style="s2">transcendence I think I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.470" end="00:59:38.900" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a crucial that&#39;s a crucial</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.690" end="00:59:40.700" style="s2">move you just made there yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.900" end="00:59:43.220" style="s2">and it&#39;s you mean that opponent</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.700" end="00:59:45.849" style="s2">processing I mean that&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.220" end="00:59:48.500" style="s2">sharpening of your Zen blade you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.849" end="00:59:51.700" style="s2">you become properly adapted without</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.500" end="00:59:55.430" style="s2">opponent processing yeah totally totally</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.700" end="00:59:56.960" style="s2">and then that&#39;s interesting because it</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.430" end="00:59:59.450" style="s2">strikes me that your insight about</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.960" end="01:00:01.730" style="s2">expanding health could potentially be</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.450" end="01:00:03.470" style="s2">integrated with with you know things</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.730" end="01:00:06.020" style="s2">like the deep continuity hypothesis to</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.470" end="01:00:07.280" style="s2">move on with in 4e cognitive science of</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.020" end="01:00:08.450" style="s2">seeing deep continuity</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.280" end="01:00:10.820" style="s2">in our cognitive states and our</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.450" end="01:00:12.740" style="s2">biological States it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.820" end="01:00:14.660" style="s2">that expansive notion of health that</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.740" end="01:00:16.250" style="s2">you&#39;re proposing would be very well</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.660" end="01:00:18.440" style="s2">situated within that continuity</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.250" end="01:00:20.630" style="s2">hypothesis that our cognitive machinery</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.440" end="01:00:22.970" style="s2">and our biological machinery ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.630" end="01:00:25.100" style="s2">share you know important structural</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.970" end="01:00:26.960" style="s2">functional organization and operational</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.100" end="01:00:28.430" style="s2">principles I think that those who</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.960" end="01:00:31.190" style="s2">actually would go together very very</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.430" end="01:00:32.450" style="s2">nicely I think yeah this uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.190" end="01:00:33.800" style="s2">when to come back to Nietzsche again</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.450" end="01:00:35.360" style="s2">who&#39;s bubbling up for me in this</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.800" end="01:00:38.240" style="s2">conversation he has a line somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.360" end="01:00:41.240" style="s2">where he says you know if you think you</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.240" end="01:00:41.870" style="s2">have reduced the soul to something about</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.240" end="01:00:45.650" style="s2">the body</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.870" end="01:00:47.660" style="s2">you haven&#39;t dispensed with the soul you</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.650" end="01:00:50.060" style="s2">just don&#39;t really know what the body is</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.660" end="01:00:51.620" style="s2">yet yeah yeah the body is capable of</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.060" end="01:00:54.950" style="s2">doing that thing you were calling the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.620" end="01:00:56.810" style="s2">soul get rid of the miracle the miracle</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.950" end="01:01:00.710" style="s2">is still there you just never think of</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.810" end="01:01:02.870" style="s2">it as really intimately entangled you</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.710" end="01:01:05.360" style="s2">know if the physiology and ecology and</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.870" end="01:01:07.040" style="s2">sociology of what we exist in here yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.360" end="01:01:08.570" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been trying to talk</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.040" end="01:01:10.220" style="s2">about sort of in terms of the philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.570" end="01:01:12.890" style="s2">of science but that comes out of</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.220" end="01:01:14.930" style="s2">cognitive science practice rather than</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.890" end="01:01:16.850" style="s2">reductionism you know the soul is</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.930" end="01:01:18.590" style="s2">nothing but this chemical process in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.850" end="01:01:20.810" style="s2">brain you&#39;re getting what you just did</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.590" end="01:01:23.930" style="s2">which is reciprocal reconstruction both</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.810" end="01:01:26.120" style="s2">of the ontology zhh change until you get</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.930" end="01:01:27.830" style="s2">a dialectical convergence in which what</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.120" end="01:01:29.540" style="s2">you end up with is something radically</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.830" end="01:01:31.640" style="s2">other than the two things that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.540" end="01:01:33.320" style="s2">oppose you don&#39;t reduce one to the other</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.640" end="01:01:34.760" style="s2">they both go through reciprocal</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.320" end="01:01:36.770" style="s2">reconstruction till you get to a place</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.760" end="01:01:37.580" style="s2">that&#39;s other than the two that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.770" end="01:01:40.610" style="s2">started</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.580" end="01:01:43.970" style="s2">they provide the constraints that enable</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.610" end="01:01:45.350" style="s2">you to produce the excess yes exactly</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.970" end="01:01:47.420" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.350" end="01:01:50.390" style="s2">I I was thinking about this the other</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.420" end="01:01:54.050" style="s2">day you know when we think of the sacred</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.390" end="01:01:55.370" style="s2">as trans categorical yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.050" end="01:02:01.430" style="s2">different ways to think about that this</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.370" end="01:02:03.380" style="s2">is the total Segway by the way trans</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.430" end="01:02:05.930" style="s2">categorical for a lot of people that</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.380" end="01:02:08.420" style="s2">means something more primal than any of</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.930" end="01:02:11.270" style="s2">the categories right but there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.420" end="01:02:12.380" style="s2">a metaphysical flavor to that it could</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.270" end="01:02:14.840" style="s2">mean something</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.380" end="01:02:16.850" style="s2">synthetic whereby we&#39;re putting things</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.840" end="01:02:19.520" style="s2">on multiple categories together in</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.850" end="01:02:20.970" style="s2">convergence to produce this I like that</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.520" end="01:02:23.730" style="s2">one because it&#39;s actionable</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.970" end="01:02:26.550" style="s2">yeah or it could mean something that</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.730" end="01:02:28.950" style="s2">shifts around yeah right which is to say</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.550" end="01:02:31.230" style="s2">you know if you if you laid out on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.950" end="01:02:33.150" style="s2">floor a big map of all the categories of</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.230" end="01:02:34.980" style="s2">the possible types of perspectives and</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.150" end="01:02:36.900" style="s2">experience that make up the universe and</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.980" end="01:02:38.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a mouse under the thing and it</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.900" end="01:02:41.579" style="s2">just moves around in different to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.550" end="01:02:43.680" style="s2">categories yeah no there&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.579" end="01:02:46.260" style="s2">three ways which which of these ways do</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.680" end="01:02:49.530" style="s2">you think of the trans categorical is</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.260" end="01:02:50.970" style="s2">being all right so I think of it mostly</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.530" end="01:02:52.680" style="s2">the second with a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.970" end="01:02:54.960" style="s2">variation on the second but I think it</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.680" end="01:02:56.400" style="s2">falls in up to three you gave me I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.960" end="01:02:59.010" style="s2">trying to be into categorical and my</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.400" end="01:03:02.760" style="s2">answer to your question about the trans</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.010" end="01:03:05.130" style="s2">categorical I think I see it like the</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.760" end="01:03:07.920" style="s2">second but proposal but in this way</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.130" end="01:03:10.260" style="s2">first of all I think of the sacred</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.920" end="01:03:13.349" style="s2">having to deal with that which you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.260" end="01:03:15.810" style="s2">I want to make a distinction out between</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.349" end="01:03:17.670" style="s2">only horizontal categories but also</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.810" end="01:03:20.150" style="s2">categorical differences between levels</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.670" end="01:03:23.130" style="s2">of being so I tend to think of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.150" end="01:03:26.609" style="s2">spiritual and that&#39;s going to relate to</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.130" end="01:03:29.579" style="s2">the sacral in terms of that which you</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.609" end="01:03:32.700" style="s2">know crosses between the categories of</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.579" end="01:03:34.440" style="s2">the the cognitive the existential and</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.700" end="01:03:37.349" style="s2">ultimately the ontological and it</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.440" end="01:03:39.690" style="s2">crosses between them and in crossing</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.349" end="01:03:41.910" style="s2">between them it does something like I</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.690" end="01:03:43.079" style="s2">talked about the trans world it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.910" end="01:03:44.730" style="s2">like you&#39;re going to another world</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.079" end="01:03:46.410" style="s2">because I don&#39;t want the Axial Age stuff</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.730" end="01:03:48.540" style="s2">what&#39;s the trans world the trans world</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.410" end="01:03:51.240" style="s2">is it&#39;s like tokens recovery theory a</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.540" end="01:03:52.230" style="s2">fantasy so and this is I&#39;m starting to</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.240" end="01:03:55.589" style="s2">think more and more of this thing the</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.230" end="01:03:57.630" style="s2">idea of this sacred tokens notion of</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.589" end="01:03:59.069" style="s2">fantasy was not escapism and not</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.630" end="01:04:01.020" style="s2">alternative ism it&#39;s not this is an</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.069" end="01:04:03.150" style="s2">alternative world or I escaped to that</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.020" end="01:04:04.859" style="s2">world the idea is I go there and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.150" end="01:04:07.440" style="s2">experienced something like culture shock</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.859" end="01:04:09.510" style="s2">I have to I have to go to this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.440" end="01:04:12.240" style="s2">significant transformation in my way of</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.510" end="01:04:14.310" style="s2">being to be in that world to really be</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.240" end="01:04:16.349" style="s2">in that world and then I return to this</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.310" end="01:04:17.609" style="s2">world and like at the anthropologist</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.349" end="01:04:19.920" style="s2">who&#39;s gone to another culture and</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.609" end="01:04:21.569" style="s2">returns to their home culture and so she</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.920" end="01:04:24.780" style="s2">can now see things in her home culture</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.569" end="01:04:27.690" style="s2">that she could never see before right</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.780" end="01:04:30.119" style="s2">she can see through the cracks of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.690" end="01:04:33.030" style="s2">categories that for everybody else seem</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.119" end="01:04:34.319" style="s2">like the wall of being right the wall of</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.030" end="01:04:36.119" style="s2">their metaphysics but she</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.319" end="01:04:38.579" style="s2">says actually there&#39;s all these gaps</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.119" end="01:04:43.289" style="s2">that you&#39;re not seeing and I can see</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.579" end="01:04:44.999" style="s2">them she recovers right that and I see</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.289" end="01:04:46.799" style="s2">that when people are going trans</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.999" end="01:04:48.869" style="s2">categorical they&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.799" end="01:04:50.099" style="s2">Transworld thing they&#39;re going out so</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.869" end="01:04:54.239" style="s2">that where they can come back and</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.099" end="01:04:56.880" style="s2">recover the relation the relationships</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.239" end="01:04:58.589" style="s2">between the categories in a dynamic and</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.880" end="01:05:01.709" style="s2">transformative way which I think falls</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.589" end="01:05:03.359" style="s2">under your synthetic proposal is if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.709" end="01:05:05.569" style="s2">understanding it correctly yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.359" end="01:05:10.469" style="s2">so the word synthetic isn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.569" end="01:05:12.539" style="s2">glorious enough there&#39;s there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.469" end="01:05:15.630" style="s2">of an activity and a function and a</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.539" end="01:05:17.999" style="s2">production yes any use to that</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.630" end="01:05:20.759" style="s2">experience if we&#39;re able to use it and</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.999" end="01:05:24.329" style="s2">that&#39;s another big part of this is you</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.759" end="01:05:26.880" style="s2">know can you handle the intensity of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.329" end="01:05:28.799" style="s2">numinous yes right and I think if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.880" end="01:05:31.969" style="s2">if you&#39;re if you&#39;re working it in an</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.799" end="01:05:34.529" style="s2">organic way in yourself you know and</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.969" end="01:05:36.719" style="s2">self-regulating that process then you</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.529" end="01:05:39.690" style="s2">can have a pretty good experience of it</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.719" end="01:05:41.430" style="s2">but it can be overwhelming for people if</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.690" end="01:05:43.859" style="s2">they&#39;re not ready or if they&#39;re rigid or</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.430" end="01:05:45.779" style="s2">in any other way unhealthy so to speak</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.859" end="01:05:47.339" style="s2">yeah and I think that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.779" end="01:05:50.160" style="s2">things we&#39;re facing collectively now</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.339" end="01:05:51.930" style="s2">like some people are getting sick some</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.160" end="01:05:54.989" style="s2">people are dying some people are going</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.930" end="01:05:58.170" style="s2">into fiscal collapse but everybody is</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.989" end="01:06:00.150" style="s2">facing traumatic weirdness yes right the</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.170" end="01:06:02.009" style="s2">sense that there&#39;s something available</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.150" end="01:06:05.309" style="s2">in the system now that&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.009" end="01:06:07.289" style="s2">peculiar constantly and that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.309" end="01:06:10.289" style="s2">have a place for it and that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.289" end="01:06:13.739" style="s2">the things religion ization has to do is</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.289" end="01:06:17.130" style="s2">provide us with the technology to deal</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.739" end="01:06:19.199" style="s2">with the trans categorical in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.130" end="01:06:22.259" style="s2">doesn&#39;t traumatize us I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.199" end="01:06:23.699" style="s2">excellent so there&#39;s I think yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.259" end="01:06:26.190" style="s2">think the notion of the sacred should</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.699" end="01:06:27.930" style="s2">always have this opponent-process in</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.190" end="01:06:31.739" style="s2">between that which homes us and that</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.930" end="01:06:33.900" style="s2">which exposes us has us confront the</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.739" end="01:06:36.089" style="s2">numinous always and Kristen and I have</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.900" end="01:06:37.589" style="s2">argued that explicitly so I&#39;m in total</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.089" end="01:06:39.329" style="s2">agreement with because that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.589" end="01:06:41.459" style="s2">need for that&#39;s what you need for</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.329" end="01:06:42.869" style="s2">systemic relevance realization your</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.459" end="01:06:45.390" style="s2">culture has to be able to move between</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.869" end="01:06:46.819" style="s2">the assimilation of home the</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.390" end="01:06:48.150" style="s2">assimilation to home and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.819" end="01:06:51.359" style="s2">accommodation and</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.150" end="01:06:53.369" style="s2">or even potential horror of right of</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.359" end="01:06:55.710" style="s2">what&#39;s outside and only when the culture</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.369" end="01:06:57.450" style="s2">can do opponent-process in between that</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.710" end="01:07:00.420" style="s2">afforded by something like religion</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.450" end="01:07:02.910" style="s2">because I think the sacred traditionally</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.420" end="01:07:05.609" style="s2">cross culturally cross contextually has</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.910" end="01:07:08.160" style="s2">always been that dynamic opponent</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.609" end="01:07:10.710" style="s2">processing between that which homes us</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.160" end="01:07:13.349" style="s2">and that which could potentially horrify</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.710" end="01:07:15.359" style="s2">us so totally that there&#39;s a long</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.349" end="01:07:18.029" style="s2">tradition of speaking about the fear of</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.359" end="01:07:20.730" style="s2">God yes and it&#39;s like we are all born</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.029" end="01:07:23.609" style="s2">with that phobia and one of the ways to</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.730" end="01:07:25.890" style="s2">correct a phobia is voluntary exposure</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.609" end="01:07:28.140" style="s2">therapy yeah it has to be drawn that</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.890" end="01:07:30.510" style="s2">area you have to go back and forth you</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.140" end="01:07:32.490" style="s2">know we&#39;re get familiar with it yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.510" end="01:07:34.650" style="s2">that goes to the second point I wanted</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.490" end="01:07:37.380" style="s2">to bring up which goes to the work that</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.650" end="01:07:40.380" style="s2">I&#39;m doing with Daniel Greg on the on the</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.380" end="01:07:42.119" style="s2">on the cognitive continuum so if this</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.380" end="01:07:44.039" style="s2">thesis is right and it&#39;s the scientific</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.119" end="01:07:45.569" style="s2">thesis so I think it&#39;s plausible it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.039" end="01:07:47.609" style="s2">not established I&#39;m not claiming that</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.569" end="01:07:49.589" style="s2">but other people are converging on it</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.609" end="01:07:52.230" style="s2">like Newberg and others that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.589" end="01:07:55.500" style="s2">continuum between very low level fluency</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.230" end="01:07:58.049" style="s2">of processing insight like when you have</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.500" end="01:08:00.950" style="s2">a ha moment flow the work I did with Leo</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.049" end="01:08:03.480" style="s2">and area on flow as an insight cascade</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.950" end="01:08:05.910" style="s2">mystical experiences awakening</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.480" end="01:08:07.920" style="s2">experiences and then you know full blow</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.910" end="01:08:09.450" style="s2">and you know you know transformative</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.920" end="01:08:11.549" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.450" end="01:08:13.680" style="s2">if there is that continuum and what</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.549" end="01:08:15.150" style="s2">we&#39;re doing is recursively exacting and</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.680" end="01:08:16.770" style="s2">complexified through a kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.150" end="01:08:18.449" style="s2">circuitry used to use Anderson&#39;s term</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.770" end="01:08:20.940" style="s2">Michael Anderson&#39;s term the same</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.449" end="01:08:23.520" style="s2">machinery I think you could situate</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.940" end="01:08:25.380" style="s2">progressive desensitization into the</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.520" end="01:08:26.069" style="s2">gradual movement along the cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.380" end="01:08:27.929" style="s2">continuum</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.069" end="01:08:29.670" style="s2">teach people the disruptive strategies</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.929" end="01:08:31.830" style="s2">that are very low-level that bring about</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.670" end="01:08:33.330" style="s2">insight and then teach them the</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.830" end="01:08:35.609" style="s2">strategies that are needed to get into</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.330" end="01:08:37.980" style="s2">flow and so on and then you can take</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.609" end="01:08:40.560" style="s2">people again and so I think there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.980" end="01:08:42.690" style="s2">a progressive program for moving along</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.560" end="01:08:45.060" style="s2">the cognitive continuum that you could</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.690" end="01:08:46.799" style="s2">probably pedagogically sync up with that</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.060" end="01:08:49.230" style="s2">progressive program through teaching</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.799" end="01:08:51.390" style="s2">people the inter personal things so that</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.230" end="01:08:52.920" style="s2">you could get that that exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.390" end="01:08:55.080" style="s2">you&#39;re proposing you could get the</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.920" end="01:08:57.330" style="s2">progressive desensitization along the</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.080" end="01:08:59.139" style="s2">cognitive continuum that is in sync with</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.330" end="01:09:03.489" style="s2">people being able to more and more read</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.139" end="01:09:08.529" style="s2">move into the overflow I can think of no</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.489" end="01:09:11.889" style="s2">reason why that wouldn&#39;t work but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.529" end="01:09:14.679" style="s2">definitely worth trying well every step</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.889" end="01:09:16.480" style="s2">of that process there&#39;s a an</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.679" end="01:09:17.199" style="s2">encountering more richness in more</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.480" end="01:09:19.449" style="s2">detail</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.199" end="01:09:22.089" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s countering intensities and</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.449" end="01:09:25.089" style="s2">trying to assimilate or adapt to those</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.089" end="01:09:27.190" style="s2">intensities and there&#39;s a bringing</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.089" end="01:09:29.619" style="s2">together of making coherence of what</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.190" end="01:09:31.540" style="s2">you&#39;ve got exactly where it operates</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.619" end="01:09:33.940" style="s2">sort of as a whole and maybe it was more</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.540" end="01:09:37.150" style="s2">than a whole yeah it&#39;s very constant in</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.940" end="01:09:38.589" style="s2">all those steps although health is also</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.150" end="01:09:41.529" style="s2">an important factor in that because</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.589" end="01:09:43.239" style="s2">really with people who have bodies right</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.529" end="01:09:45.759" style="s2">and their ability to do this thing is</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.239" end="01:09:47.230" style="s2">going to depend on you know whether they</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.759" end="01:09:48.969" style="s2">have pain in their abdomen whether</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.230" end="01:09:51.310" style="s2">they&#39;re getting along or whether they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.969" end="01:09:53.319" style="s2">breathing correctly whether their nails</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.310" end="01:09:55.119" style="s2">can allow their heart to expand or not</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.319" end="01:09:56.679" style="s2">all these sorts of things totally</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.119" end="01:09:59.679" style="s2">totally and and that comes up</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.679" end="01:10:02.350" style="s2">practically in like as I said I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.679" end="01:10:04.210" style="s2">a live meditation class right now not to</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.350" end="01:10:06.429" style="s2">try and give people well some of what</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.210" end="01:10:10.150" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about right now directly</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.429" end="01:10:12.969" style="s2">in response to the co big crisis and so</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.150" end="01:10:14.949" style="s2">you know and and it&#39;s a course in that</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.969" end="01:10:17.050" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s exactly like we just talked</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.949" end="01:10:18.969" style="s2">about it&#39;s it&#39;s progressive it you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.050" end="01:10:21.550" style="s2">it takes people through this you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.969" end="01:10:25.600" style="s2">constantly gradually expanding you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.550" end="01:10:27.790" style="s2">excitation and exposure right um but</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.600" end="01:10:29.409" style="s2">along the way right you you have to you</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.790" end="01:10:30.699" style="s2">have to pause you have to have question</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.409" end="01:10:32.110" style="s2">and answers because people do you have</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.699" end="01:10:34.540" style="s2">problems with the body with the breath</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.110" end="01:10:37.960" style="s2">with it and it&#39;s so it has to be this</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.540" end="01:10:40.860" style="s2">you know it has to be very its I you</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.960" end="01:10:42.699" style="s2">know it&#39;s something that really has to I</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.860" end="01:10:44.500" style="s2">want to be careful there I mean I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.699" end="01:10:45.699" style="s2">you can learn a lot from you know a</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.500" end="01:10:48.340" style="s2">meditation book but I think meditation</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.699" end="01:10:50.560" style="s2">is like making love but if you won&#39;t if</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.340" end="01:10:53.530" style="s2">you only reading about it you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.560" end="01:10:55.600" style="s2">not capable of it right in an important</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.530" end="01:10:57.699" style="s2">way uh and you know and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.600" end="01:10:58.659" style="s2">central metaphor in the tradition I was</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.699" end="01:11:00.460" style="s2">brought up in that you know that</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.659" end="01:11:01.869" style="s2">meditation is your meditation and</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.460" end="01:11:03.400" style="s2">contemplation you&#39;re learning to prefer</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.869" end="01:11:05.110" style="s2">end yourself the way you would your</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.400" end="01:11:06.340" style="s2">friend another person you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.110" end="01:11:08.440" style="s2">can&#39;t sort of be friends with somebody</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.340" end="01:11:11.920" style="s2">just by you know reading a book you have</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.440" end="01:11:12.520" style="s2">to do this this whole other thing so I</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.920" end="01:11:15.010" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.520" end="01:11:17.650" style="s2">very seriously what you said because I</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.010" end="01:11:20.830" style="s2">see it on a daily basis about you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.650" end="01:11:22.720" style="s2">trying to finesse in Pascal sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.830" end="01:11:24.880" style="s2">word trying to fit you can&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.720" end="01:11:25.840" style="s2">spirit of geometry but you have to have</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.880" end="01:11:28.000" style="s2">the spirit of finesse</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.840" end="01:11:30.280" style="s2">are you finesse yes you know this</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.000" end="01:11:33.280" style="s2">progressive you know expansion</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.280" end="01:11:34.960" style="s2">excitation increasing exposure but</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.280" end="01:11:37.420" style="s2">increasing you know building of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.960" end="01:11:39.220" style="s2">person&#39;s faith in the sense we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.420" end="01:11:41.170" style="s2">talking about it here that caught that</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.220" end="01:11:44.560" style="s2">sense of continuity of contact about</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.170" end="01:11:47.410" style="s2">activity right with you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.560" end="01:11:50.140" style="s2">vicissitudes and the fatalities of human</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.410" end="01:11:51.610" style="s2">existence yeah getting that to work very</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.140" end="01:11:54.280" style="s2">very carefully</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.610" end="01:11:56.920" style="s2">it yeah there there there&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.280" end="01:11:58.480" style="s2">there&#39;s and that&#39;s why you know Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.920" end="01:12:00.100" style="s2">was ultimately really worried and Plato</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.480" end="01:12:02.980" style="s2">was about writing things down because</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.100" end="01:12:05.080" style="s2">capturing that finesse in text is very</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.980" end="01:12:08.140" style="s2">hard but we have something different now</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.080" end="01:12:11.230" style="s2">we have this right we have this we have</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.140" end="01:12:12.490" style="s2">these things that are every every second</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.230" end="01:12:14.890" style="s2">what&#39;s happening between you and I is</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.490" end="01:12:17.830" style="s2">deeply Socratic but we can record it</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.890" end="01:12:19.510" style="s2">permanently like we used to do like text</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.830" end="01:12:21.160" style="s2">and notice the weirdness because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.510" end="01:12:23.230" style="s2">been talking about there&#39;s people the</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.160" end="01:12:24.880" style="s2">weirdness of the of the medium itself to</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.230" end="01:12:27.790" style="s2">bring up on your McLuhan point like look</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.880" end="01:12:29.860" style="s2">at how big your faces tomorrow it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.790" end="01:12:32.320" style="s2">if we were in our faces filled that our</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.860" end="01:12:33.820" style="s2">visual field we&#39;d be really close in</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.320" end="01:12:36.010" style="s2">real life right and that&#39;d be like</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.820" end="01:12:38.620" style="s2">really socially awkward but the medium</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.010" end="01:12:39.940" style="s2">accepts that kind of proximity and</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.620" end="01:12:43.030" style="s2">although were present to each other</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.940" end="01:12:45.220" style="s2">there&#39;s no spatialization so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.030" end="01:12:48.820" style="s2">way in which we&#39;re marking status or</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.220" end="01:12:51.640" style="s2">role with space right and we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.820" end="01:12:54.870" style="s2">lit right and and and it&#39;s so I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.640" end="01:12:57.880" style="s2">it&#39;s I bet Weinstein picked up on this</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.870" end="01:13:00.160" style="s2">but I&#39;m trying to do more with it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.880" end="01:13:01.900" style="s2">kind of like you know we&#39;re back to what</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.160" end="01:13:05.200" style="s2">we used to have when we were in</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.900" end="01:13:08.380" style="s2">campfires right whether the brightly lit</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.200" end="01:13:10.750" style="s2">faces closely no spatial marking of you</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.380" end="01:13:15.030" style="s2">know of status everybody and you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.750" end="01:13:19.210" style="s2">this this this communal thing and and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.030" end="01:13:21.670" style="s2">I&#39;m hoping that because we have the</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.210" end="01:13:23.650" style="s2">virtual campfires and that because they</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.670" end="01:13:26.409" style="s2">symbol on because they join together</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.650" end="01:13:28.570" style="s2">things that we thought were previously</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.409" end="01:13:31.449" style="s2">oppositional to each other which is the</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.570" end="01:13:33.100" style="s2">finesse of dialogue and the permanency</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.449" end="01:13:36.040" style="s2">of literature joins them together</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.100" end="01:13:38.409" style="s2">symbolically and exacts this primordial</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.040" end="01:13:40.449" style="s2">is primordial so CLE because we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.409" end="01:13:42.960" style="s2">sitting around campfires across several</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.449" end="01:13:45.790" style="s2">species for probably at least you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.960" end="01:13:47.500" style="s2">800,000 years or so right and Matt</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.790" end="01:13:49.420" style="s2">Rossano has talked about how that has</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.500" end="01:13:52.210" style="s2">just put the Zap on the evolution of our</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.420" end="01:13:55.330" style="s2">cognition and our intersubjectivity so</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.210" end="01:13:59.469" style="s2">this weird combination of transcending</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.330" end="01:14:02.110" style="s2">you know oral finesse and textual</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.469" end="01:14:04.870" style="s2">permanence and yet also harkening back</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.110" end="01:14:07.360" style="s2">to the primordial Atif of the campfire i</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.870" end="01:14:09.070" style="s2">think the medium therefore holds</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.360" end="01:14:12.190" style="s2">something really really precious a</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.070" end="01:14:14.139" style="s2">really precious opportunity for us it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.190" end="01:14:17.139" style="s2">enormous potential if we use it right</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.139" end="01:14:19.300" style="s2">yeah you know you either move beyond</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.139" end="01:14:21.400" style="s2">literate into non literate or you move</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.300" end="01:14:23.920" style="s2">beyond literate into trans literate yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.400" end="01:14:25.929" style="s2">it brings the brings back the oral and</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.920" end="01:14:27.850" style="s2">archaic and melds it together with the</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.929" end="01:14:30.190" style="s2">wins that we got from the cognition of</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.850" end="01:14:32.500" style="s2">reading and writing yes and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.190" end="01:14:35.290" style="s2">a one of a dozen really good arguments</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.500" end="01:14:37.870" style="s2">for why shamanism is central to the new</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.290" end="01:14:41.530" style="s2">scientific religious awakening right</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.870" end="01:14:44.560" style="s2">right the thing I wanted to say was in</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.530" end="01:14:46.090" style="s2">addition to all of those practices right</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.560" end="01:14:47.620" style="s2">bringing people in and teaching them the</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.090" end="01:14:49.199" style="s2">skills and they get a little better and</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.620" end="01:14:51.699" style="s2">they little better and down the road</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.199" end="01:14:54.040" style="s2">they&#39;re introduced to some more of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.699" end="01:14:57.040" style="s2">problems where they could use their</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.040" end="01:14:58.690" style="s2">successes in that whole process is also</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.040" end="01:15:01.389" style="s2">always under attack needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.690" end="01:15:03.550" style="s2">protected yes other guys who might</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.389" end="01:15:04.480" style="s2">exploit it from individuals exploiting</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.550" end="01:15:07.900" style="s2">it themselves</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.480" end="01:15:10.630" style="s2">is one of the pieces of religious wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.900" end="01:15:12.989" style="s2">is yeah there are demons they&#39;re our</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.630" end="01:15:16.690" style="s2">vices there are in tension like</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.989" end="01:15:20.790" style="s2">processes that are trying to subvert the</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.690" end="01:15:23.860" style="s2">successful process yes we are</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.790" end="01:15:26.260" style="s2">intentionally withdrawing collapsing</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.860" end="01:15:28.330" style="s2">sabotaging ourselves or you know and</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.260" end="01:15:31.179" style="s2">it&#39;s debatable whether we say we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:15:33.040" end="01:15:36.340" style="s2">on purpose we gain some leverage over it</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.290" end="01:15:39.460" style="s2">could go either way</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.340" end="01:15:40.000" style="s2">but there is a you know a demon is your</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.460" end="01:15:41.440" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.000" end="01:15:44.020" style="s2">translated through the lens of</p>

<p begin="01:15:44.020" end="01:15:47.800" style="s2">you and the nihilism is like that too</p>

<p begin="01:15:53.860" end="01:15:59.380" style="s2">I smash everything outside of me down so</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.590" end="01:15:59.620" style="s2">yeah the emptiness inside of me yes very</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.380" end="01:16:02.980" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.620" end="01:16:07.030" style="s2">yeah teaching each other to be vigilant</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.980" end="01:16:10.180" style="s2">and robust against our sabotage attempts</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.030" end="01:16:11.830" style="s2">systematically and personally yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.180" end="01:16:13.990" style="s2">part of the wisdom tradition has to</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.830" end="01:16:15.670" style="s2">include that and I mean of course and</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.990" end="01:16:17.980" style="s2">that was the and you know the religious</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.670" end="01:16:19.630" style="s2">institutions did provide that they</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.980" end="01:16:21.730" style="s2">provided protection mechanisms how the</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.630" end="01:16:23.470" style="s2">protection mechanisms can be like an</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.730" end="01:16:25.630" style="s2">autoimmune disorder they could they you</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.470" end="01:16:27.580" style="s2">know I&#39;m thinking of what happens you</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.630" end="01:16:28.540" style="s2">know with with the Holy Inquisition and</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.580" end="01:16:31.870" style="s2">things like that right</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.540" end="01:16:34.120" style="s2">the attempt to protect because Amina</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.870" end="01:16:36.100" style="s2">originally you know the attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.120" end="01:16:37.660" style="s2">protect people from heresy was exactly</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.100" end="01:16:39.070" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.660" end="01:16:41.020" style="s2">well now whether or not all the heretics</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.070" end="01:16:43.120" style="s2">or demonic I&#39;m not agree with the</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.020" end="01:16:46.210" style="s2">church&#39;s history but I&#39;m saying they</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.120" end="01:16:47.680" style="s2">were trying to they&#39;re trying to create</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.210" end="01:16:49.930" style="s2">the functionality you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.680" end="01:16:53.050" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to protect right and</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.930" end="01:16:54.820" style="s2">properly protect the health of people as</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.050" end="01:16:57.250" style="s2">they&#39;re moving through this very</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.820" end="01:17:01.750" style="s2">vulnerable transformative process I get</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.250" end="01:17:02.920" style="s2">that I do worry about that so let me let</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.750" end="01:17:04.120" style="s2">me be clear I think your point is</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.920" end="01:17:05.650" style="s2">exactly right that&#39;s why you heard me</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.120" end="01:17:07.180" style="s2">it&#39;s constantly saying yes yes yes</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.650" end="01:17:08.710" style="s2">throat so it&#39;s very clear that I agree</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.180" end="01:17:10.930" style="s2">with it but I&#39;m also aware of verse</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.710" end="01:17:13.450" style="s2">Lewis&#39;s argument that you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.930" end="01:17:15.430" style="s2">hunt for heresy in the West really laid</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.450" end="01:17:18.100" style="s2">the foundation for totalitarian thinking</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.430" end="01:17:19.660" style="s2">and totalitarian practices because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.100" end="01:17:23.860" style="s2">a kind of it can degenerate into a</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.660" end="01:17:27.130" style="s2">purity code kind of thing so doing</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.860" end="01:17:30.310" style="s2">teaching people and coming up with ways</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.130" end="01:17:32.770" style="s2">of protecting them I think is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.310" end="01:17:37.030" style="s2">absolutely necessary I don&#39;t I did I</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.770" end="01:17:38.590" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s unavoidable but I think</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.030" end="01:17:41.460" style="s2">attendant upon that is exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.590" end="01:17:44.350" style="s2">danger that I&#39;m expressing which is</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.460" end="01:17:46.540" style="s2">these things these things that are</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.350" end="01:17:49.270" style="s2">supposed to be the immune system if you</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.540" end="01:17:52.900" style="s2">allow me the analogy protecting the</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.270" end="01:17:54.370" style="s2">nascent spirituality and religion can</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.900" end="01:17:59.310" style="s2">become autoimmune</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.370" end="01:18:01.300" style="s2">orders in a powerful way and so what</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.310" end="01:18:03.010" style="s2">what are your thoughts on that problem</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.300" end="01:18:05.710" style="s2">that problem of trying to afford the</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.010" end="01:18:07.570" style="s2">functionality but what what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.710" end="01:18:09.100" style="s2">things in general you know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.570" end="01:18:10.420" style="s2">asking you for specific things because</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.100" end="01:18:12.510" style="s2">we can&#39;t do that yet what are the</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.420" end="01:18:15.280" style="s2">principles for dealing with that threat</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.510" end="01:18:18.760" style="s2">generally speaking there has to be on</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.280" end="01:18:21.190" style="s2">the one hand a really well understood</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.760" end="01:18:23.890" style="s2">sociological critique of those processes</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.190" end="01:18:26.200" style="s2">yes we all have to study those we all</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.890" end="01:18:28.270" style="s2">need to be better at decoding the</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.200" end="01:18:29.740" style="s2">ideology and systemic processes that</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.270" end="01:18:31.630" style="s2">were embedded in that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.740" end="01:18:32.860" style="s2">important skill going forward now we</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.630" end="01:18:37.750" style="s2">need to see those things and sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.860" end="01:18:40.750" style="s2">people are hysterically exaggerated in</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.750" end="01:18:44.590" style="s2">in calling out fascism wherever goes</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.750" end="01:18:46.840" style="s2">wrong right but that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.590" end="01:18:48.340" style="s2">dysfunctional or primitive version of</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.840" end="01:18:51.100" style="s2">something that&#39;s really accurate which</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.340" end="01:18:53.260" style="s2">is we have to be on guard against these</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.100" end="01:18:56.290" style="s2">regressive collapses in the systems</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.260" end="01:18:58.060" style="s2">we&#39;re using and you need a meta view in</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.290" end="01:19:00.310" style="s2">order to do that right traditional</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.060" end="01:19:03.070" style="s2">societies couldn&#39;t tell when they went</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.310" end="01:19:04.840" style="s2">astray yeah yeah modernity looks back</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.070" end="01:19:07.300" style="s2">and maybe dismisses them all as being</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.840" end="01:19:09.220" style="s2">astray but it can&#39;t tell when it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.300" end="01:19:11.620" style="s2">its job or going astray either so you</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.220" end="01:19:14.380" style="s2">knew this interview with something like</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.620" end="01:19:18.370" style="s2">a health and development orientation</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.380" end="01:19:20.440" style="s2">yeah and and a deep sense of how systems</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.370" end="01:19:22.630" style="s2">function especially social systems</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.440" end="01:19:24.280" style="s2">otherwise we stand around constantly</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.630" end="01:19:27.270" style="s2">looking at the failures of our social</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.280" end="01:19:29.500" style="s2">systems and it&#39;s not just you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.270" end="01:19:31.990" style="s2">heresy and people being burned at the</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.500" end="01:19:33.970" style="s2">stake it&#39;s the constant failure of our</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.990" end="01:19:36.160" style="s2">legislature to move us forward and</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.970" end="01:19:39.130" style="s2">update us probably yeah totally yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.160" end="01:19:43.240" style="s2">yeah a large part of it equally is the</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.130" end="01:19:45.820" style="s2">individuals have to have the emotional</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.240" end="01:19:49.090" style="s2">and physiological and cognitive capacity</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.820" end="01:19:51.670" style="s2">to tolerate strange sensations and we</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.090" end="01:19:54.640" style="s2">are this expansion right if they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.670" end="01:19:57.820" style="s2">feel that if they can&#39;t think well maybe</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.640" end="01:20:00.750" style="s2">it&#39;s okay to be heretical right that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.820" end="01:20:03.640" style="s2">risky emotion in the bodies of people</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.750" end="01:20:05.320" style="s2">and you have to be able to relax and</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.640" end="01:20:08.099" style="s2">feel into that you have to have a</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.320" end="01:20:10.590" style="s2">background of many practices of relaxing</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.099" end="01:20:12.989" style="s2">and feeling into uncomfortable things so</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.590" end="01:20:14.429" style="s2">that in the moment you can go let&#39;s hold</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.989" end="01:20:16.439" style="s2">on maybe this needs to be protected</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.429" end="01:20:18.869" style="s2">against or maybe I&#39;m just reacting</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.439" end="01:20:21.570" style="s2">against the weird feeling here yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.869" end="01:20:24.269" style="s2">that&#39;s opportunity is something that</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.570" end="01:20:26.099" style="s2">comes out of a practice but also comes</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.269" end="01:20:28.619" style="s2">out of bodies being healthy enough to</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.099" end="01:20:31.109" style="s2">let strange sensations go through them</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.619" end="01:20:33.239" style="s2">bodies and minds bodies and minds yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.109" end="01:20:35.369" style="s2">and hearts yeah bodies and minds north</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.239" end="01:20:37.379" style="s2">so this time in this DuckTales I think</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.369" end="01:20:40.079" style="s2">with one of Zack Zack Stein&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.379" end="01:20:42.239" style="s2">central arguments that you know the</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.079" end="01:20:45.090" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.239" end="01:20:48.449" style="s2">the the the reconstitution of the wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.090" end="01:20:51.149" style="s2">projects are inevitably bound up with</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.449" end="01:20:53.849" style="s2">you know you know as a significant</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.149" end="01:20:56.369" style="s2">pedagogical Reformation Reformation</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.849" end="01:20:59.309" style="s2">right you know the way we&#39;re educating</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.369" end="01:21:02.070" style="s2">people we&#39;re now educating them under</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.309" end="01:21:03.869" style="s2">the sole normativity of the market we</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.070" end="01:21:05.909" style="s2">used to educate them also under science</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.869" end="01:21:08.129" style="s2">but even that&#39;s now being more and more</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.909" end="01:21:10.169" style="s2">co-opted but what can this do to make us</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.129" end="01:21:11.999" style="s2">better producers and consumers once</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.169" end="01:21:14.340" style="s2">again as I get labeled with this</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.999" end="01:21:16.789" style="s2">unfairly are not some sort of raving</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.340" end="01:21:20.369" style="s2">anti capitalist I&#39;m just I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.789" end="01:21:22.859" style="s2">criticizing the market does things yes</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.369" end="01:21:24.749" style="s2">it does but to believe that it does all</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.859" end="01:21:26.129" style="s2">things and it does things that to</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.749" end="01:21:29.189" style="s2">believe that it&#39;s omnipotent and</p>

<p begin="01:21:29.189" end="01:21:35.969" style="s2">foolish idolatry and so one way is to</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.929" end="01:21:38.189" style="s2">follow up and Zack explicitly agreed</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.969" end="01:21:39.959" style="s2">with this in person you know that we</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.189" end="01:21:41.820" style="s2">should be educating people not just</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.959" end="01:21:43.199" style="s2">under the normativity of the market we</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.820" end="01:21:46.320" style="s2">should be educating them under the</p>

<p begin="01:21:46.320" end="01:21:50.909" style="s2">know spirituality the religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.300" end="01:21:55.159" style="s2">not a religion wisdom and how to protect</p>

<p begin="01:21:55.159" end="01:21:59.399" style="s2">individual or vulnerable group that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.599" end="01:22:01.260" style="s2">going through some liminal</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.399" end="01:22:03.570" style="s2">transformative transition and</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.260" end="01:22:06.829" style="s2">transformation yes I think our education</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.570" end="01:22:09.359" style="s2">system has to be really broadly</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.829" end="01:22:10.709" style="s2">reconfigured and we&#39;re actually in we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.359" end="01:22:12.719" style="s2">right in this we&#39;re right we&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.709" end="01:22:14.579" style="s2">right now but we have to the virus has</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.719" end="01:22:16.649" style="s2">forced us that&#39;s part of his point to</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.579" end="01:22:18.840" style="s2">consider I&#39;ll turn deeply things that</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.649" end="01:22:20.519" style="s2">we&#39;re now a radical no you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.840" end="01:22:22.440" style="s2">your key people that well baby maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.519" end="01:22:25.890" style="s2">can right</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.440" end="01:22:28.320" style="s2">and so there&#39;s uh I think that that what</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.890" end="01:22:31.050" style="s2">you just said dovetails very very nicely</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.320" end="01:22:32.850" style="s2">with his overall art argument about you</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.050" end="01:22:35.130" style="s2">know just a fundamental need to</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.850" end="01:22:38.040" style="s2">transform our pedagogical vision like at</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.130" end="01:22:41.520" style="s2">a very very deep very deep level and a</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.040" end="01:22:43.320" style="s2">very comprehensive level no I agree with</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.520" end="01:22:45.990" style="s2">that completely that we I mean a huge</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.320" end="01:22:47.670" style="s2">part of all of this is reformulating</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.990" end="01:22:50.520" style="s2">what our basic educational principles</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.670" end="01:22:52.500" style="s2">are yeah right and that&#39;s gonna go</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.520" end="01:22:55.110" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna run against ways in which</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.500" end="01:22:57.630" style="s2">they&#39;ve been currently adapted to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.110" end="01:22:58.530" style="s2">exploited by particular versions of</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.630" end="01:23:00.900" style="s2">markets</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.530" end="01:23:02.220" style="s2">yes exactly well said it&#39;s gonna go up</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.900" end="01:23:04.440" style="s2">against a whole bunch of people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.220" end="01:23:07.020" style="s2">anxiety about making any change to those</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.440" end="01:23:09.180" style="s2">processes and it&#39;s gonna run up against</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.020" end="01:23:11.370" style="s2">the problem of we don&#39;t necessarily know</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.180" end="01:23:13.530" style="s2">what are all the changes we need to make</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.370" end="01:23:14.940" style="s2">yeah exactly right and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.530" end="01:23:16.260" style="s2">difference between knowledge and</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.940" end="01:23:19.080" style="s2">understanding what does it really mean</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.260" end="01:23:21.000" style="s2">to assimilate something now do you get</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.080" end="01:23:22.770" style="s2">better how do you grow what what</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.000" end="01:23:25.770" style="s2">actually does that and what never</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.770" end="01:23:27.660" style="s2">mattered in that process those are deep</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.770" end="01:23:30.150" style="s2">questions and that&#39;s a big project and</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.660" end="01:23:31.710" style="s2">it&#39;d be yeah I think and you know of</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.150" end="01:23:33.750" style="s2">course there&#39;s also questions that Plato</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.710" end="01:23:35.430" style="s2">famously brought into the dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.750" end="01:23:36.870" style="s2">questions about education and he</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.430" end="01:23:39.420" style="s2">proposed all kinds of educational</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.870" end="01:23:41.730" style="s2">reforms and you know some of them I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.420" end="01:23:44.940" style="s2">critical of but the intent and what he</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.730" end="01:23:48.030" style="s2">was trying to do was I think meet the</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.940" end="01:23:49.920" style="s2">demand that Zack is pointing to well um</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.030" end="01:23:51.540" style="s2">I think that&#39;s sort of a good place to</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.920" end="01:23:56.700" style="s2">wrap it up and I did we go to much</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.540" end="01:23:59.070" style="s2">longer nobody will watch this video this</p>
