<p begin="00:01:09.360" end="00:01:13.740" style="s2">younger person have helped you inform</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.820" end="00:01:15.689" style="s2">your perspective about the online world</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.740" end="00:01:18.119" style="s2">can you tell us a little bit about your</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.689" end="00:01:20.850" style="s2">magic days and what that perspective has</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.119" end="00:01:22.500" style="s2">provided yeah I always start with magic</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.850" end="00:01:24.630" style="s2">because if you start by looking at what</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.500" end="00:01:26.729" style="s2">technology is doing that the common</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.630" end="00:01:28.409" style="s2">metaphor is people think well it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.729" end="00:01:31.170" style="s2">about how we&#39;re using technology but</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.409" end="00:01:32.520" style="s2">we&#39;re the ones using it and the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.170" end="00:01:34.409" style="s2">premise of I think the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.520" end="00:01:36.600" style="s2">conversation will have today is really</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.409" end="00:01:39.180" style="s2">more about how is technology influencing</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.600" end="00:01:41.729" style="s2">us and the reason I go to the magic</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.180" end="00:01:45.240" style="s2">metaphor so often in my childhood is</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.729" end="00:01:47.460" style="s2">it&#39;s about recognizing a symmetries of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.240" end="00:01:48.960" style="s2">power like an asymmetric advantage and</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.460" end="00:01:52.380" style="s2">that&#39;s what a magician essentially has</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.960" end="00:01:54.299" style="s2">over you is there&#39;s a sense of they know</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.380" end="00:01:56.040" style="s2">something about your mind that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.299" end="00:01:57.810" style="s2">know about yourself because if you did</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.040" end="00:01:59.520" style="s2">know that about yourself the magic trick</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.810" end="00:02:01.729" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t work and what&#39;s especially</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.520" end="00:02:06.479" style="s2">interesting to me about magic is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.729" end="00:02:08.429" style="s2">the universality of the things that a</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.479" end="00:02:11.099" style="s2">magician knows about all human minds and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.429" end="00:02:13.810" style="s2">the fact that even a nuclear physicist</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.099" end="00:02:15.550" style="s2">can easily be fooled by a magician</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.810" end="00:02:18.280" style="s2">there it&#39;s actually doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.550" end="00:02:21.040" style="s2">matter what domain of expertise or PhD</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.280" end="00:02:22.840" style="s2">you have magic is about a subtler layer</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.040" end="00:02:24.819" style="s2">of human vulnerabilities think of them</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.840" end="00:02:27.550" style="s2">like the zero day vulnerabilities of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.819" end="00:02:29.380" style="s2">back doors on the human mind in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.550" end="00:02:33.250" style="s2">cause-and-effect reasoning in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.380" end="00:02:34.930" style="s2">attention in terms of misdirection and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.250" end="00:02:36.760" style="s2">that&#39;s obviously the kind of basic stuff</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.930" end="00:02:38.950" style="s2">that is you go more advanced there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.760" end="00:02:40.599" style="s2">whole long list of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.950" end="00:02:42.489" style="s2">features and I think one last thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.599" end="00:02:44.980" style="s2">there is that magicians are kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.489" end="00:02:46.780" style="s2">the first applied psychologists because</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.980" end="00:02:48.340" style="s2">way before we had in official fields of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.780" end="00:02:50.590" style="s2">psychology they were figuring these</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.340" end="00:02:52.510" style="s2">things out and they didn&#39;t even name the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.590" end="00:02:53.769" style="s2">principles but they had this whole kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.510" end="00:02:56.170" style="s2">of library of things that they were</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.769" end="00:02:57.850" style="s2">aware of and started to to exploit makes</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.170" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">perfect sense you&#39;ve also mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.850" end="00:03:02.980" style="s2">working with the famous or maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:05.709" style="s2">infamous Stanford persuasive technology</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.980" end="00:03:08.110" style="s2">lab who are they and what impact do they</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.709" end="00:03:10.299" style="s2">have on our situation and on your</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.110" end="00:03:12.519" style="s2">perspectives so at Stanford I studied</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.299" end="00:03:15.099" style="s2">computer science and so I have a typical</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.519" end="00:03:16.390" style="s2">computer science background but I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.099" end="00:03:18.670" style="s2">mostly interested in the psychology</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.390" end="00:03:20.290" style="s2">cognitive science sort of dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.670" end="00:03:22.840" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a major at Stanford</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.290" end="00:03:25.269" style="s2">called symbolic systems that you know a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.840" end="00:03:27.459" style="s2">lot of alumni famous alumni like Reid</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.269" end="00:03:28.810" style="s2">Hoffman and Scott Forstall the guy who&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.459" end="00:03:31.239" style="s2">been at the iPhone were actually in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.810" end="00:03:33.250" style="s2">program that I was kind of more oriented</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.239" end="00:03:35.049" style="s2">to and part of that program there was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.250" end="00:03:36.910" style="s2">class by this one professor named BJ</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.049" end="00:03:39.069" style="s2">Fogg and from his lab called the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.910" end="00:03:40.690" style="s2">Stanford persuasive technology lab where</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.069" end="00:03:43.420" style="s2">they essentially took everything we knew</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.690" end="00:03:45.220" style="s2">about the field of persuasion influence</p>

<p begin="00:03:56.290" end="00:04:00.910" style="s2">if we were to embed that in technology</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.940" end="00:04:03.100" style="s2">you know could technology be an</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.910" end="00:04:07.299" style="s2">influence over your attitudes beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.100" end="00:04:09.010" style="s2">behaviors habits and you know I that</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.299" end="00:04:11.230" style="s2">class there&#39;s a whole history we can go</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.010" end="00:04:12.700" style="s2">into there but the founders of Instagram</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.230" end="00:04:14.470" style="s2">were in that class many of the early</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.700" end="00:04:16.630" style="s2">alumni that went on to join the growth</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.470" end="00:04:19.690" style="s2">teams at the early tech companies uber</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.630" end="00:04:22.270" style="s2">LinkedIn Facebook many people went on</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.690" end="00:04:24.700" style="s2">and because it gave a tool set how to</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.270" end="00:04:27.010" style="s2">build more and more engaging products</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.700" end="00:04:27.700" style="s2">and just want a name really quickly that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.010" end="00:04:29.890" style="s2">the professor</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.700" end="00:04:32.380" style="s2">BJ Fogg is often vilified I think in</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.890" end="00:04:33.730" style="s2">incorrectly because he warned the FTC</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.380" end="00:04:35.230" style="s2">about the dangers of persuasive</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.730" end="00:04:37.960" style="s2">technology and where this could go back</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.230" end="00:04:40.540" style="s2">in the late 90s I think it was 1996 and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.960" end="00:04:43.390" style="s2">he has always tried to apply persuasive</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.540" end="00:04:45.610" style="s2">technology for for good things like</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.390" end="00:04:47.380" style="s2">world peace he actually had a project</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.610" end="00:04:49.510" style="s2">called peace dot which was like peace</p>

<p begin="00:04:49.510" end="00:04:53.860" style="s2">where each tech company would ask how</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.580" end="00:04:55.720" style="s2">could it be persuading the world towards</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.860" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">world peace we can go into these topics</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.720" end="00:04:58.930" style="s2">if you if you want to is there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:05:00.880" style="s2">of detail here yeah I think the takeaway</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.930" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">here and sort of something everyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.880" end="00:05:05.770" style="s2">needs to understand is that these are</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:07.450" style="s2">deeply designed systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.770" end="00:05:10.660" style="s2">he&#39;s funny you mentioned slot machines</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.450" end="00:05:13.330" style="s2">the first time this issue of deeply</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.660" end="00:05:14.980" style="s2">cognitive science informed technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.330" end="00:05:17.860" style="s2">was one a business friend of mine went</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.980" end="00:05:19.960" style="s2">to work as the CEO of the third largest</p>

<p begin="00:05:33.730" end="00:05:38.310" style="s2">staff and he said they all came from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.190" end="00:05:40.930" style="s2">disciplines where people are basically</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.310" end="00:05:42.730" style="s2">torturing rats and make them do various</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.930" end="00:05:44.770" style="s2">things so I go that&#39;s great</p>

<p begin="00:05:54.040" end="00:05:59.200" style="s2">on this was last year I published an</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.860" end="00:06:01.630" style="s2">essay called regaining our cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.200" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">sovereignty about how you know people</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.630" end="00:06:06.190" style="s2">have become addicted to smartphones in</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:08.260" style="s2">particular and one of the data points I</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.190" end="00:06:10.300" style="s2">dug up when I was writing that was I</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.260" end="00:06:12.190" style="s2">went to the Facebook internal job board</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.300" end="00:06:16.900" style="s2">or I guess publicly facing job board and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.190" end="00:06:19.150" style="s2">typed in psychology and 708 openings at</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.900" end="00:06:21.640" style="s2">Facebook had the word psychology in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.150" end="00:06:23.950" style="s2">job description and so again that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.640" end="00:06:25.630" style="s2">aha you know these people</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.950" end="00:06:27.340" style="s2">makes perfect sense if I was them I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.630" end="00:06:29.650" style="s2">doing the same thing it&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.340" end="00:06:32.530" style="s2">bring in serious talent that understands</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.650" end="00:06:35.290" style="s2">how the human mind works and uses that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.530" end="00:06:37.120" style="s2">insight to make these products way more</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.290" end="00:06:39.670" style="s2">effective at pushing our buttons and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.120" end="00:06:41.650" style="s2">we&#39;d have any idea and it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.670" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">note that this is a new unique</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.650" end="00:06:45.160" style="s2">phenomenon I mean you know the hammer</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:47.259" style="s2">that might be sitting in your shed does</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.160" end="00:06:48.520" style="s2">not have a thousand phd&#39;s behind it</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.259" end="00:06:50.199" style="s2">trying to figure out how do they get you</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.520" end="00:06:52.419" style="s2">to use the hammer in the particular way</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.199" end="00:06:54.460" style="s2">even your telephone back in the nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.419" end="00:06:55.690" style="s2">seventies didn&#39;t have a thousand PhDs</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.460" end="00:06:57.250" style="s2">behind it trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.690" end="00:06:59.020" style="s2">use your social psychology and do</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.250" end="00:07:00.220" style="s2">experiments on rats to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.020" end="00:07:02.949" style="s2">get them to talk through the telephone</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.220" end="00:07:04.570" style="s2">right so they these were tools and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.949" end="00:07:05.979" style="s2">what&#39;s really changed this is why we</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.570" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">really focus on this aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.979" end="00:07:11.560" style="s2">persuasive technology as what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:13.120" style="s2">accusing as the problem is the degree of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.560" end="00:07:14.740" style="s2">asymmetry you know that the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.120" end="00:07:16.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a thousand engineers behind the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.740" end="00:07:17.380" style="s2">screen who knew a lot more about our</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.150" end="00:07:19.000" style="s2">psychology than we know about ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.380" end="00:07:20.380" style="s2">well I think you&#39;re certainly right</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.000" end="00:07:22.180" style="s2">about the hammer but I&#39;m gonna push back</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.380" end="00:07:23.860" style="s2">just a little bit and this is a theme</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.180" end="00:07:26.050" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna push on a couple of times to</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.860" end="00:07:27.699" style="s2">distinguish between what was going on in</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.050" end="00:07:30.220" style="s2">the previous generation and the current</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.699" end="00:07:32.729" style="s2">generation there was a technology before</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.220" end="00:07:35.050" style="s2">online that was amazingly</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.729" end="00:07:37.539" style="s2">psychologically informed both from</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.050" end="00:07:39.610" style="s2">academic psychology and in practice and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.539" end="00:07:41.199" style="s2">that is TV advertising in fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.610" end="00:07:43.870" style="s2">advertising and in general but</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.199" end="00:07:46.330" style="s2">particularly TV advertising these things</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.870" end="00:07:48.940" style="s2">were amazingly expensively produced</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.330" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">still are I assume and they did all</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.940" end="00:07:53.979" style="s2">kinds of tests including EEG etc so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:55.810" style="s2">not like this has not been something</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.979" end="00:07:57.849" style="s2">we&#39;ve confronted before well this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.810" end="00:07:59.800" style="s2">what always comes up I feel like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.849" end="00:08:01.360" style="s2">I&#39;ve spent a decade now having the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.800" end="00:08:05.020" style="s2">conversation of but haven&#39;t we always</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.360" end="00:08:07.479" style="s2">had propaganda TV marketing advertising</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.020" end="00:08:10.360" style="s2">etc what could be so alarming or bad</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.479" end="00:08:12.460" style="s2">about what we have now it really is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.360" end="00:08:14.590" style="s2">new unprecedented situation I think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.460" end="00:08:16.300" style="s2">you know if someone was telling you</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.590" end="00:08:17.650" style="s2">about an atomic bomb but you were</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.300" end="00:08:18.639" style="s2">already we&#39;re irregular bombs I said</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.650" end="00:08:21.220" style="s2">well I said this bombs just a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.639" end="00:08:23.470" style="s2">bomb they didn&#39;t show you like an entire</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.220" end="00:08:24.699" style="s2">city getting obliterated you say it just</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.470" end="00:08:25.810" style="s2">sounds like it&#39;s a bigger bomb than the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.699" end="00:08:28.270" style="s2">other bombs I mean there&#39;s nothing new</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.810" end="00:08:30.099" style="s2">here and you know in this case with</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.270" end="00:08:33.089" style="s2">atomic bombs you can actually visually</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.099" end="00:08:36.459" style="s2">see the just stunning degree of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.089" end="00:08:37.120" style="s2">exponential damage and scope that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.459" end="00:08:39.550" style="s2">can create</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.120" end="00:08:42.430" style="s2">whereas in technology I think the degree</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.550" end="00:08:45.580" style="s2">of advancement in the persuasion</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.430" end="00:08:47.410" style="s2">capacity is not in the visible domains</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.580" end="00:08:48.850" style="s2">you can&#39;t use your eyeball to see how</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.410" end="00:08:51.160" style="s2">big it is right and we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.850" end="00:08:53.470" style="s2">intuition for what billions of people</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.160" end="00:08:55.640" style="s2">being influenced by these things really</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.470" end="00:08:57.200" style="s2">looks like if we wanted to slow it down</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.640" end="00:08:58.850" style="s2">there&#39;s at least four major distinct</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.200" end="00:09:00.200" style="s2">things that are that are different</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.850" end="00:09:01.460" style="s2">usually supposed to say there&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.200" end="00:09:03.890" style="s2">things because three so much easier to</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.460" end="00:09:07.220" style="s2">remember let&#39;s go with four the first is</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.890" end="00:09:10.640" style="s2">the intimacy and pervasiveness of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.220" end="00:09:12.680" style="s2">infrastructure so TV you know used to</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.640" end="00:09:13.880" style="s2">have to watch TV you choose to watch it</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.680" end="00:09:15.830" style="s2">it was in your living room maybe it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.880" end="00:09:17.540" style="s2">periodically but you know an</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.830" end="00:09:19.010" style="s2">advertisement has to reach you through a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.540" end="00:09:20.930" style="s2">channel you happen to be watching but</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.010" end="00:09:23.450" style="s2">it&#39;s not like built into the fabric of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.930" end="00:09:25.820" style="s2">your walls in your home whereas the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.450" end="00:09:28.760" style="s2">smartphone we check 150 times a day we</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.820" end="00:09:30.230" style="s2">have 2.7 billion people using Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.760" end="00:09:32.120" style="s2">that&#39;s about one and a half times the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.230" end="00:09:34.700" style="s2">size of Christianity in terms of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.120" end="00:09:36.020" style="s2">psychological footprint we wake up with</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.700" end="00:09:37.580" style="s2">the thing ever since you know we turn</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.020" end="00:09:39.350" style="s2">off our alarm in the morning so the time</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.580" end="00:09:41.690" style="s2">we go to bed at night so that first</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.350" end="00:09:44.150" style="s2">characteristic is the sort of intimate</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.690" end="00:09:46.820" style="s2">infrastructure aspect the pervasiveness</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.150" end="00:09:48.890" style="s2">the second is the social persuasive</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.820" end="00:09:50.570" style="s2">element one of the things I learned at</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.890" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">the Stanford persuasive technology lab</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.570" end="00:09:56.450" style="s2">is how much more powerful persuasion can</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:59.120" style="s2">be if you can control the social</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.450" end="00:10:00.590" style="s2">psychological cues that people are using</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.120" end="00:10:02.930" style="s2">to make sense of what&#39;s true or what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.590" end="00:10:05.240" style="s2">real or what to do and if you can say</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.930" end="00:10:08.060" style="s2">that well 300 of your friends liked or</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.240" end="00:10:09.680" style="s2">shared this or you have five people</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.060" end="00:10:11.540" style="s2">watching you as you&#39;re doing this action</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.680" end="00:10:14.180" style="s2">right now they&#39;re little eyeballs or on</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.540" end="00:10:15.710" style="s2">the screen the social persuasiveness is</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.180" end="00:10:18.020" style="s2">very powerful this gets into things like</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.710" end="00:10:21.350" style="s2">the Asch conformity experiments and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.020" end="00:10:22.880" style="s2">on the third aspect is AI and this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.350" end="00:10:24.860" style="s2">probably the one that&#39;s hardest for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.880" end="00:10:27.680" style="s2">brain to kind of into it but it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.860" end="00:10:29.840" style="s2">there is a the ability to make and run</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.680" end="00:10:31.280" style="s2">predictions about what you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.840" end="00:10:32.810" style="s2">do and what would cause you to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.280" end="00:10:34.370" style="s2">something you know every single time you</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.810" end="00:10:36.290" style="s2">use YouTube and you say I&#39;m gonna watch</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.370" end="00:10:38.060" style="s2">this one video and then I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.290" end="00:10:39.800" style="s2">done you know and then you end up</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.060" end="00:10:41.120" style="s2">watching for two hours and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.800" end="00:10:42.500" style="s2">what the hell just happened to me you</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:44.150" style="s2">know I fell into a YouTube trance and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.500" end="00:10:45.980" style="s2">you say well I guess I should have had</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.150" end="00:10:47.300" style="s2">more self-control but what was really</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.980" end="00:10:47.990" style="s2">going on is when you hit play on a</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.300" end="00:10:49.820" style="s2">YouTube video</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.990" end="00:10:51.260" style="s2">there was an AI on the other side of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.820" end="00:10:53.240" style="s2">screen you know you activate all of</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.260" end="00:10:55.160" style="s2">Google&#39;s multibillion-dollar computing</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.240" end="00:10:57.200" style="s2">infrastructure and it wakes up a little</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.160" end="00:10:59.780" style="s2">avatar voodoo doll version of you it</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.200" end="00:11:01.190" style="s2">does you know a calculation on a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.780" end="00:11:02.450" style="s2">million different recommended videos it</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.190" end="00:11:03.950" style="s2">could show you next and it makes a</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.450" end="00:11:05.690" style="s2">prediction about which one I could show</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.950" end="00:11:07.790" style="s2">you that would cause you to stay here</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.690" end="00:11:09.710" style="s2">and so we don&#39;t really think about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.790" end="00:11:11.420" style="s2">unfairness of this fight between our</p>

<p begin="00:11:11.420" end="00:11:13.820" style="s2">screen and then the biggest</p>

<p begin="00:11:13.820" end="00:11:17.750" style="s2">world on the other side the last thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.250" end="00:11:19.040" style="s2">I&#39;ll mention is that AI is used for</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.750" end="00:11:21.410" style="s2">personalization so the fourth</p>

<p begin="00:12:23.330" end="00:12:28.220" style="s2">understand a lot of people do and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.120" end="00:12:30.020" style="s2">know one issue that you brought up for</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.220" end="00:12:32.750" style="s2">sure and other people have as well is</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.020" end="00:12:35.990" style="s2">that these algorithms not that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.750" end="00:12:38.960" style="s2">aimed to suck people in to extremism but</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.990" end="00:12:41.990" style="s2">because of the way our cognitive systems</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.960" end="00:12:43.940" style="s2">operate we respond more powerfully to</p>

<p begin="00:12:55.010" end="00:12:59.920" style="s2">that yeah well I&#39;d like to go even</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.380" end="00:13:02.600" style="s2">stronger and say that the regime of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.920" end="00:13:04.610" style="s2">social platforms and YouTube and so on</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.600" end="00:13:06.710" style="s2">that we have basically jacked into the</p>

<p begin="00:13:14.360" end="00:13:17.360" style="s2">might sound like extreme statements but</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.620" end="00:13:18.890" style="s2">I hope we get into defending why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.360" end="00:13:20.600" style="s2">actually the case because I want people</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.890" end="00:13:22.580" style="s2">to not see this as a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.600" end="00:13:23.540" style="s2">between you know are we addicted to</p>

<p begin="00:13:33.199" end="00:13:37.279" style="s2">specifically so you know we have at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.990" end="00:13:40.250" style="s2">Center for Humane technology a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.279" end="00:13:42.589" style="s2">ex tech whistleblowers who are building</p>

<p begin="00:13:44.660" end="00:13:49.670" style="s2">amazing researcher and whistleblower who</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.959" end="00:13:52.250" style="s2">built part of the YouTube recommendation</p>

<p begin="00:13:52.250" end="00:13:56.540" style="s2">have you paid for your YouTube account</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.329" end="00:13:58.759" style="s2">recently yeah nothing all right nothing</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.540" end="00:14:00.170" style="s2">so and how is YouTube well and Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.759" end="00:14:02.209" style="s2">etc worth more than a trillion and a</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.170" end="00:14:04.819" style="s2">half dollars a market value they sell</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.209" end="00:14:06.170" style="s2">attention and obviously that is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.819" end="00:14:08.750" style="s2">product that&#39;s actually more precisely</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.170" end="00:14:11.690" style="s2">as Jaron Lanier would say the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.750" end="00:14:14.930" style="s2">just imperceptibly change your identity</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.690" end="00:14:16.880" style="s2">belief behaviors etc is the product so</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.930" end="00:14:18.410" style="s2">the capacity to influence you is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.880" end="00:14:21.829" style="s2">product and they need your attention to</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.410" end="00:14:24.259" style="s2">do that and because you know YouTube is</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.829" end="00:14:25.790" style="s2">competing with TV and with Facebook for</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.259" end="00:14:28.190" style="s2">attention it needs to get more and more</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.790" end="00:14:30.199" style="s2">aggressive over time so they&#39;ll start</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.190" end="00:14:33.230" style="s2">adding things like autoplay etc and a</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.199" end="00:14:34.940" style="s2">lot of people don&#39;t know that 70% of the</p>

<p begin="00:14:34.940" end="00:14:40.040" style="s2">YouTube is driven by the recommendation</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.069" end="00:14:41.569" style="s2">systems 70% it&#39;s not like we open up</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.040" end="00:14:43.670" style="s2">YouTube there&#39;s this blank white box and</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.569" end="00:14:45.230" style="s2">we just click the videos that we want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.670" end="00:14:46.670" style="s2">watch or type type in the search terms</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.230" end="00:14:49.310" style="s2">we want we do that too but we do that</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.670" end="00:14:51.350" style="s2">vast minority of the time mostly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.310" end="00:14:52.760" style="s2">the autoplay so now you imagine okay so</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.350" end="00:14:54.889" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t seem so bad let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.760" end="00:14:56.569" style="s2">AI pointed at my brain gets me to watch</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.889" end="00:14:58.670" style="s2">one more video doesn&#39;t seems like such a</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.569" end="00:15:00.230" style="s2">bad deal the question is what is it</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.670" end="00:15:01.880" style="s2">actually steering people to do and</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.230" end="00:15:03.649" style="s2">notice that it&#39;s not us that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.880" end="00:15:05.480" style="s2">responsible for what we watch it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.649" end="00:15:07.880" style="s2">mainly YouTube here because it&#39;s got the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.480" end="00:15:10.220" style="s2">asymmetric influence and 70% is driven</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.880" end="00:15:11.420" style="s2">by it and you know the metaphor we like</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.220" end="00:15:13.490" style="s2">to give people here is if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.420" end="00:15:15.350" style="s2">line up all the trillions and trillions</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.490" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">of videos that are on YouTube on one</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.350" end="00:15:19.430" style="s2">axis one spectrum and on the left-hand</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.360" end="00:15:22.850" style="s2">side of the spectrum you have Walter</p>

<p begin="00:15:29.420" end="00:15:33.470" style="s2">side you have crazy town</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.920" end="00:15:35.670" style="s2">you have the extreme conspiracy theories</p>

<p begin="00:15:40.860" end="00:15:45.780" style="s2">spectrum starting at any video anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.200" end="00:15:48.330" style="s2">from calm to crazy when YouTube wants</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.780" end="00:15:50.250" style="s2">you to watch more on that axis which</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.330" end="00:15:51.690" style="s2">which way is it going to send you if it</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.250" end="00:15:53.970" style="s2">wants you to watch more videos</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.690" end="00:15:55.320" style="s2">it&#39;s never gonna send you to calm videos</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.970" end="00:15:58.050" style="s2">because those are not really good for</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.320" end="00:16:00.030" style="s2">engagement and so conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.050" end="00:16:02.520" style="s2">extremism or things that further affirm</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.030" end="00:16:04.530" style="s2">your existing worldview are the things</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.520" end="00:16:06.690" style="s2">that get more traffic so now if you zoom</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.530" end="00:16:08.850" style="s2">out and imagine a kind of godlike view</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.690" end="00:16:11.100" style="s2">of the attention economy you&#39;ve got 2.7</p>

<p begin="00:16:17.700" end="00:16:22.200" style="s2">the more extreme stuff and I want people</p>

<p begin="00:17:11.880" end="00:17:14.850" style="s2">government&#39;s been lying and science has</p>

<p begin="00:17:19.800" end="00:17:23.940" style="s2">can&#39;t trust anything that science is</p>

<p begin="00:18:43.299" end="00:18:49.000" style="s2">have proof that trope was colluding with</p>

<p begin="00:20:08.890" end="00:20:13.720" style="s2">coined is that humans are approximately</p>

<p begin="00:20:24.010" end="00:20:26.950" style="s2">into the cognitive psychology of</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.450" end="00:20:28.899" style="s2">intelligence I&#39;d like to go down a long</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.950" end="00:20:30.730" style="s2">list on how you could make way smarter</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.899" end="00:20:33.010" style="s2">intelligence than us so let&#39;s assume</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.730" end="00:20:35.110" style="s2">we&#39;re the stupidest possible general</p>

<p begin="00:21:30.820" end="00:21:35.019" style="s2">of more propaganda than there is actual</p>

<p begin="00:21:35.019" end="00:21:39.250" style="s2">of I think people often underestimate</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.580" end="00:21:41.350" style="s2">the degree to which we&#39;ve hollowed out</p>

<p begin="00:21:41.350" end="00:21:45.130" style="s2">our sense making and one thing I like to</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.899" end="00:21:47.470" style="s2">do to give people as a metaphor for this</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.130" end="00:21:48.850" style="s2">is you know newspapers thought that they</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.470" end="00:21:51.429" style="s2">were in the truth business that their</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.850" end="00:21:52.570" style="s2">product was selling truth but when these</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.429" end="00:21:54.100" style="s2">tech companies come well actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.570" end="00:21:56.049" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of two phases to this the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.100" end="00:21:57.760" style="s2">first phase was when Craigslist came</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.049" end="00:21:59.110" style="s2">along newspapers realized actually they</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.760" end="00:22:01.059" style="s2">weren&#39;t in the truth business they were</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.110" end="00:22:02.769" style="s2">in the classifieds business because</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.059" end="00:22:04.720" style="s2">classic Craigslist came along and ate</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.769" end="00:22:05.830" style="s2">their lunch and suddenly they had to</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.720" end="00:22:08.230" style="s2">figure out how to make the online</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.830" end="00:22:10.179" style="s2">advertising thing work and do a hybrid</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.230" end="00:22:11.679" style="s2">business model etcetera that was the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.179" end="00:22:12.789" style="s2">first phase of newspapers realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.679" end="00:22:14.590" style="s2">weren&#39;t actually in the truth business</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.789" end="00:22:15.669" style="s2">then the second phase comes along after</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.590" end="00:22:16.690" style="s2">they figured out how to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.669" end="00:22:19.030" style="s2">stabilize after Craig</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.690" end="00:22:19.810" style="s2">came and took their classifieds which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.030" end="00:22:21.790" style="s2">they thought they were in the truth</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.810" end="00:22:23.110" style="s2">business again but then what they</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.790" end="00:22:24.910" style="s2">actually realized as they were in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.110" end="00:22:26.860" style="s2">attention business not the classifieds</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.910" end="00:22:29.490" style="s2">business the reason that they found that</p>

<p begin="00:22:29.490" end="00:22:33.370" style="s2">imagine two black black boxes right in</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.110" end="00:22:35.770" style="s2">the black box on the left you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.370" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">essentially a news organization Wall</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.770" end="00:22:39.160" style="s2">Street Journal New York Times etc you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:40.300" style="s2">got to pay those journalists hundred</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.160" end="00:22:41.470" style="s2">thousand dollars a year or two hundred</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.300" end="00:22:42.790" style="s2">thousand dollars a year you got to pay</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.470" end="00:22:44.560" style="s2">those editors you&#39;ve got to pay for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.790" end="00:22:46.510" style="s2">Iraq security details you&#39;ve got to pay</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.560" end="00:22:47.890" style="s2">for the long time it takes to do an</p>

<p begin="00:22:47.890" end="00:22:49.870" style="s2">interview witnesses you&#39;ve got to do</p>

<p begin="00:22:51.490" end="00:22:54.460" style="s2">to be perfect but there&#39;s some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.810" end="00:22:57.130" style="s2">notion of process and there&#39;s human</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.460" end="00:22:59.590" style="s2">moral judgment involved and that is an</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.130" end="00:23:01.780" style="s2">expensive set of inputs to produce what</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.590" end="00:23:04.780" style="s2">on the output side well an article or a</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.780" end="00:23:05.950" style="s2">newspaper report and that generates a</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.780" end="00:23:08.140" style="s2">certain amount of attention and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.950" end="00:23:09.970" style="s2">that sold to advertisers but it comes at</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.140" end="00:23:12.850" style="s2">a very high cost of paying all those</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.970" end="00:23:16.120" style="s2">human beings so then YouTube Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.850" end="00:23:18.010" style="s2">Twitter etc come along and especially</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.120" end="00:23:19.690" style="s2">the social media companies say I have an</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.010" end="00:23:21.130" style="s2">idea and I&#39;m by the way I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.690" end="00:23:23.140" style="s2">this is actually how it went but from a</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.130" end="00:23:24.610" style="s2">business perspective this is effectively</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.140" end="00:23:27.130" style="s2">why those businesses are so successful</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.610" end="00:23:29.890" style="s2">is they said instead of paying those</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.130" end="00:23:31.450" style="s2">journalists what if each person was</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.890" end="00:23:33.190" style="s2">convinced to be narcissistically</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.450" end="00:23:34.660" style="s2">addicted to how many followers they had</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.190" end="00:23:37.330" style="s2">and how much attention that they could</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.660" end="00:23:39.160" style="s2">broadcast that they&#39;ll essentially be a</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.330" end="00:23:42.370" style="s2">useful idiot in the attention economy</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.160" end="00:23:44.380" style="s2">and be publishing and generating</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.370" end="00:23:46.600" style="s2">attention for free out of their own</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.380" end="00:23:50.110" style="s2">narcissism because people want to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.600" end="00:23:51.460" style="s2">seen as smarter and more thoughtful and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.110" end="00:23:53.470" style="s2">get people interested in their lives etc</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.460" end="00:23:54.970" style="s2">so you start posting photos of your</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.470" end="00:23:57.100" style="s2">breakfast or you start posting news</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.970" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">articles and saying how smart you are so</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.100" end="00:24:01.150" style="s2">if you think about those two black boxes</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:03.100" style="s2">the left is a very expensive way of</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.150" end="00:24:05.410" style="s2">producing human attention the one on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.100" end="00:24:07.570" style="s2">right the social media companies is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.410" end="00:24:09.100" style="s2">very very cheap way of producing human</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.570" end="00:24:11.230" style="s2">attention we&#39;re essentially the uber</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.100" end="00:24:13.510" style="s2">drivers of the gig economy creating and</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.230" end="00:24:15.310" style="s2">producing human attention essentially at</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.510" end="00:24:16.960" style="s2">no cost for free not even getting paid</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.310" end="00:24:19.720" style="s2">by the companies but then what that</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.960" end="00:24:22.060" style="s2">means is that we replace that process of</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.720" end="00:24:24.730" style="s2">Investigation of fact-checking of it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.060" end="00:24:26.770" style="s2">witness reports of long cycles and human</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.730" end="00:24:29.320" style="s2">discernment with essentially a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.770" end="00:24:30.400" style="s2">angry people who are yelling thinking</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.320" end="00:24:32.110" style="s2">that they have the smartest</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.400" end="00:24:34.030" style="s2">take so they do breaking news in all</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.110" end="00:24:36.100" style="s2">caps they do cynical commentary they</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.030" end="00:24:38.380" style="s2">take the least charitable example they</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.100" end="00:24:40.780" style="s2">amplify it build a mob around it and say</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.380" end="00:24:43.350" style="s2">look how bad the other side is and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.780" end="00:24:46.360" style="s2">has become the default information</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.350" end="00:24:48.100" style="s2">environment and when you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.360" end="00:24:49.780" style="s2">that&#39;s actually what&#39;s happened and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.100" end="00:24:51.640" style="s2">game theoretically now the New York</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.780" end="00:24:53.980" style="s2">Times on the left-hand side has to</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.640" end="00:24:55.690" style="s2">compete with that they have to now say</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.980" end="00:24:57.700" style="s2">well let&#39;s at least play the clickbait</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.690" end="00:24:59.500" style="s2">game to even get those articles you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.700" end="00:25:02.200" style="s2">to get the same amount of attention so</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.500" end="00:25:04.420" style="s2">it&#39;s really screwed up the entire</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.200" end="00:25:05.590" style="s2">information environment and I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.420" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">that&#39;s what I think people deeply</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.590" end="00:25:09.190" style="s2">underestimate about what&#39;s gone on yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:11.530" style="s2">the game theory dynamic you know my</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.190" end="00:25:13.240" style="s2">friend Brett Weinstein good friend yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.530" end="00:25:17.170" style="s2">he&#39;s that friend of mine for years and</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.240" end="00:25:19.270" style="s2">great guy and part of his core analysis</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.170" end="00:25:21.280" style="s2">of what&#39;s going on is that it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.270" end="00:25:23.530" style="s2">old shit right it&#39;s evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.280" end="00:25:26.350" style="s2">dynamics and it&#39;s game theory dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.530" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">and what he always underlines is the one</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.350" end="00:25:30.580" style="s2">that&#39;s doing us the most harm across the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:32.440" style="s2">board is the race to the bottom yep and</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.580" end="00:25:34.240" style="s2">essentially what you&#39;re describing with</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.440" end="00:25:36.100" style="s2">respect to the news dynamic is you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.240" end="00:25:38.380" style="s2">that even now the New York Times it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.100" end="00:25:40.480" style="s2">Foley&#39;s stupid-ass stories about some</p>

<p begin="00:25:40.480" end="00:25:44.170" style="s2">right who gives a shit right on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.040" end="00:25:45.970" style="s2">scale of things it&#39;s a zero but because</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.170" end="00:25:47.320" style="s2">they&#39;re in the clickbait business you</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.970" end="00:25:49.600" style="s2">know they&#39;re forced to fill the front</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.320" end="00:25:51.190" style="s2">page full of crap so they can compete</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.600" end="00:25:53.320" style="s2">with Facebook well this is all why the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.190" end="00:25:54.940" style="s2">fitness landscape needs to be a fitness</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.320" end="00:25:56.860" style="s2">landscape that&#39;s that&#39;s coupled with</p>

<p begin="00:25:56.860" end="00:26:01.000" style="s2">that that we actually want the</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.660" end="00:26:02.950" style="s2">competition to be for but this is why</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.000" end="00:26:04.600" style="s2">it&#39;s so dangerous if the competition and</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.950" end="00:26:07.000" style="s2">the fitness landscape are basically</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.600" end="00:26:09.310" style="s2">anchored on the resource of human</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.000" end="00:26:11.350" style="s2">attention then that&#39;s basically reverse</p>

<p begin="00:26:29.980" end="00:26:34.240" style="s2">of the auto-playing videos or the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.750" end="00:26:35.800" style="s2">infinite scrolling feeds our co-founder</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.240" end="00:26:38.320" style="s2">at the Center for Humane Technology is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.800" end="00:26:40.150" style="s2">Raskin he actually invented the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.320" end="00:26:41.530" style="s2">scroll features that&#39;s that thing where</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.150" end="00:26:43.540" style="s2">scroll with your thumb and it never</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.530" end="00:26:44.230" style="s2">stops right it wasn&#39;t always designed</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.540" end="00:26:46.570" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.230" end="00:26:49.270" style="s2">and the insight comes from a study that</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.570" end="00:26:51.130" style="s2">was done I think it said Cornell there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.270" end="00:26:52.960" style="s2">a food lab where they had six people</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.130" end="00:26:55.179" style="s2">sitting down at a table each with a bowl</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.960" end="00:26:57.490" style="s2">of soup in front of them and two of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.179" end="00:26:59.020" style="s2">bowls of soup had a little pipe</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.490" end="00:27:00.820" style="s2">underneath that was actually refilling</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.020" end="00:27:02.740" style="s2">the bowl of soup with more soup as the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.820" end="00:27:04.299" style="s2">person drank and the question was</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.740" end="00:27:05.980" style="s2">essentially about food psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.299" end="00:27:09.220" style="s2">consumption do people know when to stop</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.980" end="00:27:11.080" style="s2">on their own and it turned out that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.220" end="00:27:13.750" style="s2">auto refilling soup bowls people ate</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.080" end="00:27:15.580" style="s2">about 76 percent more calories and they</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.750" end="00:27:18.010" style="s2">didn&#39;t really notice and so the point is</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.580" end="00:27:20.080" style="s2">that our brains just like a magician</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.010" end="00:27:21.610" style="s2">rely on stopping cues to know when to</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.080" end="00:27:24.580" style="s2">stop like there&#39;s natural breaks in our</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.610" end="00:27:26.110" style="s2">experience and the idea of technology is</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.580" end="00:27:27.160" style="s2">well we don&#39;t want those stopping cues</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.110" end="00:27:28.690" style="s2">showing up because that would have you</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.160" end="00:27:29.980" style="s2">stop and reconsider what you&#39;re doing so</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.690" end="00:27:31.510" style="s2">let&#39;s actually remove those stopping</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.980" end="00:27:33.429" style="s2">cues and get you infinitely scrolling in</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.510" end="00:27:34.960" style="s2">a trance and then game theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.429" end="00:27:36.429" style="s2">once one guy does the infinite scrolling</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.960" end="00:27:37.990" style="s2">feed the other guy has to do it then</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.429" end="00:27:39.429" style="s2">when once one guy does the auto-playing</p>

<p begin="00:29:01.070" end="00:29:05.179" style="s2">harms are you know one could say all</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.440" end="00:29:06.919" style="s2">right so they manipulate me I really</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.179" end="00:29:08.179" style="s2">give a shit fuck at people manipulating</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.919" end="00:29:08.629" style="s2">me for years I&#39;ll probably drink a</p>

<p begin="00:29:11.929" end="00:29:15.889" style="s2">harms that are coming out of this race</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.119" end="00:29:19.249" style="s2">to the bottom around the attention</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.889" end="00:29:21.799" style="s2">hijacking economy sure well we think of</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.249" end="00:29:24.110" style="s2">it like you know prior to there being</p>

<p begin="00:29:24.110" end="00:29:28.429" style="s2">or global warming there&#39;s just these</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.210" end="00:29:29.989" style="s2">different ecological problems that feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.429" end="00:29:32.440" style="s2">separate you know you have the coral</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.989" end="00:29:35.029" style="s2">reefs you have nitrogen runoff you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.440" end="00:29:36.499" style="s2">species loss in the Amazon and they</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.029" end="00:29:37.940" style="s2">might seem like separate problems but</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.499" end="00:29:38.629" style="s2">then when you have a model like climate</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.940" end="00:29:40.429" style="s2">change you see that they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.629" end="00:29:42.710" style="s2">connected so similarly with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.429" end="00:29:44.269" style="s2">attention economy dynamics people say oh</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.710" end="00:29:45.619" style="s2">like I&#39;m a little bit more distracted we</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.269" end="00:29:47.239" style="s2">have this distraction problem this</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.619" end="00:29:48.980" style="s2">information overload problem then we</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.239" end="00:29:50.419" style="s2">have this totally separate polarization</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.980" end="00:29:52.429" style="s2">problem then we have this totally</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.419" end="00:29:54.019" style="s2">separate shortening of attention spans</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.429" end="00:29:55.429" style="s2">problem reductions and critical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.019" end="00:29:58.820" style="s2">then we have this totally separate</p>

<p begin="00:29:58.820" end="00:30:03.619" style="s2">doubt problem and the point is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.919" end="00:30:05.480" style="s2">these are all one connected system that</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.619" end="00:30:07.249" style="s2">are also mutually self-reinforcing</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.480" end="00:30:08.809" style="s2">so you know if you look at some of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.249" end="00:30:10.730" style="s2">harms you know our attention spans have</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.809" end="00:30:12.799" style="s2">been going down we did a great episode</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.730" end="00:30:14.059" style="s2">on our podcast your own divide it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.799" end="00:30:16.730" style="s2">called your undivided attention with</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.059" end="00:30:18.200" style="s2">this professor Gloria mark at UC Irvine</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.730" end="00:30:19.909" style="s2">who&#39;s been studying the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.200" end="00:30:22.309" style="s2">attention and distraction for a very</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.909" end="00:30:24.919" style="s2">long time she&#39;s found out that it takes</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.309" end="00:30:26.840" style="s2">about 23 minutes I think on average to</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.919" end="00:30:29.359" style="s2">resume focus after an interruption and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.840" end="00:30:31.340" style="s2">we actually cycled through two unrelated</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.359" end="00:30:32.720" style="s2">projects before we usually get back to</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.340" end="00:30:35.299" style="s2">the thing that we were doing this is on</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.720" end="00:30:36.320" style="s2">sort of desktop computers but she&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.299" end="00:30:38.179" style="s2">found I think that I think the average</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.320" end="00:30:40.100" style="s2">attention span or focus duration on a</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.179" end="00:30:42.049" style="s2">screen is their desktop screens now is</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.100" end="00:30:43.369" style="s2">about 40 seconds but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.049" end="00:30:44.989" style="s2">anybody would say that their attention</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.369" end="00:30:46.639" style="s2">spans are going up or it&#39;s easier to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.989" end="00:30:48.200" style="s2">read books than ever but it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.639" end="00:30:49.909" style="s2">harder and harder and harder because</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.200" end="00:30:51.859" style="s2">we&#39;re training our nervous systems to</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.909" end="00:30:54.859" style="s2">condition them to expect rewards or</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.859" end="00:30:56.989" style="s2">juicy you know exciting things at a more</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.859" end="00:30:58.999" style="s2">and more frequent rate so that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.989" end="00:31:01.399" style="s2">one of the first areas of harm then you</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.999" end="00:31:03.710" style="s2">have addiction and isolation so you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.399" end="00:31:04.820" style="s2">the more the race for attention is you</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.710" end="00:31:06.769" style="s2">know to keep you on the screen that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.820" end="00:31:09.470" style="s2">basically to keep you by yourself right</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.769" end="00:31:11.389" style="s2">scrolling that means disassociated your</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.470" end="00:31:13.339" style="s2">chin down your ass off</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.389" end="00:31:15.320" style="s2">gets compressed at 45 degrees not really</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.339" end="00:31:16.459" style="s2">breathing as much nothing less and less</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.320" end="00:31:18.379" style="s2">sort of in your body</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.459" end="00:31:20.690" style="s2">these isolation dynamics are really</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.379" end="00:31:21.889" style="s2">costly I was just talking with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.690" end="00:31:24.619" style="s2">former Surgeon General of the United</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.889" end="00:31:26.690" style="s2">States v vector C and he was talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.619" end="00:31:28.429" style="s2">about how he believed that isolation and</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.690" end="00:31:30.259" style="s2">loneliness are one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.429" end="00:31:32.839" style="s2">invisible social problems that is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.259" end="00:31:35.329" style="s2">getting nearly enough attention 18% of</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.839" end="00:31:38.419" style="s2">people in a big Cygnus study in 2018</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.329" end="00:31:40.519" style="s2">said they had no one that they felt like</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.419" end="00:31:42.379" style="s2">they could talk to when they felt alone</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.519" end="00:31:44.239" style="s2">which is just horrible I mean we really</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.379" end="00:31:45.889" style="s2">you know solitary confinement is one of</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.239" end="00:31:48.709" style="s2">the worst punishments we give to human</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.889" end="00:31:51.289" style="s2">beings in jail and we are doing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.709" end="00:31:53.239" style="s2">essentially as a natural accidental</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.289" end="00:31:55.159" style="s2">consequence of the attention economy</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.239" end="00:31:56.479" style="s2">my biggest fear we can go through the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.159" end="00:31:58.099" style="s2">harms forever we have a project called</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.479" end="00:32:00.049" style="s2">the ledger of harms on the Senate</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.099" end="00:32:01.399" style="s2">framing technology website where we try</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.049" end="00:32:03.229" style="s2">to outline many of these things but my</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.399" end="00:32:04.729" style="s2">biggest fear is actually the breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.229" end="00:32:06.859" style="s2">of the information environment the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.729" end="00:32:08.869" style="s2">dismantling of sense-making and the loss</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.859" end="00:32:10.279" style="s2">of trust in society that emerges where</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.869" end="00:32:12.139" style="s2">we don&#39;t even know what to trust anymore</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.279" end="00:32:14.329" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing that if we just jump to</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.139" end="00:32:15.409" style="s2">the chase we&#39;re really worried about I I</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.329" end="00:32:17.149" style="s2">guess I should add one more thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.409" end="00:32:19.879" style="s2">because the children aspect is very</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.149" end="00:32:22.489" style="s2">important that after two decades in</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.879" end="00:32:23.899" style="s2">decline of high depressive symptoms for</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.489" end="00:32:26.179" style="s2">teenage girls so let&#39;s take teenage</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.899" end="00:32:27.440" style="s2">girls I think it&#39;s 12 to 17 years old</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.179" end="00:32:30.109" style="s2">this is in my recent congressional</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.440" end="00:32:32.179" style="s2">hearing testimony there was two decades</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.109" end="00:32:35.029" style="s2">in decline and then it surges up a</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.179" end="00:32:36.709" style="s2">hundred and seventy percent after 2010</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.029" end="00:32:39.259" style="s2">which is around the time of mobile</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.709" end="00:32:42.019" style="s2">social apps like Instagram snapchat etc</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.259" end="00:32:44.450" style="s2">and so teen suicides and teen depression</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.019" end="00:32:45.799" style="s2">are up by a lot and Jonathon Heights</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.450" end="00:32:47.479" style="s2">work and the coddling of the American</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.799" end="00:32:49.129" style="s2">mind is very very relevant for that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.479" end="00:32:50.719" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a really really serious issue</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.129" end="00:32:53.059" style="s2">you know these are real consequences</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.719" end="00:32:55.159" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s focus back on the one you</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.059" end="00:32:57.589" style="s2">call out as the core yeah the breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.159" end="00:33:00.769" style="s2">a sense making sometimes I also label it</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.589" end="00:33:03.499" style="s2">information nihilism where people are</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.769" end="00:33:06.079" style="s2">unable to make distinctions any longer</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.499" end="00:33:08.479" style="s2">between you know what is sense and what</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.079" end="00:33:10.369" style="s2">is nonsense yeah well we can go in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.479" end="00:33:12.169" style="s2">of different directions on it I mean I I</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.369" end="00:33:13.700" style="s2">think that your listeners have already</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.169" end="00:33:15.320" style="s2">listened to Danish Martin burger</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.700" end="00:33:18.200" style="s2">hopefully and and others so clearly</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.320" end="00:33:20.239" style="s2">articulate that you know again speaking</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.200" end="00:33:22.099" style="s2">to someone actually just recently high</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.239" end="00:33:23.450" style="s2">up in the tech industry about this you</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.099" end="00:33:25.080" style="s2">know we were talking about election</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.450" end="00:33:26.400" style="s2">integrity and</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.080" end="00:33:29.910" style="s2">you know what do we do to protect the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.400" end="00:33:31.380" style="s2">2020 elections and it&#39;s not like I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.910" end="00:33:34.500" style="s2">yes we should do more to protect against</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.380" end="00:33:36.960" style="s2">bad actors but the amount of our natural</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.500" end="00:33:37.620" style="s2">information environment now that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.960" end="00:33:40.140" style="s2">gibberish</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.620" end="00:33:41.910" style="s2">clickbait and that that&#39;s the default</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.140" end="00:33:45.150" style="s2">information environment I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.910" end="00:33:47.640" style="s2">the invisible thing that&#39;s so bad is we</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.150" end="00:33:48.960" style="s2">we need high quality sources of of</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.640" end="00:33:50.880" style="s2">information and making sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.960" end="00:33:53.700" style="s2">and at the very least I think we should</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.880" end="00:33:55.740" style="s2">avoid anything whose business model is</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.700" end="00:33:56.730" style="s2">chasing attention as soon as we know</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.740" end="00:33:59.040" style="s2">that your business model is chasing</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.730" end="00:34:00.900" style="s2">attention that just means that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.040" end="00:34:02.460" style="s2">distortion running all the way through</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.900" end="00:34:03.990" style="s2">the way that you are publishing</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.460" end="00:34:06.030" style="s2">information so things that are more</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.990" end="00:34:08.910" style="s2">subscription-based Financial Times etc</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.030" end="00:34:10.860" style="s2">are less likely to be incurring that</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.910" end="00:34:12.510" style="s2">kind of damage yeah let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.860" end="00:34:14.270" style="s2">that a little bit I was involved in</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.510" end="00:34:17.130" style="s2">building out fair amount of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.270" end="00:34:19.500" style="s2">pre-internet and early internet online</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.130" end="00:34:22.260" style="s2">information services including way back</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.500" end="00:34:24.510" style="s2">yonder in 1980 the source the very first</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.260" end="00:34:26.910" style="s2">consumer oriented online service and</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.510" end="00:34:29.420" style="s2">throughout most of that time most</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.910" end="00:34:31.710" style="s2">products were paid and were not</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.420" end="00:34:35.040" style="s2">advertising supported the very end</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.710" end="00:34:37.440" style="s2">around you know 1996 something like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.040" end="00:34:38.670" style="s2">AOL started doing a little advertising</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.440" end="00:34:41.400" style="s2">but it wasn&#39;t the core of the business</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.670" end="00:34:42.990" style="s2">model until after the 2000s do you</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.400" end="00:34:45.270" style="s2">really think it&#39;s possible to put the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.990" end="00:34:47.130" style="s2">genie back in the bottle and say no more</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.270" end="00:34:47.610" style="s2">advertising supported businesses on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.130" end="00:34:51.440" style="s2">Internet</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.610" end="00:34:54.060" style="s2">well it&#39;s very very hard I mean it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.440" end="00:34:56.280" style="s2">think of the advertising business model</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.060" end="00:34:58.440" style="s2">almost like the fossil fuel era of</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.280" end="00:35:01.050" style="s2">energy in our energy economy you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.440" end="00:35:03.540" style="s2">our entire economic infrastructure is</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.050" end="00:35:06.180" style="s2">basically directly coupled with the you</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.540" end="00:35:08.340" style="s2">know petro dollar petroleum in a global</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.180" end="00:35:10.140" style="s2">economy and I think that you know much</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.340" end="00:35:12.600" style="s2">of the growth of the the US stock market</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.140" end="00:35:15.000" style="s2">in the last couple of years has been by</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.600" end="00:35:16.710" style="s2">the major advertising based companies</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.000" end="00:35:18.780" style="s2">and if you subtract that from the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.710" end="00:35:20.040" style="s2">economy you know how do you do that</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.780" end="00:35:21.870" style="s2">that&#39;s one and a half trillion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.040" end="00:35:23.820" style="s2">of market value at the very least if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.870" end="00:35:25.920" style="s2">take Google and Facebook together who</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.820" end="00:35:27.900" style="s2">are based on advertising so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.920" end="00:35:30.420" style="s2">saying it&#39;s easy but we have to be able</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.900" end="00:35:32.130" style="s2">to name the pernicious nosov this</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.420" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">business model I mean I honestly think</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.130" end="00:35:36.450" style="s2">I&#39;ve been withholding from being the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:38.460" style="s2">outrage machine here but I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.450" end="00:35:38.640" style="s2">leading to a kind of dark ages in terms</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.460" end="00:35:39.930" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.640" end="00:35:41.940" style="s2">what we&#39;ve already been heading into</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.930" end="00:35:44.099" style="s2">we&#39;ve been baking our society for about</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.940" end="00:35:45.660" style="s2">you know six seven years in these</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.099" end="00:35:47.490" style="s2">automated algorithms of YouTube and</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.660" end="00:35:49.049" style="s2">whatever good they do now we have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.490" end="00:35:50.910" style="s2">recognize that for six or seven years</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.049" end="00:35:52.589" style="s2">they were recommending conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.910" end="00:35:54.809" style="s2">theories and extremism and outrage and</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.589" end="00:35:58.079" style="s2">polarization affirmation on information</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.809" end="00:36:00.000" style="s2">so you know first is to recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.079" end="00:36:01.559" style="s2">the true costs are free we like to say</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.000" end="00:36:03.230" style="s2">that you know free is the most expensive</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.559" end="00:36:05.279" style="s2">business model we&#39;ve ever created</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.230" end="00:36:07.589" style="s2">because it destroys kind of everything</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.279" end="00:36:09.180" style="s2">else you know and as you said I think in</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.589" end="00:36:10.769" style="s2">a previous episode of your podcast we</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.180" end="00:36:12.900" style="s2">can go back to things like subscriptions</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.769" end="00:36:15.779" style="s2">I think you said that on average</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.900" end="00:36:17.609" style="s2">Facebook would be $2 a month for a user</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.779" end="00:36:19.619" style="s2">around the world and obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.609" end="00:36:21.390" style="s2">developing world is different than the</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.619" end="00:36:22.589" style="s2">mainstream world but we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.390" end="00:36:24.660" style="s2">actually dealt with this with things</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.589" end="00:36:26.400" style="s2">like Netflix I mean the average time</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.660" end="00:36:29.880" style="s2">spent watching Netflix is something like</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.400" end="00:36:31.950" style="s2">71 minutes a day and people pay eleven</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.880" end="00:36:33.809" style="s2">ninety nine a month I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.950" end="00:36:35.700" style="s2">rate now I can&#39;t forget remember for</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.809" end="00:36:37.079" style="s2">their Netflix account and you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.700" end="00:36:39.299" style="s2">people actually spend almost as much</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.079" end="00:36:41.039" style="s2">time on social media and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.299" end="00:36:42.539" style="s2">paying anything but would you be willing</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.039" end="00:36:43.859" style="s2">to pay you know if you already paid that</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.539" end="00:36:45.359" style="s2">for Netflix why wouldn&#39;t you be willing</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.859" end="00:36:47.849" style="s2">to pay for social media that was</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.359" end="00:36:49.950" style="s2">actually in service of human values yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.849" end="00:36:52.500" style="s2">I keep talking about this as you just</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.950" end="00:36:54.089" style="s2">pointed out and I don&#39;t get anybody to</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.500" end="00:36:56.789" style="s2">nod their heads the fact that we did an</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.089" end="00:36:58.980" style="s2">experiment once for $20 a month would</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.789" end="00:37:01.920" style="s2">have brought one into a community both</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.980" end="00:37:04.170" style="s2">political and online community and man</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.920" end="00:37:06.599" style="s2">do people hate to pay yeah and I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.170" end="00:37:09.119" style="s2">you&#39;ve read Chris Anderson&#39;s book free</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.599" end="00:37:12.690" style="s2">the future of a radical price yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.119" end="00:37:14.789" style="s2">unfortunately even one cent is very</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.690" end="00:37:17.190" style="s2">different than free and part of that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.789" end="00:37:19.470" style="s2">that people hate to have to fill out yet</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.190" end="00:37:21.660" style="s2">another set of usernames and passwords</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.470" end="00:37:23.910" style="s2">that have potentially high stakes</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.660" end="00:37:26.880" style="s2">I either connected to their credit card</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.910" end="00:37:28.049" style="s2">or to their bank account and gosh you</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.880" end="00:37:29.849" style="s2">know I wish we could I could figure out</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.049" end="00:37:31.140" style="s2">a way or somebody else come get a little</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.849" end="00:37:33.180" style="s2">too old to be doing this stuff myself</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.140" end="00:37:35.400" style="s2">but that the next generation of</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.180" end="00:37:38.160" style="s2">entrepreneurs could figure out a way to</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.400" end="00:37:41.819" style="s2">move back to an era where people pay for</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.160" end="00:37:43.769" style="s2">value and advertising is not the core of</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.819" end="00:37:46.559" style="s2">the business model but I don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.769" end="00:37:48.000" style="s2">yeah well I think people like Apple you</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.559" end="00:37:49.440" style="s2">know I always say that Apple is actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.000" end="00:37:51.509" style="s2">one of the interesting actors in this</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.440" end="00:37:52.290" style="s2">space because their business model is</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.509" end="00:37:54.060" style="s2">not monetize</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.290" end="00:37:55.620" style="s2">your attention in fact they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.060" end="00:37:57.480" style="s2">like the government of the attention</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.620" end="00:37:59.160" style="s2">economy they choose which apps get to</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.480" end="00:38:01.410" style="s2">participate in the App Store they choose</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.160" end="00:38:04.440" style="s2">you know the rules and the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.410" end="00:38:06.180" style="s2">building codes of what an app is and</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.440" end="00:38:08.400" style="s2">what levels of notification access you</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.180" end="00:38:10.470" style="s2">get and what you can and can&#39;t do and</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.400" end="00:38:12.930" style="s2">all that stuff they can actually create</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.470" end="00:38:14.730" style="s2">the kind of payments infrastructure that</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.930" end="00:38:17.190" style="s2">could be based in you know built into</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.730" end="00:38:18.810" style="s2">iCloud and you know for a few dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.190" end="00:38:20.910" style="s2">month basically have dollars</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.810" end="00:38:22.470" style="s2">automatically flow to things that</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.910" end="00:38:24.150" style="s2">provide more value but again we need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.470" end="00:38:25.440" style="s2">change the fitness landscape of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.150" end="00:38:27.480" style="s2">attention economy so we&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:28.980" style="s2">competing for attention at all but</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.480" end="00:38:30.990" style="s2">competing for essentially help in our</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.980" end="00:38:33.330" style="s2">lives and you know it&#39;s interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.990" end="00:38:35.040" style="s2">use as metaphor sometimes of you know if</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.330" end="00:38:37.590" style="s2">you ask me like five years ago would you</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.040" end="00:38:39.660" style="s2">pay $11 multiple times a day to get</p>

<p begin="00:41:33.960" end="00:41:37.980" style="s2">these issues so we need a clarifying</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.460" end="00:41:39.690" style="s2">public awareness on the problem first</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.980" end="00:41:41.910" style="s2">before we can take that public action</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.690" end="00:41:44.400" style="s2">and of course you know the other issue</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.910" end="00:41:46.140" style="s2">which I see fairly often I happen to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.400" end="00:41:47.760" style="s2">unlike a lot of people in the kind of</p>

<p begin="00:43:59.620" end="00:44:04.300" style="s2">imagine outlawing the collection of</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.560" end="00:44:05.980" style="s2">individual behavioral data in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.300" end="00:44:07.900" style="s2">the system and how do you see that</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.980" end="00:44:09.640" style="s2">solving the issues just just too curious</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.900" end="00:44:11.470" style="s2">and understand your sense making well</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.640" end="00:44:14.380" style="s2">let&#39;s put a sharper edge on it if</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.470" end="00:44:18.130" style="s2">Facebook had no data about my behavior</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.380" end="00:44:20.230" style="s2">it would be essentially impossible for</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.130" end="00:44:22.420" style="s2">them to micro-target me and so the</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.230" end="00:44:24.940" style="s2">efficiency of the whole cycle would go</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.420" end="00:44:27.370" style="s2">down substantially probably by a factor</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.940" end="00:44:30.160" style="s2">of five and we be getting closer back to</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.370" end="00:44:33.010" style="s2">the economics of direct response us mail</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.160" end="00:44:33.780" style="s2">as opposed to the unbelievably highly</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.010" end="00:44:36.270" style="s2">efficient</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.780" end="00:44:39.120" style="s2">targeting that can be done today so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.270" end="00:44:41.670" style="s2">essentially a major deoptimization</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.120" end="00:44:42.990" style="s2">of the cycle yeah but I think one issue</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.670" end="00:44:44.460" style="s2">is the collection of the data but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.990" end="00:44:45.930" style="s2">it&#39;s you know you have to ask like is</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.460" end="00:44:48.270" style="s2">there a way that Facebook would be</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.930" end="00:44:50.340" style="s2">unable or could they not have access to</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.270" end="00:44:52.320" style="s2">your data I mean by definition they have</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.340" end="00:44:54.840" style="s2">your friends by definition they have the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.320" end="00:44:56.940" style="s2">posts that we post by definition they</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.840" end="00:44:58.440" style="s2">have to keep track of what gets clicked</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.940" end="00:44:59.820" style="s2">so they can show you back later the</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.440" end="00:45:02.130" style="s2">number of likes that you have so they</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.820" end="00:45:03.750" style="s2">can&#39;t erase that information unless you</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.130" end="00:45:05.490" style="s2">want to go to a totally ephemeral social</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.750" end="00:45:07.110" style="s2">network or something like that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.490" end="00:45:09.300" style="s2">second problem is that people actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.110" end="00:45:11.040" style="s2">prefer personalized news feeds over</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.300" end="00:45:12.720" style="s2">let&#39;s say chronological ones like we</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.040" end="00:45:14.160" style="s2">could erase all of the engagement</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.720" end="00:45:16.560" style="s2">metrics and say let&#39;s just sort news</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.160" end="00:45:18.210" style="s2">feeds by you know what the exact</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.560" end="00:45:20.130" style="s2">chronological order in time that they</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.210" end="00:45:21.450" style="s2">posted them but people don&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.130" end="00:45:22.830" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually really inefficient</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.450" end="00:45:24.000" style="s2">and you kind of scroll through a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.830" end="00:45:25.950" style="s2">of stuff that&#39;s not so relevant we</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.000" end="00:45:27.990" style="s2">actually prefer things to be filtered</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.950" end="00:45:30.000" style="s2">for us and if the filtering requires</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.990" end="00:45:32.520" style="s2">uses of data to make that process more</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.000" end="00:45:34.080" style="s2">efficient people want that I think what</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.520" end="00:45:36.690" style="s2">I&#39;m pushing against is just we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.080" end="00:45:38.610" style="s2">have a 100% of our information</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.690" end="00:45:40.740" style="s2">environment be tuned by personalization</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.610" end="00:45:43.100" style="s2">because it eliminates the sort of shared</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.740" end="00:45:45.180" style="s2">water water cooler or public broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.100" end="00:45:46.920" style="s2">events you know in in countries in</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.180" end="00:45:48.930" style="s2">Nordic countries I think it&#39;s in Finland</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.920" end="00:45:50.850" style="s2">professor Fred Turner at Stanford was</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.930" end="00:45:53.070" style="s2">just telling me about he&#39;s a great</p>

<p begin="00:45:53.070" end="00:45:57.420" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of a 10-minute public news</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.500" end="00:45:58.980" style="s2">break that&#39;s at the center of their</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.420" end="00:46:00.930" style="s2">soccer matches so whatever there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.980" end="00:46:03.300" style="s2">football game yeah there&#39;s a 10-minute</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.930" end="00:46:05.130" style="s2">break that everyone is tuning into and</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.300" end="00:46:06.570" style="s2">they put that at the center of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.130" end="00:46:09.390" style="s2">attention economy and create a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.570" end="00:46:11.280" style="s2">shared set of information sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.390" end="00:46:12.930" style="s2">for everyone and I think things like</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.280" end="00:46:14.970" style="s2">that where we balancing the personal</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.930" end="00:46:17.340" style="s2">with the public is what we need more of</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.970" end="00:46:20.130" style="s2">how you let something&#39;s gonna fall back</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.340" end="00:46:21.420" style="s2">up on the idea that we want personalized</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.130" end="00:46:23.850" style="s2">services you know I&#39;ve experimented</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.420" end="00:46:26.280" style="s2">quite a bit with Facebook it used to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.850" end="00:46:28.410" style="s2">you could actually set the setting to</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.280" end="00:46:31.110" style="s2">show me the feed in chronological order</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.410" end="00:46:33.780" style="s2">and I&#39;m not sure it was worse than the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.110" end="00:46:35.340" style="s2">zuc algorithm but what Facebook does</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.780" end="00:46:36.690" style="s2">they keep changing it back you know you</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.340" end="00:46:38.220" style="s2">basically have to switch it once every</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.690" end="00:46:40.380" style="s2">two or three hours if you want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.220" end="00:46:42.690" style="s2">that on the other hand I have also</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.380" end="00:46:45.240" style="s2">experimented with turning off history on</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.690" end="00:46:47.100" style="s2">Google and you know for Google search</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.240" end="00:46:47.660" style="s2">and at least for me I much prefer it</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.100" end="00:46:49.370" style="s2">with his</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.660" end="00:46:52.070" style="s2">Rhian I want Google to know that when I</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.370" end="00:46:54.590" style="s2">type Python it usually means the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.070" end="00:46:56.660" style="s2">computer language and not the snake so</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.590" end="00:46:58.040" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting then the domains</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.660" end="00:47:00.890" style="s2">may differ a little bit to what degree</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.040" end="00:47:03.350" style="s2">the manipulation is actually of consumer</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.890" end="00:47:05.480" style="s2">benefit versus you know benefit for</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.350" end="00:47:06.740" style="s2">presenting willing eyeballs for</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.480" end="00:47:08.870" style="s2">advertisers and the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.740" end="00:47:11.360" style="s2">micro-target yeah I think the principle</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.870" end="00:47:14.420" style="s2">of data minimization and personalization</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.360" end="00:47:16.670" style="s2">that is not for the interests of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.420" end="00:47:18.410" style="s2">commercial entity but for our interests</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.670" end="00:47:21.290" style="s2">more like a fiduciary you know Forrest</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.410" end="00:47:22.790" style="s2">Landry and and I and others have kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.290" end="00:47:24.560" style="s2">articulated the argument of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.790" end="00:47:26.690" style="s2">technology needs to act like a fiduciary</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.560" end="00:47:29.360" style="s2">to our values based on the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.690" end="00:47:31.700" style="s2">there&#39;s the degree of asymmetry between</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.360" end="00:47:33.710" style="s2">its power over us and and our limited</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.700" end="00:47:35.420" style="s2">power with it so if you if you compare</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.710" end="00:47:37.760" style="s2">and you lined up these comparisons you</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.420" end="00:47:40.040" style="s2">know you say let&#39;s say you know a doctor</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.760" end="00:47:42.230" style="s2">knows way more about medicine than you</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.040" end="00:47:44.300" style="s2">do and you&#39;re there lying unconscious on</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.230" end="00:47:45.590" style="s2">the operating table you are fully in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.300" end="00:47:48.500" style="s2">submission of what they can do to you</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.590" end="00:47:50.360" style="s2">right so imagine the doctors entire</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.500" end="00:47:52.970" style="s2">business model was just maximizing</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.360" end="00:47:55.010" style="s2">profit shareholder value getting paid</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.970" end="00:47:56.420" style="s2">entirely by Pharma pumping you with</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.010" end="00:47:58.370" style="s2">drugs doing surgeries they didn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.420" end="00:47:59.930" style="s2">to do and that was the doctor about to</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.370" end="00:48:02.600" style="s2">operate on you in that vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.930" end="00:48:04.280" style="s2">situation we would outlaw that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.600" end="00:48:05.990" style="s2">fully commercial relationship of</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.280" end="00:48:08.000" style="s2">something that has that level of</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.990" end="00:48:09.980" style="s2">asymmetric power over the outcomes that</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.000" end="00:48:11.780" style="s2">matter for you similar with a</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.980" end="00:48:14.480" style="s2">psychotherapist who&#39;s dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.780" end="00:48:15.440" style="s2">very intimate details of your psyche you</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.480" end="00:48:17.030" style="s2">know they could give you very misguided</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.440" end="00:48:18.650" style="s2">advice they could lie to you they could</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.030" end="00:48:20.000" style="s2">say oh and the to heal that trauma from</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.650" end="00:48:21.620" style="s2">your childhood you have to have sex with</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.000" end="00:48:23.810" style="s2">me they can say all sorts of things that</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.620" end="00:48:25.070" style="s2">would be very vulnerable so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.810" end="00:48:26.630" style="s2">name for that relationship it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.070" end="00:48:29.060" style="s2">fiduciary relationship instead of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.630" end="00:48:31.340" style="s2">contract relationship to recognize the</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.060" end="00:48:33.980" style="s2">asymmetry of power in those two things</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.340" end="00:48:35.480" style="s2">and if you line up those two and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.980" end="00:48:36.650" style="s2">degree of asymmetry how much do they</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.480" end="00:48:38.120" style="s2">know about you that you don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.650" end="00:48:40.220" style="s2">yourself how much are you trusting them</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.120" end="00:48:41.870" style="s2">how vulnerable are you between a doctor</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.220" end="00:48:43.460" style="s2">and a patient between a psychotherapist</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.870" end="00:48:45.230" style="s2">and their client and then you ask how</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.460" end="00:48:48.350" style="s2">much information does Facebook have</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.230" end="00:48:50.360" style="s2">about you compared to you knowing about</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.350" end="00:48:53.090" style="s2">yourself how about the difference of</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.360" end="00:48:54.410" style="s2">intimacy between what a psychotherapist</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.090" end="00:48:55.670" style="s2">knows about you versus what Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.410" end="00:48:58.490" style="s2">knows about you you know you&#39;ve all her</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.670" end="00:48:59.750" style="s2">Ari gives this example that Facebook can</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.490" end="00:49:01.160" style="s2">know that you&#39;re gay before you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.750" end="00:49:01.490" style="s2">you&#39;re gay based on just the way that</p>

<p begin="00:49:06.890" end="00:49:09.590" style="s2">the ads that don&#39;t have the person of</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.210" end="00:49:11.180" style="s2">the same sex and you may not even be</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.590" end="00:49:13.369" style="s2">aware of that yourself and so in general</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.180" end="00:49:15.710" style="s2">technology is able to make predictions</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.369" end="00:49:18.350" style="s2">about people that are asymmetric you we</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.710" end="00:49:19.820" style="s2">would never allow that relationship to</p>

<p begin="00:49:25.820" end="00:49:29.030" style="s2">at the business model and I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.960" end="00:49:31.250" style="s2">addresses some of the the other issues</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.030" end="00:49:32.619" style="s2">that we&#39;ve raised one last metaphor for</p>

<p begin="00:49:32.619" end="00:49:36.530" style="s2">imagine a priest in a confession booth</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.910" end="00:49:38.780" style="s2">which is another sort of asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.530" end="00:49:40.220" style="s2">situation where you&#39;re there and you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:49:47.030" end="00:49:50.810" style="s2">things except that priest is listening</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.280" end="00:49:54.290" style="s2">to the confessions of not just the town</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.810" end="00:49:56.000" style="s2">but 2.7 billion people right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.290" end="00:49:58.340" style="s2">Facebook except they also have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.000" end="00:50:00.110" style="s2">supercomputer that&#39;s basically storing</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.340" end="00:50:02.900" style="s2">and recording all the confessions made</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.110" end="00:50:05.000" style="s2">by 2.7 billion people and then finding</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.900" end="00:50:06.530" style="s2">patterns in the confessions so that they</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.000" end="00:50:08.270" style="s2">can actually make predictions about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.530" end="00:50:09.740" style="s2">next confession you&#39;re gonna say in the</p>

<p begin="00:50:09.740" end="00:50:13.580" style="s2">gonna say it and so even as you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:50:13.580" end="00:50:16.430" style="s2">based on gait detection and how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.200" end="00:50:17.900" style="s2">walking they could make predictions</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.430" end="00:50:19.070" style="s2">about confessions you&#39;re gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.900" end="00:50:20.990" style="s2">because they have a supercomputer and</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.070" end="00:50:23.150" style="s2">you don&#39;t we would never allow that</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.990" end="00:50:24.590" style="s2">priest to have a commercial relationship</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.150" end="00:50:26.480" style="s2">where they sell everything that they</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.590" end="00:50:27.500" style="s2">learned about you and the predictions</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.480" end="00:50:28.730" style="s2">that they can make about you that are</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.500" end="00:50:30.260" style="s2">going to happen in the future</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.730" end="00:50:32.570" style="s2">that you don&#39;t even know about to</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.260" end="00:50:34.340" style="s2">another advertiser we should not have</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.570" end="00:50:35.869" style="s2">those be commercial relationships we</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.340" end="00:50:37.850" style="s2">need them to be a fiduciary or protected</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.869" end="00:50:40.280" style="s2">relationship yeah like that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.850" end="00:50:42.050" style="s2">very very vivid especially as a person</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.280" end="00:50:44.600" style="s2">that was raised a Catholic I kicked that</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.050" end="00:50:45.859" style="s2">particular curse when I was 11 but you</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.600" end="00:50:48.340" style="s2">know I understand exactly what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.859" end="00:50:50.990" style="s2">saying and it&#39;s a very powerful image</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.340" end="00:50:52.730" style="s2">one of the things I saw in something</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.990" end="00:50:55.100" style="s2">that you wrote or want maybe it was on</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.730" end="00:50:57.260" style="s2">the humane tech one is very similar an</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.100" end="00:50:59.480" style="s2">idea I had which was what would happen</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.260" end="00:51:01.340" style="s2">if we just taxed say internet</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.480" end="00:51:03.410" style="s2">advertising very high say a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.340" end="00:51:04.640" style="s2">percent tax on internet advertising do</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.410" end="00:51:06.380" style="s2">you think that would be enough to get</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.640" end="00:51:08.240" style="s2">the virtuous circle to spend the other</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.380" end="00:51:10.400" style="s2">way yeah it&#39;s a good question you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.240" end="00:51:12.440" style="s2">we haven&#39;t done a full policy economic</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.400" end="00:51:14.030" style="s2">analysis of you know how to how to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.440" end="00:51:14.340" style="s2">that part of this is like saying okay we</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.030" end="00:51:16.740" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.340" end="00:51:18.840" style="s2">bad business model that&#39;s you know we</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.740" end="00:51:21.330" style="s2">want to get people off of it and one way</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.840" end="00:51:22.770" style="s2">we&#39;ve dealt with this in other you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.330" end="00:51:24.600" style="s2">situations right now if we subsidized</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.770" end="00:51:26.670" style="s2">oil so we keep using it but what if we</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.600" end="00:51:28.320" style="s2">start taxing it to a degree that it</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.670" end="00:51:30.270" style="s2">starts to get more expensive than the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.320" end="00:51:31.620" style="s2">regenerative alternatives then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.270" end="00:51:32.940" style="s2">crossing point and then suddenly the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.620" end="00:51:35.340" style="s2">economy flips into the regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.940" end="00:51:36.840" style="s2">alternatives and so the issue here is</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.340" end="00:51:39.480" style="s2">that all of our technology being</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.840" end="00:51:41.720" style="s2">advertising backed is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.480" end="00:51:44.340" style="s2">parasitic extractive and polluting and</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.720" end="00:51:46.590" style="s2">we could tax it much like we want to tax</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.340" end="00:51:48.900" style="s2">fossil fuels progressively carbon taxes</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.590" end="00:51:51.540" style="s2">etc to try to create a transition plan</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.900" end="00:51:54.300" style="s2">to ultimately fund a transition to more</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.540" end="00:51:56.550" style="s2">renewable stuff here but the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.300" end="00:51:58.410" style="s2">the you know the way we generate energy</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.550" end="00:52:00.360" style="s2">is is different than the way we generate</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.410" end="00:52:02.070" style="s2">these different kind of outcomes with</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.360" end="00:52:03.240" style="s2">technology so I don&#39;t know the exact way</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.070" end="00:52:05.610" style="s2">that this would work but one metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.240" end="00:52:08.610" style="s2">I&#39;ve given in the past to this is what</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.610" end="00:52:10.200" style="s2">we&#39;ve done with energy utilities if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.610" end="00:52:12.090" style="s2">think about energy utilities they used</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.200" end="00:52:13.620" style="s2">to have a perverse incentive they</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.090" end="00:52:15.360" style="s2">actually make more money the more energy</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.620" end="00:52:17.700" style="s2">you used including the more energy you</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.360" end="00:52:19.440" style="s2">waste so please leave the lights on</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.700" end="00:52:22.290" style="s2">leave the faucets on leave the shower on</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.440" end="00:52:24.030" style="s2">you know we make more money the more</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.290" end="00:52:25.650" style="s2">energy you use and we would actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.030" end="00:52:27.480" style="s2">want to send that nest into your home</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.650" end="00:52:30.030" style="s2">that actually encourages you with you</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.480" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">know points and rewards to keep using as</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.030" end="00:52:34.590" style="s2">much as possible because that&#39;s how the</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:37.050" style="s2">energy management prediction AI at</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.590" end="00:52:38.430" style="s2">cetera would be incentivized and we</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.050" end="00:52:41.160" style="s2">actually successfully went through</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.430" end="00:52:43.020" style="s2">legislation in the United States as far</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.160" end="00:52:45.300" style="s2">as I understand I think 50% of US states</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.020" end="00:52:48.000" style="s2">now have what they call decoupling where</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.300" end="00:52:51.060" style="s2">they fully decoupled how much energy you</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.000" end="00:52:53.070" style="s2">use from how much money they make and</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.060" end="00:52:55.380" style="s2">the way they do this is based on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.070" end="00:52:56.400" style="s2">seasonal availability of energy and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.380" end="00:52:57.990" style="s2">gonna tie this back by the way to</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.400" end="00:52:59.370" style="s2">attention cuz it&#39;s another finite</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.990" end="00:53:00.360" style="s2">resource you know a finite amount of</p>

<p begin="00:53:02.580" end="00:53:06.390" style="s2">how do we manage this so the way they</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.770" end="00:53:08.360" style="s2">did this is you know let&#39;s say you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:53:11.520" end="00:53:14.820" style="s2">energy and they charge you based on how</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.840" end="00:53:16.470" style="s2">much you use per performance but then</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.820" end="00:53:17.700" style="s2">once you hit the sort of seasonal</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.470" end="00:53:19.410" style="s2">availability they want to start</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.700" end="00:53:21.870" style="s2">disincentivizing you so they double</p>

<p begin="00:53:21.870" end="00:53:25.740" style="s2">expensive that stops you from using it</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.670" end="00:53:27.390" style="s2">so now you have all these extra profits</p>

<p begin="00:55:02.100" end="00:55:05.609" style="s2">straightforward plans like that I just</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.750" end="00:55:07.109" style="s2">because I imagine that it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.609" end="00:55:08.910" style="s2">to be done progressively in some way</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.109" end="00:55:11.730" style="s2">much like carbon taxes have to it you</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.910" end="00:55:13.260" style="s2">know build up slowly over time there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.730" end="00:55:14.850" style="s2">different ways of doing it yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.260" end="00:55:17.220" style="s2">will say but as part of my prep for this</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.850" end="00:55:19.890" style="s2">call I watched your testimony in front</p>

<p begin="00:55:21.840" end="00:55:26.010" style="s2">get it now unlike a few years ago</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.670" end="00:55:29.190" style="s2">they&#39;re still pretty vague on the whole</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.010" end="00:55:30.600" style="s2">thing seems to me yeah those you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.190" end="00:55:32.609" style="s2">there&#39;s differences here you know we&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:55:51.060" end="00:55:54.870" style="s2">degree of harm that&#39;s being created and</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.250" end="00:55:56.910" style="s2">they were framing it as a problem of bad</p>

<p begin="00:56:12.180" end="00:56:15.660" style="s2">bad stuff off these good platforms and</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.130" end="00:56:17.820" style="s2">the main reframe I was trying to provide</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.660" end="00:56:20.190" style="s2">is that&#39;s not the situation at all the</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.820" end="00:56:22.830" style="s2">natural functioning of the social media</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.190" end="00:56:24.810" style="s2">advertising extracting attention</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.830" end="00:56:26.580" style="s2">extracting platforms are to cause these</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.810" end="00:56:28.950" style="s2">harms and that&#39;s not something that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.580" end="00:56:30.540" style="s2">think the members were aware of but I</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.950" end="00:56:32.640" style="s2">will say you know something else that</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.540" end="00:56:34.860" style="s2">which is you know if you go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.640" end="00:56:36.150" style="s2">Zuckerberg hearings you know if I ask</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.860" end="00:56:38.310" style="s2">you what do you remember do you remember</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.150" end="00:56:40.290" style="s2">Jim about what&#39;s the one talking point</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.310" end="00:56:42.540" style="s2">or sort of memorable thing coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.290" end="00:56:44.160" style="s2">those hearings I truthfully I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.540" end="00:56:46.140" style="s2">even watch them I did watch his</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.160" end="00:56:48.330" style="s2">Georgetown speed I see but I did not</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.140" end="00:56:50.760" style="s2">watch him on Capitol Hill well for those</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.330" end="00:56:53.160" style="s2">who who were tracking that the typical</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.760" end="00:56:55.740" style="s2">answer is there&#39;s a one moment where I</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.160" end="00:56:58.730" style="s2">think it&#39;s orrin hatch asks Zuckerberg</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.740" end="00:57:03.300" style="s2">so mr. Zuckerberg how do you make money</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.730" end="00:57:06.540" style="s2">and Zuckerberg replies senator we sell</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.300" end="00:57:08.610" style="s2">ads and that being the most memorable</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.540" end="00:57:11.370" style="s2">line coming out of what was probably</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.610" end="00:57:13.770" style="s2">more than eight to ten hours of hearings</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.370" end="00:57:15.810" style="s2">right it basically makes the public</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.770" end="00:57:17.550" style="s2">remember one thing which is that</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.810" end="00:57:19.020" style="s2">government is incompetent doesn&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.550" end="00:57:21.360" style="s2">and they didn&#39;t even know his business</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.020" end="00:57:23.160" style="s2">model etc how would you ever trust</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.360" end="00:57:25.860" style="s2">regulation coming from a body like that</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.160" end="00:57:27.510" style="s2">and if I were Zuckerberg and if I were</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.860" end="00:57:29.580" style="s2">Facebook I would have paid for that</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.510" end="00:57:31.230" style="s2">moment to happen because it generated</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.580" end="00:57:33.240" style="s2">the kind of trust imbalance that I would</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.230" end="00:57:35.520" style="s2">want people to be storing in their</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.240" end="00:57:37.260" style="s2">brains and what it makes you forget is</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.520" end="00:57:39.510" style="s2">that there is plenty of other questions</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.260" end="00:57:41.790" style="s2">asked by other senators and Congress</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.510" end="00:57:44.460" style="s2">members that were actually very good</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.790" end="00:57:46.040" style="s2">senator Kennedy from Louisiana had us</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.460" end="00:57:48.570" style="s2">some really fantastic questions</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.040" end="00:57:50.430" style="s2">Blumenthal Warner the honest ads Act</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.570" end="00:57:53.340" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of good stuff happening on</p>

<p begin="00:57:53.340" end="00:57:56.790" style="s2">point is there&#39;s a distribution of a</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.290" end="00:57:58.500" style="s2">and there&#39;s great groups like Tech</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.790" end="00:58:00.600" style="s2">Congress that are trying to actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.500" end="00:58:03.420" style="s2">bring more people with technology</p>

<p begin="00:58:03.420" end="00:58:07.530" style="s2">left this problem which if we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.190" end="00:58:09.780" style="s2">zoom out a little bit is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.530" end="00:58:10.800" style="s2">statement that we and our nonprofit the</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.780" end="00:58:12.900" style="s2">Center for human technology kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.800" end="00:58:15.420" style="s2">focus on which is the EO Wilson quote</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.900" end="00:58:17.610" style="s2">that the problem of humanity is we have</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.420" end="00:58:20.490" style="s2">Paleolithic emotions medieval</p>

<p begin="00:58:22.620" end="00:58:27.480" style="s2">clock rates because the Paleolithic</p>

<p begin="00:58:27.480" end="00:58:32.370" style="s2">years ago our medieval institutions</p>

<p begin="00:58:49.920" end="00:58:54.180" style="s2">way or another we have to bring the</p>

<p begin="01:00:12.150" end="01:00:15.509" style="s2">polarization and climate denial actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.400" end="01:00:17.190" style="s2">being the default information</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.509" end="01:00:18.839" style="s2">environment I mean Jim the reason I work</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.190" end="01:00:20.579" style="s2">on these issues actually in the well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.839" end="01:00:23.549" style="s2">so concerned is I actually think the</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.579" end="01:00:24.990" style="s2">climate you know ecocide issues are the</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.549" end="01:00:27.960" style="s2">thing we really have to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.990" end="01:00:29.970" style="s2">and the technology makes it impossible</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.960" end="01:00:31.440" style="s2">for us to ever come to agree because</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.970" end="01:00:34.019" style="s2">it&#39;s polarizing us into different</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.440" end="01:00:35.999" style="s2">realities and that is the most</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.019" end="01:00:37.619" style="s2">existential issue for solving any of our</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.999" end="01:00:39.630" style="s2">issues so this is almost like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.619" end="01:00:42.480" style="s2">infrastructure issue we have to solve to</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.630" end="01:00:44.339" style="s2">to address the other ones yeah it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.480" end="01:00:46.289" style="s2">forcing function or at least it it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.339" end="01:00:48.690" style="s2">outer forcing function right if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.289" end="01:00:50.549" style="s2">destabilize their society other ways you</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.690" end="01:00:52.309" style="s2">know for instance the level of</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.549" end="01:00:54.569" style="s2">inequality gets so high that we have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.309" end="01:00:56.640" style="s2">violent revolution with the usual</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.569" end="01:00:59.309" style="s2">outcome of some bad dictator in charge</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.640" end="01:01:01.799" style="s2">you know if we don&#39;t accidentally create</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.309" end="01:01:04.589" style="s2">a genetically engineered organism which</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.799" end="01:01:07.980" style="s2">produces Giga deaths you know if we</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.589" end="01:01:09.690" style="s2">avoid nuclear war then climate change</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.980" end="01:01:12.059" style="s2">will get us some time early in the next</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.690" end="01:01:14.039" style="s2">century so we have a lot of existential</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.059" end="01:01:15.390" style="s2">risk problems not just climate change</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.039" end="01:01:17.999" style="s2">but it&#39;s the one that we know is coming</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.390" end="01:01:20.369" style="s2">the other ones are more speculative and</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.999" end="01:01:22.109" style="s2">lower probability yeah yeah we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.369" end="01:01:23.579" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a lot of sense making that we</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.109" end="01:01:25.410" style="s2">need to do to deal with all of the the</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.579" end="01:01:27.779" style="s2">shorter term threats I&#39;m with you there</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.410" end="01:01:29.970" style="s2">yeah and is there any hope at all of</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.779" end="01:01:32.819" style="s2">these incremental approaches driven by</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.970" end="01:01:34.859" style="s2">the US Congress can get us there well I</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.819" end="01:01:36.239" style="s2">think that there&#39;s what I am optimistic</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.859" end="01:01:38.099" style="s2">about and I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.239" end="01:01:41.279" style="s2">optimistic about the whole system but we</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.099" end="01:01:44.069" style="s2">have to keep going on is that at least</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.279" end="01:01:46.589" style="s2">in Congress what I found is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.069" end="01:01:48.150" style="s2">that everybody knows everything we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.589" end="01:01:50.759" style="s2">laid out and the sort of information</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.150" end="01:01:53.430" style="s2">ecology destruction dark ages sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.759" end="01:01:54.749" style="s2">thing and they just disagree it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.430" end="01:01:56.579" style="s2">actually this that they don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.749" end="01:01:59.220" style="s2">when people wake up to what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.579" end="01:02:01.109" style="s2">going on they&#39;re terrified and they want</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.220" end="01:02:02.849" style="s2">to help so I actually think there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.109" end="01:02:03.950" style="s2">know we sort of say like unlike climate</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.849" end="01:02:06.930" style="s2">change where you have to convince</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.950" end="01:02:09.539" style="s2">thousands of companies in hundreds of</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.930" end="01:02:11.369" style="s2">countries and get lots of governments to</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.539" end="01:02:14.130" style="s2">coordinate to change all of this</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.369" end="01:02:15.450" style="s2">infrastructure to be carbon neutral you</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.130" end="01:02:18.150" style="s2">know in the case of technology there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.450" end="01:02:21.359" style="s2">probably only about a thousand people in</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.150" end="01:02:22.890" style="s2">one country regulated by you know couple</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.359" end="01:02:25.530" style="s2">key states in one federal</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.890" end="01:02:27.150" style="s2">to basically make some of the needed</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.530" end="01:02:29.100" style="s2">changes so at the end of the day about</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.150" end="01:02:31.050" style="s2">only a thousand people technology</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.100" end="01:02:33.900" style="s2">leaders product managers designers</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.050" end="01:02:35.850" style="s2">executives metrics people a few</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.900" end="01:02:38.070" style="s2">regulators may be a few strategic</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.850" end="01:02:41.040" style="s2">litigation cases would need to actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.070" end="01:02:43.500" style="s2">be involved in this process and so you</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.040" end="01:02:44.730" style="s2">know we sort of have this thinking piece</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.500" end="01:02:46.530" style="s2">that we haven&#39;t published that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.730" end="01:02:49.290" style="s2">how do we get to humane technology by</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.530" end="01:02:51.990" style="s2">2030 and it involves essentially you</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.290" end="01:02:54.030" style="s2">know those thousand people activating in</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.990" end="01:02:55.230" style="s2">these specific ways that would be</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.030" end="01:02:56.700" style="s2">interesting I&#39;ve looked very much</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.230" end="01:02:58.740" style="s2">forward to reading that paper when you</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.700" end="01:03:00.360" style="s2">guys put it out something you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.740" end="01:03:02.550" style="s2">in your congressional testimony and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.360" end="01:03:04.740" style="s2">think you mentioned elsewhere is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.550" end="01:03:06.450" style="s2">current weakness of third party</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.740" end="01:03:08.160" style="s2">fact-checking services you know there</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.450" end="01:03:10.770" style="s2">are two guys on a folding table</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.160" end="01:03:13.140" style="s2">basically trying to hold back the flood</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.770" end="01:03:15.000" style="s2">of bad faith this course a friend of</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.140" end="01:03:16.110" style="s2">mine guy named dick brass who was I</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.000" end="01:03:17.340" style="s2">don&#39;t if you know dick he&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.110" end="01:03:19.440" style="s2">interesting guy he was a senior</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.340" end="01:03:21.900" style="s2">executive you know SVP level at</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.440" end="01:03:23.460" style="s2">Microsoft he was also at the same level</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.900" end="01:03:25.770" style="s2">at Oracle on the few people that was</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.460" end="01:03:28.710" style="s2">somehow managed to be personal friends</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.770" end="01:03:30.930" style="s2">with both Larry Ellison and Bill Gates</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.710" end="01:03:32.820" style="s2">he&#39;s got an idea he&#39;s been floating</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.930" end="01:03:34.170" style="s2">around that the big tech companies you</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.820" end="01:03:36.840" style="s2">know that the handful that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.170" end="01:03:39.960" style="s2">talking about ought to get together and</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.840" end="01:03:42.350" style="s2">fund a hundreds of millions of dollars a</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.960" end="01:03:45.060" style="s2">year fact-checking enterprise</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.350" end="01:03:47.970" style="s2">not-for-profit engineered rigorously to</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.060" end="01:03:49.860" style="s2">be of that objective transparent you</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.970" end="01:03:52.890" style="s2">know as good as it can possibly be and</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.860" end="01:03:54.720" style="s2">then let all these platforms use the</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.890" end="01:03:57.120" style="s2">output the signals output from this</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.720" end="01:03:59.460" style="s2">third party the fact-checking system to</p>

<p begin="01:03:59.460" end="01:04:04.290" style="s2">course any hope along those lines well I</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.670" end="01:04:06.240" style="s2">like the idea of funding with hundreds</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.290" end="01:04:08.700" style="s2">of millions of dollars a sense making</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.240" end="01:04:10.350" style="s2">protection layer for society that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.700" end="01:04:11.910" style="s2">shared among technology companies but I</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.350" end="01:04:16.140" style="s2">actually think what we really need is to</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.910" end="01:04:17.700" style="s2">build the kind of cultural sense making</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.140" end="01:04:19.500" style="s2">infrastructure you know what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.700" end="01:04:21.900" style="s2">Daniel in forests and Zack Stein talk</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.500" end="01:04:23.880" style="s2">about of just better sense making you</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.900" end="01:04:26.970" style="s2">know I use the analogy sometimes of back</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.880" end="01:04:29.460" style="s2">in the 1940s when the United States saw</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.970" end="01:04:32.640" style="s2">Germany a country that had the most</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.460" end="01:04:34.050" style="s2">sophisticated philosophy science culture</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.640" end="01:04:36.210" style="s2">you know as an epitome from I mean a</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.050" end="01:04:36.690" style="s2">kind of peak of a civilization in in</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.210" end="01:04:38.670" style="s2">Europe</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.690" end="01:04:40.860" style="s2">how that culture that was so</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.670" end="01:04:43.620" style="s2">sophisticated could be the one that</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.860" end="01:04:45.720" style="s2">would fall into authoritarian Nazi sort</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.620" end="01:04:47.550" style="s2">of rule and it sort of broke their</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.720" end="01:04:49.470" style="s2">expectations about what is psychology</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.550" end="01:04:50.820" style="s2">like we thought we knew ourselves we</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.470" end="01:04:52.950" style="s2">thought we knew human nature but the</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.820" end="01:04:54.390" style="s2">fact that this happened made us question</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.950" end="01:04:56.490" style="s2">everything and so there&#39;s a surge of</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.390" end="01:04:57.690" style="s2">interest in psychology and the United</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.490" end="01:05:00.630" style="s2">States there was a group called the</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.690" end="01:05:02.760" style="s2">committee for national morale that was</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.630" end="01:05:04.350" style="s2">funded to help cultivate what they</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.760" end="01:05:06.600" style="s2">called the Democratic personality</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.350" end="01:05:08.310" style="s2">because they didn&#39;t take a democratic</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.600" end="01:05:09.870" style="s2">mindset our Democratic personality as</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.310" end="01:05:11.760" style="s2">something you know to be taken for</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.870" end="01:05:13.110" style="s2">granted something you get for free it</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.760" end="01:05:15.480" style="s2">was something we had to grow and</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.110" end="01:05:18.030" style="s2">cultivate and people like Gregory</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.480" end="01:05:20.040" style="s2">Bateson and Margaret Mead I know you had</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.030" end="01:05:22.050" style="s2">Nora Bateson on this podcast people like</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.040" end="01:05:24.960" style="s2">this were actually brought together to</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.050" end="01:05:28.710" style="s2">say how do we cultivate a gala terian</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.960" end="01:05:30.570" style="s2">tolerant empathetic mindsets and you</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.710" end="01:05:32.850" style="s2">know this this is what in the United</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.570" end="01:05:35.040" style="s2">States was was developed there was also</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.850" end="01:05:38.400" style="s2">a related group called the Institute for</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.040" end="01:05:40.230" style="s2">propaganda analysis that helped dissect</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.400" end="01:05:42.060" style="s2">in pamphlets and in libraries they did</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.230" end="01:05:43.950" style="s2">lots of programs in schools that they</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.060" end="01:05:45.750" style="s2">helped dissect foreign propaganda</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.950" end="01:05:47.790" style="s2">because they were worried that fascist</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.750" end="01:05:50.940" style="s2">propaganda would enter into the minds of</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.790" end="01:05:53.640" style="s2">US citizens and they had to make people</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.940" end="01:05:55.080" style="s2">more aware of how that happened and you</p>

<p begin="01:07:20.190" end="01:07:24.450" style="s2">thing that I think we really need is a</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.300" end="01:07:26.670" style="s2">recognition that each society each open</p>

<p begin="01:07:30.480" end="01:07:34.800" style="s2">and so we need the kind of public</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.730" end="01:07:37.020" style="s2">education and sense-making capacity that</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.800" end="01:07:39.960" style="s2">we haven&#39;t had yeah I mean that would be</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.020" end="01:07:41.430" style="s2">good but what is it I mean you know how</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.960" end="01:07:44.370" style="s2">do you go from a point where there are</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.430" end="01:07:47.130" style="s2">some people actually believing in Flat</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.370" end="01:07:50.220" style="s2">Earth and Alec Jones to a point where we</p>

<p begin="01:07:52.650" end="01:07:57.330" style="s2">the bad stuff out is it more like an</p>

<p begin="01:08:03.960" end="01:08:07.650" style="s2">might this actually work yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.090" end="01:08:09.480" style="s2">great question I don&#39;t think anybody who</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.650" end="01:08:11.460" style="s2">claims to have a clear answer I would</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.480" end="01:08:13.800" style="s2">doubt I think the first thing for me is</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.460" end="01:08:16.290" style="s2">people have to see this problem as it</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.800" end="01:08:17.490" style="s2">occurred because if you try to say to</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.290" end="01:08:19.140" style="s2">someone like it&#39;s change your beliefs</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.490" end="01:08:20.970" style="s2">from these crazy conspiracy theories and</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.140" end="01:08:23.040" style="s2">Alex Jones that&#39;s not really gonna work</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.970" end="01:08:24.750" style="s2">well you if you if you tell someone like</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.040" end="01:08:26.250" style="s2">we did with cigarettes this is bad for</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.750" end="01:08:28.410" style="s2">you that doesn&#39;t actually stop someone</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.250" end="01:08:29.940" style="s2">from from from doing it you have to show</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.410" end="01:08:31.920" style="s2">them how they were manipulated and</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.940" end="01:08:33.210" style="s2">that&#39;s why I have always with the</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.920" end="01:08:35.790" style="s2">magician frame and the persuasive</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.210" end="01:08:38.190" style="s2">technology frame focus this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.790" end="01:08:40.440" style="s2">on what is the artificial illusion the</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.190" end="01:08:42.270" style="s2">kind of hypnotic spell that&#39;s been cast</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.440" end="01:08:44.549" style="s2">upon Society for years and years and</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.270" end="01:08:47.130" style="s2">years to say this is how the world went</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.549" end="01:08:49.410" style="s2">crazy if we don&#39;t actually have looking</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.130" end="01:08:51.000" style="s2">backwards the last seven years a view of</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.410" end="01:08:52.440" style="s2">how this is actually what happened to</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.000" end="01:08:54.299" style="s2">sense making so we can all see this</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.440" end="01:08:56.069" style="s2">thing that happened that gives you the</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.299" end="01:08:58.740" style="s2">kind of metacognitive perch you can</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.069" end="01:09:00.540" style="s2">climb up to to now see these are the</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.740" end="01:09:02.190" style="s2">distortions that happen in our society</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.540" end="01:09:03.580" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s the first thing is a</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.190" end="01:09:05.830" style="s2">collective understanding</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.580" end="01:09:08.080" style="s2">of the process of how conspiracy</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.830" end="01:09:10.900" style="s2">theories came to win and how Trust came</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.080" end="01:09:12.820" style="s2">to lose and all of that so that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.900" end="01:09:14.859" style="s2">of the the first step and then I think</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.820" end="01:09:16.930" style="s2">we need an immune system that makes it</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.859" end="01:09:19.300" style="s2">easier for us to you know not pollute</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.930" end="01:09:20.950" style="s2">the information ecology we need more</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.300" end="01:09:22.839" style="s2">deterrence rather than defense so</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.950" end="01:09:24.609" style="s2">instead of whack-a-mole you know AI</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.839" end="01:09:27.010" style="s2">super lasers that are looking at</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.609" end="01:09:28.930" style="s2">shooting down the bad information that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.010" end="01:09:31.210" style="s2">coming in and trying to scan for fake</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.930" end="01:09:33.400" style="s2">news and trying to catch it at scale we</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.210" end="01:09:34.750" style="s2">need more deterrence consequences for if</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.400" end="01:09:36.400" style="s2">something were to go wrong you would be</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.750" end="01:09:38.320" style="s2">held accountable and that would cause</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.400" end="01:09:39.609" style="s2">more people to be more careful about how</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.320" end="01:09:41.500" style="s2">they contribute to the information</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.609" end="01:09:43.810" style="s2">environment this reminds me of things</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.500" end="01:09:45.550" style="s2">like you know in China for example they</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.810" end="01:09:49.300" style="s2">will allow you to post a deep fake but</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.550" end="01:09:51.400" style="s2">only if you disclose and label it as</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.300" end="01:09:53.470" style="s2">such that this is a deep fake and you</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.400" end="01:09:55.330" style="s2">can actually go to jail if you publish a</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.470" end="01:09:57.340" style="s2">deep fake without labeling it as such</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.330" end="01:10:00.370" style="s2">and that&#39;s an interesting example where</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.340" end="01:10:01.980" style="s2">you know you can post certain things but</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.370" end="01:10:04.540" style="s2">you have to take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.980" end="01:10:06.160" style="s2">labeling it clearly you could have</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.540" end="01:10:07.810" style="s2">something like that on Facebook where</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.160" end="01:10:09.700" style="s2">they could even say hey look there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.810" end="01:10:12.400" style="s2">these mainstream news channels whether</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.700" end="01:10:14.860" style="s2">it&#39;s MSNBC or Fox News or Breitbart or</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.400" end="01:10:16.810" style="s2">whoever who might publish a deep fake</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.860" end="01:10:18.220" style="s2">and not label it and Facebook could say</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.810" end="01:10:21.190" style="s2">hey we&#39;re actually gonna suspend your</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.220" end="01:10:22.600" style="s2">account for 36 hours on Facebook if you</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.190" end="01:10:24.640" style="s2">actually post a deep fake without</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.600" end="01:10:26.410" style="s2">labeling it so they&#39;re not saying you</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.640" end="01:10:28.840" style="s2">can&#39;t post it they&#39;re saying you have to</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.410" end="01:10:30.130" style="s2">say that this was edited and labeled and</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.840" end="01:10:32.590" style="s2">I think we need more pre-emptive</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.130" end="01:10:33.250" style="s2">liability and deterrence than we need</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.590" end="01:10:35.290" style="s2">defense</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.250" end="01:10:36.550" style="s2">yeah the examples you just gave there</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.290" end="01:10:39.430" style="s2">are things that are well within the</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.550" end="01:10:40.360" style="s2">power of the platforms to do today yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.430" end="01:10:42.100" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.360" end="01:10:43.840" style="s2">how close do you think they are to</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.100" end="01:10:45.670" style="s2">feeling like they&#39;re an under enough</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.840" end="01:10:47.050" style="s2">pressure from the political sphere to</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.670" end="01:10:49.150" style="s2">actually spend some of their resources</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.050" end="01:10:50.680" style="s2">on things like this well they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.150" end="01:10:52.510" style="s2">spending nearly enough I mean we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.680" end="01:10:54.970" style="s2">given the analogy in the past that if</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.510" end="01:10:58.690" style="s2">you compare how much Facebook spends on</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.970" end="01:11:00.760" style="s2">security to their total revenue it&#39;s 6</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.690" end="01:11:03.010" style="s2">percent of the revenue you compare that</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.760" end="01:11:05.020" style="s2">to a city you know Zuckerberg likes to</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.010" end="01:11:06.850" style="s2">claim that Facebook is a global</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.020" end="01:11:09.280" style="s2">community of 2 billion people like one</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.850" end="01:11:11.200" style="s2">big city well let&#39;s take a city like Los</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.280" end="01:11:14.050" style="s2">Angeles and how much do they spend on</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.200" end="01:11:16.330" style="s2">security they spend 25 percent of their</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.050" end="01:11:17.290" style="s2">budget on security so Facebook is under</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.330" end="01:11:20.620" style="s2">spending</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.290" end="01:11:21.940" style="s2">by about four to five times basically so</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.620" end="01:11:23.620" style="s2">you know certainly one thing is they</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.940" end="01:11:25.240" style="s2">could spend then more money on it but my</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.620" end="01:11:26.410" style="s2">I think deeper issue is I think that</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.240" end="01:11:28.510" style="s2">they&#39;re not thinking about it the right</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.410" end="01:11:30.760" style="s2">way because they&#39;re focused on catching</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.510" end="01:11:32.020" style="s2">the bad guys catching the bad speech and</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.760" end="01:11:33.070" style="s2">then they have these free speech issues</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.020" end="01:11:34.390" style="s2">in the United States so they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.070" end="01:11:36.220" style="s2">to get in on it</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.390" end="01:11:38.320" style="s2">so I think we need to change the</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.220" end="01:11:41.050" style="s2">conversation from from free speech to</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.320" end="01:11:42.460" style="s2">about distribution context reach breech</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.050" end="01:11:44.500" style="s2">disclosures another thing that they</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.460" end="01:11:46.300" style="s2">could do for example is whenever there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.500" end="01:11:48.910" style="s2">an information operation they can back</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.300" end="01:11:50.980" style="s2">notify everybody who was impacted there</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.910" end="01:11:53.140" style="s2">is I think something like 55 million</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.980" end="01:11:55.270" style="s2">people impacted by a recent Saudi</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.140" end="01:11:59.400" style="s2">Arabian information operation I believe</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.270" end="01:12:01.300" style="s2">that the Russian 2016 information counts</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.400" end="01:12:03.130" style="s2">operations that they was affected about</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.300" end="01:12:04.570" style="s2">a hundred and fifty million Americans it</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.130" end="01:12:06.490" style="s2">was a hundred and twenty six million on</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.570" end="01:12:08.170" style="s2">Facebook and if you counted Instagram</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.490" end="01:12:10.300" style="s2">it&#39;s a hundred and fifty million but</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.170" end="01:12:13.240" style="s2">those people aren&#39;t even aware that they</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.300" end="01:12:14.440" style="s2">were affected or impacted so one of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.240" end="01:12:16.960" style="s2">things that Facebook could be required</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.440" end="01:12:19.060" style="s2">to do is to back notify everybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.960" end="01:12:20.350" style="s2">been affected and this is be very</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.060" end="01:12:22.300" style="s2">similar to things like when there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.350" end="01:12:23.800" style="s2">security breach and Equifax says hey</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.300" end="01:12:25.540" style="s2">there&#39;s a breach our data got out there</p>

<p begin="01:12:33.730" end="01:12:37.090" style="s2">joke is that NPR actually does this</p>

<p begin="01:12:37.090" end="01:12:40.090" style="s2">that they have to issue like a fact</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.920" end="01:12:41.770" style="s2">check and they have to go back and</p>

<p begin="01:12:41.770" end="01:12:45.700" style="s2">their app have successfully done that so</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.990" end="01:12:48.790" style="s2">the joke is if NPR can do it than</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.700" end="01:12:50.320" style="s2">Facebook can he would think so of course</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.790" end="01:12:51.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of kind of subtle</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.320" end="01:12:55.540" style="s2">distinctions there what constitutes</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.970" end="01:12:58.390" style="s2">sufficient exploit that would require a</p>

<p begin="01:13:12.850" end="01:13:16.240" style="s2">into very interesting philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.380" end="01:13:19.570" style="s2">questions about for example what is an</p>

<p begin="01:13:19.570" end="01:13:23.980" style="s2">have a lot of domestic people with ideas</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.060" end="01:13:25.630" style="s2">that might be more extreme or wanna say</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.980" end="01:13:28.060" style="s2">things but if I&#39;m Russia I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.630" end="01:13:29.110" style="s2">have to plant new information operations</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.060" end="01:13:31.170" style="s2">in your country get people to believe</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.110" end="01:13:32.400" style="s2">something new I can just find existing</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.170" end="01:13:34.679" style="s2">people who believe something that might</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.400" end="01:13:36.360" style="s2">be more fringe but I can dial them up by</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.679" end="01:13:37.920" style="s2">sending a hundred Russian BOTS at them</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.360" end="01:13:39.929" style="s2">and making them get thousands and</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.920" end="01:13:41.640" style="s2">thousands of retweets and and and make</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.929" end="01:13:43.500" style="s2">them go viral and so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.640" end="01:13:44.790" style="s2">question of well Russia&#39;s not even and</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.500" end="01:13:46.410" style="s2">isn&#39;t to be Russia by the way it can be</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.790" end="01:13:49.230" style="s2">anybody and just using them as an</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.410" end="01:13:50.489" style="s2">example my friend Renee di Resta was on</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.230" end="01:13:52.830" style="s2">the Senate Intelligence Committee and</p>

<p begin="01:13:54.480" end="01:13:57.449" style="s2">a bit about it and one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.400" end="01:13:59.400" style="s2">that they did go after her beyond</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.449" end="01:14:01.320" style="s2">african-americans was the state</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.400" end="01:14:03.510" style="s2">secessionist movements so the California</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.320" end="01:14:05.219" style="s2">secessionist movement and the Texas</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.510" end="01:14:06.480" style="s2">session is movement and so you could say</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.219" end="01:14:07.800" style="s2">well what&#39;s the harm there is the</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.480" end="01:14:09.870" style="s2">question I hear you asking medium</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.800" end="01:14:12.600" style="s2">because those people believe that anyway</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.870" end="01:14:14.280" style="s2">why should we notify you that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.600" end="01:14:15.840" style="s2">been affected by an influence operation</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.280" end="01:14:17.219" style="s2">when I was just thinking and believing</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.840" end="01:14:19.410" style="s2">those things and agree with it anyway</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.219" end="01:14:21.690" style="s2">the point is that people feel more</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.410" end="01:14:23.610" style="s2">discussed in repugnance when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.690" end="01:14:24.750" style="s2">realized that they&#39;re the target of</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.610" end="01:14:26.699" style="s2">something of something that&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.750" end="01:14:28.020" style="s2">influence them and so I think that</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.699" end="01:14:30.090" style="s2">that&#39;s what we have to introduce is the</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.020" end="01:14:31.620" style="s2">common knowledge that there are large</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.090" end="01:14:34.140" style="s2">influence operations happening from</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.620" end="01:14:36.000" style="s2">foreign countries all the time and that</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.140" end="01:14:37.800" style="s2">this is not just this sort of safe space</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.000" end="01:14:40.410" style="s2">so our our trust is essentially</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.800" end="01:14:41.730" style="s2">miscalibrated you know we&#39;re calibrated</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.410" end="01:14:42.810" style="s2">to trust things to a certain degree in</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.730" end="01:14:44.820" style="s2">the physical world but we should have</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.810" end="01:14:47.130" style="s2">less trust in the virtual world and</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.820" end="01:14:48.390" style="s2">we&#39;re not really operating as such at</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.130" end="01:14:50.370" style="s2">least a different kind of trust I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.390" end="01:14:52.650" style="s2">have to worry about somebody robbing me</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.370" end="01:14:54.719" style="s2">at gunpoint online but I do have to</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.650" end="01:14:56.850" style="s2">worry about them inserting perverse</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.719" end="01:14:59.190" style="s2">memes into my head by repetition if</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.850" end="01:15:01.110" style="s2">nothing else that&#39;s right and I just</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.190" end="01:15:02.820" style="s2">think that overall people underestimate</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.110" end="01:15:04.500" style="s2">the cost of what we&#39;re talking about in</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.820" end="01:15:06.239" style="s2">the scale because it sounds so small and</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.500" end="01:15:08.520" style="s2">so subtle right I mean you know like</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.239" end="01:15:10.290" style="s2">those military weapons that you can</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.520" end="01:15:12.360" style="s2">point it at someone and you can generate</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.290" end="01:15:14.010" style="s2">sound that only they will hear or even</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.360" end="01:15:15.719" style="s2">it sounds so loud that will actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.010" end="01:15:17.100" style="s2">catch them off guard there&#39;s like these</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.719" end="01:15:18.420" style="s2">specific weapons that do that so if you</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.100" end="01:15:20.310" style="s2">move an inch away from that person you</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.420" end="01:15:22.320" style="s2">won&#39;t hear anything that&#39;s like micro</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.310" end="01:15:24.090" style="s2">targeting right I can micro target</p>

<p begin="01:20:05.690" end="01:20:09.530" style="s2">exactly the ability to synthesize text</p>

<p begin="01:20:22.880" end="01:20:26.449" style="s2">form and because the dimensionality of</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.650" end="01:20:28.280" style="s2">text is so much less than the richness</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.449" end="01:20:30.530" style="s2">of voice or voice synthesis it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.280" end="01:20:32.539" style="s2">easier to fake then you add things like</p>

<p begin="01:27:21.280" end="01:27:25.450" style="s2">so the main thing that we focus on with</p>

<p begin="01:29:26.139" end="01:29:30.130" style="s2">morning next to our alarm it sort of</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.670" end="01:29:31.330" style="s2">lets us create that space and say what</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.130" end="01:29:32.920" style="s2">do you want to do and you could say I</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.330" end="01:29:35.530" style="s2">want to pick these habits whether it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:32:34.869" end="01:32:39.280" style="s2">things we have to look at is just making</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.510" end="01:32:40.919" style="s2">sure that the expertise guiding the</p>
