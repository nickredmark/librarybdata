<p begin="00:00:09.960" end="00:00:15.630" style="s2">loved it I loved it was about Tracey Mae</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.019" end="00:00:17.340" style="s2">and her speech and how we need to allow</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.630" end="00:00:19.430" style="s2">our leaders to be fallible and bring</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.340" end="00:00:23.130" style="s2">emotion and the actual human beings and</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.430" end="00:00:24.660" style="s2">yeah we do but that&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.130" end="00:00:26.490" style="s2">going to happen because we&#39;ve designed a</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.660" end="00:00:28.109" style="s2">system where we need our leaders to look</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.490" end="00:00:29.910" style="s2">like that that&#39;s who gets voted in that</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.109" end="00:00:33.719" style="s2">- it&#39;s not going to change overnight</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.910" end="00:00:36.329" style="s2">what we can do is create a space for us</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.719" end="00:00:39.960" style="s2">to be actual real fallible human beings</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.329" end="00:00:41.969" style="s2">to bring our true selves to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.960" end="00:00:43.890" style="s2">conversation and how that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.969" end="00:00:46.760" style="s2">means something and so that is what we</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.890" end="00:00:49.739" style="s2">are gonna create together is a system to</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.760" end="00:00:51.780" style="s2">be able to have deep conversations it</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.739" end="00:00:54.930" style="s2">isn&#39;t about the anger and the tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.780" end="00:00:56.760" style="s2">although that will come in pieces and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.930" end="00:00:58.710" style="s2">will deal with it as it does but to</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.760" end="00:01:00.719" style="s2">create the space where you can be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.710" end="00:01:03.390" style="s2">fallible human being where you can make</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.719" end="00:01:06.780" style="s2">mistakes and still be seen as worthy</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.390" end="00:01:08.430" style="s2">because we&#39;re all worthy and society in</p>
