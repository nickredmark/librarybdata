<p begin="00:03:04.680" end="00:03:08.430" style="s2">a statement and then she follows it up</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.270" end="00:03:10.590" style="s2">with the question she said we will not</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.430" end="00:03:13.710" style="s2">survive without adopting soulful living</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.590" end="00:03:15.510" style="s2">as the soul of humanity awakens the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.710" end="00:03:17.400" style="s2">unfoldment of higher consciousness will</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.510" end="00:03:19.620" style="s2">change civilization to a new era based</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.400" end="00:03:23.100" style="s2">on wholeness interrelatedness and</p>

<p begin="00:03:23.100" end="00:03:26.910" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion on a</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.630" end="00:03:28.610" style="s2">simple premise of recognizing with</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.910" end="00:03:32.370" style="s2">reverence and awe that we have a soul</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.610" end="00:03:33.630" style="s2">thank you so this is a very pertinent</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.370" end="00:03:36.110" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.630" end="00:03:39.570" style="s2">Karina&#39;s asking because there have been</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.110" end="00:03:42.300" style="s2">a series of discussions one with paul</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.570" end="00:03:44.640" style="s2">van der clay another one with Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.300" end="00:03:47.610" style="s2">Sweeney and Christopher Metro Pietro and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.640" end="00:03:48.630" style="s2">also overlapping with some discussions</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.610" end="00:03:53.910" style="s2">with Jordan Hall where I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.630" end="00:04:00.180" style="s2">exploring this topic the topic of soul</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.910" end="00:04:01.709" style="s2">so there&#39;s a term that I&#39;ve adopted for</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.180" end="00:04:04.170" style="s2">trying to describe this methodology stop</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.709" end="00:04:06.600" style="s2">my term it&#39;s so Kari has a book on</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.170" end="00:04:09.720" style="s2">Augustine&#39;s invention of the inner self</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.600" end="00:04:11.880" style="s2">but he he says he dislikes the title the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.720" end="00:04:13.410" style="s2">books published in English but dislikes</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.880" end="00:04:16.470" style="s2">the title because the English word</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.410" end="00:04:18.150" style="s2">invention is not what he wants he</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.470" end="00:04:20.609" style="s2">actually wants the Latin term inventio</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.150" end="00:04:24.450" style="s2">because the Latin word inventio</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.609" end="00:04:26.010" style="s2">actually straddles the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.450" end="00:04:27.210" style="s2">between inventing something and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.010" end="00:04:28.680" style="s2">discovering something</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.210" end="00:04:30.660" style="s2">which is actually getting pertinent for</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.680" end="00:04:35.990" style="s2">a sort of a Neoplatonic framework which</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.660" end="00:04:38.699" style="s2">Augustine belonged to and so I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.990" end="00:04:40.710" style="s2">co-opted this with the term of reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.699" end="00:04:42.650" style="s2">EO and so what I&#39;ve been exploring in</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.710" end="00:04:48.419" style="s2">the dia logos is the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.650" end="00:04:52.100" style="s2">reinvent EO of soul and the way I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.419" end="00:04:54.449" style="s2">tried to understand that is instead of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.100" end="00:04:58.949" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to sort of put aside the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.449" end="00:05:00.840" style="s2">metaphysical and ontological Heritage</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.949" end="00:05:04.050" style="s2">baggage depending on how you want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.840" end="00:05:06.690" style="s2">view it and try to get a sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.050" end="00:05:10.259" style="s2">again from a phenomenological functional</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.690" end="00:05:14.370" style="s2">and the idea that I have been exploring</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.259" end="00:05:18.080" style="s2">India logos is that there is a capacity</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.370" end="00:05:22.830" style="s2">we have to come into a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:24.599" style="s2">between the more nests of reality that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.830" end="00:05:26.550" style="s2">is afforded by the fact that reality is</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.599" end="00:05:30.210" style="s2">ultimately combinatorially explosiveness</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.550" end="00:05:34.710" style="s2">Spinoza like to say that it has infinite</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.210" end="00:05:37.490" style="s2">attributes so between the more nests and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.710" end="00:05:41.280" style="s2">then something that Collingwood made</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.490" end="00:05:44.039" style="s2">really clear an apparent in his</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.280" end="00:05:45.510" style="s2">philosophy of aesthetics and art and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.039" end="00:05:47.820" style="s2">think it&#39;s deeply convergent with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.510" end="00:05:52.380" style="s2">Buddhist notion which is this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.820" end="00:05:59.039" style="s2">such miss dat everything even this rock</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.380" end="00:06:01.919" style="s2">has a it has a particularity an identity</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.039" end="00:06:04.470" style="s2">as the term is a suchness a here nowness</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.919" end="00:06:06.419" style="s2">that is non categorical there&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.470" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">which this is even if it&#39;s a stone even</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.419" end="00:06:11.190" style="s2">if it&#39;s a black rot there&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.639" end="00:06:13.740" style="s2">which it is unlike all the other members</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.190" end="00:06:15.930" style="s2">in that category and as those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.740" end="00:06:17.460" style="s2">have followed this series you know that</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.930" end="00:06:18.930" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about relating to this not</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.460" end="00:06:23.520" style="s2">in the Hamming mode of having it as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.930" end="00:06:25.860" style="s2">Roth but in the bean mode right relating</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.520" end="00:06:27.720" style="s2">to it almost like a dhow I&#39;m not calling</p>

<p begin="00:06:27.720" end="00:06:33.690" style="s2">is its particular suchness Sunnis be</p>

<p begin="00:06:33.690" end="00:06:38.520" style="s2">somewhere with this because I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.400" end="00:06:41.630" style="s2">to get how we can bring back an</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.520" end="00:06:41.630" style="s2">important notion</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.169" end="00:06:52.169" style="s2">so if you think of the more nests as an</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.669" end="00:06:54.810" style="s2">experience of the mystery of</p>

<p begin="00:06:54.810" end="00:07:02.940" style="s2">a combinatorial explosive reality and</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.759" end="00:07:05.789" style="s2">you can think of the suchness as the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.940" end="00:07:08.849" style="s2">mystery of our individuation how our</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.789" end="00:07:14.370" style="s2">relevance realization is self evolving</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.849" end="00:07:17.150" style="s2">in a way that right never never can be</p>

<p begin="00:07:25.560" end="00:07:31.259" style="s2">young made a great deal of this there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:09:10.390" end="00:09:23.320" style="s2">is and so I think that if we come to</p>

<p begin="00:15:16.100" end="00:15:21.649" style="s2">doing that and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.079" end="00:15:24.489" style="s2">thing to do okay so let&#39;s try and move</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.649" end="00:15:24.489" style="s2">on to the next question</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.919" end="00:15:29.630" style="s2">Mackenzie Levitt who&#39;s also a patron</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.619" end="00:15:31.699" style="s2">it&#39;s good to hear from you Mackenzie</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.630" end="00:15:33.440" style="s2">what are your thoughts on the book film</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.699" end="00:15:36.110" style="s2">Life of Pi and its relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.440" end="00:15:39.490" style="s2">meeting crisis this is a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.110" end="00:15:42.350" style="s2">question I highly recommend the film I</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.490" end="00:15:44.870" style="s2">found the film just aesthetically to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.350" end="00:15:46.220" style="s2">one of the most beautiful films I have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.870" end="00:15:48.769" style="s2">scene in my life</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.220" end="00:15:50.600" style="s2">I believe it was Angley the director but</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.769" end="00:15:52.639" style="s2">I might be misremembering and if so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.600" end="00:15:54.829" style="s2">apologize to the person who actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.639" end="00:15:59.509" style="s2">directed it but I&#39;m not aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.829" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">cinematographer I don&#39;t remember but the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.509" end="00:16:05.509" style="s2">Life of Pi does something really really</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:08.360" style="s2">beautiful because it brings out a</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.509" end="00:16:11.540" style="s2">contrast to my mind in such an</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.360" end="00:16:12.980" style="s2">aesthetically powerful aesthetically</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.540" end="00:16:14.600" style="s2">attractive manner it brings out a</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.980" end="00:16:19.130" style="s2">distinction that is actually central for</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.600" end="00:16:23.120" style="s2">the meeting crisis so I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.130" end="00:16:24.139" style="s2">to do this with spoilers so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.120" end="00:16:26.149" style="s2">going to apologize</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.139" end="00:16:27.740" style="s2">don&#39;t listen for the next 10 minutes if</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.149" end="00:16:29.660" style="s2">you haven&#39;t seen the movie or read the</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.740" end="00:16:30.949" style="s2">book and you intend to because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.660" end="00:16:33.290" style="s2">no way for me to talk about it this</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.949" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">adapt this point without there being a</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.290" end="00:16:38.300" style="s2">bit of a spoiler so let&#39;s talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:41.329" style="s2">movie because I think this will be more</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.300" end="00:16:43.490" style="s2">accessible to more people so the movie</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.329" end="00:16:46.569" style="s2">seems to be centering around this</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.490" end="00:16:49.370" style="s2">question about how to think about God</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.569" end="00:16:54.110" style="s2">well that&#39;s you know Wow and you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.370" end="00:16:56.000" style="s2">there&#39;s and the thing is this is like</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.110" end="00:16:58.160" style="s2">when you&#39;re doing sort of meditative</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.000" end="00:17:01.189" style="s2">questioning and you pick questions that</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.160" end="00:17:02.029" style="s2">present lots of obvious answers and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.189" end="00:17:04.970" style="s2">you&#39;re not supposed to just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.029" end="00:17:06.770" style="s2">reject those answers but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.970" end="00:17:08.600" style="s2">supposed to accept them either you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.770" end="00:17:10.839" style="s2">supposed to treat them as portals and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.600" end="00:17:13.159" style="s2">see through them to what they portend</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.839" end="00:17:14.179" style="s2">and that&#39;s the kind of question that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.159" end="00:17:15.319" style="s2">the way we should relate to this</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.179" end="00:17:17.809" style="s2">question because of course a lot of all</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.319" end="00:17:19.520" style="s2">these answers come up their culture is</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.809" end="00:17:22.159" style="s2">shouting lots of obvious answers around</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.520" end="00:17:24.799" style="s2">this all the time so what the book does</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.159" end="00:17:27.409" style="s2">is it instead of sort of confronting all</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.799" end="00:17:30.169" style="s2">of that it sort of goes yes but and it</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.409" end="00:17:32.780" style="s2">sort of the movie and the book but so</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.169" end="00:17:35.210" style="s2">what what it does is it says okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.780" end="00:17:37.970" style="s2">question ìhow to think of a god and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.210" end="00:17:40.159" style="s2">instead the person tells a story right</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.970" end="00:17:42.919" style="s2">tells the story of Pi but whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.159" end="00:17:43.490" style="s2">the adult version of this boy was given</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.919" end="00:17:45.890" style="s2">the nickname</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.490" end="00:17:51.170" style="s2">and it&#39;s right and the adult is telling</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.890" end="00:17:54.080" style="s2">the story of this very heroic story in</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.170" end="00:17:56.300" style="s2">the Union sense of a hero a boy who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.080" end="00:17:58.250" style="s2">been in a ship wrecked and is trapped in</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.300" end="00:17:59.870" style="s2">a lifeboat with the tiger and some other</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.250" end="00:18:06.320" style="s2">animals and especially the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.870" end="00:18:07.850" style="s2">right two tigers and you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.320" end="00:18:09.860" style="s2">could Blake&#39;s Tiger Tiger burning bright</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.850" end="00:18:12.920" style="s2">so there&#39;s all the all those illusions</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.860" end="00:18:14.990" style="s2">all this deeply archetypal stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.920" end="00:18:20.000" style="s2">being alluded to you go through this</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.990" end="00:18:21.980" style="s2">whole story and you see this and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.000" end="00:18:23.330" style="s2">and the boy is going through he&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.980" end="00:18:25.790" style="s2">adolescent he&#39;s going through these</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.330" end="00:18:28.580" style="s2">fundamental transformations in his</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.790" end="00:18:30.230" style="s2">confrontation with these animals these</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.580" end="00:18:32.450" style="s2">sort of archetypal animals but most</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.230" end="00:18:35.059" style="s2">especially the tiger and with himself</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.450" end="00:18:37.610" style="s2">and of course with the sea and then the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.059" end="00:18:40.340" style="s2">world is right it&#39;s almost like a union</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.610" end="00:18:42.380" style="s2">synchronicity although I have questions</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.340" end="00:18:44.230" style="s2">about what that exactly is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.380" end="00:18:47.450" style="s2">be pointing to but we&#39;ll put that aside</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.230" end="00:18:52.010" style="s2">like that because he also comes upon</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.450" end="00:18:55.070" style="s2">these these venues these places these</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.010" end="00:18:57.710" style="s2">locations that are mythic in that</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.070" end="00:19:00.620" style="s2">they&#39;re beautiful but they&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.710" end="00:19:02.840" style="s2">right they they pour ten again they</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.620" end="00:19:05.000" style="s2">portend a deeper meaning and a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.840" end="00:19:07.460" style="s2">significance and they have allusions to</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.000" end="00:19:09.860" style="s2">mythological experiences like it goes to</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.460" end="00:19:11.900" style="s2">this island and it&#39;s alluding to you</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.860" end="00:19:15.140" style="s2">know when his mother directed a short of</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.900" end="00:19:19.540" style="s2">a picture of Krishna as the ultimate and</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.140" end="00:19:19.540" style="s2">all this stuff is sort of being</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.280" end="00:19:29.210" style="s2">actualized and put into association but</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.290" end="00:19:32.059" style="s2">not in a clearly closed final form it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.210" end="00:19:33.980" style="s2">no it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s left very the things</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.059" end="00:19:35.840" style="s2">are very febrile and moving around and</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.980" end="00:19:37.850" style="s2">so all of this is going on and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.840" end="00:19:41.540" style="s2">getting deeply engrossed with this whole</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.850" end="00:19:44.800" style="s2">thing and then you find out but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.540" end="00:19:48.110" style="s2">story is actually in a deep sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.800" end="00:19:51.500" style="s2">allegorical that it&#39;s not an accurate</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.110" end="00:19:54.080" style="s2">depiction of what the boy went through</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.500" end="00:19:55.820" style="s2">historically what the boy went through</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.080" end="00:19:57.080" style="s2">historically was actually an interaction</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.820" end="00:19:59.989" style="s2">with other human beings of</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.080" end="00:20:03.799" style="s2">was brutal and aspects of himself his</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.989" end="00:20:06.889" style="s2">own tiger nature had come out and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.799" end="00:20:08.509" style="s2">realize oh and then in the movie one of</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.889" end="00:20:10.580" style="s2">the characters suddenly realizes this</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.509" end="00:20:12.440" style="s2">structure position and then the question</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.580" end="00:20:15.980" style="s2">of course emerges well why did you tell</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.440" end="00:20:18.320" style="s2">the story this way to me and and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.980" end="00:20:20.480" style="s2">there&#39;s the there&#39;s the the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.320" end="00:20:21.489" style="s2">given well this is this is a much better</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.480" end="00:20:24.590" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.489" end="00:20:25.610" style="s2">now there&#39;s part of us a Cartesian part</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.590" end="00:20:27.739" style="s2">of us that goes well how can it be a</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.610" end="00:20:31.429" style="s2">better story it&#39;s not historically true</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.739" end="00:20:34.269" style="s2">it&#39;s less but the point is point is you</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.429" end="00:20:38.210" style="s2">actually understand all of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.269" end="00:20:40.519" style="s2">archetypal mythopoetic processes that</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.210" end="00:20:43.429" style="s2">were at work in the adolescent and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.519" end="00:20:45.980" style="s2">get a deeper participatory sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.429" end="00:20:47.749" style="s2">transformation within himself how he was</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.980" end="00:20:49.429" style="s2">connected to himself and how he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.749" end="00:20:51.320" style="s2">connected to the world and how he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.429" end="00:20:53.690" style="s2">connected to his religious heritage you</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.320" end="00:20:56.119" style="s2">get that much more profoundly than he</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.690" end="00:20:59.600" style="s2">would get in a literal propositional</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.119" end="00:21:02.539" style="s2">history and then you remember this whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.600" end="00:21:04.220" style="s2">thing is an allegory you&#39;re reading a</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.539" end="00:21:06.409" style="s2">story or you&#39;re watching a movie and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.220" end="00:21:08.529" style="s2">within the frame you&#39;re getting that</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.409" end="00:21:12.169" style="s2">this whole telling of his autobiography</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.529" end="00:21:16.759" style="s2">is a way of getting us to understand how</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.169" end="00:21:19.879" style="s2">we should think about God we should be</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.759" end="00:21:24.769" style="s2">thinking about God right in the way in</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.879" end="00:21:28.730" style="s2">which the boy told the story not so much</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.769" end="00:21:33.230" style="s2">as trying to capture the propositional</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.730" end="00:21:35.419" style="s2">literal truths and so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.230" end="00:21:37.239" style="s2">distinction between a Cartesian notion</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.419" end="00:21:40.489" style="s2">of truth which is accurate</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.239" end="00:21:43.129" style="s2">representations that literally right</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.489" end="00:21:46.129" style="s2">correspond to the world and hiding this</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.129" end="00:21:49.399" style="s2">sense of truth is Alafaya which is to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.129" end="00:21:51.649" style="s2">in right relationship coupled to reality</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.399" end="00:21:54.379" style="s2">in such a way that there&#39;s a reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.649" end="00:21:57.950" style="s2">opening and reality could pen disclose</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.379" end="00:22:00.970" style="s2">itself to us insofar as we are receptive</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.950" end="00:22:03.440" style="s2">and we will identify with a</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.970" end="00:22:06.320" style="s2">transformation a transformative response</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.440" end="00:22:09.660" style="s2">that affords it coming into existence</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.320" end="00:22:15.300" style="s2">this is understanding truth as a process</p>

<p begin="00:24:39.160" end="00:24:42.669" style="s2">who&#39;s an atheist and then and she&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:24:42.669" end="00:24:47.289" style="s2">moment where she sees she&#39;s exposed and</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.460" end="00:24:50.860" style="s2">she says oh they should have sent a poet</p>

<p begin="00:24:50.860" end="00:25:00.400" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what I recommend for a way</p>

<p begin="00:30:09.280" end="00:30:12.430" style="s2">I&#39;m doing the form right so that when</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.200" end="00:30:14.560" style="s2">I&#39;m actually fighting there&#39;s no one</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.430" end="00:30:16.840" style="s2">there and so the idea is I use</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.560" end="00:30:18.250" style="s2">imagination to Train perception and of</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.840" end="00:30:19.900" style="s2">course using perception to train</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.250" end="00:30:22.330" style="s2">imagination all the time the two hours</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.900" end="00:30:24.790" style="s2">that I talked about earlier so I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.330" end="00:30:28.510" style="s2">that&#39;s an integral part of any good</p>

<p begin="00:30:32.740" end="00:30:36.700" style="s2">facilitate that because you&#39;re training</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.150" end="00:30:38.260" style="s2">your attention to zoom in and out and</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.700" end="00:30:40.210" style="s2">you&#39;re training it to zoom if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.260" end="00:30:42.190" style="s2">allow me up and down between top-down</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.210" end="00:30:44.350" style="s2">processing which is what imagination is</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.190" end="00:30:46.420" style="s2">and bottom-up processing which what</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.350" end="00:30:49.420" style="s2">perception is so not only be in out</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.420" end="00:30:51.580" style="s2">right you&#39;re also doing the up down the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.420" end="00:30:53.620" style="s2">digital feature all etc so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.580" end="00:30:55.990" style="s2">a powerful way of also training</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.620" end="00:30:58.450" style="s2">attentional scaling as well as training</p>

<p begin="00:32:01.049" end="00:32:05.129" style="s2">and then you have to practice everyday</p>

<p begin="00:33:12.809" end="00:33:17.770" style="s2">homes and valorize it I would recommend</p>

<p begin="00:37:33.270" end="00:37:39.029" style="s2">already presented on this and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.539" end="00:37:42.390" style="s2">think it is coincidental that these</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.029" end="00:37:45.840" style="s2">experiences often trigger</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.390" end="00:37:48.810" style="s2">mystical and religious responses because</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.840" end="00:37:50.160" style="s2">I think religio and I tried to argue</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.810" end="00:37:52.910" style="s2">this independently assort on just</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.160" end="00:37:55.920" style="s2">gesturing at existing arguments religio</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.910" end="00:37:59.700" style="s2">when we enhance religio for its own sake</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.920" end="00:38:03.060" style="s2">into experiences of beauty and Wonder</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.700" end="00:38:05.400" style="s2">and awe and if we push it too far we can</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.060" end="00:38:07.380" style="s2">fall into horror alright and we find</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.400" end="00:38:10.050" style="s2">them so positively valuable I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.380" end="00:38:12.810" style="s2">that&#39;s the core of spirituality of</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.050" end="00:38:15.300" style="s2">religion that&#39;s the religio part of</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.810" end="00:38:17.550" style="s2">religion at least and we celebrate it</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.300" end="00:38:20.130" style="s2">and we do it for its own sake precisely</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.550" end="00:38:23.760" style="s2">because what we&#39;re doing is engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.130" end="00:38:26.820" style="s2">the development the actualization of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.760" end="00:38:29.340" style="s2">deepest potential of a relevance</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.820" end="00:38:32.520" style="s2">realization machinery on our capacity</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.340" end="00:38:35.400" style="s2">for being in right relationship deeply</p>

<p begin="00:38:35.400" end="00:38:39.090" style="s2">coupling to ourselves to each other and</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.040" end="00:38:42.660" style="s2">to the world</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.090" end="00:38:46.350" style="s2">and so psychedelic experiences when they</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.660" end="00:38:48.980" style="s2">are properly home of the capacity to put</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.350" end="00:38:51.650" style="s2">us into that state where we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.980" end="00:38:54.270" style="s2">experiencing something like beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.650" end="00:38:56.670" style="s2">wonder and awe on the continuum of</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.270" end="00:38:58.560" style="s2">insight flow a higher state of</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.670" end="00:39:01.730" style="s2">consciousness that sense of being called</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.560" end="00:39:03.990" style="s2">in a transformative experience etc and</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.730" end="00:39:06.660" style="s2">and that&#39;s why the empirical research</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.990" end="00:39:08.130" style="s2">especially at the Griffis labs and also</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.660" end="00:39:09.780" style="s2">some of the work that Newberg is doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.130" end="00:39:11.700" style="s2">and some of the work that I&#39;m doing with</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.780" end="00:39:13.770" style="s2">Jenson Kim and Michelle Ferrari of</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.700" end="00:39:16.890" style="s2">Jennifers teller and Bryan hasta caneva</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.770" end="00:39:18.990" style="s2">ah all of it is pointing towards the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.890" end="00:39:21.570" style="s2">deep connection but I&#39;m going to return</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.990" end="00:39:26.450" style="s2">to this once again I think it is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.570" end="00:39:29.340" style="s2">mistake to reduce this to just</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.450" end="00:39:32.990" style="s2">neurological states that have been</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.340" end="00:39:36.810" style="s2">created by the chemical interaction</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.990" end="00:39:39.170" style="s2">afforded by the drug I think a much more</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.810" end="00:39:40.860" style="s2">a broader developmental dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.170" end="00:39:43.800" style="s2">understanding needs to be brought to</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.860" end="00:39:46.560" style="s2">bear to properly understand why you see</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.800" end="00:39:49.050" style="s2">this convergence because the convergence</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.560" end="00:39:53.340" style="s2">is not I mean there&#39;s some convergence</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.050" end="00:39:55.490" style="s2">of content but the content but people</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.340" end="00:39:57.530" style="s2">the beliefs in content</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.490" end="00:39:59.900" style="s2">other than other like the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.530" end="00:40:01.100" style="s2">metaphysical propositions I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.900" end="00:40:03.080" style="s2">talking about the propositions in which</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.100" end="00:40:05.000" style="s2">people are trying to articulate right</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.080" end="00:40:08.930" style="s2">when they&#39;re trying to articulate how</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.000" end="00:40:10.460" style="s2">they are coupled to themselves into each</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.930" end="00:40:12.740" style="s2">other trail I&#39;m not talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.460" end="00:40:14.450" style="s2">but I&#39;m talking about like when when</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.740" end="00:40:17.000" style="s2">people sort of pronounce oh well the</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.450" end="00:40:18.950" style="s2">world has seven layers or ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.000" end="00:40:20.330" style="s2">it&#39;s all just change or there is a god</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.950" end="00:40:23.900" style="s2">or there isn&#39;t a god because all of</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.330" end="00:40:26.480" style="s2">these things come out of these these of</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.900" end="00:40:27.619" style="s2">these experiences so but the universals</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.480" end="00:40:28.880" style="s2">are much more you know they&#39;re much more</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.619" end="00:40:31.119" style="s2">obvious they&#39;re much more not</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:33.860" style="s2">adversarial much more adverbial</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.119" end="00:40:36.350" style="s2">universals like there&#39;s oneness and</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.860" end="00:40:39.140" style="s2">there&#39;s deep Uranus and nowness and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.350" end="00:40:40.910" style="s2">connectedness and beauty in a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.140" end="00:40:43.160" style="s2">whether then and what&#39;s most important a</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.910" end="00:40:46.100" style="s2">sense of hyper realness and a realness</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.160" end="00:40:48.380" style="s2">that demands change from me I think we</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.100" end="00:40:51.650" style="s2">need to pay attention to all of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.380" end="00:40:53.570" style="s2">increasing empirical evidence both the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.650" end="00:40:57.500" style="s2">qualitative reports and the more</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.570" end="00:40:59.990" style="s2">experimental work is being done and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.500" end="00:41:06.440" style="s2">what I think we should be understanding</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.990" end="00:41:09.230" style="s2">is that if we do two things if we</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.440" end="00:41:10.910" style="s2">understand these states from a4e</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.230" end="00:41:13.340" style="s2">cognitive science perspective not just</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.910" end="00:41:18.640" style="s2">as neurological States but as embodied</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.340" end="00:41:21.950" style="s2">embedded in active developmental right</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.640" end="00:41:24.290" style="s2">developmental dynamical systems and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.950" end="00:41:28.550" style="s2">we and we also see that within the</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.290" end="00:41:32.600" style="s2">framework of a central tradition then we</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.550" end="00:41:36.230" style="s2">can get a good the answer about why we</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.600" end="00:41:38.170" style="s2">see we tend to experience a subset of</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.230" end="00:41:41.180" style="s2">these psychedelic experiences as</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.170" end="00:41:42.530" style="s2">mystical and religious experiences so I</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.180" end="00:41:44.810" style="s2">hope that answers your question</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.530" end="00:41:47.210" style="s2">it&#39;s another the questions are getting</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.810" end="00:41:49.790" style="s2">today and I mean this and I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.210" end="00:41:52.100" style="s2">complementary they&#39;re profound and so I</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.790" end="00:41:54.170" style="s2">can&#39;t answer them by like oh if you give</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.100" end="00:41:57.440" style="s2">PDP do it here&#39;s a how I answer you I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.170" end="00:42:00.140" style="s2">got to give a long answer because</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.440" end="00:42:04.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s working these</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.140" end="00:42:06.950" style="s2">questions so this question from Rob hey</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.310" end="00:42:09.110" style="s2">Rob who&#39;s also patron is there anything</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.950" end="00:42:12.050" style="s2">like stoic poetry that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.110" end="00:42:13.550" style="s2">demand as the more poetic text to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.050" end="00:42:15.530" style="s2">Lexi oh he&#39;s talking about Lexi Oh</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.550" end="00:42:18.290" style="s2">Davina with if there is not do you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.530" end="00:42:21.650" style="s2">any Taoist or Buddhist source texts or</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.290" end="00:42:23.930" style="s2">commentaries that you&#39;d like and why and</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.650" end="00:42:25.760" style="s2">thanks John and a more for all you do I</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.930" end="00:42:30.140" style="s2">thank you for wrote for thinking that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.760" end="00:42:32.390" style="s2">always appreciated so there are a few</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.140" end="00:42:36.130" style="s2">sort of stoic hymns</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.390" end="00:42:40.040" style="s2">bye bye bye : s disease and I think also</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.130" end="00:42:46.210" style="s2">by Zeno tu suce I don&#39;t know if that</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.040" end="00:42:46.210" style="s2">you&#39;d find those particularly powerful I</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.040" end="00:42:55.340" style="s2">yes stoic poetry not too much of it has</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.300" end="00:43:00.800" style="s2">survived I&#39;m trying to think of a modern</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.340" end="00:43:05.300" style="s2">analog to it I I can&#39;t think of anybody</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.800" end="00:43:09.740" style="s2">that comes to mind there&#39;s a bit in in</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.300" end="00:43:14.120" style="s2">Gerard Manley Hopkins that feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.740" end="00:43:18.050" style="s2">lot of how the stoic sort of felt the</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.120" end="00:43:21.560" style="s2">vibrancy of the logos in reality that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.050" end="00:43:26.150" style="s2">definitely the case but Dartmouth and</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.560" end="00:43:26.930" style="s2">Hopkins is a Christian a Taoist text</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.150" end="00:43:29.660" style="s2">that&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.930" end="00:43:34.160" style="s2">I think the toilet HN is really really</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.660" end="00:43:37.220" style="s2">powerful but sorry I don&#39;t mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.160" end="00:43:44.360" style="s2">mean to be disheartening the talent hm</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.220" end="00:43:47.780" style="s2">has to be in order to do Lexi Oh with</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.360" end="00:43:49.940" style="s2">something like the talent HN it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.780" end="00:43:53.270" style="s2">idea that you&#39;re doing that you&#39;d be are</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.940" end="00:43:55.940" style="s2">doing some Dallas practices as well like</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.270" end="00:43:57.290" style="s2">some of the Chico or Taichi evident some</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.940" end="00:44:01.280" style="s2">of the Chicana I&#39;ve been teaching or</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.290" end="00:44:06.680" style="s2">perhaps Taichi so if you want to start</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.280" end="00:44:10.360" style="s2">using the talented Chan as a text or the</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.680" end="00:44:13.520" style="s2">or the schwa Rosa I would recommend also</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.360" end="00:44:15.650" style="s2">in addition to doing Lexie oh I would</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.450" end="00:49:48.400" style="s2">I hope to do is ameliorate it somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.299" end="00:49:51.640" style="s2">reliably so can I so I can reduce the</p>

<p begin="00:49:51.640" end="00:49:57.880" style="s2">drives so that being said engaging in an</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.230" end="00:49:59.920" style="s2">ecology of practices and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.880" end="00:50:03.490" style="s2">engage in it for a long time so that it</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.920" end="00:50:07.200" style="s2">becomes a correspondingly complex and</p>

<p begin="00:50:10.900" end="00:50:16.420" style="s2">and almost like a martial art fluency</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.329" end="00:50:18.970" style="s2">way with that parasitic processing</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.420" end="00:50:24.010" style="s2">that&#39;s ultimately the most fundamental</p>

<p begin="01:04:11.880" end="01:04:19.229" style="s2">writing about and exploring so I think</p>

<p begin="01:04:19.229" end="01:04:23.940" style="s2">the Dionysian represents is just as</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.720" end="01:04:26.460" style="s2">crucial as the ability to make frame</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.940" end="01:04:29.130" style="s2">which is what the Apollonian is and you</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.460" end="01:04:32.039" style="s2">need a dynamical opponent processing</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.130" end="01:04:34.440" style="s2">between them and I think there is always</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.039" end="01:04:35.579" style="s2">a relationship between arrows and logos</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.440" end="01:04:38.009" style="s2">but I think one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.579" end="01:04:39.839" style="s2">happens when they one of the marks of</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.009" end="01:04:45.479" style="s2">right relationship between arrows and</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.839" end="01:04:50.460" style="s2">logos is that arrows doesn&#39;t get reduced</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.479" end="01:04:53.819" style="s2">to just a static conceptual coherence</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.460" end="01:04:55.589" style="s2">it&#39;s right it is the evolving gathering</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.819" end="01:04:58.950" style="s2">together of things that come to belong</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.589" end="01:05:01.950" style="s2">together in a mutuality of enhanced and</p>

<p begin="01:05:01.950" end="01:05:08.249" style="s2">arrows is transformed when it is no</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.119" end="01:05:11.489" style="s2">longer reduced to just the oneness of</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.249" end="01:05:14.489" style="s2">consumption Plato talks about when the</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.489" end="01:05:17.009" style="s2">arrows is brought into right</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.489" end="01:05:19.680" style="s2">relationship with logos via the logos</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.009" end="01:05:21.960" style="s2">bias the encounter with Socrates that</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.680" end="01:05:25.140" style="s2">the arrows goes from being consumptive</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.960" end="01:05:27.239" style="s2">oneness to generative oneness that what</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.140" end="01:05:29.519" style="s2">the the erotic impulses transformed into</p>

<p begin="01:05:37.589" end="01:05:43.349" style="s2">relationship between logos and eros is</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.999" end="01:05:46.170" style="s2">really fundamentally important and we</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.349" end="01:05:48.210" style="s2">can see how logo we can look for marks</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.170" end="01:05:50.249" style="s2">of right relationship within logos and</p>

<p begin="01:05:58.140" end="01:06:02.880" style="s2">answer to your question and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.910" end="01:06:05.099" style="s2">also is completely in sync with the</p>

<p begin="01:07:37.650" end="01:07:41.760" style="s2">you mean from multiple realisability</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.350" end="01:07:44.570" style="s2">especially referring to organic versus</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.760" end="01:07:48.710" style="s2">mechanical intelligence thank you</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.570" end="01:07:56.880" style="s2">multiple realizability is this idea</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.710" end="01:08:01.260" style="s2">multiple realizability is it&#39;s bound up</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.880" end="01:08:03.900" style="s2">with terms we we people use all the time</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.260" end="01:08:05.700" style="s2">without fully appreciating them and this</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.900" end="01:08:09.120" style="s2">is the distinction between software and</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.700" end="01:08:12.510" style="s2">hardware within computer a computer</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.120" end="01:08:15.900" style="s2">science and computer use right so think</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.510" end="01:08:18.510" style="s2">of a program software and think of how</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.900" end="01:08:21.210" style="s2">that program could be run on many</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.510" end="01:08:23.370" style="s2">different pieces of hardware I could be</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.210" end="01:08:25.529" style="s2">running word in this computer or this</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.370" end="01:08:27.480" style="s2">computer or this computer or this</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.529" end="01:08:30.540" style="s2">computer I could even be running word</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.480" end="01:08:32.910" style="s2">and on machines that are not built like</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.540" end="01:08:34.259" style="s2">the standard computer is I could be</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.910" end="01:08:36.930" style="s2">running it on something that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.259" end="01:08:38.890" style="s2">organized like a neural network what</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.930" end="01:08:41.109" style="s2">it&#39;s made of and there</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.890" end="01:08:44.200" style="s2">computers used to be much larger and</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.109" end="01:08:47.320" style="s2">have transistors right and now they have</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.200" end="01:08:52.420" style="s2">microchips and so even the material so</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.320" end="01:08:54.130" style="s2">the the physical media within which the</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.420" end="01:08:56.950" style="s2">software has to run so the physical</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.130" end="01:09:00.130" style="s2">medium is the hardware and the idea is I</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.950" end="01:09:03.460" style="s2">can run the same software on maybe many</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.130" end="01:09:05.589" style="s2">many different kinds of hardware made of</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.460" end="01:09:09.520" style="s2">many different kinds of physical stuff</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.589" end="01:09:12.160" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a mistake to try to</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.520" end="01:09:14.890" style="s2">understand the software by looking at</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.160" end="01:09:17.740" style="s2">this particular hardware alright so</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.890" end="01:09:19.750" style="s2">here&#39;s the software and oh well I look</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.740" end="01:09:22.450" style="s2">at how a Mac runs and that will make me</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.750" end="01:09:24.550" style="s2">understand how the software runs well</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.450" end="01:09:26.109" style="s2">that&#39;s not right because that same</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.550" end="01:09:28.630" style="s2">software can run in many different</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.109" end="01:09:31.540" style="s2">machines there are many different things</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.630" end="01:09:34.030" style="s2">it&#39;d be like trying to understand chess</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.540" end="01:09:35.589" style="s2">but you find people playing chess and</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.030" end="01:09:37.570" style="s2">let&#39;s say the the pieces are made of a</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.589" end="01:09:40.390" style="s2">plessy&#39;s ah I know what I&#39;ll do I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.570" end="01:09:42.250" style="s2">study the material that the board and</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.390" end="01:09:44.500" style="s2">the pieces are made out of and that will</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.250" end="01:09:46.210" style="s2">help me to understand chess and you go</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.500" end="01:09:47.500" style="s2">that&#39;s not going to get you chess</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.210" end="01:09:49.780" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work that way that you can play</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.500" end="01:09:51.880" style="s2">chess with pieces of plastic pieces of</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.780" end="01:09:53.290" style="s2">wood you can play it electronically you</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.880" end="01:09:57.180" style="s2">could play it just with little marks on</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.290" end="01:10:02.320" style="s2">pieces of paper it&#39;s multiple realizable</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.180" end="01:10:05.440" style="s2">now what that means therefore is that</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.320" end="01:10:08.970" style="s2">you can&#39;t reduce the software make it</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.440" end="01:10:11.290" style="s2">identical to any particular hardware</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.970" end="01:10:12.730" style="s2">what this means by the way and most</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.290" end="01:10:14.530" style="s2">people don&#39;t realize that is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.730" end="01:10:15.940" style="s2">actually a deep people think that these</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.530" end="01:10:19.480" style="s2">two things go together and they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.940" end="01:10:21.430" style="s2">really happy bedfellows right which is</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.480" end="01:10:24.220" style="s2">artificial intelligence and neuroscience</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.430" end="01:10:27.670" style="s2">yeah they&#39;re actually kind of opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.220" end="01:10:29.230" style="s2">each other because neuroscience says</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.670" end="01:10:31.420" style="s2">well I&#39;m gonna understand the mind by</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.230" end="01:10:34.300" style="s2">looking at a particular kind of hardware</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.420" end="01:10:36.400" style="s2">of the brain an artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.300" end="01:10:38.740" style="s2">says no no that&#39;s the wrong place to</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.400" end="01:10:41.950" style="s2">look you should be looking instead at</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.740" end="01:10:44.800" style="s2">the software because the software is</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.950" end="01:10:46.540" style="s2">where you&#39;re going to under the that the</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.800" end="01:10:49.600" style="s2">hardware might turn out to be largely</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.540" end="01:10:51.610" style="s2">irrelevant like the plastic of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.600" end="01:10:52.420" style="s2">pieces in the chest being irrelevant</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.610" end="01:10:54.310" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.420" end="01:11:02.080" style="s2">chess now i&#39;m presenting these as</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.310" end="01:11:06.790" style="s2">extremes of course what that means is we</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.080" end="01:11:09.010" style="s2">have got to examine that very</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.790" end="01:11:10.750" style="s2">computational metaphor because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.010" end="01:11:13.830" style="s2">first of all that challenges the idea</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.750" end="01:11:16.030" style="s2">that we can simply equate minded braids</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.830" end="01:11:18.670" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that your mind is</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.030" end="01:11:20.469" style="s2">some you know ghostly thing that can</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.670" end="01:11:22.719" style="s2">float free from your brain we said but I</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.469" end="01:11:24.790" style="s2">can move my software program around you</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.719" end="01:11:27.640" style="s2">can but you can never have software</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.790" end="01:11:29.590" style="s2">that&#39;s not running on hardware I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.640" end="01:11:31.360" style="s2">smash all the computers and then the</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.590" end="01:11:33.190" style="s2">software somehow floats into some</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.360" end="01:11:36.969" style="s2">metaphysical heaven that&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.190" end="01:11:39.429" style="s2">mistake on the other hand as we move</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.969" end="01:11:44.050" style="s2">into cognitive science that is much more</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.429" end="01:11:47.940" style="s2">embodied and embedded and extended and</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.050" end="01:11:51.420" style="s2">enacted we&#39;re coming to understand that</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.940" end="01:11:55.210" style="s2">cognition is not independent from</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.420" end="01:11:56.440" style="s2">biology that there&#39;s a deep continuity</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.210" end="01:11:58.989" style="s2">now doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.440" end="01:12:01.600" style="s2">artificial intelligence it might but it</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.989" end="01:12:02.679" style="s2">tends to point towards this idea that if</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.600" end="01:12:05.260" style="s2">we want to create artificial</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.679" end="01:12:07.030" style="s2">intelligence we&#39;re simultaneously and in</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.260" end="01:12:09.390" style="s2">integrated fashion probably gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.030" end="01:12:14.530" style="s2">to create something like artificial life</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.390" end="01:12:17.350" style="s2">life that is genuinely autopoietic so</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.530" end="01:12:20.560" style="s2">multiple realizability is is just a</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.350" end="01:12:22.719" style="s2">fraught topic and it is just it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.560" end="01:12:25.000" style="s2">central topic when i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.719" end="01:12:26.860" style="s2">introduce our cognitive science to</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.000" end="01:12:29.949" style="s2">people because it gets you deeply</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.860" end="01:12:31.900" style="s2">thinking outside of the of our common</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.949" end="01:12:34.330" style="s2">sense obvious nosov up mind and brain oh</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.900" end="01:12:36.520" style="s2">wow that&#39;s when more complex them that i</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.330" end="01:12:38.380" style="s2">thought it was and then and then once</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.520" end="01:12:40.270" style="s2">you challenge that common sense with the</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.380" end="01:12:42.010" style="s2">computational metaphor you then</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.270" end="01:12:44.080" style="s2">challenge the computational metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.010" end="01:12:46.989" style="s2">with for econ of science and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.080" end="01:12:49.179" style="s2">very far from the cultural cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.989" end="01:12:51.820" style="s2">grammar by which we have always talked</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.179" end="01:12:54.600" style="s2">at least since Descartes about mind and</p>

<p begin="01:12:54.600" end="01:13:00.370" style="s2">multiple realizability takes you okay</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.750" end="01:13:01.960" style="s2">we&#39;ve gone much longer than we normally</p>
