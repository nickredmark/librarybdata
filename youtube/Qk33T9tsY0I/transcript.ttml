<p begin="00:00:04.380" end="00:00:17.279" style="s2">it to vote for in the last video I</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.940" end="00:00:18.869" style="s2">talked about how our adversarial system</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.279" end="00:00:21.779" style="s2">creates a situation where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.869" end="00:00:25.080" style="s2">impossible for us to approach problems</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.779" end="00:00:27.359" style="s2">from the position of you know what basic</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.080" end="00:00:28.980" style="s2">assumptions can we all agree on what do</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.359" end="00:00:31.500" style="s2">we will want to get out of this and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.980" end="00:00:35.340" style="s2">develop an idea or a policy or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.500" end="00:00:40.590" style="s2">from there and that the fractious Ness</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.340" end="00:00:42.840" style="s2">and other ink creates as pollution is</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.590" end="00:00:44.820" style="s2">extremely harmful to society in this one</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.840" end="00:00:46.379" style="s2">I want to talk about I think what is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.820" end="00:00:47.820" style="s2">worst of all of the forms of pollution</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.379" end="00:00:51.360" style="s2">that our political system generates</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.820" end="00:00:52.710" style="s2">mainly distrust because it is impossible</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.360" end="00:00:54.300" style="s2">for people to trust each other if</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.710" end="00:00:56.399" style="s2">they&#39;re being lied to all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.300" end="00:00:58.680" style="s2">so in this video I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.399" end="00:01:00.359" style="s2">the lies that we are told by our</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.680" end="00:01:01.739" style="s2">political representatives and not just</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.359" end="00:01:04.260" style="s2">some of the time but pretty much all of</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.739" end="00:01:06.750" style="s2">the time I mean it is so pervasive that</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.260" end="00:01:08.070" style="s2">during political campaigns the promises</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.750" end="00:01:09.900" style="s2">that are made none of us take them</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.070" end="00:01:11.659" style="s2">seriously we know that half or more of</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.900" end="00:01:14.580" style="s2">them whatever are going to be broken</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.659" end="00:01:16.770" style="s2">when they&#39;re interviewed they evade and</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.580" end="00:01:18.180" style="s2">avoid questions part answer questions</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.770" end="00:01:20.670" style="s2">because they don&#39;t want to tell the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.180" end="00:01:22.259" style="s2">whole and entire truth they lie about</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.670" end="00:01:23.610" style="s2">their affairs they lie about their</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.259" end="00:01:26.009" style="s2">business interests they lie about</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.610" end="00:01:28.140" style="s2">conflicts of interest I mentioned in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.009" end="00:01:29.790" style="s2">previous video that in order to make</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.140" end="00:01:31.770" style="s2">themselves look as though they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.790" end="00:01:34.200" style="s2">a decent job they will manipulate and</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.770" end="00:01:36.329" style="s2">cherry-pick data and you know this is so</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.200" end="00:01:37.979" style="s2">pervasive it goes on all the time that</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.329" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">we have become accustomed to it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.979" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">become normalized for us and so the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:49.939" style="s2">extent to which distrust is just there</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.840" end="00:01:54.509" style="s2">in the air all the time is extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.939" end="00:01:56.820" style="s2">so but apart from those going on all of</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.509" end="00:01:58.950" style="s2">the time sort of low-level lies if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.820" end="00:02:01.020" style="s2">want to call them that they&#39;ve told a</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.950" end="00:02:02.399" style="s2">whole bunch of whoppers over the years</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.020" end="00:02:04.710" style="s2">as well and so I&#39;m just going to very</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.399" end="00:02:07.320" style="s2">quickly remind you of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.710" end="00:02:09.330" style="s2">juicier ones and please understand it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.320" end="00:02:10.739" style="s2">taken me like five minutes of racking my</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.330" end="00:02:12.370" style="s2">brains without having to look anything</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.739" end="00:02:15.220" style="s2">up just from memory to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.370" end="00:02:16.780" style="s2">this list and you know there are many</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.220" end="00:02:17.860" style="s2">many many more that given a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.780" end="00:02:19.959" style="s2">of thought and a little bit of time I</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.860" end="00:02:21.220" style="s2">could I could add to it but as I&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.959" end="00:02:23.170" style="s2">before I don&#39;t want to make these videos</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.220" end="00:02:25.450" style="s2">too long so let&#39;s take a look at a few</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.170" end="00:02:27.489" style="s2">so first of all there was the Pentagon</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.450" end="00:02:28.659" style="s2">Papers released by the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.489" end="00:02:30.700" style="s2">and The Washington Post back in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.659" end="00:02:32.680" style="s2">early 70s which showed that the Johnson</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.700" end="00:02:34.480" style="s2">administration had and I quote lied</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.680" end="00:02:37.239" style="s2">extensively not only to the public but</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.480" end="00:02:39.129" style="s2">to Congress as well then there was the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.239" end="00:02:41.349" style="s2">Watergate scandal right way and Nixon&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.129" end="00:02:43.629" style="s2">people bugged the Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.349" end="00:02:45.069" style="s2">headquarters and then lied about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.629" end="00:02:47.319" style="s2">when accused of it then lied about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.069" end="00:02:48.640" style="s2">and tried to cover it up and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.319" end="00:02:49.690" style="s2">link between these two things as well</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.640" end="00:02:51.340" style="s2">because the guy that released the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.690" end="00:02:53.590" style="s2">Pentagon Papers Ellsberg</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.340" end="00:02:55.629" style="s2">I think his name was anyway he was</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.590" end="00:02:57.280" style="s2">originally charged with espionage and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.629" end="00:02:58.209" style="s2">on and the charges related dropped when</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.280" end="00:03:00.459" style="s2">it was found that the Nixon</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.209" end="00:03:02.680" style="s2">administration had tried to run a smear</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.459" end="00:03:04.659" style="s2">campaign on him then there was the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.680" end="00:03:06.190" style="s2">Ronald Reagan Oliver North thing where</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.659" end="00:03:09.810" style="s2">they were illegally selling weapons to</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.190" end="00:03:12.849" style="s2">the Contras in Iran and a similar</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.810" end="00:03:15.700" style="s2">situation in Nicaragua where the CIA was</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.849" end="00:03:17.500" style="s2">allowing Nicaraguan drugs runners to run</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.700" end="00:03:19.989" style="s2">into the u.s. and back again giving them</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.500" end="00:03:21.989" style="s2">cover so that the money generated would</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.989" end="00:03:24.730" style="s2">be used to finance weapons for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.989" end="00:03:27.069" style="s2">Nicaraguan Contras in his excellent film</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.730" end="00:03:29.620" style="s2">hyper normalization and Adams sorry</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.069" end="00:03:31.060" style="s2">Curtis charts the course of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.620" end="00:03:33.430" style="s2">narrative surrounding Colonel Gaddafi</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.060" end="00:03:35.950" style="s2">and how he went from vicious brutal</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.430" end="00:03:38.829" style="s2">dictator to friend of the West and Ally</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.950" end="00:03:40.780" style="s2">in the region to harbinger of terrorists</p>

<p begin="00:03:46.629" end="00:03:50.739" style="s2">my personal favor and in pretty recent</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.970" end="00:03:53.019" style="s2">memory is the weapons of mass</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.739" end="00:03:55.239" style="s2">destruction nonsense that took us to war</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.019" end="00:03:56.590" style="s2">in Iraq I mean I know much more about</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.239" end="00:03:58.540" style="s2">what happened in Britain than in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.590" end="00:04:00.280" style="s2">u.s. I do remember : power going he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.540" end="00:04:02.650" style="s2">going and giving his irrefutable</p>

<p begin="00:04:05.500" end="00:04:11.560" style="s2">but in Britain the BBC journalist Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.250" end="00:04:14.530" style="s2">Gilligan actually came out and said</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.560" end="00:04:16.299" style="s2">these intelligence dossiers have been</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.530" end="00:04:18.579" style="s2">sexed up they&#39;ve been made to look much</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.299" end="00:04:20.320" style="s2">worse than they are in order to take us</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.579" end="00:04:22.840" style="s2">to war he made the accusation directly</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.320" end="00:04:24.610" style="s2">and not only did the government deny it</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.840" end="00:04:25.420" style="s2">but they sent up a hot they set up a</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.610" end="00:04:28.900" style="s2">whole jamming</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.420" end="00:04:31.330" style="s2">hurry the Hutton report which exonerated</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.900" end="00:04:33.220" style="s2">the government and you know damned the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.330" end="00:04:36.190" style="s2">BBC the director-general had to resign</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.220" end="00:04:38.740" style="s2">Andrew Gilligan lost his job and Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.190" end="00:04:41.590" style="s2">Gilligan source in this story a chap by</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.740" end="00:04:44.680" style="s2">the name with dr. David Kelly once the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.590" end="00:04:46.150" style="s2">public spotlight shone on him then he</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.680" end="00:04:47.860" style="s2">ended up killing himself he both</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.150" end="00:04:50.290" style="s2">overdosed and slit his wrists and ended</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.860" end="00:04:52.780" style="s2">up killing himself and so the government</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.290" end="00:04:54.970" style="s2">was responsible for all of this not to</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.780" end="00:04:56.680" style="s2">mention the thousands of lies both</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.970" end="00:04:59.050" style="s2">British and American soldiers and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.680" end="00:05:01.170" style="s2">million or more Iraqi lives lost in the</p>

<p begin="00:05:04.289" end="00:05:08.279" style="s2">and as we all now know it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.899" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">Andrew Gilligan&#39;s accusations were</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.279" end="00:05:12.149" style="s2">absolutely right there was no real</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:14.039" style="s2">foundation to believe that Saddam had</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.149" end="00:05:17.009" style="s2">weapons of mass destruction and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.039" end="00:05:19.800" style="s2">idea of whistleblowers or reporters</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.009" end="00:05:22.110" style="s2">being hounded down for exposing the lies</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.800" end="00:05:23.430" style="s2">and the crimes of their governments has</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.110" end="00:05:26.339" style="s2">been getting worse and worse and worse</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.430" end="00:05:28.319" style="s2">just to give a few examples the I</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.339" end="00:05:29.999" style="s2">mentioned before the Nicaragua story the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.319" end="00:05:31.979" style="s2">chat that exposed that was a journalist</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.999" end="00:05:33.020" style="s2">by the name of Gary Webb and of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.979" end="00:05:37.709" style="s2">the government denied it vehemently</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.020" end="00:05:41.129" style="s2">accused him of Mis casting the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.709" end="00:05:43.080" style="s2">government as evil and he lost his job</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.129" end="00:05:45.119" style="s2">he lost his wife he ended up committing</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.080" end="00:05:46.919" style="s2">suicide as a consequence of that but of</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.119" end="00:05:49.229" style="s2">course everything that he reported and a</p>

<p begin="00:05:49.229" end="00:05:53.520" style="s2">release of papers later on turned out to</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.999" end="00:05:55.800" style="s2">be absolutely accurate I mean much more</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.520" end="00:05:58.559" style="s2">recently we have people like Edward</p>

<p begin="00:06:30.659" end="00:06:35.459" style="s2">now an exile Chelsea Manning I believe</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.659" end="00:06:39.059" style="s2">is back in jail and still back in jail</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.459" end="00:06:42.169" style="s2">and so you know it&#39;s it&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.059" end="00:06:44.639" style="s2">difficult and extremely courageous for</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.169" end="00:06:45.749" style="s2">people to come forward and expose the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.639" end="00:06:49.969" style="s2">lies and the crimes that their</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.530" end="00:07:02.790" style="s2">and if we go back a little bit further</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.600" end="00:07:05.490" style="s2">in history the u.s. entered the first</p>

<p begin="00:07:05.490" end="00:07:09.210" style="s2">Lusitania and the loss of a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.170" end="00:07:10.980" style="s2">American lives in that but I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.210" end="00:07:12.450" style="s2">situation when the Miffy manipulated</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.980" end="00:07:13.950" style="s2">Churchill knew perfectly well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.450" end="00:07:16.740" style="s2">going to happen if the Lusitania sailed</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.950" end="00:07:18.540" style="s2">the German government even posted an ad</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.740" end="00:07:20.580" style="s2">in the paper saying if you bought the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.540" end="00:07:23.760" style="s2">Lusitania we&#39;re going to try and sink it</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.580" end="00:07:27.270" style="s2">so you know that was that was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.760" end="00:07:29.370" style="s2">manipulation and and an untruth the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.270" end="00:07:30.810" style="s2">Second World War the American entrance</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.370" end="00:07:32.820" style="s2">into the Second World War was</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.810" end="00:07:35.400" style="s2">precipitated by the attack on Pearl</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.820" end="00:07:36.780" style="s2">Harbor which again history now shows us</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.400" end="00:07:38.100" style="s2">or documents now show us that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.780" end="00:07:39.690" style="s2">American government knew perfectly well</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.100" end="00:07:41.370" style="s2">that it was going to happen encouraged</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.690" end="00:07:43.050" style="s2">it in fact and all of their really good</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.370" end="00:07:45.720" style="s2">ships at left Pearl Harbor and gone and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.050" end="00:07:47.250" style="s2">gone and docked elsewhere the Vietnam</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.720" end="00:07:49.020" style="s2">War was precipitated by the Gulf of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.250" end="00:07:51.600" style="s2">Tonkin incident and we now know that</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.020" end="00:07:53.790" style="s2">that also didn&#39;t actually happen and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.600" end="00:07:57.650" style="s2">you know the three biggest wars in</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.790" end="00:08:00.300" style="s2">recent memory all three of those were</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.650" end="00:08:03.210" style="s2">precipitated aggravated America&#39;s entry</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.300" end="00:08:07.250" style="s2">into was caused by lies bold-faced</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.210" end="00:08:07.250" style="s2">barefaced straightforward lies</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.400" end="00:08:15.460" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.840" end="00:08:21.820" style="s2">and then of course there was the wars on</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.330" end="00:08:23.620" style="s2">communism and then drugs and now</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.820" end="00:08:25.240" style="s2">terrorism you know how many lies how</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.620" end="00:08:28.210" style="s2">many distortions how many manipulations</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.240" end="00:08:30.610" style="s2">how much propaganda has been told in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.210" end="00:08:32.529" style="s2">name of those things and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.610" end="00:08:34.180" style="s2">again I could go on and on and on and on</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.529" end="00:08:36.039" style="s2">and on there are dozens hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.180" end="00:08:37.870" style="s2">these things but the point to think</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.039" end="00:08:40.599" style="s2">about is that these are just the ones</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.870" end="00:08:42.460" style="s2">that we know about right God knows how</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.599" end="00:08:44.290" style="s2">many other horrific things have been</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.460" end="00:08:47.290" style="s2">done and lied about and covered up that</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.290" end="00:08:49.750" style="s2">have never been exposed and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.290" end="00:08:50.500" style="s2">you got to think so many lies so many</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.750" end="00:08:53.350" style="s2">crimes</p>

<p begin="00:08:53.350" end="00:08:58.810" style="s2">behalf by people that we elected so</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.890" end="00:09:03.610" style="s2">think about that next time you go to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.810" end="00:09:05.350" style="s2">polls thanks for listening the power of</p>
