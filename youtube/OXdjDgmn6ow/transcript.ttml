<p begin="00:00:51.440" end="00:00:56.399" style="s2">but you know the death rate here is 200</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.280" end="00:00:59.840" style="s2">times lesser than in europe so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.399" end="00:01:01.039" style="s2">it&#39;s uh yeah it&#39;s not that bad as you</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.840" end="00:01:03.280" style="s2">can imagine and</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.039" end="00:01:04.640" style="s2">people now go out again but we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.280" end="00:01:07.520" style="s2">masks yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.640" end="00:01:08.799" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s fascinating how um in all</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.520" end="00:01:10.640" style="s2">asian countries</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.799" end="00:01:12.159" style="s2">there&#39;s not not much of an issue around</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.640" end="00:01:13.040" style="s2">mosques and i mean anybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.159" end="00:01:15.840" style="s2">traveled in asia</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.040" end="00:01:17.439" style="s2">knows that it&#39;s normal for asian people</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.840" end="00:01:20.000" style="s2">when they have a little flu or they</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.439" end="00:01:21.040" style="s2">feel bad in the morning they get the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.000" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">mask out and they</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.040" end="00:01:25.439" style="s2">go out with the mask because they have</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">the social responsibility to say</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.439" end="00:01:31.680" style="s2">i might be infectious so i&#39;m gonna yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:34.720" style="s2">exactly you know this theory uh i think</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.680" end="00:01:37.119" style="s2">uh she was called ruth benedict um</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.720" end="00:01:39.520" style="s2">and she wrote a book long time ago i</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.119" end="00:01:41.840" style="s2">think it was in the 30s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.520" end="00:01:44.079" style="s2">where she distinguished shame based from</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.840" end="00:01:47.439" style="s2">guild-based cultures</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.079" end="00:01:49.920" style="s2">um and so in east asia it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.439" end="00:01:53.040" style="s2">shame-based culture</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.920" end="00:01:56.240" style="s2">and so the the other plays</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.040" end="00:01:58.240" style="s2">a very big role so you do things</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.240" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">because of the other right and that has</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.240" end="00:02:03.439" style="s2">both negative and positive</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.000" end="00:02:07.119" style="s2">uh aspect but so the idea of you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.439" end="00:02:08.800" style="s2">not being a nuisance to the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.119" end="00:02:10.959" style="s2">that is very strong here and it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.800" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">of a natural thing this</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.959" end="00:02:14.319" style="s2">i mean i have all these european friends</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:16.720" style="s2">complaining about you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.319" end="00:02:18.160" style="s2">having masks and this is just another</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.720" end="00:02:21.120" style="s2">debate here it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.160" end="00:02:22.000" style="s2">of course if i can save a life you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.120" end="00:02:25.280" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.000" end="00:02:26.720" style="s2">putting on a mask and protect myself</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.280" end="00:02:28.400" style="s2">because this is another thing there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.720" end="00:02:30.560" style="s2">certain fear here of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.400" end="00:02:31.599" style="s2">you know hygienic very strong hygienic</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.560" end="00:02:34.720" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.599" end="00:02:36.080" style="s2">ideology so it plays together right the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.720" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">fear of infection</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.080" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">as well as the the care uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">for the you know the heart the social</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.120" end="00:02:45.360" style="s2">harmony right whether it&#39;s confusionism</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:48.080" style="s2">or buddhism they all have this stress on</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:49.760" style="s2">social harmony</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.080" end="00:02:52.080" style="s2">doing everything you can not to upset</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.760" end="00:02:54.480" style="s2">the other person like even</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.080" end="00:02:56.319" style="s2">you know apparently uh buddhist monks</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.480" end="00:02:57.680" style="s2">have these 70 different emotions so they</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.319" end="00:02:59.920" style="s2">can recognize</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.680" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">you know so they they people look at</p>

<p begin="00:04:22.560" end="00:04:28.000" style="s2">constantly arguing um</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.639" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">yeah normally in this series of um</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.000" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:33.759" style="s2">i i start off by by inviting people to</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">tell a little bit about their own</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.759" end="00:04:37.600" style="s2">um story and um i&#39;ve done a little bit</p>

<p begin="00:04:42.800" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">you spent a lot of time in the when was</p>

<p begin="00:04:59.520" end="00:05:05.520" style="s2">so so in terms of my professional career</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:08.080" style="s2">i worked nine years for the united</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.520" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">states information agency</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.080" end="00:05:12.400" style="s2">uh which uh perhaps elizabeth at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.840" end="00:05:15.759" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.400" end="00:05:18.080" style="s2">was an arm of the state department uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.759" end="00:05:20.479" style="s2">but which had to reflect the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:22.800" style="s2">plurality of u.s culture so as was as</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.479" end="00:05:24.720" style="s2">the same time kind of transmission bill</p>

<p begin="00:05:27.919" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">xyz but we also had the whole gamut of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.759" end="00:05:36.240" style="s2">magazines from right to left so we had</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:39.120" style="s2">the nation the new republic the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.240" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">progressive in these times on the left</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.120" end="00:05:43.039" style="s2">we had the national review and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:45.199" style="s2">heritage foundation</p>

<p begin="00:05:46.720" end="00:05:50.720" style="s2">so that was very pleasant but i actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.320" end="00:05:52.240" style="s2">did that in brussels</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.720" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">so it was the american library in</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.240" end="00:05:59.039" style="s2">brussels i was in charge of doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:06:01.280" style="s2">uh like synthetic reports for</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.039" end="00:06:02.319" style="s2">usually like second level officials in</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.280" end="00:06:04.639" style="s2">nato and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.319" end="00:06:06.240" style="s2">shape and the european union and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.639" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">belgian ministry of you know so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.240" end="00:06:10.880" style="s2">basically the people working</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.639" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">for the ministers would then ask us you</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.880" end="00:06:14.720" style="s2">know what what is happening in the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:17.120" style="s2">around abortion for example</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.720" end="00:06:19.600" style="s2">right and at the time there was no</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.120" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">internet so we had access to all these</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.600" end="00:06:24.800" style="s2">amazing databases like the congressional</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:26.720" style="s2">research surveys that you know that were</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.800" end="00:06:29.919" style="s2">like really rich</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.720" end="00:06:30.319" style="s2">so it was a great job and then it also</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:32.240" style="s2">makes</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.319" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">makes clear because i&#39;ve often wondered</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.240" end="00:06:35.759" style="s2">how in your curation</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:37.199" style="s2">of the peer-to-peer foundation website</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.759" end="00:06:39.039" style="s2">which by now has what</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.199" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">nine thousand sub pages or something</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.039" end="00:06:40.960" style="s2">like that twenty thousand twenty two</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:43.199" style="s2">thousand</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.960" end="00:06:45.520" style="s2">wow and seventy and seventy five million</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.199" end="00:06:48.560" style="s2">views uh like a year and a half ago</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.520" end="00:06:51.680" style="s2">so so the synthetic brain and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.560" end="00:06:55.199" style="s2">the library capacity of of um</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.680" end="00:06:56.880" style="s2">scanning um yeah i seem to have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.199" end="00:06:58.400" style="s2">particular type of brain</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.880" end="00:07:00.720" style="s2">um like there&#39;s a lot of things i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.400" end="00:07:03.759" style="s2">do i&#39;m not physical so don&#39;t ask me</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.720" end="00:07:06.880" style="s2">to repair a bicycle because i</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.759" end="00:07:09.919" style="s2">i will destroy it for 30 years you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.880" end="00:07:12.800" style="s2">even the best expert can repair</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.919" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">after i&#39;ve come through trying to repair</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.800" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:17.599" style="s2">but in terms of like pattern recognition</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:19.759" style="s2">i i</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.599" end="00:07:20.960" style="s2">i really do that well you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.759" end="00:07:22.639" style="s2">maybe embarrassing to say that by</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.960" end="00:07:25.039" style="s2">yourself but i i really think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.639" end="00:07:28.080" style="s2">true it&#39;s in the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.039" end="00:07:29.840" style="s2">almost visually see patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:31.680" style="s2">and then you know the joy of putting</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.840" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">them together</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.680" end="00:07:34.800" style="s2">um you know i had i had mystical</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.680" end="00:07:38.160" style="s2">experiences like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:40.639" style="s2">two times where i would read something</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.160" end="00:07:41.759" style="s2">and because it put so many things that i</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.639" end="00:07:44.400" style="s2">couldn&#39;t put together</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.759" end="00:07:44.879" style="s2">you know in a kind of integral framework</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.400" end="00:07:46.720" style="s2">like for</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.879" end="00:07:48.000" style="s2">three days i&#39;m literally high because</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.720" end="00:07:51.199" style="s2">that does it for me you know like</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.000" end="00:07:53.520" style="s2">wow wow like inside</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.199" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">you know yeah yeah so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.520" end="00:07:57.360" style="s2">personality quirk it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">you know it&#39;s don&#39;t wish it on everybody</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.360" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:02.720" style="s2">uh um yeah i&#39;m good at that i resonate</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:05.280" style="s2">strongly with that because</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.720" end="00:08:06.240" style="s2">like what i when i did my my phd</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.280" end="00:08:09.280" style="s2">research</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.240" end="00:08:11.520" style="s2">i very early on realized that um</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.280" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">academically we&#39;re often trained to when</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.520" end="00:08:14.960" style="s2">we read a text</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:16.879" style="s2">to look for the bits where we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.960" end="00:08:18.879" style="s2">agree and then make a big statement</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.879" end="00:08:20.960" style="s2">about why this person is wrong and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.879" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">very early on i decided that that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.960" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:25.520" style="s2">interested in and i think when you do</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:28.879" style="s2">synthesis what you&#39;re trying to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.520" end="00:08:31.520" style="s2">to find the jewels in in somebody&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.879" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">and that like i always say um the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.520" end="00:08:33.599" style="s2">that really shines when you when you</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:35.519" style="s2">read</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.599" end="00:08:37.279" style="s2">somebody&#39;s work in a book and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.519" end="00:08:40.640" style="s2">there&#39;s just one paragraph that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.279" end="00:08:41.599" style="s2">that really jumps exactly and you see it</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.640" end="00:08:43.200" style="s2">immediately that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.599" end="00:08:46.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens to me like you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.200" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">i i just it just springs out of the page</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.000" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">like immediately</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.040" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how that works exactly and</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.440" end="00:08:53.279" style="s2">you know that&#39;s why i&#39;m always being</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:54.800" style="s2">very sympathetic to integral approaches</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.279" end="00:08:56.880" style="s2">integrative approaches you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:58.399" style="s2">as ken wilbur says nobody&#39;s hundred</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.880" end="00:09:03.040" style="s2">percent wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.399" end="00:09:05.279" style="s2">right so do you see something</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.040" end="00:09:06.640" style="s2">you know we&#39;re talking before uh before</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.279" end="00:09:07.680" style="s2">we started the recording about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.640" end="00:09:11.040" style="s2">bruderhof</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.680" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">i&#39;m not a christian uh but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:14.480" style="s2">fascinated by</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.240" end="00:09:15.360" style="s2">you know how they live together and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.480" end="00:09:19.279" style="s2">something to learn</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.360" end="00:09:21.120" style="s2">even from people that you disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.279" end="00:09:23.600" style="s2">and i can&#39;t find the same joy in looking</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.120" end="00:09:26.000" style="s2">at the radical atheist group</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.600" end="00:09:27.200" style="s2">because they they will so a perspective</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.000" end="00:09:29.120" style="s2">gives you some</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.200" end="00:09:30.959" style="s2">insight it&#39;s like you eliminate</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.120" end="00:09:32.560" style="s2">something and you also hide some things</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.959" end="00:09:35.440" style="s2">with a perspective right</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.560" end="00:09:36.080" style="s2">and so the idea of being able to look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.440" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.080" end="00:09:39.600" style="s2">through multiple perspectives that for</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.600" end="00:09:43.279" style="s2">shines more light on the object you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:45.519" style="s2">trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.279" end="00:09:46.959" style="s2">absolutely and so the commons which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.519" end="00:09:48.640" style="s2">my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.959" end="00:09:50.000" style="s2">you know shines a particular light on</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.640" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">reality which not</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.000" end="00:09:53.839" style="s2">everybody else but then so does the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.839" end="00:09:55.120" style="s2">growth and so there&#39;s both capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.839" end="00:09:57.120" style="s2">post growth and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.120" end="00:09:59.440" style="s2">regenerative approaches</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.120" end="00:10:00.800" style="s2">each of these approaches highlights some</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.440" end="00:10:03.839" style="s2">aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.800" end="00:10:05.040" style="s2">reality for me that relates very</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.839" end="00:10:07.760" style="s2">strongly to</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.040" end="00:10:09.360" style="s2">this this sort of epistemological aikido</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.760" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">that i tried to do in my book</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.360" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">um with um</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:16.800" style="s2">taking people closer to the questions</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:17.600" style="s2">rather than the solutions and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.800" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">answers</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.600" end="00:10:21.519" style="s2">because of course we need solutions and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.839" end="00:10:23.200" style="s2">answers in a world that&#39;s failing on so</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.519" end="00:10:27.120" style="s2">many levels for us at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.200" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">um but but if we actually as</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.120" end="00:10:34.399" style="s2">cultures meeting and as a culture um</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.040" end="00:10:36.320" style="s2">held the questions centrally yeah then</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.399" end="00:10:37.839" style="s2">then you can you can listen to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.320" end="00:10:39.680" style="s2">else&#39;s perspective and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.839" end="00:10:41.920" style="s2">quite so important whether you agree</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.680" end="00:10:43.440" style="s2">with it or not because it shines a light</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.920" end="00:10:45.040" style="s2">onto the question that you have in</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.440" end="00:10:47.360" style="s2">common with that person</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.040" end="00:10:49.440" style="s2">and if you find the answer if it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.360" end="00:10:50.240" style="s2">fighting whose answer and whose solution</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.440" end="00:10:52.480" style="s2">is right</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.240" end="00:10:53.519" style="s2">then then we can&#39;t learn together um</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:57.519" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.519" end="00:10:59.519" style="s2">so that yeah but what moved you from</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.519" end="00:11:00.560" style="s2">from working with information in that</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.519" end="00:11:02.480" style="s2">way to that</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.560" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">phase where you you did quite a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.480" end="00:11:08.000" style="s2">technology work um</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:09.140" style="s2">yeah so so from the usia i went to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.000" end="00:11:10.560" style="s2">british petroleum</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.140" end="00:11:14.000" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.560" end="00:11:16.079" style="s2">i worked for the agri-business division</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.000" end="00:11:19.200" style="s2">and nobody knows that but bp was the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.079" end="00:11:22.320" style="s2">biggest producer of animal feed</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.200" end="00:11:22.320" style="s2">in the early 90s</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.560" end="00:11:26.000" style="s2">and it was a really interesting job</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.880" end="00:11:27.920" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.000" end="00:11:29.519" style="s2">you know i was working for the top layer</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.920" end="00:11:31.920" style="s2">like the the 15 top</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.519" end="00:11:33.680" style="s2">managers of this division with 25 000</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.920" end="00:11:36.959" style="s2">people under them and i was just like</p>

<p begin="00:11:40.959" end="00:11:44.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.800" end="00:11:45.839" style="s2">you know and then the other one would</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.880" end="00:11:49.680" style="s2">come and he would</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.839" end="00:11:52.880" style="s2">ask me can you prove to me that not</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.680" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">right and so i was obliged to really</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.880" end="00:11:57.680" style="s2">put on a perspectival hat to help this</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.000" end="00:11:59.440" style="s2">particular director makes his case in</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.600" end="00:12:20.720" style="s2">yeah then after that i did that for</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.079" end="00:12:23.200" style="s2">three years</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.720" end="00:12:25.279" style="s2">i started a magazine called wave which</p>

<p begin="00:13:08.720" end="00:13:12.480" style="s2">and then another one doing intranets and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2">extranets</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.480" end="00:13:15.600" style="s2">so creating relationships with suppliers</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.480" end="00:13:19.040" style="s2">and clients and</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.600" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">uh that was interesting uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.040" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">but then like we got in 2000 the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.680" end="00:13:25.519" style="s2">internet bubble and that was</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.440" end="00:13:27.360" style="s2">my second company was like really in</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.519" end="00:13:29.390" style="s2">trouble because that we lost 90</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.360" end="00:13:31.279" style="s2">of our</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.390" end="00:13:32.880" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.279" end="00:13:35.360" style="s2">our clients in three months you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.880" end="00:13:39.360" style="s2">like was a</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.360" end="00:13:40.480" style="s2">good experience um yeah and then my last</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.360" end="00:13:41.920" style="s2">job was</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.480" end="00:13:45.440" style="s2">what i already knew it would be that i</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.920" end="00:13:48.639" style="s2">had a big big burnout in 96</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.440" end="00:13:50.639" style="s2">and then i decided to do one last job at</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.639" end="00:13:53.600" style="s2">belgacom the largest telecommunications</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.639" end="00:13:57.199" style="s2">company at the time in belgium</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.600" end="00:13:57.920" style="s2">with a view of leaving business</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.199" end="00:14:01.279" style="s2">altogether</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.920" end="00:14:03.279" style="s2">so the idea was you know let me</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.279" end="00:14:05.279" style="s2">get a well-paying job and then save as</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.279" end="00:14:08.320" style="s2">much as i can and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.279" end="00:14:10.959" style="s2">so i i met my thai wife</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.320" end="00:14:12.399" style="s2">and then i ended up doing a two-year</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.959" end="00:14:13.920" style="s2">sabbatical</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.399" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">in chiang mai northern thailand where</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.920" end="00:14:19.120" style="s2">i&#39;m now</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:20.560" style="s2">and i i studied phase transitions so i</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.120" end="00:14:22.240" style="s2">wanted to know</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.560" end="00:14:25.120" style="s2">you know so i had been a marxist when</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.240" end="00:14:25.120" style="s2">i&#39;m in my 20s</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.279" end="00:14:28.320" style="s2">because okay that&#39;s another sideline</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.880" end="00:14:31.440" style="s2">story but let me tell you quickly that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.320" end="00:14:33.680" style="s2">one also so i wasn&#39;t happy</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.440" end="00:14:35.440" style="s2">so when i started understanding that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.680" end="00:14:38.639" style="s2">know that kind of revolution</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.440" end="00:14:40.079" style="s2">wasn&#39;t going to happen so then i decided</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.639" end="00:14:41.040" style="s2">what if i can change the world i have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.079" end="00:14:44.079" style="s2">change myself</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.040" end="00:14:46.959" style="s2">right so i did you know almost</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.079" end="00:14:48.959" style="s2">all the california therapies in</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.959" end="00:14:52.160" style="s2">existence you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.959" end="00:14:54.240" style="s2">uh s seminars uh bioenergy</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.160" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">primal scream you name it you know i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.240" end="00:14:57.120" style="s2">done them</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:58.560" style="s2">and then another seven years uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.120" end="00:15:00.800" style="s2">spiritual search</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.560" end="00:15:02.399" style="s2">you know like it happens to other people</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.800" end="00:15:03.040" style="s2">in psychology they say well there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.399" end="00:15:04.720" style="s2">than that</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.040" end="00:15:06.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not just about you it&#39;s about you</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.720" end="00:15:10.720" style="s2">know um</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.480" end="00:15:12.880" style="s2">so the eastern stuff the western stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:14.880" style="s2">you know it was in parallel basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.880" end="00:15:16.880" style="s2">and so and then when i started doing my</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.880" end="00:15:18.639" style="s2">internet companies that was like</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.880" end="00:15:20.320" style="s2">okay i&#39;ve done enough work on myself now</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.639" end="00:15:21.360" style="s2">i want to create something in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.320" end="00:15:22.880" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:24.480" style="s2">but i discovered that you know just</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.880" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">doing business wasn&#39;t my thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.480" end="00:15:31.839" style="s2">and so hence the sabbatical</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:33.360" style="s2">and so my question was</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.839" end="00:15:36.240" style="s2">you know how do you change the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.360" end="00:15:38.800" style="s2">right and by looking at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.240" end="00:15:40.399" style="s2">roman empire the 15th century the 18th</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.800" end="00:15:42.720" style="s2">century all these you know big</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.399" end="00:15:44.240" style="s2">big changes mostly europe because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.720" end="00:15:48.000" style="s2">european</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.240" end="00:15:50.480" style="s2">um i came away with a an understanding</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.000" end="00:15:52.959" style="s2">that seed forms are very important</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.480" end="00:15:54.240" style="s2">so in other words before you have these</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.959" end="00:15:57.680" style="s2">big violent</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.240" end="00:16:01.120" style="s2">uprisings you usually have you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.680" end="00:16:01.120" style="s2">one or two centuries where</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.600" end="00:16:04.639" style="s2">because the old system no longer works</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.360" end="00:16:07.680" style="s2">people you know go</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.639" end="00:16:09.519" style="s2">some kind of exodus right and start</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.680" end="00:16:12.079" style="s2">doing things differently</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.519" end="00:16:14.240" style="s2">and and then these forms consolidate</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.079" end="00:16:16.720" style="s2">from subsystems eventually then</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.240" end="00:16:17.920" style="s2">get into a fight and become the new norm</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.720" end="00:16:20.639" style="s2">so that&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.920" end="00:16:22.000" style="s2">right and so my conviction second</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.639" end="00:16:24.880" style="s2">conviction was that today</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:26.720" style="s2">these seed forms are the re-emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.880" end="00:16:29.519" style="s2">the commons</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.720" end="00:16:32.160" style="s2">that if you leave you know the purely</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.519" end="00:16:34.720" style="s2">capitalist dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.160" end="00:16:36.079" style="s2">what you try to do today is almost in</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.720" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">every case some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.079" end="00:16:40.720" style="s2">some form of commoning you know enabled</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:42.079" style="s2">by these new digital technologies which</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.720" end="00:16:45.120" style="s2">allow people to connect</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.079" end="00:16:47.199" style="s2">globally uh so it&#39;s two billion people</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.120" end="00:16:49.519" style="s2">not just connecting and communicating</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.199" end="00:16:52.639" style="s2">but self organizing</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.519" end="00:16:55.519" style="s2">and creating new value circuits</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.639" end="00:16:57.120" style="s2">right so just give you an example maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.519" end="00:17:00.639" style="s2">not the best one</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.120" end="00:17:01.759" style="s2">but people in austin belgium can order</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.639" end="00:17:04.720" style="s2">on facebook sorry</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.759" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">it&#39;s facebook but that&#39;s what they do</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.720" end="00:17:10.240" style="s2">and they order</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:13.439" style="s2">from a collective of fishermen you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.240" end="00:17:18.160" style="s2">collective purchasing of organic</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.439" end="00:17:20.000" style="s2">healthy fish you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.160" end="00:17:22.000" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a that&#39;s a new value</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.000" end="00:17:23.600" style="s2">circuit right they</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.000" end="00:17:25.679" style="s2">they leave the middlemen behind they</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.600" end="00:17:28.799" style="s2">don&#39;t go to the store</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.679" end="00:17:31.120" style="s2">uh they don&#39;t even go to the market they</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.799" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">they make a solidarity-based agreement</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.120" end="00:17:34.559" style="s2">with the fishermen</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.679" end="00:18:08.960" style="s2">when i started with my wiki which is you</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.760" end="00:18:12.840" style="s2">know now 20 000</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.960" end="00:18:14.080" style="s2">22 000 articles i said okay it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.840" end="00:18:17.360" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.080" end="00:18:20.160" style="s2">not how things should be but what people</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.360" end="00:18:21.840" style="s2">are actually doing to change</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.160" end="00:18:23.039" style="s2">and then i look at it how you know how</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.840" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">is it working what&#39;s the governance</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.039" end="00:18:27.440" style="s2">what&#39;s the property</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:28.400" style="s2">and so slowly then you you cohere some</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.440" end="00:18:32.240" style="s2">insights</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.400" end="00:18:34.080" style="s2">so that&#39;s the second level and</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.240" end="00:18:35.600" style="s2">for me it&#39;s about being factual and</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.080" end="00:18:37.360" style="s2">coherent</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.600" end="00:18:38.799" style="s2">so you know new facts you change your</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.360" end="00:18:42.240" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.799" end="00:18:44.000" style="s2">but it has to be coherent right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.240" end="00:18:45.840" style="s2">some people call this low theory because</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.000" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t aim to be a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.840" end="00:18:51.360" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:53.840" style="s2">but you are consolidating your insights</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.360" end="00:18:54.840" style="s2">you know in one particular domain or</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.840" end="00:18:58.400" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.840" end="00:19:01.840" style="s2">or and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.400" end="00:19:04.960" style="s2">my priorities how do we</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.840" end="00:19:08.799" style="s2">support extend the place of the commons</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.960" end="00:19:12.000" style="s2">in our societies because historically</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.799" end="00:19:12.880" style="s2">what we see i think is in history is</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.000" end="00:19:15.360" style="s2">this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.880" end="00:19:17.760" style="s2">succession of extractive and</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.360" end="00:19:19.760" style="s2">regenerative faces</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.760" end="00:19:22.400" style="s2">you know when an extractive regime kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.760" end="00:19:24.320" style="s2">of overuses and collapses</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.400" end="00:19:27.760" style="s2">then the healing period is actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.320" end="00:19:27.760" style="s2">around regenerating the commons</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.000" end="00:19:31.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve recently written a piece that</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.320" end="00:19:33.520" style="s2">that actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.440" end="00:19:35.360" style="s2">um like this is a common pattern that</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.520" end="00:19:35.679" style="s2">has happened in the past yes so i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.360" end="00:19:38.640" style="s2">looked</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.679" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">so these theories are called wave pulse</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.640" end="00:19:41.120" style="s2">theories</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:42.640" style="s2">so kind of you have a move to one</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.120" end="00:19:44.240" style="s2">polarity</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.640" end="00:19:45.679" style="s2">then something bad happens and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.240" end="00:19:47.919" style="s2">the pulse</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.679" end="00:19:49.360" style="s2">that then generates a counter reaction</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.919" end="00:19:51.679" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.360" end="00:19:53.600" style="s2">and so when you look at biophysical</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.679" end="00:19:55.440" style="s2">economics</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.600" end="00:19:57.280" style="s2">when you look at peter turchin and what</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.440" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">he calls it&#39;s clio dynamics when you</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.280" end="00:20:02.000" style="s2">look at</p>

<p begin="00:20:02.000" end="00:20:06.400" style="s2">you really see this recurring</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.840" end="00:20:07.280" style="s2">it isn&#39;t interesting because because i</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.400" end="00:20:08.799" style="s2">like i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:20:21.600" end="00:20:26.480" style="s2">is also about like if</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.880" end="00:20:28.000" style="s2">if if you have two opposing values but</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.480" end="00:20:31.120" style="s2">they both have value</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.000" end="00:20:33.120" style="s2">and and need to be honored then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.120" end="00:20:36.400" style="s2">not in a choice between this</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.120" end="00:20:39.600" style="s2">or that and the so many of our problems</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.400" end="00:20:42.480" style="s2">actually come from mistaking a</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.600" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">dilemma for a choice and choices are</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.480" end="00:20:46.159" style="s2">either or type</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">um decisions but dilemmas need to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.159" end="00:20:49.760" style="s2">navigated</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.120" end="00:20:50.240" style="s2">a bit like sailing against the wind and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.760" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.240" end="00:20:53.600" style="s2">it resonates with what you were just</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:55.120" style="s2">describing yeah yeah i&#39;m so i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.600" end="00:20:58.480" style="s2">familiar with this particular</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.120" end="00:21:00.559" style="s2">uh concept but yeah it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.480" end="00:21:01.760" style="s2">yeah and then you know if if you know a</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.559" end="00:21:04.400" style="s2">bit i&#39;m sure you do</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.760" end="00:21:05.840" style="s2">you know about integral approaches it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.400" end="00:21:08.640" style="s2">you know it&#39;s transcend and include</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.840" end="00:21:10.240" style="s2">right so it&#39;s not just about saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.640" end="00:21:11.919" style="s2">capital means bad we need something</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.240" end="00:21:13.679" style="s2">totally different</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.919" end="00:21:15.039" style="s2">it&#39;s saying you know we have serious</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.679" end="00:21:16.240" style="s2">problem with this system but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.039" end="00:21:19.360" style="s2">some good stuff in it</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.240" end="00:21:21.039" style="s2">yeah so can we imagine a higher form of</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.360" end="00:21:23.120" style="s2">integration</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.039" end="00:21:25.280" style="s2">where we can actually for example keep</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.120" end="00:21:28.559" style="s2">the efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.280" end="00:21:31.120" style="s2">you know of of private companies</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.559" end="00:21:32.960" style="s2">uh but in a higher level system that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.120" end="00:21:36.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t destroy the planet for example</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.960" end="00:21:38.880" style="s2">right so i&#39;m never ready to just say</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.480" end="00:21:40.640" style="s2">everything that is existing is bad it</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.880" end="00:21:43.520" style="s2">needs to be totally replaced which i</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.640" end="00:21:45.280" style="s2">think is very very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.520" end="00:21:47.280" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have so many things the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.280" end="00:21:49.840" style="s2">functional equivalence</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.280" end="00:21:51.280" style="s2">yet right that&#39;s fascinating because</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.840" end="00:21:52.240" style="s2">like i just wanted to come back because</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.280" end="00:21:54.640" style="s2">you earlier</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.240" end="00:21:56.400" style="s2">said in your youth you were a marxist i</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.640" end="00:21:57.280" style="s2">wanted to double check on on something</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.400" end="00:21:59.760" style="s2">that because</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.280" end="00:22:01.200" style="s2">famously marx said about himself that he</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.760" end="00:22:03.600" style="s2">is not a ma</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.200" end="00:22:05.360" style="s2">i am not a marxist so when when you say</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.600" end="00:22:07.520" style="s2">you were a marxist does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.360" end="00:22:08.400" style="s2">you were very interested in the work of</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.520" end="00:22:11.440" style="s2">marx</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.400" end="00:22:12.880" style="s2">or in the work of the people um who then</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.440" end="00:22:14.799" style="s2">call themselves marxist</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.880" end="00:22:16.720" style="s2">afterwards because probably probably</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.799" end="00:22:18.640" style="s2">more the second because uh you know i</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.720" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">was a trotskyist so then you have this</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.640" end="00:22:23.039" style="s2">you know this kind of lineage and of</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">course it was very limiting</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.039" end="00:22:30.600" style="s2">because you know for example</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:34.240" style="s2">now i&#39;m kind of planning to look into</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.600" end="00:22:36.880" style="s2">associationist mutualists distributists</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.240" end="00:22:38.159" style="s2">uh forms of the labor movement because</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.880" end="00:22:39.840" style="s2">you know the labor movement is about</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.159" end="00:22:41.840" style="s2">commons and most people don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.840" end="00:22:44.720" style="s2">but you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.840" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">welfare is social commons right so when</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.720" end="00:22:47.919" style="s2">you lose</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:49.280" style="s2">access to your natural resources and</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.919" end="00:22:50.080" style="s2">that&#39;s what capital did you know it</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.280" end="00:22:52.640" style="s2">enclosed</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.080" end="00:22:54.799" style="s2">the land privatized it should you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.640" end="00:22:56.880" style="s2">chase the farmers away</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.799" end="00:22:57.919" style="s2">and they became you know works without</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.880" end="00:23:00.159" style="s2">means of production</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.919" end="00:23:01.840" style="s2">i think that&#39;s still very much correct</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.159" end="00:23:04.559" style="s2">as an analysis</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.840" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">so they you know what they did then was</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.559" end="00:23:09.360" style="s2">to mutualize</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:10.960" style="s2">their life risk right so when you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.360" end="00:23:12.799" style="s2">have natural resource companies you move</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.960" end="00:23:14.400" style="s2">to social commerce</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.799" end="00:23:16.000" style="s2">so i can see the history of the labor</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.400" end="00:23:19.280" style="s2">movement as</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.000" end="00:23:21.360" style="s2">uh you know a revival of social comments</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.280" end="00:23:22.320" style="s2">but for example when you&#39;re in that</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.360" end="00:23:24.480" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.320" end="00:23:25.520" style="s2">that we just discussed then i knew about</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.480" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">reforms</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.520" end="00:23:28.559" style="s2">reformists i knew about anarchists</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:31.200" style="s2">that&#39;s all i knew about</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.559" end="00:23:33.679" style="s2">this you know the story we were told</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.200" end="00:23:35.760" style="s2">when i was in my 20s</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.679" end="00:23:37.280" style="s2">was a very limited story of what</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.760" end="00:23:40.320" style="s2">actually had happened in history</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.280" end="00:23:40.880" style="s2">you know so i never heard that there</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.320" end="00:23:42.880" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.880" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">you know parties getting 30 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.880" end="00:23:46.960" style="s2">the vote which were neither</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:48.960" style="s2">marxists neither reformists neither</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.960" end="00:23:51.840" style="s2">anarchism was something else</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.960" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">and actually represented this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.840" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">you know distributed property right</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:24:00.799" style="s2">so the commons is not only about</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:02.799" style="s2">you know a new form of common property</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.799" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">about mutualizing something</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.799" end="00:24:06.880" style="s2">but i think in terms of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:08.880" style="s2">balance of power we really need also to</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.880" end="00:24:10.000" style="s2">protect individual property so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.880" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.000" end="00:24:14.640" style="s2">you know collectivism it&#39;s it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.279" end="00:24:17.200" style="s2">about creating</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.640" end="00:24:18.240" style="s2">a distribution of power distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.200" end="00:24:20.000" style="s2">property</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.240" end="00:24:21.919" style="s2">you know something are better done</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.000" end="00:24:23.919" style="s2">together some things are</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.919" end="00:24:25.520" style="s2">you know might be you know so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.919" end="00:24:27.919" style="s2">anticipate</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.520" end="00:24:28.640" style="s2">uh the difference between my view and</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.919" end="00:24:32.080" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.640" end="00:24:35.039" style="s2">is that i believe value is created</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.080" end="00:24:35.039" style="s2">by everyone</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.360" end="00:24:40.559" style="s2">and so basically value is created not by</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.520" end="00:24:43.440" style="s2">commodifying it by contributions</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.559" end="00:24:45.200" style="s2">so every citizen every inhabitant is</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.440" end="00:24:48.159" style="s2">productive and creates value</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.200" end="00:24:50.240" style="s2">caring is commoning caring is value</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.159" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">creation</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.240" end="00:24:54.000" style="s2">so that needs to be recognized once you</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.720" end="00:24:56.000" style="s2">recognize that then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.000" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">recognize that civil society is actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.000" end="00:24:59.039" style="s2">productive</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:25:00.159" style="s2">not just the market right because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.039" end="00:25:02.640" style="s2">the view we have now</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.159" end="00:25:03.679" style="s2">you can only create value through</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.640" end="00:25:07.039" style="s2">extraction</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.679" end="00:25:08.880" style="s2">basically right and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.039" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">regenerative approaches you know which</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.880" end="00:25:14.159" style="s2">is what you stand for</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:17.279" style="s2">you need philanthropy taxation but</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.159" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">there is very little direct furnish</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.279" end="00:25:22.000" style="s2">you know finance and capital available</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:23.919" style="s2">for doing regenerative work it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.000" end="00:25:25.600" style="s2">systemic right it&#39;s systemic</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.919" end="00:25:27.600" style="s2">because we believe the market creates a</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.600" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">value we need to tax the market value</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.600" end="00:25:30.880" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:32.000" style="s2">only then can we give something and</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.880" end="00:25:33.520" style="s2">redistribute it</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.000" end="00:25:35.279" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s completely wrong so</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.520" end="00:25:38.640" style="s2">we need to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.279" end="00:25:39.279" style="s2">that everyone creates value and create</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.640" end="00:25:42.480" style="s2">what we call</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.279" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">pre-distribution regimes right</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.480" end="00:25:48.480" style="s2">and then we seek market forms</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:51.360" style="s2">that are generative towards the</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.480" end="00:25:53.520" style="s2">community and the web of life</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.360" end="00:25:54.960" style="s2">so it&#39;s not about abolishing the market</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.520" end="00:25:57.919" style="s2">it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.960" end="00:25:58.720" style="s2">creating a new framework for it where</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.919" end="00:26:01.279" style="s2">you know it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.720" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">exceed the planetary boundaries which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.279" end="00:26:04.400" style="s2">a negative way of looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:06.240" style="s2">but in a positive way and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.400" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">what you bring to the table</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.240" end="00:26:09.919" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s being regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:11.360" style="s2">it&#39;s about not just maintaining it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.919" end="00:26:15.440" style="s2">about healing</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.360" end="00:26:17.360" style="s2">right and then i i talk about the state</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.440" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">because unlike many other people i do</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.360" end="00:26:21.760" style="s2">believe we need it i need</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.720" end="00:26:23.919" style="s2">i think we need common good institutions</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.760" end="00:26:26.559" style="s2">because here&#39;s the difference if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.919" end="00:26:28.159" style="s2">an anarchist or libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.559" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">you think the world is constituted</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.159" end="00:26:32.480" style="s2">either by individuals creating contracts</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:34.640" style="s2">with each other</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.480" end="00:26:35.679" style="s2">or by groups you know like a federation</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.640" end="00:26:37.600" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.679" end="00:26:39.039" style="s2">that was the anarchist point of view the</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.600" end="00:26:40.880" style="s2">19th century</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.039" end="00:26:42.080" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think that&#39;s true i think we</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.880" end="00:26:45.919" style="s2">always already start</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.080" end="00:26:51.279" style="s2">from a society a relationality</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.919" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">um and that even the commons is selfish</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.279" end="00:26:54.480" style="s2">like if you do free software enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:56.400" style="s2">self-interest</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.480" end="00:26:57.760" style="s2">well not just enlightened i i&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.400" end="00:26:59.520" style="s2">negative than that you know if you do</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.760" end="00:27:01.120" style="s2">free software</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.520" end="00:27:03.120" style="s2">it&#39;s very good that you do free software</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.120" end="00:27:04.320" style="s2">but do you think about ecology probably</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.120" end="00:27:07.120" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.320" end="00:27:08.240" style="s2">you know look at blockchain and bitcoin</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.120" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.240" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">they have strong open source elements</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.159" end="00:27:15.200" style="s2">they have strong</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:18.240" style="s2">ecosystem ecosystemic approaches</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.200" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">but their energy regime</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.240" end="00:27:22.960" style="s2">is awful yeah right so that&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:24.960" style="s2">trying to say is that it&#39;s not enough</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.960" end="00:27:27.039" style="s2">just to do commenting on your own you</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.960" end="00:27:28.640" style="s2">need common good institutions that kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.039" end="00:27:31.600" style="s2">of protect</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.640" end="00:27:32.720" style="s2">the common good of everyone living in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.600" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">territory</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.720" end="00:27:37.039" style="s2">but i&#39;m increasingly thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.600" end="00:27:38.799" style="s2">virtual territories</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.039" end="00:27:41.279" style="s2">right and see the world as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.799" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">mixing of both territory</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.279" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">and kind of virtual nations that are</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:48.080" style="s2">involved in flows</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:49.840" style="s2">like the digital nomads right we have 25</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.080" end="00:27:52.880" style="s2">000 of them here</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.840" end="00:27:54.559" style="s2">uh before kovit uh you know they have</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.880" end="00:27:56.640" style="s2">their own economy they move around they</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.559" end="00:27:59.440" style="s2">go to medellin they go to tenerife they</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.640" end="00:27:59.440" style="s2">go to ubud</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:03.679" style="s2">at the moment it&#39;s more they went</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:06.159" style="s2">because um they went oh yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.679" end="00:28:07.520" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how that evolves yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.159" end="00:28:08.080" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how that&#39;s going to go</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.520" end="00:28:11.200" style="s2">it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.080" end="00:28:12.799" style="s2">but but pretty briefly there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.200" end="00:28:14.720" style="s2">places where we could go</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.799" end="00:28:16.480" style="s2">go and you&#39;ve already said so many</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.720" end="00:28:19.440" style="s2">things that i would like to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.480" end="00:28:19.919" style="s2">um just naming three and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.440" end="00:28:23.120" style="s2">choose</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.919" end="00:28:25.600" style="s2">which which one you pick up um</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.120" end="00:28:27.600" style="s2">this conversation that we have about um</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.600" end="00:28:30.960" style="s2">this is the end of capitalism we need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.600" end="00:28:32.480" style="s2">need to find a new system or is there a</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.960" end="00:28:35.120" style="s2">way like what i heard through</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.480" end="00:28:37.760" style="s2">and what you were saying is that there</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.120" end="00:28:40.159" style="s2">might be a way to redesign</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.760" end="00:28:42.480" style="s2">capitalism to a point where it won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.159" end="00:28:44.320" style="s2">what we now call capitalism anymore</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.480" end="00:28:46.960" style="s2">and so in that sense the people who say</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.320" end="00:28:48.640" style="s2">no we might need to undo capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.960" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">um we&#39;ll also get that bit because it</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.640" end="00:28:54.000" style="s2">will transform so fundamentally but but</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:56.240" style="s2">honoring the the value and the useful</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.000" end="00:28:58.880" style="s2">things that are still in it so</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.240" end="00:29:00.000" style="s2">because i i find this this radical sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.880" end="00:29:03.600" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:04.960" style="s2">rather than redesign um stop and start</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.600" end="00:29:08.080" style="s2">again with something else</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.960" end="00:29:11.279" style="s2">um which creates such a</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.080" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">backlash from the system that</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.279" end="00:29:14.960" style="s2">that&#39;s a very good question i i have</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:17.279" style="s2">some ideas about this so one is this</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.960" end="00:29:21.200" style="s2">idea that</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.279" end="00:29:22.320" style="s2">you can create uh create new frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.200" end="00:29:25.279" style="s2">around the existing</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.320" end="00:29:26.240" style="s2">right so i&#39;m particularly fond of for</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.279" end="00:29:28.960" style="s2">example the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.240" end="00:29:30.640" style="s2">economy economy for the common good so</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.960" end="00:29:33.840" style="s2">this is christian felber</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.640" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">uh and his uh you know in the movement</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.840" end="00:29:37.039" style="s2">so he looked at all the european</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:39.440" style="s2">constitutions and</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.039" end="00:29:41.039" style="s2">he said okay every single constitution</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.440" end="00:29:42.159" style="s2">says the economy should serve the common</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.039" end="00:29:43.840" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.159" end="00:29:45.039" style="s2">it there&#39;s no constitution that says the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.840" end="00:29:46.559" style="s2">economy should serve private</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.039" end="00:29:48.559" style="s2">shareholders it&#39;s it&#39;s the reality but</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.559" end="00:29:52.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not in the constitution</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.559" end="00:29:54.399" style="s2">and then he says the common good</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.720" end="00:29:56.399" style="s2">is not metaphysical it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.399" end="00:29:57.840" style="s2">we can democratically agree on through a</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.399" end="00:30:00.480" style="s2">democratic process</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.840" end="00:30:02.159" style="s2">right and so you know ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.480" end="00:30:04.159" style="s2">members two thousand organizations</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.159" end="00:30:05.440" style="s2">are trying it out they came up with this</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.159" end="00:30:07.760" style="s2">kind of double uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.440" end="00:30:10.080" style="s2">accounting framework one for regions and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.760" end="00:30:13.520" style="s2">one for corporations</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:16.960" style="s2">17 clusters of impact</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.520" end="00:30:19.440" style="s2">right and you put them outside you see</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.960" end="00:30:22.320" style="s2">for example the government could say you</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.440" end="00:30:23.039" style="s2">know we do an investment policy and we</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.320" end="00:30:25.200" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.039" end="00:30:26.559" style="s2">use this impact as criteria for</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.200" end="00:30:30.240" style="s2">investment</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.559" end="00:30:32.159" style="s2">so if you do good you get</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.240" end="00:30:33.919" style="s2">more subsidies in this taxation if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.159" end="00:30:35.520" style="s2">do bad impacts</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.919" end="00:30:37.440" style="s2">you pay more taxation you get less</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.520" end="00:30:38.080" style="s2">subsidies you know something of that</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.440" end="00:30:39.440" style="s2">order right</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.080" end="00:30:41.520" style="s2">so what you&#39;re doing there is like</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.440" end="00:30:42.399" style="s2">outside in change you still have</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.520" end="00:30:45.039" style="s2">corporations</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.399" end="00:30:46.480" style="s2">you sit at the cio but they have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.039" end="00:30:49.679" style="s2">behave differently</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.480" end="00:30:51.440" style="s2">in order to get ahead so i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.679" end="00:30:53.600" style="s2">a very interesting approach</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.440" end="00:30:55.120" style="s2">uh because this is a dilemma if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.600" end="00:30:57.840" style="s2">if you&#39;re an anti-capitalist right</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.120" end="00:30:59.919" style="s2">the thing is are you really sure that</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.840" end="00:31:03.039" style="s2">within 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.919" end="00:31:04.320" style="s2">you can change the system i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.039" end="00:31:06.960" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.320" end="00:31:09.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s like a marriage can&#39;t live with</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.960" end="00:31:12.240" style="s2">them can&#39;t live without them</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.440" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">you know you you have to to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.240" end="00:31:18.240" style="s2">what you have</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:19.679" style="s2">and you know get to mutually beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.240" end="00:31:21.600" style="s2">you know compromise that works for</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.679" end="00:31:23.360" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.600" end="00:31:24.880" style="s2">so that&#39;s how i see how we should deal</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.360" end="00:31:25.279" style="s2">with these issues it&#39;s not from saying</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.880" end="00:31:27.039" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.279" end="00:31:28.480" style="s2">one day from the other like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.039" end="00:31:30.799" style="s2">abolish everything</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.480" end="00:31:32.399" style="s2">it&#39;s you know how can we frame things in</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.799" end="00:31:36.000" style="s2">a way that</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.399" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">the whole incentive regime you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.000" end="00:31:40.080" style="s2">pushes people to behave differently i i</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.080" end="00:31:43.440" style="s2">think that makes a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.080" end="00:31:46.960" style="s2">um but what i&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.440" end="00:31:49.200" style="s2">in in our kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.960" end="00:31:50.399" style="s2">movement and our like that the people we</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.200" end="00:31:53.360" style="s2">we connect with</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.399" end="00:31:55.039" style="s2">um is that very often so many of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.360" end="00:31:58.640" style="s2">good examples i mean you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.039" end="00:32:02.240" style="s2">the um community supported fisheries</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.640" end="00:32:04.880" style="s2">do make creative use of uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.240" end="00:32:05.760" style="s2">information technology and and and high</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.880" end="00:32:07.600" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.760" end="00:32:10.320" style="s2">and we&#39;re talking through computers at</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.600" end="00:32:13.279" style="s2">the moment um</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.320" end="00:32:17.360" style="s2">in order to create these new more</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.279" end="00:32:17.360" style="s2">commons oriented peer-to-peer structures</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.840" end="00:32:24.399" style="s2">but then part of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.960" end="00:32:25.200" style="s2">the future say is like even since the</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.399" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.200" end="00:32:29.519" style="s2">like like um since limits to growth just</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:31.279" style="s2">recently had a conversation with dennis</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.519" end="00:32:33.600" style="s2">meadows and he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.279" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">almost kind of washed my head a little</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.600" end="00:32:37.600" style="s2">bit on on</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.880" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">um being like i would have never called</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.600" end="00:32:42.080" style="s2">myself a techno optimist before and i</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:42.880" style="s2">don&#39;t consider myself that but but he</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.080" end="00:32:46.559" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.880" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">actually quite strong on um</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.559" end="00:32:52.960" style="s2">when i asked him how he sees the future</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:56.480" style="s2">it was very much</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.960" end="00:32:59.600" style="s2">more people on the land again much more</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.480" end="00:33:03.279" style="s2">localized uh living with a in</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.600" end="00:33:05.440" style="s2">a much lower energy regime and</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.279" end="00:33:07.600" style="s2">so people people being directly involved</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.440" end="00:33:09.679" style="s2">in primary production again farming</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.600" end="00:33:10.720" style="s2">and biomaterials production and</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.679" end="00:33:15.120" style="s2">reforestation</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.720" end="00:33:18.480" style="s2">and all those kind of things and um</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.120" end="00:33:20.640" style="s2">and so it keeps this looming question of</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.480" end="00:33:22.159" style="s2">when we build all these infrastructures</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.640" end="00:33:23.600" style="s2">with the commons engine and with</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.159" end="00:33:26.559" style="s2">holochain and with</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.600" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">and and and we build networks that like</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.559" end="00:33:31.279" style="s2">we talked earlier how</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:33.279" style="s2">it&#39;s easy these days when you do this um</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.279" end="00:33:34.320" style="s2">movement building and connecting and</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.279" end="00:33:37.120" style="s2">integration work</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.320" end="00:33:37.360" style="s2">that you end up being global have lots</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.120" end="00:33:39.440" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.360" end="00:33:42.000" style="s2">amazing friends all over the globe and</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">involved in conversations in costa rica</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.000" end="00:33:44.960" style="s2">and in</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:47.519" style="s2">argentina and in spain and in germany</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.960" end="00:33:50.000" style="s2">and in belgium wherever</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.519" end="00:33:51.919" style="s2">but you if you don&#39;t watch out you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.000" end="00:33:52.559" style="s2">lose a little bit the local connection</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.919" end="00:33:54.320" style="s2">of of</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.559" end="00:33:56.320" style="s2">um what you&#39;re actually doing in your</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.320" end="00:33:57.679" style="s2">community and and my concern at the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.320" end="00:34:00.559" style="s2">moment is a little bit how</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.679" end="00:34:02.720" style="s2">how do we ensure that we actually also</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.559" end="00:34:06.080" style="s2">build the analog equivalents</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.720" end="00:34:07.679" style="s2">um because we might just</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.080" end="00:34:09.839" style="s2">no i think you&#39;re completely right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.679" end="00:34:11.359" style="s2">so we talk about cosmo local right so</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.839" end="00:34:14.800" style="s2">the idea of cosmo local</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.359" end="00:34:18.079" style="s2">is everything that&#39;s light</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.800" end="00:34:19.440" style="s2">is shared globally</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.079" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">and everything that&#39;s heavy is on</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.440" end="00:34:23.760" style="s2">locally so what we mean by that is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.000" end="00:34:25.599" style="s2">knowledge should not be restricted to</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.760" end="00:34:27.919" style="s2">intellectual property</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.599" end="00:34:31.040" style="s2">you i think it&#39;s very useful to have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.919" end="00:34:33.280" style="s2">community of farmers in nepal</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.040" end="00:34:34.560" style="s2">to discuss with the community of farmers</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.280" end="00:34:38.480" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.560" end="00:34:39.919" style="s2">in the andes because their bio</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.480" end="00:34:41.520" style="s2">whatever you call it i&#39;m not sure how to</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.919" end="00:34:44.720" style="s2">call it but you know the and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.520" end="00:34:46.720" style="s2">the biome the the biome can be very very</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.720" end="00:34:48.720" style="s2">similar and there&#39;s a lot they can learn</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.720" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">and there is a there&#39;s a case to be made</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.720" end="00:34:51.679" style="s2">that knowledge share knowledge is very</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:52.879" style="s2">important for example you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.679" end="00:34:55.359" style="s2">inca</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.879" end="00:34:56.000" style="s2">empire you know and it really goes up</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.359" end="00:34:59.520" style="s2">and down</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.000" end="00:35:03.680" style="s2">and so without the incas</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.520" end="00:35:05.680" style="s2">the food production would go down by 90</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.680" end="00:35:07.680" style="s2">so massive die outs of the local</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.680" end="00:35:09.920" style="s2">populations</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.680" end="00:35:11.920" style="s2">uh because they just you know they just</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.920" end="00:35:12.800" style="s2">regressed to their like what they really</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.920" end="00:35:16.640" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.800" end="00:35:19.200" style="s2">on their own and so then you have very</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.640" end="00:35:22.320" style="s2">low populations</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.200" end="00:35:23.599" style="s2">uh while when the inca empire then you</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.320" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">know grew again</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.599" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">then you see the population levels go up</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:29.119" style="s2">so that&#39;s the importance of having</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.680" end="00:35:30.000" style="s2">shared knowledge base which you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.119" end="00:35:32.560" style="s2">adds on to your</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.000" end="00:35:34.000" style="s2">own and uh you know you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.560" end="00:35:35.839" style="s2">middle ages in europe you know the tru</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.000" end="00:35:36.880" style="s2">the travelers were very important like</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.839" end="00:35:38.800" style="s2">the guilds</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.880" end="00:35:40.640" style="s2">were organized you know they were not</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.800" end="00:35:42.320" style="s2">static and local</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.640" end="00:35:43.680" style="s2">the the people who made the cathedrals</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.320" end="00:35:47.119" style="s2">they were traveling</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.680" end="00:35:48.800" style="s2">right by the connection and yeah so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.119" end="00:35:50.640" style="s2">so that has to stay you know that kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.800" end="00:35:53.359" style="s2">of capacity that we have</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.640" end="00:35:54.800" style="s2">as humanity to build collective</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.359" end="00:35:57.040" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.800" end="00:35:58.400" style="s2">uh at different scales but what is not</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.040" end="00:36:01.520" style="s2">healthy</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.400" end="00:36:02.880" style="s2">is to have new new zealand better going</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.520" end="00:36:05.040" style="s2">to patagonia</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.880" end="00:36:06.160" style="s2">and destroying the whole local economy</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.040" end="00:36:07.040" style="s2">and they&#39;re already making the best</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.160" end="00:36:09.119" style="s2">butter in the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.040" end="00:36:11.359" style="s2">right so these are two different things</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.119" end="00:36:14.560" style="s2">so i think the neoliberal</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.359" end="00:36:17.280" style="s2">transportation regime that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.560" end="00:36:18.720" style="s2">you know that has to change again</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.280" end="00:36:20.560" style="s2">probably not 100</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.720" end="00:36:23.200" style="s2">so i prefer to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.560" end="00:36:25.920" style="s2">subsidiarity of material production</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.200" end="00:36:26.800" style="s2">you know like i&#39;ve heard i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.920" end="00:36:30.000" style="s2">it&#39;s true but</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.800" end="00:36:34.160" style="s2">uh if ireland would not have any imports</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.000" end="00:36:35.839" style="s2">then people would have uh going</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.160" end="00:36:37.359" style="s2">right because they there&#39;s not enough i</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.839" end="00:36:39.280" style="s2">o there&#39;s something in the air</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.359" end="00:36:41.280" style="s2">just an example not everything is</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.280" end="00:36:43.280" style="s2">locally available</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.280" end="00:36:45.280" style="s2">uh but it has to be done in an</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.280" end="00:36:47.359" style="s2">intelligent way right so what what we</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.280" end="00:36:48.320" style="s2">so i&#39;m pretty in agreement with what</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.359" end="00:36:51.520" style="s2">dennis meadow</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.320" end="00:36:52.400" style="s2">said i i read a a report from terdelia</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.520" end="00:36:55.359" style="s2">which is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.400" end="00:36:58.320" style="s2">french community land trust and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.359" end="00:37:00.640" style="s2">calculated that if you 100 organic food</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.320" end="00:37:01.599" style="s2">in france you need 12 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.640" end="00:37:04.800" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.599" end="00:37:05.680" style="s2">doing farming as opposed to only two</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.800" end="00:37:07.760" style="s2">percent now</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.680" end="00:37:08.720" style="s2">yeah i mean we&#39;ve got mass unemployment</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.760" end="00:37:11.119" style="s2">and many of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.720" end="00:37:11.760" style="s2">globes are disappearing so um and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.119" end="00:37:14.240" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.760" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">healthy for the immune system and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.240" end="00:37:17.920" style="s2">connected</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.880" end="00:37:19.760" style="s2">to places you know not everybody</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.920" end="00:37:21.359" style="s2">needs all all kinds of technology you</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.760" end="00:37:23.200" style="s2">know i look at the amish</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.359" end="00:37:24.560" style="s2">who reportedly have the most productive</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.200" end="00:37:25.839" style="s2">agriculture in the us i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.560" end="00:37:26.800" style="s2">that&#39;s true but i&#39;ve read that several</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.839" end="00:37:28.240" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.800" end="00:37:29.839" style="s2">and i was looking at the bruderhof</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.240" end="00:37:32.880" style="s2">communities and you know their</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.839" end="00:37:34.720" style="s2">regenerative agriculture you know they</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.880" end="00:37:36.480" style="s2">only use minimal technology</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.720" end="00:37:38.160" style="s2">but they use technology you know so</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.480" end="00:37:40.480" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a wrong discussion it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.160" end="00:37:42.320" style="s2">not about</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.480" end="00:37:44.960" style="s2">for or against technology it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.320" end="00:37:48.400" style="s2">technology works for us with our purpose</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.960" end="00:37:50.640" style="s2">right and i have 100</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.400" end="00:37:52.400" style="s2">sympathy for people saying oh we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.640" end="00:37:54.400" style="s2">want smartphones for our children we</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.400" end="00:37:57.440" style="s2">don&#39;t need we need tv</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.400" end="00:37:59.280" style="s2">in our community why not i mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.440" end="00:38:01.599" style="s2">it&#39;s you know you judge you judge</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.280" end="00:38:04.640" style="s2">technology from the community</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.599" end="00:38:07.599" style="s2">level uh how have you</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.640" end="00:38:07.920" style="s2">how have you seen this um evolve since</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.599" end="00:38:10.079" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.920" end="00:38:11.520" style="s2">with with frank frank case you you made</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.079" end="00:38:13.760" style="s2">this um movie</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.520" end="00:38:14.880" style="s2">technology quite a long time ago by now</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.760" end="00:38:16.960" style="s2">um i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.880" end="00:38:18.079" style="s2">remember exactly it was in the late 90s</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.960" end="00:38:22.400" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.079" end="00:38:24.880" style="s2">um so you&#39;ve you&#39;ve been tuned in to</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.400" end="00:38:26.240" style="s2">the the kind of role of technology in</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.880" end="00:38:29.359" style="s2">this for a long time yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.240" end="00:38:31.920" style="s2">and and i&#39;m sort of still</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.359" end="00:38:32.960" style="s2">like i don&#39;t know i can&#39;t see the future</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.920" end="00:38:36.320" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.960" end="00:38:38.400" style="s2">but i i&#39;m wondering how</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.320" end="00:38:39.440" style="s2">how could we find the both and in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.400" end="00:38:43.280" style="s2">that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.440" end="00:38:46.480" style="s2">um create like you mentioned um</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.280" end="00:38:48.160" style="s2">bitcoin earlier and and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.480" end="00:38:50.640" style="s2">energy footprint of some of these</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.160" end="00:38:53.119" style="s2">technologies in many ways all of us</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.640" end="00:38:54.160" style="s2">like this conversation yet another piece</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.119" end="00:38:56.160" style="s2">that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.160" end="00:38:58.000" style="s2">producing we&#39;re putting out there but</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.160" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s going to be stored on some</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.000" end="00:39:01.440" style="s2">server it&#39;s going to take water and</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.520" end="00:39:04.400" style="s2">energy to keep it there absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.440" end="00:39:05.520" style="s2">so i think there&#39;s two drivers uh you</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.400" end="00:39:07.680" style="s2">know of technology</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.520" end="00:39:09.839" style="s2">and one is really capital right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.680" end="00:39:11.040" style="s2">look at the internet how it was 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.839" end="00:39:14.480" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.040" end="00:39:15.920" style="s2">and was what it has become that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.480" end="00:39:17.520" style="s2">the organic outgrowth</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.920" end="00:39:19.119" style="s2">of peer-to-peer technologies because</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.520" end="00:39:23.200" style="s2">they were taken over by big</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.119" end="00:39:24.960" style="s2">big companies who had a different agenda</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.200" end="00:39:26.480" style="s2">of you know selling our surplus</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.960" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">attention and so they</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.480" end="00:39:33.440" style="s2">they designed facebook and twitter to</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:35.200" style="s2">to be in a certain way um</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.440" end="00:39:36.640" style="s2">this that&#39;s not just technology so</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.200" end="00:39:39.680" style="s2">that&#39;s one driver for sure</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:43.760" style="s2">but the technocolypse movie had</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.680" end="00:39:45.520" style="s2">and another idea which is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.760" end="00:39:48.240" style="s2">technology is bad religion let me</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.520" end="00:39:51.520" style="s2">quickly explain so the idea that i have</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.240" end="00:39:53.359" style="s2">is that transcendence is really a human</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.520" end="00:39:55.920" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.359" end="00:39:56.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s not just belief it&#39;s really kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.920" end="00:39:59.040" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.640" end="00:40:00.320" style="s2">built in that we want this we want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.040" end="00:40:03.440" style="s2">transcend go</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.320" end="00:40:03.440" style="s2">at higher levels</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:07.680" style="s2">and so i think that when europe</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.240" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">abandoned</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.680" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">religion uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.000" end="00:40:15.359" style="s2">that drive became unconscious right and</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.800" end="00:40:18.400" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.359" end="00:40:20.640" style="s2">what the thesis of technocalypse is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.400" end="00:40:22.000" style="s2">transhumanism which is really the agenda</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.640" end="00:40:23.839" style="s2">now you know like</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.000" end="00:40:26.160" style="s2">all these people are now the head of</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.839" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">research of google and they get</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.160" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">you know billions of dollars right for</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:32.480" style="s2">their dreams</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.920" end="00:40:34.240" style="s2">is an unconscious religion so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.480" end="00:40:38.240" style="s2">different ways you can say that so</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.240" end="00:40:40.240" style="s2">omniscience omnipresence right</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.240" end="00:40:42.560" style="s2">that&#39;s what they want they they they</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.240" end="00:40:45.839" style="s2">want to use technology to achieve what</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.560" end="00:40:47.680" style="s2">they think religion can&#39;t yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.839" end="00:40:49.920" style="s2">we we spoke to a hindu scholar he had</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.680" end="00:40:51.680" style="s2">made a map of 64 cities</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.920" end="00:40:53.920" style="s2">you know special powers that you can do</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.680" end="00:40:57.119" style="s2">by doing yoga</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.920" end="00:40:58.240" style="s2">like by location and you know and he</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.119" end="00:41:00.240" style="s2">says well that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.240" end="00:41:02.160" style="s2">technology is actually doing so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.240" end="00:41:04.000" style="s2">really taking all these things that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.160" end="00:41:07.520" style="s2">used to believe</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.000" end="00:41:10.319" style="s2">we could do by self work and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.520" end="00:41:11.040" style="s2">they putting it there outside of us in</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.319" end="00:41:13.760" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.040" end="00:41:14.319" style="s2">right and so transhumanism is a bad</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.760" end="00:41:16.160" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.319" end="00:41:17.680" style="s2">and bad because it&#39;s unconscious that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.160" end="00:41:19.920" style="s2">is a religion</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.680" end="00:41:21.079" style="s2">and so in many ways we are driven by</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.920" end="00:41:22.800" style="s2">some people call it male</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.079" end="00:41:25.280" style="s2">transcendentalism</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.800" end="00:41:28.160" style="s2">um you know this kind of desire to</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.280" end="00:41:31.280" style="s2">escape the body to escape matter</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.160" end="00:41:34.560" style="s2">and so somehow this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.280" end="00:41:35.520" style="s2">fused with capitalism as you know a</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.560" end="00:41:39.040" style="s2">really strong</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.520" end="00:41:41.040" style="s2">driver so my response to this is to</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.040" end="00:41:43.680" style="s2">become conscious of it</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.040" end="00:41:45.599" style="s2">and to move to more more conscious</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.680" end="00:41:48.319" style="s2">value-based design</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.599" end="00:41:50.720" style="s2">so i have a report that i published last</p>

<p begin="00:42:19.200" end="00:42:23.280" style="s2">oh yes so one of my slides shows like</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:25.040" style="s2">okay what do you think about blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.280" end="00:42:26.880" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.040" end="00:42:28.560" style="s2">okay what is for me important in</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.880" end="00:42:30.240" style="s2">blockchain technology</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.560" end="00:42:32.319" style="s2">is not the technology itself but it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.240" end="00:42:34.560" style="s2">the capacity to think and create</p>

<p begin="00:42:38.240" end="00:42:41.920" style="s2">so accounting is really how we see the</p>

<p begin="00:42:59.680" end="00:43:05.760" style="s2">is double entry accounting that was</p>

<p begin="00:43:21.520" end="00:43:26.480" style="s2">right it&#39;s how we see the world so that</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.520" end="00:43:28.400" style="s2">to have a distributed ledger a shared</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.480" end="00:43:30.319" style="s2">accounting system and which also means a</p>

<p begin="00:43:30.319" end="00:43:34.079" style="s2">means that we can start working in</p>

<p begin="00:43:34.079" end="00:43:38.079" style="s2">and this is what happened in free</p>

<p begin="00:43:50.240" end="00:43:54.079" style="s2">looking at signals like the bees and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.880" end="00:43:56.720" style="s2">ants</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.079" end="00:43:58.720" style="s2">right you don&#39;t need a hierarchy command</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.720" end="00:44:00.319" style="s2">you can say i&#39;m a developer i want to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.720" end="00:44:03.280" style="s2">this i look at linux oh</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.319" end="00:44:03.839" style="s2">they don&#39;t have it yet i can do it right</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.280" end="00:44:06.800" style="s2">imagine</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.839" end="00:44:08.000" style="s2">once you have accounting you can look at</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.800" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">streams of matter</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.000" end="00:44:11.920" style="s2">and energy and do the same i don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:14.000" style="s2">to make more shoes</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.920" end="00:44:17.119" style="s2">because i can see that there is an</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.000" end="00:44:17.119" style="s2">overproduction of shoes</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.200" end="00:44:23.119" style="s2">um so yeah so that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.119" end="00:44:24.640" style="s2">let me look but okay let me say just one</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.119" end="00:44:26.880" style="s2">thing because now this was actually the</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.640" end="00:44:30.319" style="s2">threat and i&#39;m finished then with that</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.880" end="00:44:32.400" style="s2">so a libertarian blockchain developer</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.319" end="00:44:34.160" style="s2">thinks about individuals so it thinks</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.400" end="00:44:36.079" style="s2">about smart contracts</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.160" end="00:44:37.680" style="s2">individual to individual a commons</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.079" end="00:44:40.400" style="s2">oriented developer</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.680" end="00:44:42.240" style="s2">looks at groups and collaborative uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.400" end="00:44:45.280" style="s2">collaboration groups so he does</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.240" end="00:44:46.319" style="s2">ostrom contracts he looks at social</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.280" end="00:44:48.960" style="s2">charters</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.319" end="00:44:51.119" style="s2">a libertarian developer looks at</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.960" end="00:44:53.760" style="s2">commodity currencies like bitcoin</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.119" end="00:44:55.440" style="s2">you know it&#39;s based on supply and demand</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.760" end="00:44:57.440" style="s2">a commons developer would think about</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.440" end="00:44:58.960" style="s2">mutual credit</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.440" end="00:45:00.480" style="s2">right so that&#39;s what i&#39;m trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:02.319" style="s2">and i&#39;m done with that</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.480" end="00:45:04.079" style="s2">so we have to think about that</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.319" end="00:45:06.800" style="s2">technology is not something out</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.079" end="00:45:08.079" style="s2">there that is neutral and organic we</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.800" end="00:45:10.720" style="s2">have to think about it it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.079" end="00:45:12.480" style="s2">that we as humans design</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.720" end="00:45:14.400" style="s2">and therefore we can design technology</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.480" end="00:45:16.839" style="s2">for the commons and obviously a local</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.400" end="00:45:18.720" style="s2">community will have completely different</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.839" end="00:45:21.839" style="s2">needs you know than a</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.720" end="00:45:24.000" style="s2">let&#39;s say a nomad collective that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.839" end="00:45:25.920" style="s2">doing free software on a global scale</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.000" end="00:45:27.280" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.920" end="00:45:28.960" style="s2">so it&#39;s not about technology that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.280" end="00:45:30.079" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to say it&#39;s about what kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.960" end="00:45:32.400" style="s2">of technology because</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.079" end="00:45:33.440" style="s2">you know using spares spears is</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.400" end="00:45:36.079" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.440" end="00:45:37.359" style="s2">yeah no no absolutely but the the sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.079" end="00:45:40.319" style="s2">that i had this</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.359" end="00:45:41.839" style="s2">that we earlier were talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.319" end="00:45:45.599" style="s2">important really axioms</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.839" end="00:45:48.240" style="s2">are um with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.599" end="00:45:49.599" style="s2">how the world shows up for us and even</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.240" end="00:45:53.440" style="s2">what what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.599" end="00:45:56.480" style="s2">that the like like the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.440" end="00:45:59.520" style="s2">the frame of seeing everything</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.480" end="00:46:00.720" style="s2">within an accounting framework um like</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.520" end="00:46:02.560" style="s2">what i</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.720" end="00:46:04.079" style="s2">what i&#39;ve noticed lately and i&#39;m it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.560" end="00:46:04.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a question i&#39;m sitting with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.079" end="00:46:08.240" style="s2">not like i</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.720" end="00:46:10.720" style="s2">have an answer to it fully um is</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.240" end="00:46:13.040" style="s2">all this good work that is is looking</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.720" end="00:46:15.119" style="s2">into resource and allocation councils</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.040" end="00:46:16.640" style="s2">and all this kind of idea of okay we</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.119" end="00:46:20.560" style="s2">have a limited amount of</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.640" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">resources they&#39;re running out fast and</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.560" end="00:46:24.800" style="s2">we need to create a more equitable</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:24.800" style="s2">society and</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.880" end="00:46:28.160" style="s2">even some people are taking it into the</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.880" end="00:46:29.760" style="s2">bioregionals</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.160" end="00:46:31.680" style="s2">space and saying okay let&#39;s let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.760" end="00:46:33.680" style="s2">at what what can this bio region produce</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.680" end="00:46:37.119" style="s2">and how do we share it</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.680" end="00:46:40.079" style="s2">as a commons um all wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.119" end="00:46:40.079" style="s2">but if we</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.640" end="00:46:45.520" style="s2">like by going the kind of jack fresno</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.400" end="00:46:48.960" style="s2">venus project</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.520" end="00:46:50.880" style="s2">way of letting big data compute what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.960" end="00:46:52.000" style="s2">available what&#39;s being produced with</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:54.480" style="s2">what technology</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.000" end="00:46:56.640" style="s2">and having some sort of premium of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.480" end="00:46:58.079" style="s2">scientists how you like you always sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.640" end="00:47:00.560" style="s2">of calls it just</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.079" end="00:47:02.480" style="s2">like that we see it now with with covet</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:04.400" style="s2">like which scientists</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.480" end="00:47:06.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of diversity in what the</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.400" end="00:47:10.480" style="s2">perspective scientists offer us</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.800" end="00:47:10.960" style="s2">how do we keep control over or some kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.480" end="00:47:13.760" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.960" end="00:47:15.680" style="s2">participatory right of decision making</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.760" end="00:47:18.880" style="s2">rather than control is the wrong word</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.680" end="00:47:20.960" style="s2">and when we transfer all of this to</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.880" end="00:47:22.319" style="s2">the big data cloud and the people who</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.960" end="00:47:25.040" style="s2">make sense of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.319" end="00:47:25.760" style="s2">that data and i&#39;m i&#39;m a bit concerned</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.040" end="00:47:27.920" style="s2">that like even</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.760" end="00:47:29.040" style="s2">even the notion of because then people</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.920" end="00:47:30.319" style="s2">run into the second law of</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.040" end="00:47:33.520" style="s2">thermodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.319" end="00:47:36.319" style="s2">um and and create through that</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.520" end="00:47:38.720" style="s2">yet again a sort of scarcity mindset um</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.319" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">in my mind what what that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.720" end="00:47:41.200" style="s2">very often</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.839" end="00:47:42.480" style="s2">that&#39;s one point we never had that</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.200" end="00:47:43.599" style="s2">conversation where you put out that</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.480" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">paper</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.599" end="00:47:50.839" style="s2">um to my mind when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:52.240" style="s2">thermodynamics which is a concept out of</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.839" end="00:47:55.359" style="s2">physics</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.240" end="00:47:56.000" style="s2">we forget that we live as biological</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.359" end="00:47:58.400" style="s2">beings</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.000" end="00:47:59.119" style="s2">in very different time scales than what</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.400" end="00:48:00.960" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.119" end="00:48:03.280" style="s2">second law of thermodynamics is talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.960" end="00:48:04.640" style="s2">about yes of course the second law of</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.280" end="00:48:06.240" style="s2">thermodynamics holds</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.640" end="00:48:07.920" style="s2">in that perspective within that</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.240" end="00:48:10.720" style="s2">scientific framework</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.920" end="00:48:11.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s part of reality in that right</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.720" end="00:48:14.640" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.680" end="00:48:16.559" style="s2">but for us as human beings like we</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.640" end="00:48:19.599" style="s2">always dissed the dinosaurs for having</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.559" end="00:48:21.359" style="s2">gone extinct um but they made it 30</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.599" end="00:48:23.680" style="s2">million years we</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.359" end="00:48:24.559" style="s2">haven&#39;t even scratched the surface of</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.680" end="00:48:27.440" style="s2">that yet</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.559" end="00:48:28.880" style="s2">and and what i&#39;m saying is we can create</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.440" end="00:48:32.720" style="s2">abundant</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.880" end="00:48:35.599" style="s2">shared wealth and beauty for</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.720" end="00:48:36.800" style="s2">ten thousands or even a million years or</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.599" end="00:48:38.800" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.800" end="00:48:39.839" style="s2">and that means a lot like in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.800" end="00:48:42.559" style="s2">real lived</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.839" end="00:48:43.599" style="s2">meaning experience that that&#39;s worth it</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.559" end="00:48:46.800" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.599" end="00:48:49.280" style="s2">and the thermal like life</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.800" end="00:48:51.520" style="s2">life in and of itself on this planet is</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.280" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">a negan trophic engine if we if you look</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.520" end="00:48:57.040" style="s2">at what life has done to planet earth</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:48:59.200" style="s2">locally is to create more abundance</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.040" end="00:49:01.440" style="s2">over time and of course eventually our</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.200" end="00:49:04.319" style="s2">sun is gonna go supernova</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.440" end="00:49:05.599" style="s2">explode and and will all burn and up but</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.319" end="00:49:07.680" style="s2">in the meantime</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.599" end="00:49:09.520" style="s2">um yeah but i i think that the question</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.680" end="00:49:11.520" style="s2">for me is</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.520" end="00:49:13.280" style="s2">you know what do we know what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.520" end="00:49:15.440" style="s2">with our complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.280" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">right so we do have extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.440" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">complex society</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:23.920" style="s2">which generates a surplus that allows us</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:27.119" style="s2">to have you know scientific systems</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.920" end="00:49:27.119" style="s2">medical systems</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.520" end="00:49:31.760" style="s2">so what i&#39;m fearing is that out of</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.640" end="00:49:37.040" style="s2">idealism</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.760" end="00:49:40.079" style="s2">you know we we actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.040" end="00:49:43.520" style="s2">kind of design a very</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.079" end="00:49:45.599" style="s2">fast downward slope</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.520" end="00:49:46.880" style="s2">that will that could cost many many many</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.599" end="00:49:49.839" style="s2">lives</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.880" end="00:49:52.000" style="s2">right so i&#39;m always thinking smoo how</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.839" end="00:49:54.319" style="s2">can we smoothen this transition</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.000" end="00:49:55.280" style="s2">and that requires in my view taking into</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.319" end="00:49:58.720" style="s2">account of</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.280" end="00:49:59.920" style="s2">you know current technology and so my</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.720" end="00:50:02.079" style="s2">effort i know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.920" end="00:50:03.680" style="s2">not perfect and there can be more you</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.079" end="00:50:07.280" style="s2">know radical idealized</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.680" end="00:50:09.200" style="s2">versions of this but um</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.280" end="00:50:11.119" style="s2">if already with the current technology</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.200" end="00:50:13.760" style="s2">we could see</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.119" end="00:50:14.400" style="s2">you know what the limits are in our</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.760" end="00:50:17.599" style="s2">usage</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.400" end="00:50:18.319" style="s2">right so the kate wayworth uh donuts</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.599" end="00:50:21.599" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.319" end="00:50:23.280" style="s2">if that would become the standard view</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.599" end="00:50:24.319" style="s2">of our accounting system that would be</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.280" end="00:50:27.839" style="s2">in my view</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.319" end="00:50:29.839" style="s2">an extraordinary advance because i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.839" end="00:50:31.599" style="s2">think everybody is ready</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.839" end="00:50:33.839" style="s2">you know to go in a bruderhof community</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.599" end="00:50:36.079" style="s2">you see what i mean it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.839" end="00:50:37.839" style="s2">but uh not everybody is going to live in</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.079" end="00:50:39.280" style="s2">an eco village</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.839" end="00:50:41.119" style="s2">but the interesting thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.280" end="00:50:43.760" style="s2">walnut is that the donut has</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.119" end="00:50:44.480" style="s2">two circles um i mean we cannot can have</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.760" end="00:50:46.160" style="s2">an argument of</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.480" end="00:50:47.599" style="s2">whether the image of the donut was very</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.160" end="00:50:48.720" style="s2">useful because it&#39;s such such an</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.599" end="00:50:51.839" style="s2">unhealthy thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.720" end="00:50:53.839" style="s2">and a donut but but the two circles</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.839" end="00:50:55.920" style="s2">the inner circle of the socioeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.839" end="00:50:58.000" style="s2">foundations that enable people</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.920" end="00:50:58.960" style="s2">in place to live within planetary</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.000" end="00:51:02.319" style="s2">boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.960" end="00:51:05.200" style="s2">is is almost the precondition</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.319" end="00:51:05.920" style="s2">for staying within planetary boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.200" end="00:51:08.240" style="s2">the approach</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.920" end="00:51:09.839" style="s2">of starting with resource and allocation</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.240" end="00:51:13.280" style="s2">starting from the planetary</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.839" end="00:51:15.440" style="s2">boundaries down um but</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.280" end="00:51:16.960" style="s2">it&#39;s when you and and that&#39;s why i so</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.440" end="00:51:17.680" style="s2">deeply appreciate your work because i</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.960" end="00:51:19.839" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.680" end="00:51:21.119" style="s2">the the peer-to-peer work is actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.839" end="00:51:23.200" style="s2">working much more</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.119" end="00:51:24.800" style="s2">from on the inner circle of how do we</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.200" end="00:51:25.920" style="s2">create the conditions that appear</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.800" end="00:51:27.680" style="s2">in place yes because you know like</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.920" end="00:51:28.720" style="s2">holochain i wanted to say this when you</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.680" end="00:51:30.240" style="s2">talked about</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.720" end="00:51:32.079" style="s2">uh you know if you look at the whole</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.240" end="00:51:33.920" style="s2">chain vision it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.079" end="00:51:36.319" style="s2">one big thing for everyone it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.920" end="00:51:38.880" style="s2">capacity of everyone to create</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.319" end="00:51:39.440" style="s2">their own distributed ledger like their</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.880" end="00:51:42.480" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.440" end="00:51:44.960" style="s2">you know logistical coordination</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.480" end="00:51:45.920" style="s2">and two if they want to to share it with</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.960" end="00:51:49.359" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.920" end="00:51:52.640" style="s2">right so that&#39;s kind of a peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.359" end="00:51:54.319" style="s2">uh aggregation</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.640" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2">when you look at bitcoin and blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.319" end="00:51:58.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a world computer</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.000" end="00:52:00.480" style="s2">every transaction has to be verified by</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.559" end="00:52:03.200" style="s2">all the other transactions in the past</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.480" end="00:52:04.720" style="s2">which creates an exponential energy</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.200" end="00:52:06.960" style="s2">usage right</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.720" end="00:52:09.040" style="s2">so when you look into design you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.960" end="00:52:09.599" style="s2">think differently about how to design</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.040" end="00:52:12.960" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.599" end="00:52:16.000" style="s2">things uh but yeah do</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.960" end="00:52:18.880" style="s2">do we want to you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.000" end="00:52:19.280" style="s2">i think if we abandon digital technology</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.880" end="00:52:21.680" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.280" end="00:52:22.720" style="s2">all that john lonnich i i think we will</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.680" end="00:52:25.280" style="s2">we will see a</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.720" end="00:52:27.359" style="s2">an extraordinary collapse of complex</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.280" end="00:52:28.480" style="s2">systems and many people will die in my</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.359" end="00:52:30.800" style="s2">view right</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.480" end="00:52:32.720" style="s2">so maybe maybe there is no other</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.800" end="00:52:34.640" style="s2">solution and we will get there</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.720" end="00:52:38.240" style="s2">but i think we should try yeah we should</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.640" end="00:52:41.760" style="s2">really try to transform what we have</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.240" end="00:52:45.280" style="s2">uh you know as realistically as possible</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.760" end="00:52:47.920" style="s2">uh into like a next phase right i</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.280" end="00:52:48.319" style="s2">i kind of i agree with you but one thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.920" end="00:52:50.559" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.319" end="00:52:52.720" style="s2">that has happened to me in the last year</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.559" end="00:52:56.240" style="s2">a little bit is um</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.720" end="00:52:57.599" style="s2">very often in my work i i</p>

<p begin="00:52:59.359" end="00:53:03.280" style="s2">if you want to change the way people</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.599" end="00:53:06.000" style="s2">think don&#39;t tell them what to think</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.280" end="00:53:07.920" style="s2">um give them a tool the use of which</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.000" end="00:53:11.040" style="s2">will change the way they think</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.920" end="00:53:11.040" style="s2">and that was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.760" end="00:53:17.359" style="s2">sort of design briefs that i held close</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.119" end="00:53:19.359" style="s2">to my heart when i was writing my book i</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.359" end="00:53:20.480" style="s2">i regard my book as a work that works</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.359" end="00:53:22.559" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.480" end="00:53:24.160" style="s2">does that to a certain extent but if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.559" end="00:53:24.880" style="s2">if you spin that thought a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.160" end="00:53:27.680" style="s2">further then</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.880" end="00:53:29.280" style="s2">then um all technology is such a tool</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.680" end="00:53:33.040" style="s2">that changes the way we think</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.280" end="00:53:36.079" style="s2">and and it has had very positive um</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.040" end="00:53:39.839" style="s2">and very negative aspects to it uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.079" end="00:53:40.400" style="s2">sometimes i mean i love all these guys</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.839" end="00:53:43.760" style="s2">working</p>

<p begin="00:53:52.240" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2">like build the process by which people</p>

<p begin="00:53:56.000" end="00:54:01.200" style="s2">yeah exactly the only the only question</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.760" end="00:54:05.040" style="s2">that i have with this is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.200" end="00:54:06.160" style="s2">if that somehow creates an in-group and</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.040" end="00:54:09.119" style="s2">out group for those</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.160" end="00:54:11.280" style="s2">people like most of the world&#39;s food is</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.119" end="00:54:14.240" style="s2">still grown by peasant farmers</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.280" end="00:54:15.040" style="s2">and they&#39;re not necessarily as digitally</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.240" end="00:54:17.359" style="s2">literate</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.040" end="00:54:19.040" style="s2">as we have they&#39;re not necessarily able</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.359" end="00:54:21.760" style="s2">to access</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.040" end="00:54:23.119" style="s2">um this technology as easily okay they</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.760" end="00:54:23.680" style="s2">might have mobile phones and blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.119" end="00:54:26.079" style="s2">blah but</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.680" end="00:54:26.880" style="s2">but do we really want to like for</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.079" end="00:54:28.400" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.880" end="00:54:29.920" style="s2">could put this together with</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.400" end="00:54:30.880" style="s2">conversation i had with martin from</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.920" end="00:54:33.760" style="s2">hildebrand who</p>

<p begin="00:54:47.040" end="00:54:53.200" style="s2">um and the minute you bring</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.799" end="00:54:55.119" style="s2">that culture in contact with oh we now</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.200" end="00:54:55.680" style="s2">can pay you for keeping the amazon like</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.119" end="00:54:58.000" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.680" end="00:54:59.359" style="s2">and but you have to use all these this</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.000" end="00:55:02.880" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.359" end="00:55:04.720" style="s2">you actually maybe not even with</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.880" end="00:55:06.079" style="s2">bad intent with good intent but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.720" end="00:55:08.400" style="s2">introducing a trojan</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.079" end="00:55:11.440" style="s2">horse of technology that changes how</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.400" end="00:55:13.920" style="s2">people think and actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.440" end="00:55:15.680" style="s2">eradicates even more cultural diversity</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.920" end="00:55:18.720" style="s2">and rather than celebrating it</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:20.559" style="s2">yes i i don&#39;t know i</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.720" end="00:55:22.559" style="s2">i think they should decide you know and</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.559" end="00:55:23.760" style="s2">and if you look at the amish for example</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.559" end="00:55:26.799" style="s2">right they</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.760" end="00:55:28.319" style="s2">they have a council of elders</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.799" end="00:55:29.920" style="s2">and first of all they look at what the</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.319" end="00:55:33.760" style="s2">bible says because they&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.920" end="00:55:35.599" style="s2">they&#39;re based on this faith um</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.760" end="00:55:37.920" style="s2">but the second question they ask</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.599" end="00:55:40.240" style="s2">themselves is what is this technology</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.920" end="00:55:42.240" style="s2">going to do to our community</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.240" end="00:55:44.799" style="s2">right and these two criteria determine</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.240" end="00:55:46.720" style="s2">whether or not they accept</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.799" end="00:55:49.119" style="s2">a technology or not and i think this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.720" end="00:55:51.200" style="s2">entirely legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.119" end="00:55:52.400" style="s2">and i think different peoples will make</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.200" end="00:55:55.359" style="s2">different decisions</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.400" end="00:55:57.599" style="s2">about what level of technology they want</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.359" end="00:55:59.200" style="s2">uh and i think that&#39;s good because</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.599" end="00:56:03.200" style="s2">i i understand what you&#39;re saying but</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.200" end="00:56:05.839" style="s2">like i can say the opposite which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.200" end="00:56:07.359" style="s2">if they don&#39;t get the minimum amount of</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.839" end="00:56:10.000" style="s2">knowledge and technology</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.359" end="00:56:11.200" style="s2">of their enemies they&#39;re gonna be wiped</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.000" end="00:56:14.319" style="s2">out completely</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.200" end="00:56:18.319" style="s2">right so i don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.319" end="00:56:20.000" style="s2">either or it&#39;s it&#39;s basically for them</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.319" end="00:56:21.839" style="s2">you know to the best of their knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.000" end="00:56:23.359" style="s2">to decide you know how they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.839" end="00:56:25.359" style="s2">defend themselves right</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.359" end="00:56:27.280" style="s2">but the important thing is to restore</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.359" end="00:56:29.040" style="s2">technological autonomy</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.280" end="00:56:30.319" style="s2">you know it&#39;s technological maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.040" end="00:56:32.000" style="s2">sovereignty if you could call it that</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.319" end="00:56:33.440" style="s2">way it&#39;s like food sovereignty right you</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.000" end="00:56:35.839" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be dependent</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.440" end="00:56:38.880" style="s2">on big military nationals you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.839" end="00:56:40.240" style="s2">able to decide at the local level</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.880" end="00:56:42.079" style="s2">you know how you&#39;re going to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.240" end="00:56:44.160" style="s2">food food supply and</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.079" end="00:56:45.440" style="s2">and everything right so i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.160" end="00:56:47.839" style="s2">that&#39;s the solution it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.440" end="00:56:50.000" style="s2">it&#39;s we you know we don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.839" end="00:56:52.240" style="s2">best solution is</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.000" end="00:56:53.599" style="s2">uh and we need a palette you know a</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.240" end="00:56:57.040" style="s2">french word um</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.599" end="00:56:59.359" style="s2">like a a series of options that these</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.040" end="00:57:02.559" style="s2">people can have</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.359" end="00:57:04.160" style="s2">you know um</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.559" end="00:57:06.160" style="s2">because there&#39;s probably not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.160" end="00:57:07.680" style="s2">one uh answer</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.160" end="00:57:09.680" style="s2">and there&#39;s going to be a certain level</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.680" end="00:57:12.160" style="s2">of darwinistic selection when you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.680" end="00:57:13.920" style="s2">some people do this and it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.160" end="00:57:15.760" style="s2">all this other people will take another</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.920" end="00:57:18.079" style="s2">solution that will turn out to be the</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.760" end="00:57:20.559" style="s2">best one</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.079" end="00:57:21.280" style="s2">but i mean it i completely agree that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.559" end="00:57:24.319" style="s2">do need to</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.280" end="00:57:27.680" style="s2">technology to help this this transition</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.319" end="00:57:30.960" style="s2">and to some extent i see technology</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.680" end="00:57:34.480" style="s2">having the potential of enabling</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.960" end="00:57:36.240" style="s2">the implementation of the high political</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.480" end="00:57:38.079" style="s2">ideal of subsidiarity that</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.240" end="00:57:40.240" style="s2">so much of what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.079" end="00:57:42.720" style="s2">subsidiarity is at the core of it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.240" end="00:57:44.720" style="s2">people talk about we need more citizens</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.720" end="00:57:46.319" style="s2">participation and people need to be more</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.720" end="00:57:48.400" style="s2">involved in the communities</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.319" end="00:57:50.160" style="s2">if we don&#39;t have subsidiarity we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.400" end="00:57:53.119" style="s2">we won&#39;t get that and</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.160" end="00:57:56.160" style="s2">you won&#39;t get subsidiarity without also</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.119" end="00:57:58.880" style="s2">a balancing of the globalized economy to</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.160" end="00:57:59.760" style="s2">with regionalized economies so without</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.880" end="00:58:02.319" style="s2">economic</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.760" end="00:58:03.040" style="s2">relocalization and re-regionalization we</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.319" end="00:58:05.599" style="s2">can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.040" end="00:58:08.000" style="s2">subsidiarity and apparently we can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.599" end="00:58:09.760" style="s2">economic regionalization</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.000" end="00:58:11.040" style="s2">i want to make a bit the advocate of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.760" end="00:58:12.960" style="s2">devil so</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.040" end="00:58:15.040" style="s2">if i understand it well you know both</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.960" end="00:58:17.520" style="s2">china and japan at some moment decided</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.040" end="00:58:18.450" style="s2">to isolate themselves</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.520" end="00:58:20.799" style="s2">from the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.450" end="00:58:22.160" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.799" end="00:58:24.640" style="s2">i think in japan it was called the</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.160" end="00:58:26.000" style="s2">dokugawa period</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.640" end="00:58:28.000" style="s2">and this is a very interesting period</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.000" end="00:58:32.400" style="s2">because it&#39;s demons</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.000" end="00:58:36.079" style="s2">demonstrably a regional</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.400" end="00:58:39.200" style="s2">uh balanced society so it uses its</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.079" end="00:58:40.640" style="s2">regional planetary boundaries in exactly</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.200" end="00:58:42.559" style="s2">the right balance so that it could</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.640" end="00:58:44.079" style="s2">eventually continue forever</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.559" end="00:58:45.920" style="s2">so that&#39;s very good news because you</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.079" end="00:58:49.359" style="s2">know we know we can do it</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.920" end="00:58:51.119" style="s2">now they practice child death</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.359" end="00:58:53.200" style="s2">to do this so that&#39;s not a good solution</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.119" end="00:58:55.200" style="s2">for us they</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.200" end="00:58:57.920" style="s2">they would basically kill babies when</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.200" end="00:59:00.000" style="s2">there were too many of them but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.920" end="00:59:02.000" style="s2">but so japan leave for three centuries</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.000" end="00:59:04.720" style="s2">in this system and i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.000" end="00:59:06.640" style="s2">china also from the 12th to the 15th</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.720" end="00:59:07.839" style="s2">century or something like that right</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.640" end="00:59:10.000" style="s2">what happened was that when the</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.839" end="00:59:13.119" style="s2">europeans came you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.000" end="00:59:16.400" style="s2">one single gun boat</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.119" end="00:59:18.720" style="s2">was able to dominate the whole of china</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.400" end="00:59:20.079" style="s2">you see what i&#39;m trying to say so you</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.720" end="00:59:23.200" style="s2">always have to</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.079" end="00:59:24.640" style="s2">yes you can be idealistic but you live</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.200" end="00:59:27.359" style="s2">in a world where power</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.640" end="00:59:29.760" style="s2">is really important and technology is</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.359" end="00:59:33.280" style="s2">part of that power</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.760" end="00:59:34.160" style="s2">um and so that&#39;s for me a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.280" end="00:59:37.760" style="s2">question like</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.160" end="00:59:40.000" style="s2">you know how like do you really but</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.760" end="00:59:41.440" style="s2">want to be totally pacifistic and have</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.000" end="00:59:43.280" style="s2">no arms when you know that</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.440" end="00:59:44.799" style="s2">your neighbors are not doing it right so</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.280" end="00:59:47.359" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.799" end="00:59:48.880" style="s2">always a big question where you where</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.359" end="00:59:52.079" style="s2">you know how you balance these</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.880" end="00:59:53.599" style="s2">different uh desires and so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.079" end="00:59:54.319" style="s2">theory which i think isn&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.599" end="00:59:55.599" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.319" end="00:59:57.920" style="s2">you probably know about it you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.599" end="00:59:59.599" style="s2">multi-level selection</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.920" end="01:00:01.440" style="s2">where it says that you know once humans</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.599" end="01:00:04.079" style="s2">become cultural</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.440" end="01:00:06.240" style="s2">then the evolution is actually a</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.079" end="01:00:09.200" style="s2">competition between groups</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.240" end="01:00:11.520" style="s2">rather than between individuals so uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.200" end="01:00:14.400" style="s2">somebody with bad genes</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.520" end="01:00:16.079" style="s2">living in a good group is more likely to</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.400" end="01:00:17.280" style="s2">survive than somebody with good change</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.079" end="01:00:21.040" style="s2">in a bad group</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.280" end="01:00:23.920" style="s2">so to speak right so um</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.040" end="01:00:26.960" style="s2">and so these people like turchin and</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.920" end="01:00:28.960" style="s2">richard david stone would argue that</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.960" end="01:00:31.359" style="s2">you there&#39;s a competition between peer</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.960" end="01:00:33.680" style="s2">politics between you know kingdoms and</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.359" end="01:00:35.599" style="s2">empires and nations</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.680" end="01:00:37.520" style="s2">but in order to win that competition you</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.599" end="01:00:39.599" style="s2">have to be the strongest</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.520" end="01:00:40.880" style="s2">so the that&#39;s how we became cooperative</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.599" end="01:00:42.640" style="s2">as a species</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.880" end="01:00:44.240" style="s2">what i&#39;m trying to do is kind of change</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.640" end="01:00:45.839" style="s2">that logic is and that&#39;s what i think</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.240" end="01:00:47.520" style="s2">what the commons do can we create</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.839" end="01:00:49.680" style="s2">comments</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.520" end="01:00:51.680" style="s2">that create a primary field of</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.680" end="01:00:53.119" style="s2">cooperation</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.680" end="01:00:54.960" style="s2">and within that primary field of</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.119" end="01:00:56.000" style="s2">computation uh cooperation that can be</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.960" end="01:00:59.440" style="s2">competition for example</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.000" end="01:01:01.280" style="s2">the guild system protected every worker</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.440" end="01:01:03.359" style="s2">but you still have good craftsmen and</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.280" end="01:01:05.599" style="s2">bad craftsman and that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.359" end="01:01:07.280" style="s2">right the good craftsman will get more</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.599" end="01:01:09.440" style="s2">orders than a bad one</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.280" end="01:01:11.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s an incentive to learn more</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.440" end="01:01:15.680" style="s2">and to be better</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.760" end="01:01:18.720" style="s2">but the competition was framed</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.680" end="01:01:21.839" style="s2">into a protective cooperative system</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.720" end="01:01:22.880" style="s2">this is fascinating i don&#39;t know are you</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.839" end="01:01:25.900" style="s2">familiar with the word</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.880" end="01:01:27.040" style="s2">of the work of john stewart um</p>

<p begin="01:01:27.040" end="01:01:30.559" style="s2">i looked at it some years ago and i</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.720" end="01:01:33.280" style="s2">never read the whole book but uh yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.559" end="01:01:33.680" style="s2">i think it&#39;s pretty much the same idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.280" end="01:01:35.520" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.680" end="01:01:37.040" style="s2">he has this this wonderful sentence in</p>

<p begin="01:01:37.040" end="01:01:41.640" style="s2">evolution as um that the process of</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.079" end="01:01:44.280" style="s2">evolution is a process of</p>

<p begin="01:01:48.480" end="01:01:52.640" style="s2">and then the important sentences that</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.640" end="01:01:55.119" style="s2">throughout the history of evolution that</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.640" end="01:01:56.640" style="s2">reintegration happens through the</p>

<p begin="01:01:56.640" end="01:02:00.799" style="s2">of collaboration um whether it&#39;s from</p>

<p begin="01:02:09.520" end="01:02:13.119" style="s2">so much more is possible because that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:02:14.160" end="01:02:17.920" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s creating this next level</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.319" end="01:02:21.039" style="s2">collaborative infrastructure</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.920" end="01:02:24.079" style="s2">right um but</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.039" end="01:02:26.079" style="s2">so that i was reading um peter pagani</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.079" end="01:02:28.000" style="s2">which i really really liked it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.079" end="01:02:29.520" style="s2">rethinking the world</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.000" end="01:02:31.520" style="s2">and you know it basically says the same</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.520" end="01:02:34.799" style="s2">thing as you which you have you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.520" end="01:02:35.920" style="s2">complex adaptive systems with a relative</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.799" end="01:02:39.039" style="s2">stability</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.920" end="01:02:40.480" style="s2">but they can only change through a</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.039" end="01:02:45.200" style="s2">chaotic transition or</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.480" end="01:02:47.200" style="s2">bifurcation right so in his view we have</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.200" end="01:02:49.440" style="s2">uh in capitalism first we had the</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.200" end="01:02:52.319" style="s2">mercantile system</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.440" end="01:02:53.280" style="s2">you know relatively stable which</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.319" end="01:02:54.720" style="s2">collapsed</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.280" end="01:02:57.119" style="s2">through the french revolution and</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.720" end="01:02:58.960" style="s2">napoleonic wars</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.119" end="01:03:00.160" style="s2">which gave the smithian capitalist</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.960" end="01:03:03.760" style="s2">system which was</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.160" end="01:03:08.880" style="s2">a total dominion of capital over labor</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.760" end="01:03:10.799" style="s2">which collapsed between 1914 and 1945</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.880" end="01:03:12.960" style="s2">which gave the welfare system which was</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.799" end="01:03:13.920" style="s2">a social contract between capital and</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.960" end="01:03:17.280" style="s2">labor</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.920" end="01:03:19.440" style="s2">and that is now collapsing and</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.280" end="01:03:20.559" style="s2">now we need a new type of contract</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.440" end="01:03:23.760" style="s2">between humanity</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.559" end="01:03:26.559" style="s2">and you know the web of life</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.760" end="01:03:29.920" style="s2">uh and so that&#39;s of course the</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.559" end="01:03:31.280" style="s2">unfortunate thing is that we have to you</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.920" end="01:03:32.079" style="s2">know go through a certain period of</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.280" end="01:03:35.200" style="s2">defragment</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.079" end="01:03:37.039" style="s2">of fragmentation and chaos before we can</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.200" end="01:03:38.720" style="s2">uh and so that means that we have to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.039" end="01:03:39.839" style="s2">pessimistic and optimistic at the same</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.720" end="01:03:42.640" style="s2">time right is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.839" end="01:03:44.240" style="s2">in the short term like we can see it</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.640" end="01:03:47.039" style="s2">before our eyes and and</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.240" end="01:03:49.680" style="s2">what i didn&#39;t anticipate was that the</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.039" end="01:03:53.839" style="s2">social collapse would precede</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.680" end="01:03:56.720" style="s2">the um the climate and other collapses</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.839" end="01:03:57.200" style="s2">so what i&#39;m seeing today like in the us</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.720" end="01:04:00.240" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.200" end="01:04:01.680" style="s2">they&#39;re very close to civil war</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.240" end="01:04:03.599" style="s2">you know maybe not everybody against</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.680" end="01:04:05.200" style="s2">everybody but certainly</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.599" end="01:04:07.039" style="s2">you know there&#39;s armed militias now on</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.200" end="01:04:08.880" style="s2">both sides</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.039" end="01:04:10.640" style="s2">and you know that can go really really</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.880" end="01:04:12.079" style="s2">wrong uh if the elections are not</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.640" end="01:04:15.119" style="s2">accepted by one party or another</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.079" end="01:04:17.520" style="s2">right so the polarization</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.119" end="01:04:20.240" style="s2">the mutual hatred is is at an</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.520" end="01:04:22.000" style="s2">extraordinarily high level</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.240" end="01:04:23.839" style="s2">uh and people can&#39;t talk to each other</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.000" end="01:04:24.559" style="s2">anymore not just in the us i mean the</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.839" end="01:04:27.039" style="s2">u.s is</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.559" end="01:04:28.079" style="s2">it&#39;s just worse than worse there than</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.039" end="01:04:30.160" style="s2">than yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.079" end="01:04:31.839" style="s2">but it&#39;s i mean you see it in germany</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.160" end="01:04:35.359" style="s2">with with with the ifd</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.839" end="01:04:37.119" style="s2">and and the um right i have it every day</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.359" end="01:04:39.119" style="s2">you know people stop being friends with</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.119" end="01:04:41.839" style="s2">me because i&#39;m not against masks for</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.119" end="01:04:41.839" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.000" end="01:04:46.000" style="s2">you know it&#39;s because i live here</p>

<p begin="01:04:58.720" end="01:05:02.640" style="s2">if it</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.520" end="01:05:04.640" style="s2">diminishes the risk right</p>

<p begin="01:05:42.799" end="01:05:47.839" style="s2">many ways</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.200" end="01:05:49.839" style="s2">in this role of being a synthesizer</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.839" end="01:05:50.640" style="s2">synthesizing different perspectives and</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.839" end="01:05:54.240" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.640" end="01:05:57.200" style="s2">both you and i are trying to hold</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.240" end="01:05:59.680" style="s2">strong the value of multi-perspectival</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.200" end="01:06:02.160" style="s2">approaches to complexity exactly</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.680" end="01:06:04.480" style="s2">equality liberty fraternity now i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.160" end="01:06:06.160" style="s2">want to choose one for the other yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.480" end="01:06:08.319" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think any value is</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.160" end="01:06:11.760" style="s2">represented well by any</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.319" end="01:06:13.520" style="s2">movement right so this like i&#39;m globally</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.760" end="01:06:15.359" style="s2">a leftist</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.520" end="01:06:17.119" style="s2">but you know i don&#39;t agree with council</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.359" end="01:06:20.319" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.119" end="01:06:23.359" style="s2">and so i have sympathy for</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.319" end="01:06:26.480" style="s2">projects that try to establish dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.359" end="01:06:29.359" style="s2">you know between antagonistic groups</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.480" end="01:06:31.359" style="s2">um i that&#39;s just like that and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.359" end="01:06:34.160" style="s2">see why i don&#39;t have the right to choose</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.359" end="01:06:35.520" style="s2">those options that&#39;s a problem the</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.160" end="01:06:37.359" style="s2">bridge builders</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.520" end="01:06:38.640" style="s2">always get shot at from both sides</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.359" end="01:06:41.520" style="s2">exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.640" end="01:06:42.799" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah and it wasn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.520" end="01:06:44.880" style="s2">difficult until</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.799" end="01:06:48.079" style="s2">two years ago but now it&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.880" end="01:06:52.480" style="s2">difficult and 2020 is really the worst</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.079" end="01:06:52.480" style="s2">it&#39;s um you know the</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.960" end="01:07:00.559" style="s2">the how fast discussions get back</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.079" end="01:07:02.960" style="s2">right so one party on another side</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.559" end="01:07:04.160" style="s2">there&#39;s always somebody who takes</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.960" end="01:07:08.559" style="s2">umbrage</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.160" end="01:07:12.079" style="s2">and goes into full you know war</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.559" end="01:07:13.839" style="s2">mode that&#39;s that&#39;s painful</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.079" end="01:07:15.440" style="s2">and i&#39;m not sure how you&#39;re doing for</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.839" end="01:07:17.599" style="s2">time that like</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.440" end="01:07:19.039" style="s2">i&#39;m kind of there&#39;s two things that i</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.599" end="01:07:20.559" style="s2">know that yeah we can do another 20</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.039" end="01:07:23.599" style="s2">minutes maximum maybe and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.559" end="01:07:25.520" style="s2">yeah because</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.599" end="01:07:27.280" style="s2">in terms of experimenting with</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.520" end="01:07:29.359" style="s2">alternative systems i think it would be</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.280" end="01:07:32.559" style="s2">really interesting to hear you</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.359" end="01:07:34.000" style="s2">um summarize a little bit what happened</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.559" end="01:07:35.920" style="s2">in ecuador with flock</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.000" end="01:07:37.359" style="s2">and what you learned from it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.920" end="01:07:38.240" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing i would love to hear</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.359" end="01:07:40.319" style="s2">about okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.240" end="01:07:42.480" style="s2">and and then i know that you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.319" end="01:07:45.359" style="s2">doing a lot of work on urban commons</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.480" end="01:07:46.079" style="s2">and you started some really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.359" end="01:07:47.520" style="s2">work in</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.079" end="01:07:49.280" style="s2">belgium there&#39;s something called the</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.520" end="01:07:52.079" style="s2">factory or like where</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.280" end="01:07:53.599" style="s2">where you&#39;re repurposing it yeah i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.079" end="01:07:58.960" style="s2">give you the details yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.599" end="01:08:01.280" style="s2">the first project was in ecuador in 2014</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.960" end="01:08:02.290" style="s2">where three governmental institutions</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.280" end="01:08:03.680" style="s2">asked us to</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.290" end="01:08:05.440" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.680" end="01:08:07.680" style="s2">you know think about the role of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.440" end="01:08:09.760" style="s2">commons in development</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.680" end="01:08:11.119" style="s2">and so the way we went about it was this</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.760" end="01:08:14.079" style="s2">idea of like</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.119" end="01:08:15.039" style="s2">national knowledge commons uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.079" end="01:08:16.880" style="s2">agriculture</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.039" end="01:08:20.400" style="s2">industry learning i&#39;ll just give you one</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.880" end="01:08:23.679" style="s2">example if you&#39;re an indigenous youth</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.400" end="01:08:24.960" style="s2">in ecuador you have to buy like a 70</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.679" end="01:08:28.640" style="s2">dollar</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.960" end="01:08:30.080" style="s2">textbook and you have to because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.640" end="01:08:32.719" style="s2">question of prestige</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.080" end="01:08:34.640" style="s2">like uh you know they&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.719" end="01:08:36.640" style="s2">second-class citizens</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.640" end="01:08:39.279" style="s2">and if you come to the class with you</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.640" end="01:08:43.040" style="s2">know not good clothes and an old</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.279" end="01:08:46.799" style="s2">textbook then like</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.040" end="01:08:46.799" style="s2">you know you feel it right so</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.960" end="01:08:52.400" style="s2">instead we could have a a national</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.159" end="01:08:53.759" style="s2">system of textbooks collectively</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.400" end="01:08:56.560" style="s2">produced by teachers</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.759" end="01:08:57.440" style="s2">in with creative commons licenses and if</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.560" end="01:09:00.480" style="s2">anybody needs</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.440" end="01:09:02.640" style="s2">you know the latest updates um</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.480" end="01:09:03.520" style="s2">you just print it out you know and add</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.640" end="01:09:06.400" style="s2">it in some</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.520" end="01:09:06.880" style="s2">some i don&#39;t know some way that that</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.400" end="01:09:09.120" style="s2">allows</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.880" end="01:09:11.600" style="s2">you to do this right so instead of</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.120" end="01:09:13.679" style="s2">paying 70 you pay 15 and you always have</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.600" end="01:09:15.040" style="s2">the most updated version</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.679" end="01:09:16.719" style="s2">because of course what these companies</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.040" end="01:09:18.400" style="s2">are doing is they just change changing</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.719" end="01:09:20.080" style="s2">three pages</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.400" end="01:09:21.920" style="s2">right and this but they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.080" end="01:09:24.400" style="s2">producing a new</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.920" end="01:09:25.679" style="s2">a new version and everybody feels forced</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.400" end="01:09:27.120" style="s2">to buy them</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.679" end="01:09:28.960" style="s2">so imagine you know this you know in</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.120" end="01:09:32.880" style="s2">different sectors now</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.960" end="01:09:36.080" style="s2">unfortunately um</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.880" end="01:09:37.520" style="s2">the national government uh was very</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.080" end="01:09:39.120" style="s2">split about this</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.520" end="01:09:42.000" style="s2">and in the end the faction that</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.120" end="01:09:44.400" style="s2">supported us lost</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.000" end="01:09:45.679" style="s2">um and you know they went full</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.400" end="01:09:49.040" style="s2">extractive</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.679" end="01:09:49.679" style="s2">mode and then korea was kind of chased</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.040" end="01:09:52.239" style="s2">away and</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.679" end="01:09:53.600" style="s2">and his successor did a very neoliberal</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.239" end="01:09:56.320" style="s2">policy</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.600" end="01:09:57.120" style="s2">um so in that sense it wasn&#39;t a big</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.320" end="01:09:59.280" style="s2">success but it</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.120" end="01:10:00.480" style="s2">it went to some local places and there</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.280" end="01:10:02.800" style="s2">was one</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.480" end="01:10:04.000" style="s2">mayor in sigjos which is uh the largest</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.800" end="01:10:06.159" style="s2">district</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.000" end="01:10:08.320" style="s2">you know so we collaborated uh some of</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.159" end="01:10:13.600" style="s2">our research team went there and</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.320" end="01:10:16.159" style="s2">uh created the three production commons</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.600" end="01:10:17.520" style="s2">in that you know very poor indigenous</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.159" end="01:10:21.280" style="s2">area</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.520" end="01:10:23.520" style="s2">um so the way i react to this you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.280" end="01:10:25.440" style="s2">okay i&#39;m not i&#39;m a consultant but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.520" end="01:10:27.520" style="s2">not an activist so i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.440" end="01:10:30.320" style="s2">push you know this is the work you asked</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.520" end="01:10:32.320" style="s2">us to do this is what we do</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.320" end="01:10:33.520" style="s2">but i think the concepts once they are</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.320" end="01:10:36.880" style="s2">explicit</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.520" end="01:10:38.320" style="s2">they they start traveling</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.880" end="01:10:41.120" style="s2">so you know like something like the</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.320" end="01:10:43.679" style="s2">partner state concept</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.120" end="01:10:45.280" style="s2">uh is now you know part of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.679" end="01:10:48.320" style="s2">scientific literature you can find</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.280" end="01:10:48.320" style="s2">hundreds of references</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.800" end="01:10:51.840" style="s2">i&#39;m not familiar with that partners so</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.320" end="01:10:53.840" style="s2">the idea of a partner state</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.840" end="01:10:55.120" style="s2">is you know so you have a common-centric</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.840" end="01:10:57.679" style="s2">society with a productive</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.120" end="01:10:58.400" style="s2">society you have a generative economy</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.679" end="01:11:02.320" style="s2">and you have</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.400" end="01:11:04.080" style="s2">a facilitating state</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.320" end="01:11:06.719" style="s2">so it works through public commons</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.080" end="01:11:08.960" style="s2">protocols like in bologna</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.719" end="01:11:10.840" style="s2">they created the bologna regulation for</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.960" end="01:11:12.080" style="s2">the care and regeneration of the urban</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.840" end="01:11:14.800" style="s2">commons</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.080" end="01:11:16.000" style="s2">it has been copied by 250 italian cities</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.800" end="01:11:18.800" style="s2">it&#39;s mobilizing</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.000" end="01:11:20.960" style="s2">one million people in italy to work on</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.800" end="01:11:22.560" style="s2">urban commons</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.960" end="01:11:24.880" style="s2">right so it&#39;s by creating an</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.560" end="01:11:26.560" style="s2">institutional design that that smooths</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.880" end="01:11:28.159" style="s2">the cooperation</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.560" end="01:11:29.679" style="s2">between the commoners and the public</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.159" end="01:11:31.840" style="s2">authority</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.679" end="01:11:33.679" style="s2">and as you know ostrom said no comments</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.840" end="01:11:34.880" style="s2">can be successful</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.679" end="01:11:37.120" style="s2">if it doesn&#39;t have some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.880" end="01:11:38.480" style="s2">agreement with the public authority</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.120" end="01:11:40.320" style="s2">because otherwise the police can come in</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.480" end="01:11:43.040" style="s2">and close you down anytime</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.320" end="01:11:44.080" style="s2">so you know that&#39;s the reality it also</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.040" end="01:11:47.120" style="s2">sounds like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.080" end="01:11:50.320" style="s2">it&#39;s the instrument to</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.120" end="01:11:51.199" style="s2">make subsidiarity a reality yeah because</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.320" end="01:11:53.520" style="s2">i mean think about</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.199" end="01:11:55.679" style="s2">kovit 19 so you know the state and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.520" end="01:11:58.800" style="s2">market were failing to produce</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.679" end="01:12:00.719" style="s2">you know all these medical hardware</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.800" end="01:12:02.560" style="s2">and you have a massive mobilization of</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.719" end="01:12:04.159" style="s2">maker movements which you know came</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.560" end="01:12:06.159" style="s2">really to the fore</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.159" end="01:12:08.000" style="s2">but they had a lot of problems because</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.159" end="01:12:11.520" style="s2">the the other side wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.000" end="01:12:12.400" style="s2">ready had no processes to accept or not</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.520" end="01:12:14.719" style="s2">accept</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.400" end="01:12:15.760" style="s2">yeah to coordinate with good quality</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.719" end="01:12:17.760" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.760" end="01:12:19.760" style="s2">so then what happened was that in france</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.760" end="01:12:22.159" style="s2">the public hospitals</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.760" end="01:12:23.920" style="s2">around paris actually created their own</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.159" end="01:12:27.120" style="s2">you know partner state</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.920" end="01:12:29.520" style="s2">kind of protocol where they they</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.120" end="01:12:32.800" style="s2">invented the system to you know check</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.520" end="01:12:34.480" style="s2">the input and accept it</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.800" end="01:12:36.080" style="s2">and i think this is a very important you</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.480" end="01:12:38.400" style="s2">know institutional reform that needs to</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.080" end="01:12:40.400" style="s2">happen in the whole world</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.400" end="01:12:41.440" style="s2">that because the thing is in that the</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.400" end="01:12:44.480" style="s2">old welfare model</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.440" end="01:12:46.960" style="s2">it&#39;s the state and the market right and</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.480" end="01:12:50.159" style="s2">the state</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.960" end="01:12:52.880" style="s2">is a bit paternalistic so it provides</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.159" end="01:12:53.199" style="s2">services that are consumed by citizens</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.880" end="01:12:55.199" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.199" end="01:12:56.960" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really allow for</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.199" end="01:13:00.400" style="s2">co-production</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.960" end="01:13:02.880" style="s2">uh and you know autonomy so the partner</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.400" end="01:13:05.280" style="s2">state is a whole set of ideas</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.880" end="01:13:06.400" style="s2">about how we can uh adapt the state form</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.280" end="01:13:10.080" style="s2">so that it works for the</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.400" end="01:13:12.000" style="s2">the expansion of the commons how do you</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.080" end="01:13:14.320" style="s2">this makes me want to ask another</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.000" end="01:13:14.320" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.080" end="01:13:22.400" style="s2">so much is being said about</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.960" end="01:13:22.880" style="s2">multi-stakeholder integration processes</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.400" end="01:13:25.600" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.880" end="01:13:27.280" style="s2">you get the cross-sector like the</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.600" end="01:13:29.360" style="s2">traditional three sectors yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.280" end="01:13:30.640" style="s2">and i i often find that maybe maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.360" end="01:13:32.960" style="s2">the whole</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.640" end="01:13:35.040" style="s2">thought form the organizing idea of</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.960" end="01:13:38.000" style="s2">thinking in three sectors</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.040" end="01:13:38.800" style="s2">actually keeps us trapped um because</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.000" end="01:13:41.600" style="s2">they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.800" end="01:13:42.080" style="s2">exclusive circles like everybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.600" end="01:13:44.320" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.080" end="01:13:47.040" style="s2">the public sector or the private sector</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.320" end="01:13:48.480" style="s2">is actually also a member of the third</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.040" end="01:13:50.080" style="s2">sector by</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.480" end="01:13:52.560" style="s2">just being that&#39;s true and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.080" end="01:13:54.080" style="s2">about exactly</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.560" end="01:13:56.719" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things that we found</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.080" end="01:13:58.480" style="s2">in ghent is that</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.719" end="01:14:00.000" style="s2">you know almost all the urban commons</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.480" end="01:14:04.239" style="s2">they were supported by public</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.000" end="01:14:04.239" style="s2">officials but</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.560" end="01:14:11.280" style="s2">almost like unofficially right</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.960" end="01:14:13.440" style="s2">but personally i think if it&#39;s official</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.280" end="01:14:14.960" style="s2">and and with protocols it would</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.440" end="01:14:17.199" style="s2">you know it would allow them to go much</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.960" end="01:14:20.239" style="s2">faster and scale up a lot of things</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.199" end="01:14:21.440" style="s2">right um because don&#39;t forget you have</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.239" end="01:14:23.440" style="s2">two sides right you</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.440" end="01:14:24.719" style="s2">you are you know you and me we can be</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.440" end="01:14:28.239" style="s2">very uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.719" end="01:14:31.040" style="s2">at home in informal processes</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.239" end="01:14:33.199" style="s2">and do a lot of things bottom up but</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.040" end="01:14:35.199" style="s2">then once you face these institutions</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.199" end="01:14:37.920" style="s2">they are not like you</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.199" end="01:14:39.760" style="s2">they want to control everything so</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.920" end="01:14:42.320" style="s2">that&#39;s where all these compromises come</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.760" end="01:14:45.360" style="s2">in you know you use the language</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.320" end="01:14:46.560" style="s2">that they can understand and and live</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.360" end="01:14:49.199" style="s2">with and work with</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.560" end="01:14:50.560" style="s2">and so it&#39;s kind of a mutual adaptation</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.199" end="01:14:52.320" style="s2">i i personally think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.560" end="01:14:54.840" style="s2">inevitable otherwise we don&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.320" end="01:14:56.159" style="s2">progress because otherwise you just get</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.840" end="01:14:58.239" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.159" end="01:15:00.239" style="s2">i still believe in the state you know so</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.239" end="01:15:03.520" style="s2">let&#39;s take an example you have</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.239" end="01:15:05.360" style="s2">social welfare it was an invention of</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.520" end="01:15:08.719" style="s2">the labor movement</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.360" end="01:15:11.600" style="s2">right since the um the labor aristocracy</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.719" end="01:15:13.040" style="s2">which had this memory of the guilds</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.600" end="01:15:16.480" style="s2">which created these</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.040" end="01:15:17.920" style="s2">solidarity mechanisms the social commons</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.480" end="01:15:19.679" style="s2">and then once the labour was strong</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.920" end="01:15:24.000" style="s2">enough the state took it over you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.679" end="01:15:24.720" style="s2">beverage model and the bismarck model</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.000" end="01:15:27.040" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.720" end="01:15:29.199" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.040" end="01:15:31.360" style="s2">what we lost then was the commoning and</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.199" end="01:15:34.480" style="s2">the autonomy but what we gained was 100</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.360" end="01:15:36.400" style="s2">percent rights for everyone</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.480" end="01:15:38.560" style="s2">right you you go from a situation where</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.400" end="01:15:41.760" style="s2">only 20 percent population</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.560" end="01:15:43.120" style="s2">is able to actually do this</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.760" end="01:15:44.880" style="s2">to a situation where it becomes a</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.120" end="01:15:47.920" style="s2">guaranteed right of every citizen i</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.880" end="01:15:51.520" style="s2">think that&#39;s progress personally right</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.920" end="01:15:54.719" style="s2">um so that&#39;s why i think the the the</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.520" end="01:15:57.120" style="s2">good institution has as a function</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.719" end="01:15:58.560" style="s2">something that you know represents the</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.120" end="01:16:00.800" style="s2">common interest of all the people in</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.560" end="01:16:02.719" style="s2">given territory</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.800" end="01:16:05.760" style="s2">but what i&#39;m trying to add to this story</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.719" end="01:16:08.159" style="s2">is that we now have all these flows</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.760" end="01:16:09.679" style="s2">and they also need to be part of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.159" end="01:16:11.679" style="s2">picture</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.679" end="01:16:12.800" style="s2">right so typically somebody like me i</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.679" end="01:16:16.400" style="s2">leave belgium</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.800" end="01:16:19.280" style="s2">i lose all my welfare benefits</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.400" end="01:16:21.280" style="s2">because there&#39;s no no recognition by the</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.280" end="01:16:22.880" style="s2">territorial</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.280" end="01:16:24.960" style="s2">that we are now living with global</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.880" end="01:16:28.560" style="s2">networks you know they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.960" end="01:16:29.840" style="s2">they can&#39;t see it so this is what we</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.560" end="01:16:33.120" style="s2">need to work on is</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.840" end="01:16:34.159" style="s2">creating hybrid adaptations where the</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.120" end="01:16:37.920" style="s2">trans local</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.159" end="01:16:38.320" style="s2">and the transnational can start to work</p>

<p begin="01:16:38.320" end="01:16:43.040" style="s2">the territorial and they can both enrich</p>

<p begin="01:16:43.760" end="01:16:48.560" style="s2">and is that like the the recent work</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.400" end="01:16:51.280" style="s2">that you&#39;re doing in belgium and that</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.560" end="01:16:51.840" style="s2">now got slowed down by by the pandemic</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.280" end="01:16:54.880" style="s2">and</p>

<p begin="01:17:03.040" end="01:17:06.080" style="s2">because i don&#39;t know if you know much</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.719" end="01:17:09.840" style="s2">about it but</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.080" end="01:17:11.120" style="s2">so as a freelancer you join them</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.840" end="01:17:12.960" style="s2">and they will do something called</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.120" end="01:17:16.159" style="s2">factoring which normally was done</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.960" end="01:17:18.080" style="s2">in the past by private companies</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.159" end="01:17:20.159" style="s2">so you put two percent of your wage in a</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.080" end="01:17:21.199" style="s2">common pot that allows them to pay you</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.159" end="01:17:24.000" style="s2">within seven days</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.199" end="01:17:25.440" style="s2">which is a huge thing for a freelancer</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.000" end="01:17:27.679" style="s2">you normally have to wait</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.440" end="01:17:29.199" style="s2">at least three months for payment on</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.679" end="01:17:30.800" style="s2">average</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.199" end="01:17:32.800" style="s2">and then after six months they create a</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.800" end="01:17:34.640" style="s2">second account</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.800" end="01:17:36.719" style="s2">and it calculates what kind of salary</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.640" end="01:17:39.520" style="s2">you can pay yourself</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.719" end="01:17:41.520" style="s2">right then you become an employee of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.520" end="01:17:43.920" style="s2">co-op</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.520" end="01:17:45.679" style="s2">and you are actually a salaried worker</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.920" end="01:17:47.199" style="s2">with all the protections of the welfare</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.679" end="01:17:48.640" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.199" end="01:17:50.560" style="s2">i think this is a brilliant hack and i</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.640" end="01:17:51.520" style="s2">call it autonomous worker because in</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.560" end="01:17:54.000" style="s2">this system</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.520" end="01:17:54.960" style="s2">you&#39;re both free like you can follow</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.000" end="01:17:57.520" style="s2">your passions</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.960" end="01:17:58.800" style="s2">and choose your employer and choose your</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.520" end="01:18:00.960" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.800" end="01:18:01.920" style="s2">and you are also a worker with who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.960" end="01:18:05.920" style="s2">protected by</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.920" end="01:18:09.040" style="s2">by the by the state um</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.920" end="01:18:10.400" style="s2">so i&#39;ve been working on things like</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.040" end="01:18:13.760" style="s2">sustainable well-being</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.400" end="01:18:15.120" style="s2">and you know so but for example this</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.760" end="01:18:17.679" style="s2">idea i just</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.120" end="01:18:19.840" style="s2">explained to you that&#39;s that&#39;s not not</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.679" end="01:18:22.320" style="s2">there yet</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.840" end="01:18:23.920" style="s2">so i wanted basically my idea was to</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.320" end="01:18:25.840" style="s2">create a container</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.920" end="01:18:26.960" style="s2">like the estonia e-government model</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.840" end="01:18:29.920" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.960" end="01:18:31.199" style="s2">so i&#39;m a belgian in thailand i can join</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.920" end="01:18:34.080" style="s2">the container</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.199" end="01:18:35.760" style="s2">of thailand but then it translates into</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.080" end="01:18:38.480" style="s2">my belgian</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.760" end="01:18:38.480" style="s2">legal system</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.880" end="01:18:41.840" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.080" end="01:18:45.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a shift in consciousness right is</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.320" end="01:18:48.159" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.840" end="01:18:49.760" style="s2">to know that the trans local is just as</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.159" end="01:18:51.280" style="s2">important as the purely</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.760" end="01:18:52.960" style="s2">territory and this is my critique on</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.280" end="01:18:55.520" style="s2">localization</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.960" end="01:18:56.159" style="s2">is that it&#39;s sometimes too regressive</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.520" end="01:18:58.640" style="s2">and you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.159" end="01:19:00.080" style="s2">as an absolute agreement yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.640" end="01:19:03.280" style="s2">absolutely i mean it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.080" end="01:19:05.840" style="s2">because the danger um also politically</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.280" end="01:19:05.840" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.719" end="01:19:10.640" style="s2">as we&#39;re seeing this polarization at the</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.800" end="01:19:13.840" style="s2">moment what&#39;s beginning to happen</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.640" end="01:19:15.199" style="s2">is that you get two very very different</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.840" end="01:19:17.520" style="s2">groups talking about</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.199" end="01:19:19.760" style="s2">bioregionalism and localization right</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.520" end="01:19:21.760" style="s2">and for very very different motives</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.760" end="01:19:23.440" style="s2">and one of them is kind of living within</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.760" end="01:19:24.880" style="s2">the planetary boundaries and creating</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.440" end="01:19:27.520" style="s2">more community and</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.880" end="01:19:29.600" style="s2">and and sees it as a movement that is in</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.520" end="01:19:31.679" style="s2">global solidarity enabling other</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.600" end="01:19:34.640" style="s2">bioregions to do the same</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.679" end="01:19:37.120" style="s2">and basically refitting the human impact</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.640" end="01:19:38.880" style="s2">on earth by a physical reality of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.120" end="01:19:40.960" style="s2">region that people inhabit</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.880" end="01:19:41.920" style="s2">that&#39;s one side and the other side is is</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.960" end="01:19:43.520" style="s2">a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.920" end="01:19:45.360" style="s2">and the world&#39;s going to like that</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.520" end="01:19:47.920" style="s2">there&#39;s more diversity there or there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.360" end="01:19:52.320" style="s2">a lot of diversity in that group from</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.920" end="01:19:55.679" style="s2">ultra right-wing kind of um</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.320" end="01:19:58.239" style="s2">protective and sometimes xenophobic</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.679" end="01:20:00.880" style="s2">exactly localization yeah yeah this is a</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.239" end="01:20:04.960" style="s2">big big issue</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.880" end="01:20:06.639" style="s2">um yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.960" end="01:20:08.320" style="s2">you know i&#39;m also much in favor of this</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.639" end="01:20:11.360" style="s2">kind of planetary thing right</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.320" end="01:20:14.320" style="s2">which is like planetary guilds</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.360" end="01:20:15.120" style="s2">uh where like you know workers could</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.320" end="01:20:18.800" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.120" end="01:20:21.120" style="s2">organize themselves you know on a</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.800" end="01:20:23.920" style="s2">trans national transnational right so</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.120" end="01:20:26.239" style="s2">i&#39;m not talking about international</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.920" end="01:20:27.920" style="s2">because that&#39;s what most people think or</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.239" end="01:20:30.840" style="s2">international you know wh</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.920" end="01:20:32.719" style="s2">no no no we&#39;re talking about native</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.840" end="01:20:35.440" style="s2">digital</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.719" end="01:20:36.639" style="s2">you know trans local organization forms</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.440" end="01:20:38.960" style="s2">of organization</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.639" end="01:20:40.400" style="s2">like a guild in the middle ages where</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.960" end="01:20:42.719" style="s2">you know the cathedral workers would</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.400" end="01:20:42.719" style="s2">travel</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.040" end="01:20:46.400" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting that&#39;s what i want to</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.400" end="01:20:47.679" style="s2">see actually the the analogy to the</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.400" end="01:20:49.120" style="s2">middle ages is actually really</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.679" end="01:20:51.440" style="s2">interesting because in the middle ages</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.120" end="01:20:52.159" style="s2">we didn&#39;t really we were just starting</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.440" end="01:20:54.159" style="s2">to form</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.159" end="01:20:55.920" style="s2">those socio-political entities that we</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.159" end="01:20:59.040" style="s2">now call nation states</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.920" end="01:21:01.360" style="s2">yeah and um to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.040" end="01:21:03.840" style="s2">most of the ones that people are now so</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.360" end="01:21:06.480" style="s2">enamored with the ones that the</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.840" end="01:21:08.960" style="s2">political leaders like to say dot dot</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.480" end="01:21:12.560" style="s2">dot first</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.960" end="01:21:15.360" style="s2">are basically</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.560" end="01:21:15.840" style="s2">structurally power over systems they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.360" end="01:21:17.360" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.840" end="01:21:19.040" style="s2">power with they&#39;re not shared power</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.360" end="01:21:22.719" style="s2">systems and</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.040" end="01:21:24.239" style="s2">um while it&#39;s very difficult and again</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.719" end="01:21:26.239" style="s2">it&#39;s not at both end and</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.239" end="01:21:28.719" style="s2">there will be a long transition but my</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.239" end="01:21:32.320" style="s2">sense is that if we want to</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.719" end="01:21:34.080" style="s2">refit the human presence on earth</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.320" end="01:21:36.159" style="s2">to the boundaries of a planet with a</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.080" end="01:21:38.480" style="s2">biosphere</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.159" end="01:21:39.760" style="s2">we can do that at the bioregional scale</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.480" end="01:21:42.960" style="s2">where bioregions</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.760" end="01:21:44.560" style="s2">and watersheds have a physical reality</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.960" end="01:21:47.120" style="s2">context within which we</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.560" end="01:21:48.159" style="s2">know how to how to a b of healing</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.120" end="01:21:50.639" style="s2">influence like to</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.159" end="01:21:51.920" style="s2">how to be restorers regenerators and and</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.639" end="01:21:53.840" style="s2">and healers</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.920" end="01:21:55.760" style="s2">to the ecosystem and the social system</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.840" end="01:21:56.639" style="s2">and and the local economy or regional</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.760" end="01:22:00.880" style="s2">economy</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.639" end="01:22:04.000" style="s2">but we all we also need</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.880" end="01:22:06.159" style="s2">the global coordination solidarity</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.000" end="01:22:08.000" style="s2">peer-to-peer knowledge exchange i like</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.159" end="01:22:09.040" style="s2">the way that you simplified it by saying</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.000" end="01:22:12.400" style="s2">if it&#39;s heavy</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.040" end="01:22:16.800" style="s2">it stays in the region it travels great</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.400" end="01:22:19.360" style="s2">um the nation state in that game</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.800" end="01:22:21.760" style="s2">to my mind has only one role which is to</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.360" end="01:22:25.360" style="s2">smooth the transition</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.760" end="01:22:27.199" style="s2">ideally yes i i fear</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.360" end="01:22:29.440" style="s2">that in the short term that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.199" end="01:22:30.560" style="s2">gonna happen like that so</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.440" end="01:22:32.719" style="s2">you know a lot of people think the</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.560" end="01:22:34.400" style="s2">nation city will disappear</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.719" end="01:22:36.080" style="s2">i think in the short term it will</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.400" end="01:22:38.080" style="s2">strengthen</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.080" end="01:22:40.080" style="s2">uh it&#39;s like a natural protective</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.080" end="01:22:42.800" style="s2">reaction right</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.080" end="01:22:44.480" style="s2">uh a lot of you know let&#39;s call them the</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.800" end="01:22:47.360" style="s2">na the original native</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.480" end="01:22:49.360" style="s2">workers they feel victimized by</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.360" end="01:22:51.679" style="s2">globalization</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.360" end="01:22:53.120" style="s2">uh but even by migration that might be</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.679" end="01:22:55.199" style="s2">right or wrong but that&#39;s what you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.120" end="01:22:57.360" style="s2">that&#39;s what they feel</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.199" end="01:22:59.679" style="s2">and the left has become the party of the</p>

<p begin="01:22:59.679" end="01:23:04.719" style="s2">uh urban people</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.800" end="01:23:06.480" style="s2">so we&#39;re seeing this split right now</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.719" end="01:23:08.320" style="s2">whereas you know the right-wing populist</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.480" end="01:23:11.280" style="s2">is the merchant class</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.320" end="01:23:12.000" style="s2">has convinced the working class that</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.280" end="01:23:14.159" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.000" end="01:23:15.440" style="s2">can protect themselves as a on on a</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.159" end="01:23:18.320" style="s2">nation-state basis</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.440" end="01:23:19.110" style="s2">right and so i i see this happening</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.320" end="01:23:20.320" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.110" end="01:23:23.120" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.320" end="01:23:23.120" style="s2">at least for a while</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.760" end="01:23:27.280" style="s2">the problem with that is of course that</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.600" end="01:23:29.360" style="s2">they&#39;re going to enter into very</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.280" end="01:23:33.040" style="s2">competitive</p>

<p begin="01:23:33.760" end="01:23:36.960" style="s2">and they&#39;re gonna see that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.360" end="01:23:39.520" style="s2">working and and so</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.960" end="01:23:40.800" style="s2">basically unfortunately i think we need</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.520" end="01:23:43.920" style="s2">to go through these</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.800" end="01:23:44.719" style="s2">pedagogical catastrophes before we get</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.920" end="01:23:47.360" style="s2">something better</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.719" end="01:23:48.560" style="s2">that just out of some kind of realism</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.360" end="01:23:50.320" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t see the state</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.560" end="01:23:52.480" style="s2">disappearing on the country these people</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.320" end="01:23:54.880" style="s2">want to strengthen it</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.480" end="01:23:57.280" style="s2">but i think fundamentally you know that</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.880" end="01:23:59.520" style="s2">this is not a way forward</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.280" end="01:24:03.040" style="s2">to solve a number of really serious</p>

<p begin="01:24:03.040" end="01:24:09.440" style="s2">um but you know we don&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.280" end="01:24:10.400" style="s2">live in the politics that we want yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.440" end="01:24:13.440" style="s2">no it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.400" end="01:24:16.960" style="s2">work in progress and that&#39;s why and and</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.440" end="01:24:19.199" style="s2">our lifespans are too short to really</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.960" end="01:24:21.360" style="s2">comprehend transitions because</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.199" end="01:24:23.920" style="s2">transitions don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.360" end="01:24:24.880" style="s2">care about the fact that we only live 70</p>

<p begin="01:24:28.159" end="01:24:33.440" style="s2">very fast a lot of them like we</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.480" end="01:24:34.480" style="s2">all our lives have been in a transition</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.440" end="01:24:36.719" style="s2">for us</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.480" end="01:24:38.159" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s only visible so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.719" end="01:24:40.800" style="s2">probably familiar with</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.159" end="01:24:42.080" style="s2">and i think we we need to stop but just</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.800" end="01:24:43.520" style="s2">finish maybe with this</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.080" end="01:24:45.280" style="s2">you&#39;re probably familiar with you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.520" end="01:24:47.440" style="s2">the game b group with daniel</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.280" end="01:24:49.679" style="s2">schmuckenberg and jordan hall</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.440" end="01:24:51.120" style="s2">and i had a conversation with daniel uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.679" end="01:24:52.480" style="s2">last week</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.120" end="01:24:54.239" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know how he comes to this</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.480" end="01:24:54.800" style="s2">conclusion but i was really intrigued he</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.239" end="01:24:58.320" style="s2">says you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.800" end="01:25:01.840" style="s2">we need now we have one generation</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.320" end="01:25:04.239" style="s2">to create a framework for the change in</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.840" end="01:25:07.520" style="s2">three or four generations</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.239" end="01:25:09.040" style="s2">that&#39;s good um it&#39;s interesting i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.520" end="01:25:12.239" style="s2">still kind of saying like</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.040" end="01:25:15.199" style="s2">i don&#39;t think we have that much time but</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.239" end="01:25:16.800" style="s2">who knows right so i&#39;m i didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.199" end="01:25:18.639" style="s2">time to explore it further but i think</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.800" end="01:25:19.920" style="s2">that was an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.639" end="01:25:21.440" style="s2">because you know that&#39;s why i&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.920" end="01:25:22.159" style="s2">now as we said in the beginning i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.440" end="01:25:25.440" style="s2">looking at</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.159" end="01:25:27.840" style="s2">those temporal rhythms uh</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.440" end="01:25:29.600" style="s2">you know these theories of history that</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.840" end="01:25:30.800" style="s2">it&#39;s called wave pulse theories that</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.600" end="01:25:34.000" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.800" end="01:25:34.800" style="s2">you know a succession of degradative</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.000" end="01:25:37.600" style="s2">extractive</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.800" end="01:25:39.040" style="s2">periods which lead to overuse and</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.600" end="01:25:42.560" style="s2">collapse and then create</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.040" end="01:25:44.719" style="s2">a postwar regenerative reaction</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.560" end="01:25:46.800" style="s2">where the commons is the core way to</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.719" end="01:25:48.719" style="s2">heal a society</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.800" end="01:25:50.560" style="s2">and i i think this is where we this is</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.719" end="01:25:53.199" style="s2">where we are at we are</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.560" end="01:25:55.840" style="s2">since 2008 an accumulation of downward</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.199" end="01:25:55.840" style="s2">spiral</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.920" end="01:26:00.880" style="s2">and at the same time all these germs are</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.840" end="01:26:03.520" style="s2">coming up because people have to</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.880" end="01:26:04.480" style="s2">and so we&#39;re both going through the</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.520" end="01:26:06.560" style="s2">degradation</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.480" end="01:26:08.719" style="s2">and the regeneration at this stage at</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.560" end="01:26:11.600" style="s2">the same time</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.719" end="01:26:12.800" style="s2">right yeah no i i i exactly it&#39;s a both</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.600" end="01:26:14.560" style="s2">hand we&#39;re in the middle of</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.800" end="01:26:16.560" style="s2">course the degeneration is much bigger</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.560" end="01:26:18.639" style="s2">than regeneration that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.560" end="01:26:20.000" style="s2">that&#39;s problematic but i mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.639" end="01:26:23.760" style="s2">just very briefly the</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.000" end="01:26:27.040" style="s2">the adaptive cycle in in zillions theory</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.760" end="01:26:28.800" style="s2">um i&#39;ll send you the link afterwards a</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.040" end="01:26:30.639" style="s2">friend of mine tobias luther from the</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.800" end="01:26:33.120" style="s2">itaha in in zurich</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.639" end="01:26:34.639" style="s2">has um turned that into rather than</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.120" end="01:26:36.320" style="s2">keeping it in the loop</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.639" end="01:26:38.560" style="s2">and it turned it into what he calls</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.320" end="01:26:39.600" style="s2">adaptive waves but with the same phases</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.560" end="01:26:42.400" style="s2">in it</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.600" end="01:26:43.679" style="s2">and the key bit is the to recognize that</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.400" end="01:26:47.280" style="s2">collapse and breakdown</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.679" end="01:26:50.000" style="s2">is actually part of the undoing of</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.280" end="01:26:52.000" style="s2">structures that no longer serve</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.000" end="01:26:53.520" style="s2">new alternatives to even have a chance</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.000" end="01:26:55.520" style="s2">exactly and that&#39;s what peter pagani</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.520" end="01:26:59.040" style="s2">says right he describes the crystal</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.520" end="01:27:01.040" style="s2">uh you know the snow crystal</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.040" end="01:27:03.679" style="s2">uh it has to disintegrate before it</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.040" end="01:27:05.440" style="s2">becomes rain</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.679" end="01:27:07.280" style="s2">it&#39;s you know there&#39;s no evolution there</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.440" end="01:27:10.400" style="s2">it&#39;s really a breakdown</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.280" end="01:27:10.400" style="s2">and reconstitution</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.800" end="01:27:14.080" style="s2">well i know you&#39;re right so this has</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.199" end="01:27:16.000" style="s2">been wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.080" end="01:27:17.520" style="s2">and we could go on yeah thank you daniel</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.000" end="01:27:19.760" style="s2">yeah um well</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.520" end="01:27:20.639" style="s2">and enjoy that make the most of being</p>

<p begin="01:27:20.639" end="01:27:24.400" style="s2">and yes it&#39;s nice not to travel for a</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.840" end="01:27:26.000" style="s2">while i</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.400" end="01:27:27.600" style="s2">i heard myself yeah yeah yeah yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.000" end="01:27:29.760" style="s2">traveled so much and</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.600" end="01:27:32.320" style="s2">and now i&#39;m trying to make the ball the</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.760" end="01:27:34.639" style="s2">best yeah yeah it makes you slow down</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.320" end="01:27:36.560" style="s2">but i i do hope we we share the same</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.639" end="01:27:38.880" style="s2">physical space again sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.560" end="01:27:40.080" style="s2">yes i do too yeah all right okay thank</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.880" end="01:27:47.360" style="s2">you danielle thank you</p>
