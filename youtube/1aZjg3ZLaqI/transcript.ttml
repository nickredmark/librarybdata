<p begin="00:01:17.400" end="00:01:23.040" style="s2">masculine and there are all of these</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.630" end="00:01:25.680" style="s2">symptoms out there in today&#39;s culture</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.040" end="00:01:27.900" style="s2">that are showing men falling behind and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.680" end="00:01:30.570" style="s2">how feminism is attacking men and making</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.900" end="00:01:32.369" style="s2">them feel somehow inadequate and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.570" end="00:01:35.850" style="s2">their unwanted by their culture in their</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.369" end="00:01:39.299" style="s2">society and both she and Dave referenced</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.850" end="00:01:41.189" style="s2">Jordan Peterson as somebody who is</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.299" end="00:01:42.869" style="s2">tackling this issue and getting out</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.189" end="00:01:46.170" style="s2">there and talking to thousands of people</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.869" end="00:01:48.180" style="s2">about how men especially young men who</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.170" end="00:01:51.540" style="s2">are feeling lost in today&#39;s society can</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.180" end="00:01:54.229" style="s2">can find their way and what they can do</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.540" end="00:01:57.710" style="s2">it in order to improve themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.229" end="00:02:00.960" style="s2">you know what I what struck me was that</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.710" end="00:02:02.219" style="s2">listening to Jordan Peterson I know that</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.960" end="00:02:04.530" style="s2">like one of the main things that he</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.219" end="00:02:05.909" style="s2">wants you know people to do is to clean</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.530" end="00:02:06.380" style="s2">up their room and to get their act</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.909" end="00:02:08.810" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.380" end="00:02:11.030" style="s2">and to start you know being productive</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.810" end="00:02:12.470" style="s2">you know in their own lives and to</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.030" end="00:02:15.709" style="s2">really take care of themselves before</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.470" end="00:02:17.300" style="s2">they they move forward but beyond that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.709" end="00:02:19.190" style="s2">don&#39;t think Jordan Pearson necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.300" end="00:02:22.910" style="s2">has the prescriptive ideas that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.190" end="00:02:24.530" style="s2">gonna help men rise up and and take</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.910" end="00:02:25.940" style="s2">responsibility for themselves and take</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.530" end="00:02:29.030" style="s2">responsibility for their life and find a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.940" end="00:02:31.700" style="s2">way to create a life that is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.030" end="00:02:35.330" style="s2">fruitful and be pleasurable and be you</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.700" end="00:02:36.590" style="s2">know of utility to society and you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.330" end="00:02:38.239" style="s2">I&#39;ve listened to Jordan Pearson for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.590" end="00:02:41.330" style="s2">long time and I really respect the guy</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.239" end="00:02:44.090" style="s2">and his early podcast with Joe Rogan was</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.330" end="00:02:45.440" style="s2">was really an eye-opener for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.090" end="00:02:46.760" style="s2">people and you know I think we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.440" end="00:02:49.340" style="s2">indebted to him for spreading the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.760" end="00:02:52.640" style="s2">message but what I&#39;m finding with him is</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.340" end="00:02:55.040" style="s2">that there&#39;s a the bridge to an actual</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.640" end="00:02:56.060" style="s2">solution to these problems is hard to</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.040" end="00:02:59.180" style="s2">find and I don&#39;t think he necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.060" end="00:03:02.060" style="s2">has the answer and listening to this</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.180" end="00:03:05.030" style="s2">woman listening to Dave go on about how</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.060" end="00:03:07.040" style="s2">all these issues are there for men and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.030" end="00:03:10.220" style="s2">how feminism is really degrading</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.040" end="00:03:12.670" style="s2">masculinity they were sort of missing</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.220" end="00:03:14.480" style="s2">you know the the main point in the link</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.670" end="00:03:16.940" style="s2">to how we&#39;re going to solve this problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.480" end="00:03:18.500" style="s2">and you know I think it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.940" end="00:03:23.470" style="s2">surprising to me that feminists are</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.500" end="00:03:25.700" style="s2">surprised that there is a rising anti</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.470" end="00:03:29.480" style="s2">ideology to what they&#39;re pushing forth</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.700" end="00:03:32.299" style="s2">and what we&#39;ve seen over the last 10</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.480" end="00:03:33.890" style="s2">years in the vari for darkest corners</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.299" end="00:03:36.500" style="s2">and furthest reaches of the Internet has</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.890" end="00:03:39.799" style="s2">been a bubbling up of a men&#39;s movement</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.500" end="00:03:41.239" style="s2">that&#39;s not and I&#39;m not talking about men</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.799" end="00:03:42.739" style="s2">going their own way or men&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.239" end="00:03:44.390" style="s2">advocates or anything like that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.739" end="00:03:46.100" style="s2">talking about men getting together and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.390" end="00:03:48.079" style="s2">helping each other find a way in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.100" end="00:03:50.269" style="s2">new environment that is completely</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.079" end="00:03:53.570" style="s2">shaped by feminism the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.269" end="00:03:55.549" style="s2">imperative and you know culminating in</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.570" end="00:03:57.950" style="s2">what we saw just recently with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.549" end="00:04:00.410" style="s2">Cavanagh hearings where we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.950" end="00:04:02.810" style="s2">completely throwing out due process or</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.410" end="00:04:05.930" style="s2">completely throwing out the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.810" end="00:04:08.450" style="s2">were innocent until proven guilty and is</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.930" end="00:04:10.930" style="s2">all culmination of events that have been</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.450" end="00:04:13.040" style="s2">building up and and came through</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.930" end="00:04:15.079" style="s2">relationships and and through the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.040" end="00:04:17.120" style="s2">universities and now found its way all</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.079" end="00:04:18.790" style="s2">the way to the Supreme Court so for us</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.120" end="00:04:20.140" style="s2">to to acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.790" end="00:04:22.090" style="s2">what to do them before we have to come</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.140" end="00:04:23.770" style="s2">up with an antidote and the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.090" end="00:04:25.780" style="s2">to do is to accept that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.770" end="00:04:28.900" style="s2">problem and there is a there is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.780" end="00:04:31.990" style="s2">problem and it&#39;s now it&#39;s now left you</p>

<p begin="00:04:37.900" end="00:04:42.640" style="s2">all the way to the Supreme Court so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.600" end="00:04:44.320" style="s2">the feminists and radical feminist</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.640" end="00:04:47.230" style="s2">movement has created an environment in</p>

<p begin="00:04:47.230" end="00:04:51.550" style="s2">antidote and I&#39;ve been participating in</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.900" end="00:04:53.260" style="s2">you know the underground sort of men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.550" end="00:04:55.150" style="s2">movement for a number of years my</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.260" end="00:04:57.580" style="s2">initial writing is at Jack Murphy live</p>

<p begin="00:04:59.140" end="00:05:03.940" style="s2">male-female dynamics and then I began to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.240" end="00:05:06.490" style="s2">understand the philosophies behind them</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.940" end="00:05:08.290" style="s2">all I began to understand how feminism</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.490" end="00:05:11.170" style="s2">was degrading men and that because</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.290" end="00:05:13.360" style="s2">feminism believes that all cultures have</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.170" end="00:05:16.720" style="s2">been patriarchal and patriarchy is</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.360" end="00:05:19.000" style="s2">oppressive and the only way to to free</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.720" end="00:05:21.220" style="s2">women is to attack and degrade</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.000" end="00:05:24.520" style="s2">masculinity we&#39;re now seeing that taking</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.220" end="00:05:26.080" style="s2">place and the the men&#39;s movement that</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.520" end="00:05:29.020" style="s2">I&#39;ve been a part of is starting to</p>

<p begin="00:10:23.300" end="00:10:27.950" style="s2">a leader in is about ready to explode</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.280" end="00:10:29.270" style="s2">into the mainstream because not only are</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.950" end="00:10:32.120" style="s2">they picking up on the fact that we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:10:47.980" end="00:10:52.120" style="s2">problem you know five years ago if you</p>

<p begin="00:26:34.830" end="00:26:38.190" style="s2">mission and they need to put that</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.539" end="00:26:39.899" style="s2">mission first and they need to put their</p>

<p begin="00:28:28.549" end="00:28:33.260" style="s2">cabinet hearings where we see the power</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.740" end="00:28:34.850" style="s2">of radical feminism saying we need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.260" end="00:28:38.960" style="s2">believe all women just because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.850" end="00:28:42.169" style="s2">women okay they&#39;re saying that the truth</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:44.809" style="s2">objective reality is about what a woman</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.169" end="00:28:47.179" style="s2">says that should be terrifying for</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.809" end="00:28:49.250" style="s2">everyone because that means that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.179" end="00:28:51.289" style="s2">rule of law is done that means that</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.250" end="00:28:53.360" style="s2">evidence is done that means that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.289" end="00:28:56.179" style="s2">on the verge of like a reign of terror</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.360" end="00:28:57.710" style="s2">where all it takes is an accusation and</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.179" end="00:28:59.690" style="s2">a smear and you are done you are</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.710" end="00:29:01.730" style="s2">finished and I have lived this you know</p>

<p begin="00:29:01.730" end="00:29:07.130" style="s2">say this stuff but like the woman</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.280" end="00:29:08.870" style="s2">accused me of being a alright Nazi and</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.130" end="00:29:11.179" style="s2">what do you know I get fired a month</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.870" end="00:29:13.309" style="s2">later like even despite of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.179" end="00:29:14.750" style="s2">evidence even despite of the facts you</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.309" end="00:29:16.370" style="s2">have to believe all women is the new</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.750" end="00:29:19.039" style="s2">mantra so of course this country needs</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.370" end="00:29:21.409" style="s2">it and it&#39;s not just me saying that it</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.039" end="00:29:23.120" style="s2">we have the symptoms are out there men</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.409" end="00:29:25.960" style="s2">aren&#39;t going to college as much as women</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.120" end="00:29:28.429" style="s2">anymore men are falling behind in there</p>

<p begin="00:29:33.460" end="00:29:37.049" style="s2">mind the health is worse they&#39;re killing</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.260" end="00:29:39.400" style="s2">themselves at a higher rate than women</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.049" end="00:29:41.140" style="s2">this is pure two women need to</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.400" end="00:29:43.299" style="s2">stop this nonsense yeah I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.140" end="00:29:45.460" style="s2">that and so the evidence is out there</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.299" end="00:29:47.380" style="s2">and the rooms that Jordan Peterson fills</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.460" end="00:29:49.179" style="s2">with thousands of people in every city</p>

<p begin="00:30:52.809" end="00:30:56.710" style="s2">process of developing a positive</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.610" end="00:30:59.409" style="s2">masculinity that&#39;s gonna fight back and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.710" end="00:31:01.270" style="s2">that is gonna bring us hopefully back</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.409" end="00:31:03.039" style="s2">from the break from the direction that</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.270" end="00:31:05.320" style="s2">we&#39;re heading I mean haven&#39;t haven&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.039" end="00:31:06.640" style="s2">guys seen the trajectory that we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.320" end="00:31:09.580" style="s2">it&#39;s not getting any better</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.640" end="00:31:12.179" style="s2">you know radical feminism has permanent</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.580" end="00:31:15.220" style="s2">permeated every element of our life and</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.179" end="00:31:17.080" style="s2">it&#39;s so common the thinking the thought</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.220" end="00:31:18.789" style="s2">process now that it doesn&#39;t even seem</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.080" end="00:31:22.720" style="s2">strange anymore it&#39;s just widely</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.789" end="00:31:26.020" style="s2">accepted and this this trajectory is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.720" end="00:31:29.679" style="s2">going to slow down unless somebody puts</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.020" end="00:31:32.169" style="s2">up a fight now the whole entire premise</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.679" end="00:31:34.539" style="s2">of feminism and radical feminism these</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.169" end="00:31:35.650" style="s2">days is to destroy masculinity because</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.539" end="00:31:38.350" style="s2">masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.650" end="00:31:40.690" style="s2">is the basis for masculine power and</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.350" end="00:31:44.480" style="s2">masculine power to the rub to feminists</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.690" end="00:31:46.910" style="s2">is the basis for the patriarchy and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:48.710" style="s2">patriarchy is oppressive and women are</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.910" end="00:31:50.530" style="s2">oppressed right so that&#39;s their thought</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.710" end="00:31:52.820" style="s2">process so of course they have to attack</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.530" end="00:31:55.760" style="s2">masculinity and they&#39;ve done a very good</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.820" end="00:31:58.460" style="s2">job of it they&#39;ve done a very good job</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.760" end="00:32:02.270" style="s2">of it you know it doesn&#39;t take much</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.460" end="00:32:04.850" style="s2">observation to see that men in our world</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.270" end="00:32:08.690" style="s2">today especially our 20s and 30s</p>

<p begin="00:32:13.640" end="00:32:18.440" style="s2">and the radical feminism has been</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.860" end="00:32:21.799" style="s2">successful enough in extinguishing the</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.440" end="00:32:24.590" style="s2">weak and smothering them and the only</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.799" end="00:32:27.169" style="s2">men that are left are the men with the</p>
