<p begin="00:01:37.409" end="00:01:43.320" style="s2">wasn&#39;t necessarily life-changing right</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.200" end="00:01:46.619" style="s2">before that I got introduced to game B</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.320" end="00:01:48.360" style="s2">and I can&#39;t believe everything that has</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.619" end="00:01:50.850" style="s2">occurred with game B in my life has</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.360" end="00:01:55.799" style="s2">happened in the last month just seems</p>

<p begin="00:01:59.070" end="00:02:03.360" style="s2">conversation plan for this Tuesday I</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.899" end="00:02:06.659" style="s2">haven&#39;t been as involved as I would like</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.360" end="00:02:09.989" style="s2">to be on the Facebook group because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.659" end="00:02:12.230" style="s2">been doing my own game B which is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.989" end="00:02:13.910" style="s2">not gave me but</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.230" end="00:02:16.400" style="s2">figuring out what it means to me and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.910" end="00:02:18.530" style="s2">also like I&#39;ve written writing it out</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.400" end="00:02:19.670" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really work for me especially in</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.530" end="00:02:21.260" style="s2">the format it&#39;s there every so often</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.670" end="00:02:22.670" style="s2">I&#39;ll see a question that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.260" end="00:02:24.740" style="s2">respond to it always ends up being a</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.670" end="00:02:30.800" style="s2">week old I&#39;m like oh no wonder having</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.740" end="00:02:34.760" style="s2">that conversation I also am getting more</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.800" end="00:02:38.480" style="s2">and more in touch with what my position</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.760" end="00:02:41.209" style="s2">is in this and although I have the idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.480" end="00:02:44.090" style="s2">that is game B that is how we can create</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.209" end="00:02:46.370" style="s2">it starting today if people want to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.090" end="00:02:48.200" style="s2">it which is creating a global tech</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.370" end="00:02:49.550" style="s2">cooperative it gives us all of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.200" end="00:02:51.230" style="s2">things that basically all of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.550" end="00:02:54.070" style="s2">speakers talk about it helps people go</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.230" end="00:02:56.780" style="s2">into flow it helps us work as both</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.070" end="00:02:59.239" style="s2">sovereign individuals without having to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.780" end="00:03:00.709" style="s2">give without having to and looking after</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.239" end="00:03:04.970" style="s2">each other like we get the group and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.709" end="00:03:08.989" style="s2">individual and didn&#39;t there&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.970" end="00:03:09.590" style="s2">one here I did not put this it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.989" end="00:03:11.030" style="s2">I don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.590" end="00:03:12.110" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s private maybe it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.030" end="00:03:14.150" style="s2">it&#39;s what you can still be talking to</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.110" end="00:03:15.530" style="s2">myself for a half an hour that should be</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.150" end="00:03:20.900" style="s2">fun actually I think it was just the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.530" end="00:03:22.970" style="s2">awesome 59th uhm realizing that I had</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.900" end="00:03:25.430" style="s2">this idea although it wasn&#39;t as good as</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.970" end="00:03:28.549" style="s2">it is now two years ago and so I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.430" end="00:03:30.170" style="s2">to keep putting myself out there in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.549" end="00:03:31.549" style="s2">way that is comfortable enough for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.170" end="00:03:33.500" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t feel like this huge leap</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.549" end="00:03:35.840" style="s2">because I can&#39;t handle the stress of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.500" end="00:03:37.670" style="s2">huge leap so I started out on periscope</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.840" end="00:03:38.989" style="s2">I started out just kind of putting out</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.670" end="00:03:41.720" style="s2">little things to my friends and family</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.989" end="00:03:44.200" style="s2">that really didn&#39;t go anywhere and he</p>

<p begin="00:06:38.689" end="00:06:42.349" style="s2">somewhat positive way I mean sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.309" end="00:06:44.599" style="s2">the most positive thing you can do is be</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.349" end="00:06:47.409" style="s2">the antagonist if that&#39;s your role</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.599" end="00:06:50.869" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of trumps world moment and</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.409" end="00:06:53.029" style="s2">so I&#39;m realizing which I&#39;ve known for</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.869" end="00:06:55.249" style="s2">months that my role maybe isn&#39;t this</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.029" end="00:06:57.110" style="s2">this thing this global cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.249" end="00:06:58.610" style="s2">although I&#39;m still gonna be here doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.110" end="00:06:59.869" style="s2">fix the world Fridays I&#39;m still gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.610" end="00:07:03.979" style="s2">trying to figure out how to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.869" end="00:07:05.509" style="s2">it but like the irony of being me like I</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.979" end="00:07:07.610" style="s2">have this idea that I think is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.509" end="00:07:09.469" style="s2">solution to the world yeah I can I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.610" end="00:07:11.449" style="s2">it&#39;s not something&#39;s one person can do</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.469" end="00:07:13.329" style="s2">on their own but it is something that</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.449" end="00:07:16.819" style="s2">someone who is more type-a and more</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.329" end="00:07:19.579" style="s2">organized and less plus neurodiverse</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.819" end="00:07:22.729" style="s2">more neurotypical could be could maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.579" end="00:07:24.050" style="s2">get off the ground much more easily but</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.729" end="00:07:26.619" style="s2">that same brain wouldn&#39;t have come up</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.050" end="00:07:29.599" style="s2">with it and so I can see that</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.619" end="00:07:31.879" style="s2">definitely my challenges and the things</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.599" end="00:07:33.769" style="s2">that society says make me less than or</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.879" end="00:07:36.079" style="s2">actually what make it possible that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.769" end="00:07:37.729" style="s2">was able to create this and I can see</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.079" end="00:07:40.219" style="s2">how the diversity on this planet</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.729" end="00:07:44.239" style="s2">especially the diversity that were less</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.219" end="00:07:48.050" style="s2">okay with ie disability it mental</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.239" end="00:07:50.569" style="s2">emotional physical are all key</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.050" end="00:07:52.999" style="s2">components of how we work together as</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.569" end="00:07:54.559" style="s2">humanity and so part of what I&#39;m here to</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.999" end="00:07:56.529" style="s2">do and I&#39;m still figuring it out so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.559" end="00:07:59.959" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily know how to explain it</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.529" end="00:08:02.629" style="s2">my world is that I&#39;m here to do that</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.959" end="00:08:04.849" style="s2">social or that personal development</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.629" end="00:08:07.939" style="s2">piece but for the group instead of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.849" end="00:08:09.829" style="s2">individual that it isn&#39;t about you</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.939" end="00:08:11.989" style="s2">necessarily needing to meditate and eat</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.829" end="00:08:14.689" style="s2">right and and you know we can find a way</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.989" end="00:08:17.779" style="s2">to make more money it&#39;s about helping</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.689" end="00:08:21.349" style="s2">each other do that like having this</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.779" end="00:08:23.179" style="s2">piece of the world like when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.349" end="00:08:24.800" style="s2">anti-capitalist and I am I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.179" end="00:08:26.899" style="s2">anti-capitalist I don&#39;t know how else to</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.800" end="00:08:28.879" style="s2">explain it I don&#39;t think the solution is</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.899" end="00:08:30.949" style="s2">ever to go backwards I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.879" end="00:08:32.419" style="s2">solution is to go back until we were all</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.949" end="00:08:34.339" style="s2">tribal and there was no internet I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.419" end="00:08:38.269" style="s2">think the solution is to go and retry</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.339" end="00:08:39.769" style="s2">communism in our countries I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.269" end="00:08:41.779" style="s2">it&#39;s even to start unions and worker</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.769" end="00:08:44.029" style="s2">cooperatives because those are old</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.779" end="00:08:46.670" style="s2">technologies it has to be something new</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.029" end="00:08:48.650" style="s2">it has to be something that gives us</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.670" end="00:08:50.630" style="s2">more than what we currently have</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.650" end="00:08:52.940" style="s2">ads individuals it has to be something</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.630" end="00:08:55.970" style="s2">that entices us as individuals in our</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.940" end="00:08:58.850" style="s2">own lives and it&#39;s like we went through</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.970" end="00:09:01.130" style="s2">this really conformist part of our</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.850" end="00:09:06.860" style="s2">history that was necessary to exist as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.130" end="00:09:09.170" style="s2">cohesive group we needed to be cohesive</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.860" end="00:09:10.700" style="s2">so therefore if you were the odd ball</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.170" end="00:09:12.410" style="s2">you&#39;ve got kicked out of the tribe you</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.700" end="00:09:14.570" style="s2">got kicked out you were not a part of it</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.410" end="00:09:19.070" style="s2">and there was a certain amount that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.570" end="00:09:20.589" style="s2">was necessary and then we got to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.070" end="00:09:25.510" style="s2">point where now we&#39;re completely</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.589" end="00:09:25.510" style="s2">individualistic want more or less and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.660" end="00:09:30.200" style="s2">there was a positive and a negative that</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.460" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">came from that and I think the next step</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.200" end="00:09:34.550" style="s2">forward is to have both of those things</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:36.890" style="s2">to have you get to be a unique</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.550" end="00:09:39.320" style="s2">individual you get to figure out who you</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.890" end="00:09:41.510" style="s2">are and that path allowing people to</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.320" end="00:09:43.850" style="s2">follow that path is how we do it all is</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.510" end="00:09:46.580" style="s2">how we create the cooperative because</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.850" end="00:09:49.190" style="s2">then you get people in flow then you get</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.580" end="00:09:50.600" style="s2">people who are giving their best self</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.190" end="00:09:52.400" style="s2">because that&#39;s what I&#39;ve tapped into you</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.600" end="00:09:54.110" style="s2">I&#39;m like oh I still don&#39;t look very good</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.400" end="00:09:54.770" style="s2">considering what society says we should</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.110" end="00:09:57.470" style="s2">look like</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.770" end="00:10:00.830" style="s2">I still can&#39;t work I still can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.470" end="00:10:03.770" style="s2">know I still can&#39;t run or do you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.830" end="00:10:06.110" style="s2">cardio work I can&#39;t like I can&#39;t there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.770" end="00:10:08.150" style="s2">a lot of things like our limitations for</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.110" end="00:10:11.089" style="s2">me but the limitations I&#39;m supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.150" end="00:10:13.510" style="s2">have to live my life because they&#39;re my</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.089" end="00:10:17.029" style="s2">roadmap and my way of getting there and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.510" end="00:10:20.350" style="s2">I can&#39;t be go tackle enough to think</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.029" end="00:10:23.900" style="s2">that I&#39;m unique and not that I&#39;m somehow</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.350" end="00:10:25.880" style="s2">better than or special that I have this</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.900" end="00:10:28.070" style="s2">path and no one else does I think we all</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.880" end="00:10:29.570" style="s2">have a path and it&#39;s not written in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.070" end="00:10:31.480" style="s2">outside it&#39;s written in the inside and</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.570" end="00:10:34.190" style="s2">we can&#39;t really judge each other&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.480" end="00:10:35.839" style="s2">everyone following their own path in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.190" end="00:10:38.029" style="s2">way that they&#39;re hopefully cognizant of</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.839" end="00:10:40.670" style="s2">like what their decisions impact other</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.029" end="00:10:42.650" style="s2">people I&#39;m overly conscious of how my</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.670" end="00:10:44.450" style="s2">decisions affect other people so I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.650" end="00:10:46.490" style="s2">people that are maybe more sociopathic</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.450" end="00:10:48.860" style="s2">and narcissistic need a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.490" end="00:10:50.860" style="s2">figure out how to how to not be how to</p>

<p begin="00:10:53.930" end="00:10:59.540" style="s2">the world and people like myself or</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.089" end="00:11:01.579" style="s2">maybe more empathetic and overthink how</p>

<p begin="00:11:01.579" end="00:11:03.649" style="s2">a little more selfish</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.390" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">and that is what I&#39;ve had to learn I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:11:56.360" end="00:12:00.110" style="s2">create with other people it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.730" end="00:12:02.029" style="s2">unlock for everyone else because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.110" end="00:12:04.850" style="s2">what it is it&#39;s the field we all play on</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.029" end="00:12:08.779" style="s2">it&#39;s creating the tools that enable us</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.850" end="00:12:10.730" style="s2">to live in flow to figure out and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.779" end="00:12:12.890" style="s2">the piece of life not the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.730" end="00:12:15.500" style="s2">not the group it&#39;s be yourself and what</p>

<p begin="00:12:15.500" end="00:12:19.790" style="s2">your better life what do you if you want</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.170" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">to eat healthy and you&#39;re not what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.790" end="00:12:23.720" style="s2">stopping you and how can we co-create</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:25.220" style="s2">that so you can eat healthier if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.720" end="00:12:26.720" style="s2">want to be on time for things if you</p>

<p begin="00:12:33.410" end="00:12:36.560" style="s2">figuring how to keep it bad like I just</p>

<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:44.180" style="s2">instead of and if we&#39;re gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.100" end="00:12:47.209" style="s2">databases we all get spreadsheets um</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.180" end="00:12:50.930" style="s2">which is not as exciting to other people</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.209" end="00:12:52.940" style="s2">that&#39;s maybe that&#39;s me there&#39;s the big</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.930" end="00:12:54.980" style="s2">piece of it is we allow people to geek</p>

<p begin="00:13:07.760" end="00:13:11.720" style="s2">is powerful of like okay well listen to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.070" end="00:13:14.029" style="s2">your own inner guidance we&#39;ll get rich</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.720" end="00:13:15.319" style="s2">and healthy from it no I have not gotten</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.029" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">rich and healthy but I think because</p>

<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:18.889" style="s2">health is something that&#39;s available to</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.540" end="00:13:27.470" style="s2">supplements you take on a planet that is</p>

<p begin="00:14:07.970" end="00:14:13.519" style="s2">from that space and innovate and we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.189" end="00:14:16.189" style="s2">all of the stuff that unlocks the more</p>

<p begin="00:14:39.049" end="00:14:43.970" style="s2">right now Horsham relying on co2</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.689" end="00:14:46.730" style="s2">emissions and other pollutants to create</p>

<p begin="00:14:55.819" end="00:15:01.939" style="s2">community and getting that information</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.549" end="00:15:03.470" style="s2">though helps and then people start with</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.939" end="00:15:05.389" style="s2">right it&#39;s like this greenhouse is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.470" end="00:15:06.619" style="s2">best and then you innovate it to make it</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.389" end="00:15:08.239" style="s2">even better and you make that technology</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.619" end="00:15:09.529" style="s2">available to everyone people have that</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.239" end="00:15:12.289" style="s2">if they&#39;re going to make that even</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.529" end="00:15:16.160" style="s2">better and so innovating open source</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.289" end="00:15:17.689" style="s2">innovating in a way that you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.160" end="00:15:19.609" style="s2">allowed to improve it because nobody</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.689" end="00:15:21.379" style="s2">owns it and we own it together and</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.609" end="00:15:25.309" style="s2">that&#39;s what a global cooperation give us</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.379" end="00:15:27.350" style="s2">and it&#39;s not we&#39;re the individuals</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.309" end="00:15:29.720" style="s2">creating it so if I own that greenhouse</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.350" end="00:15:32.300" style="s2">if it&#39;s my intellectual property</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.720" end="00:15:35.210" style="s2">and I want to sell it to you that&#39;s fine</p>

<p begin="00:15:35.210" end="00:15:38.090" style="s2">like okay and then someone else adds</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.620" end="00:15:39.710" style="s2">something to it and they&#39;re like okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.090" end="00:15:41.120" style="s2">well that who owns that well that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.710" end="00:15:42.530" style="s2">of the conversation and if you never</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.120" end="00:15:43.820" style="s2">want anyone to touch it you never want</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.530" end="00:15:46.400" style="s2">well then you&#39;re kind of playing game eh</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.820" end="00:15:48.470" style="s2">and you&#39;re playing a tiny bit game B if</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.400" end="00:15:50.090" style="s2">you&#39;re using our technology but okay as</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.470" end="00:15:52.940" style="s2">long as that&#39;s transparent we are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.090" end="00:15:54.890" style="s2">create a green house that&#39;s better than</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.940" end="00:15:58.450" style="s2">yours because we are gonna open source</p>

<p begin="00:15:58.630" end="00:16:03.770" style="s2">exponentially faster get better than</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.160" end="00:16:06.050" style="s2">yours is even if it starts at a fraction</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.770" end="00:16:07.850" style="s2">of the quality that yours does because</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.050" end="00:16:10.310" style="s2">we&#39;re co-creating it together it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.850" end="00:16:13.510" style="s2">to get better faster and we&#39;re doing</p>

<p begin="00:20:47.259" end="00:20:52.690" style="s2">joy following your internal voice</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.190" end="00:20:55.629" style="s2">including like meditations the best way</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.690" end="00:20:57.639" style="s2">to get there and I still argue with</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.629" end="00:20:59.529" style="s2">myself against meditation and I&#39;m on</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.639" end="00:21:01.629" style="s2">that journey but it&#39;s like the fastest</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.529" end="00:21:03.129" style="s2">way but like that&#39;s a part of it and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.629" end="00:21:04.539" style="s2">then it&#39;s hard to sit down and listen to</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.129" end="00:21:06.220" style="s2">your own internal thoughts is like well</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.539" end="00:21:08.470" style="s2">that&#39;s not easy and simple right at this</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.220" end="00:21:09.580" style="s2">moment and the more I own that and sit</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.470" end="00:21:10.990" style="s2">with that the more I&#39;m like I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.580" end="00:21:13.000" style="s2">meditation might be a nice thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.990" end="00:21:15.549" style="s2">right now the more I put meditation the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.000" end="00:21:17.019" style="s2">more I naturally eat healthy instead of</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.549" end="00:21:18.820" style="s2">what I used to do which is like how do</p>

<p begin="00:21:24.279" end="00:21:28.090" style="s2">always fell apart on day two or three</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.509" end="00:21:30.039" style="s2">and never really changed my life like it</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.090" end="00:21:32.980" style="s2">seems to everybody else it&#39;s like how do</p>

<p begin="00:21:43.480" end="00:21:46.629" style="s2">might not be the case cuz some people</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.980" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">might be doing some weird but we</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.629" end="00:21:52.539" style="s2">can&#39;t necessarily judge because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:56.529" style="s2">some stuff I&#39;ve done that is definitely</p>
