<p begin="00:00:04.990" end="00:00:12.080" style="s2">Wow okay so last one of the night it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.920" end="00:00:15.589" style="s2">been a very long night and I&#39;m here to</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.080" end="00:00:18.560" style="s2">talk about politics of all things this</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.589" end="00:00:21.800" style="s2">week so hopefully the events the last</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.560" end="00:00:23.600" style="s2">week in the last year have made</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.800" end="00:00:25.130" style="s2">everybody ready to perhaps do a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.600" end="00:00:26.750" style="s2">bit of thinking significantly</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.130" end="00:00:29.510" style="s2">differently about this problem of</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.750" end="00:00:33.019" style="s2">politics this is the the single most</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.510" end="00:00:35.480" style="s2">insightful lucid and honest analysis of</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.019" end="00:00:38.660" style="s2">our contemporary political situation</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.480" end="00:00:41.059" style="s2">that I&#39;ve seen so far I&#39;m being I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.660" end="00:00:42.769" style="s2">being quite serious because she she</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.059" end="00:00:46.699" style="s2">acknowledges the fact that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.769" end="00:00:49.339" style="s2">can&#39;t make sense of what is going on and</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.699" end="00:00:52.039" style="s2">this is a deep insight because a big</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.339" end="00:00:54.260" style="s2">piece of what in fact is going on is</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.039" end="00:00:56.510" style="s2">that we&#39;re right in the middle of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.260" end="00:00:59.629" style="s2">transfer of power between one</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.510" end="00:01:02.089" style="s2">comprehensive way of sense-making and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.629" end="00:01:05.230" style="s2">another quite different comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.089" end="00:01:08.090" style="s2">way of sense-making and so for the past</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.230" end="00:01:11.500" style="s2">century and a half or so we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.090" end="00:01:15.260" style="s2">under this way of a form of sense making</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.500" end="00:01:18.140" style="s2">that we can call the Encyclopedia</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.260" end="00:01:22.130" style="s2">Brittanica model right it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.140" end="00:01:24.350" style="s2">characterized by experts they have the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.130" end="00:01:26.270" style="s2">authority and the responsibility to pull</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.350" end="00:01:28.520" style="s2">social information back to centers of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.270" end="00:01:30.950" style="s2">excellence to process to analyze to</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.520" end="00:01:33.410" style="s2">evaluate and then to output the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.950" end="00:01:35.660" style="s2">authoritative truth for us to then act</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.410" end="00:01:37.310" style="s2">on and it&#39;s actually a pretty effective</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.660" end="00:01:38.840" style="s2">way of since making it works but it</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.310" end="00:01:40.040" style="s2">brought us all the way through the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.840" end="00:01:43.070" style="s2">century and brought us to where we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.040" end="00:01:45.620" style="s2">right now it&#39;s got a notable blind spots</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.070" end="00:01:48.710" style="s2">and unfortunately is extremely subject</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.620" end="00:01:51.860" style="s2">to control manipulation but you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.710" end="00:01:55.490" style="s2">it&#39;s it was the dominant form up until</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.860" end="00:01:57.860" style="s2">relatively recently now in part this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.490" end="00:02:00.980" style="s2">because the this form of sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.860" end="00:02:04.310" style="s2">was founded on top of a form of media a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.980" end="00:02:06.770" style="s2">centralized mass media topology that</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.310" end="00:02:08.840" style="s2">gave rise to and supported this form of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.770" end="00:02:10.249" style="s2">sense-making and of course for the past</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.840" end="00:02:12.870" style="s2">several decades we&#39;ve been in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.249" end="00:02:14.720" style="s2">process of replacing</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.870" end="00:02:16.890" style="s2">kind of media with a new form of</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.720" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">decentralized media the internet and</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.890" end="00:02:22.080" style="s2">social media and whatnot and on top of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:25.470" style="s2">this new media infrastructure there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.080" end="00:02:26.940" style="s2">currently growing organically a new form</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.470" end="00:02:28.950" style="s2">of sense-making that operates under</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.940" end="00:02:32.730" style="s2">completely different rules and we might</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.950" end="00:02:34.440" style="s2">call it the Wikipedia model John Rob who</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.730" end="00:02:36.450" style="s2">thinks about these sorts of things a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.440" end="00:02:40.200" style="s2">and is by far the best thinker in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.450" end="00:02:42.739" style="s2">area calls them Network tribes and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.200" end="00:02:46.620" style="s2">open-source insurgents right now and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.739" end="00:02:49.950" style="s2">perhaps the best example are from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.620" end="00:02:52.049" style="s2">contemporary political in the last last</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.950" end="00:02:55.140" style="s2">election are known as the autists of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.049" end="00:02:59.159" style="s2">Keck and meme magic to happen to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.140" end="00:03:03.540" style="s2">any autists of Keck in the audience yes</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.159" end="00:03:05.549" style="s2">a few great well because as a technology</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.540" end="00:03:08.819" style="s2">entrepreneur when I look at this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.549" end="00:03:11.120" style="s2">a dynamic what I see is Schumpeter</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.819" end="00:03:14.400" style="s2">curves waves of creative destruction</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.120" end="00:03:15.930" style="s2">like when Nokia remember they owned the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.400" end="00:03:17.660" style="s2">cell phone market until the iPhone came</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.930" end="00:03:20.579" style="s2">along and swept them from the table or</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.660" end="00:03:22.260" style="s2">when remember blockbuster was a monolith</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.579" end="00:03:24.720" style="s2">and home video the Netflix came along</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.260" end="00:03:26.669" style="s2">and swept them from the table well the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.720" end="00:03:29.310" style="s2">news is under this way of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.669" end="00:03:31.200" style="s2">things the the events of this last</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.310" end="00:03:33.329" style="s2">election are not an anomaly right there</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:35.760" style="s2">the evidence of cracks that have been</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.329" end="00:03:38.340" style="s2">opening for a very long time and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.760" end="00:03:41.400" style="s2">future of politics belongs to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.340" end="00:03:43.799" style="s2">network tribes and so in part the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.400" end="00:03:46.199" style="s2">rest of this presentation is really for</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.799" end="00:03:48.569" style="s2">the autists of CAC and for the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.199" end="00:03:52.819" style="s2">Network tribes out there because the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.569" end="00:03:52.819" style="s2">first step is easy the next step is hard</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.000" end="00:04:00.840" style="s2">so when I look at the question of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.199" end="00:04:03.660" style="s2">politics right now I actually have to go</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.840" end="00:04:04.160" style="s2">a lot deeper as I look at it and I say</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.660" end="00:04:06.120" style="s2">ok</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.160" end="00:04:07.139" style="s2">politics is under the process of being</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.120" end="00:04:09.150" style="s2">destructed by these new media</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.139" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">technologies but then I look at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.150" end="00:04:13.319" style="s2">technologies themselves and I look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:15.000" style="s2">exponential technology growth and say</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.319" end="00:04:16.760" style="s2">the problem of technological</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.000" end="00:04:18.900" style="s2">unemployment which is in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.760" end="00:04:19.709" style="s2">obsoleting the way that we go about</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.900" end="00:04:22.069" style="s2">doing labor</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.709" end="00:04:27.180" style="s2">and paying people to feed themselves or</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.069" end="00:04:29.160" style="s2">I look at say the ecosystems and in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.180" end="00:04:31.650" style="s2">environment and resources that are in</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.160" end="00:04:33.030" style="s2">the process of obsoleting the current</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.650" end="00:04:36.090" style="s2">way that we go about relating to our</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.030" end="00:04:37.770" style="s2">physical environment and so when I look</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.090" end="00:04:39.569" style="s2">at this whole system I actually start</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.770" end="00:04:41.910" style="s2">seeing a whole bunch of different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.569" end="00:04:44.699" style="s2">of s curves that are all aligning in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.910" end="00:04:46.470" style="s2">the mother of all s curves right and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.699" end="00:04:49.860" style="s2">think what we&#39;re actually looking at is</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.470" end="00:04:51.870" style="s2">a wholesale disruption of our entire</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.860" end="00:04:54.229" style="s2">civilization model right the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.870" end="00:04:59.099" style="s2">thing that comes along only once every</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.229" end="00:05:01.199" style="s2">1000 5,000 10,000 years this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.099" end="00:05:02.490" style="s2">a big deal and by the way it frankly</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.199" end="00:05:04.970" style="s2">puts a lot of what&#39;s been going on for</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.490" end="00:05:07.860" style="s2">the past year in a bit of perspective</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.970" end="00:05:10.229" style="s2">now historically we&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.860" end="00:05:14.639" style="s2">navigated these kinds of transitions a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.229" end="00:05:17.699" style="s2">little poorly you know we could get away</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.639" end="00:05:19.680" style="s2">with it though a Rome Falls and for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.699" end="00:05:21.419" style="s2">few centuries we&#39;ve got a Dark Age going</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.680" end="00:05:24.780" style="s2">on somewhere around the Mediterranean</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.419" end="00:05:27.509" style="s2">but humanity marches on the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.780" end="00:05:30.300" style="s2">this time is different for the very</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.509" end="00:05:33.570" style="s2">first time we are all enmeshed in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.300" end="00:05:36.360" style="s2">comprehensive global civilization fabric</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.570" end="00:05:38.490" style="s2">right 7.5 billion of us many of whom are</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.360" end="00:05:40.199" style="s2">just still learning how to make it work</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.490" end="00:05:42.199" style="s2">all of whom are getting better and</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.199" end="00:05:44.550" style="s2">better every day at killing each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.199" end="00:05:47.310" style="s2">and pushing the absolute limits of all</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.550" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">the infrastructure that we have so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.310" end="00:05:51.780" style="s2">at a precipice and if we drop the ball</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.199" end="00:05:55.560" style="s2">it could in fact be something we never</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.780" end="00:05:57.479" style="s2">recover from at the same time the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.560" end="00:05:59.729" style="s2">prophets of abundance are not wrong</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.479" end="00:06:03.030" style="s2">right these exact same exponential</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.880" end="00:06:10.440" style="s2">on a level of flourishing and well-being</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.190" end="00:06:13.110" style="s2">that is dreamt of only in science</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.440" end="00:06:13.500" style="s2">fiction and poetry that&#39;s where we are</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.110" end="00:06:15.930" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.500" end="00:06:18.509" style="s2">in a historical moment we&#39;re at a moment</p>

<p begin="00:06:33.010" end="00:06:37.000" style="s2">that&#39;s obviously a big question but one</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.960" end="00:06:38.170" style="s2">piece of that I&#39;d like to talk about and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.000" end="00:06:40.810" style="s2">but to do it I&#39;m going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.170" end="00:06:43.150" style="s2">introduce some conceptual models that</p>

<p begin="00:06:43.150" end="00:06:47.950" style="s2">particular I want to talk about a model</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.950" end="00:06:51.100" style="s2">introduced a little over a decade ago by</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.950" end="00:06:52.930" style="s2">my friend Dave Snowden not Edie Snowden</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.100" end="00:06:54.940" style="s2">Dave Stewart and he&#39;s a applied</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.930" end="00:06:57.310" style="s2">complexity theorist it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.940" end="00:06:59.380" style="s2">Keynesian model and in this model what</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.310" end="00:07:01.840" style="s2">Dave does is he identifies that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.380" end="00:07:04.840" style="s2">a number of different very distinct</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.840" end="00:07:06.880" style="s2">kinds of ordered systems right ways the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.840" end="00:07:08.830" style="s2">systems can behave and not just</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.880" end="00:07:10.990" style="s2">different kinds but also different ways</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.830" end="00:07:13.750" style="s2">that we should relate to them so for</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.990" end="00:07:15.850" style="s2">example consider what he calls a simple</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.750" end="00:07:18.040" style="s2">or an obvious system like a pendulum</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.850" end="00:07:20.860" style="s2">swinging back and forth or a game of</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.040" end="00:07:22.780" style="s2">tic-tac-toe it&#39;s the states available in</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.860" end="00:07:25.150" style="s2">the system are very small don&#39;t change</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.780" end="00:07:27.250" style="s2">even a you know a child can just observe</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.150" end="00:07:29.320" style="s2">the system for a while grasp the whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.250" end="00:07:31.450" style="s2">thing in mastered and in fact that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.320" end="00:07:34.110" style="s2">exactly the right way to approach a</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.450" end="00:07:36.700" style="s2">simple and obvious system identify it</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.110" end="00:07:39.010" style="s2">download the best practices implement</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.700" end="00:07:40.900" style="s2">and execute things are different when</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.010" end="00:07:43.090" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with a complicated system</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.900" end="00:07:45.130" style="s2">a complicated system is one where the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.090" end="00:07:48.130" style="s2">number of available States is vast think</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.130" end="00:07:50.080" style="s2">like say seven seven seven the operating</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.130" end="00:07:53.380" style="s2">manual that Boeing 777 or the entire</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.080" end="00:07:55.660" style="s2">American power grid these are systems</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.380" end="00:07:58.060" style="s2">where the set of states is so vast that</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.660" end="00:08:01.000" style="s2">it&#39;s implausible that a person could</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.060" end="00:08:03.340" style="s2">ever really grasp the whole system but</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.000" end="00:08:05.560" style="s2">the regular write the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.340" end="00:08:07.270" style="s2">between cause and effect is reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.560" end="00:08:08.830" style="s2">predictable and in principle you could</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.270" end="00:08:11.680" style="s2">actually print out the entire manual of</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.830" end="00:08:14.290" style="s2">the 777 it&#39;s all there all right so you</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.680" end="00:08:16.180" style="s2">can build expertise and if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.290" end="00:08:18.190" style="s2">group of people who are all trained in</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.180" end="00:08:20.169" style="s2">the operations of this system you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.190" end="00:08:22.300" style="s2">actually manage it and in fact that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.169" end="00:08:23.980" style="s2">largely what we do and our current</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.300" end="00:08:25.750" style="s2">civilization is that we build and manage</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.980" end="00:08:28.630" style="s2">complicated systems and we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.750" end="00:08:30.880" style="s2">pretty good at it the problem arises</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.630" end="00:08:34.599" style="s2">when we get to the next kind of system</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.880" end="00:08:35.830" style="s2">the truly complex now it&#39;s odd is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.599" end="00:08:38.770" style="s2">we&#39;re really just beginning to get our</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.830" end="00:08:40.150" style="s2">heads around complex systems and this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.770" end="00:08:41.460" style="s2">odd because almost everything that</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.150" end="00:08:45.660" style="s2">really matters is</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.460" end="00:08:47.190" style="s2">systems climate ecosystems biology human</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.660" end="00:08:50.520" style="s2">relationships economies these are all</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.190" end="00:08:52.589" style="s2">complex systems and what I mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.520" end="00:08:54.180" style="s2">is that these are systems where the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.589" end="00:08:57.149" style="s2">states that are available to the systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.180" end="00:08:58.830" style="s2">themselves can change in fact they</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.149" end="00:09:00.899" style="s2">change all the time the change as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.830" end="00:09:02.310" style="s2">result of the dynamics of the feedback</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.899" end="00:09:04.350" style="s2">groups and the components of the systems</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.310" end="00:09:05.910" style="s2">themselves they change as a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.350" end="00:09:08.550" style="s2">of the system and interact with this</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.910" end="00:09:10.260" style="s2">environment and evolving our agency in</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.550" end="00:09:12.209" style="s2">the system will change the system and</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.260" end="00:09:13.950" style="s2">the connection between our cause and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.209" end="00:09:16.470" style="s2">effect is effectively impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.950" end="00:09:18.899" style="s2">really predict what this means is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.470" end="00:09:21.420" style="s2">the whole toolkit of approaches that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.899" end="00:09:24.810" style="s2">do so very well in managing complicated</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.420" end="00:09:27.270" style="s2">systems don&#39;t work at all for complex</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.810" end="00:09:28.560" style="s2">systems and in fact quite often they are</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.270" end="00:09:33.029" style="s2">defeated right they they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.560" end="00:09:36.209" style="s2">counterproductive so we might say that a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.029" end="00:09:39.089" style="s2">big piece of learning how to be gods is</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.209" end="00:09:41.570" style="s2">actually learning how to use the tools</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.089" end="00:09:44.520" style="s2">of complicated systems appropriately and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.570" end="00:09:47.070" style="s2">learning how to treat complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.520" end="00:09:49.680" style="s2">authentically and what we do right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.070" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">is we grasp a complex system and we try</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.680" end="00:09:53.100" style="s2">to bound it and treat it always as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:54.690" style="s2">complicated system and this is really</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.100" end="00:09:57.630" style="s2">inevitably setting us up for failure</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.690" end="00:09:59.850" style="s2">so what does that look like in say the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.630" end="00:10:02.550" style="s2">domain of politics and governance</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.850" end="00:10:04.400" style="s2">now with this framework in mind what I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.550" end="00:10:06.900" style="s2">like to say is that governance as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.400" end="00:10:08.690" style="s2">concept is already really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.900" end="00:10:11.820" style="s2">getting started off on the wrong foot</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.690" end="00:10:14.360" style="s2">governance is complicated governance is</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.820" end="00:10:17.970" style="s2">the design of some complicated structure</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.360" end="00:10:21.209" style="s2">attempting to impose and manage complex</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.970" end="00:10:23.339" style="s2">human social life right and these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.209" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">of systems have a hard time the way that</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.339" end="00:10:27.120" style="s2">complicated systems adapt to complex</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:28.770" style="s2">environments is that they actually tend</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.120" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">to get more and more complicated and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.770" end="00:10:32.570" style="s2">complication is expensive inside you get</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:34.770" style="s2">from the Constitution to the TPP and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.570" end="00:10:36.740" style="s2">that&#39;s not a bug that&#39;s a feature that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.770" end="00:10:39.149" style="s2">how it works it&#39;s just the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.740" end="00:10:40.890" style="s2">another feature of these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.149" end="00:10:43.020" style="s2">complicated systems is they involve an</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.890" end="00:10:44.820" style="s2">alienation of agency once you&#39;ve built</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.020" end="00:10:47.070" style="s2">the complicated machine you put the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.820" end="00:10:49.500" style="s2">agency into it all right so say for</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.070" end="00:10:52.020" style="s2">example the role of the president the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.500" end="00:10:54.990" style="s2">president in the structure has agency</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.020" end="00:10:58.110" style="s2">but the human being has agency</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.990" end="00:11:01.950" style="s2">to the degree that he is playing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.110" end="00:11:03.540" style="s2">role and we poor citizens have agency</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.950" end="00:11:04.830" style="s2">only to the degree to which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.540" end="00:11:06.990" style="s2">getting to choose between one of two</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.830" end="00:11:08.610" style="s2">people to play the role I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.990" end="00:11:12.630" style="s2">about you but I&#39;ve actually been feeling</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.610" end="00:11:15.390" style="s2">alienated for my agency recently so what</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.630" end="00:11:17.580" style="s2">might be an authentically complex</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.390" end="00:11:21.330" style="s2">approach to the problem of managing</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.580" end="00:11:23.779" style="s2">human social organization and I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.330" end="00:11:26.550" style="s2">to call this collective intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.779" end="00:11:27.510" style="s2">collective intelligence is founded upon</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.550" end="00:11:30.890" style="s2">a meshwork</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.510" end="00:11:34.320" style="s2">of collaborative enhancing sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.890" end="00:11:36.000" style="s2">now no sovereignty is a loaded term when</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.320" end="00:11:39.240" style="s2">I save sovereignty I definitely don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.000" end="00:11:41.279" style="s2">mean guys with guns out west I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.240" end="00:11:43.380" style="s2">mean Hobbes&#39;s Leviathan which is just</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.279" end="00:11:45.390" style="s2">the view of sovereignty perverted</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.380" end="00:11:50.550" style="s2">through the lens of governance what I</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.390" end="00:11:53.610" style="s2">actually mean is this guy right what I</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.550" end="00:11:55.830" style="s2">mean is is a real active human capacity</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.610" end="00:11:58.800" style="s2">the caste capacity to maintain your own</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.830" end="00:12:01.110" style="s2">agency your own self mastery even in</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.800" end="00:12:02.700" style="s2">environments that are adverse I mean a</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.110" end="00:12:04.980" style="s2">very simple prosaic example let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.700" end="00:12:07.860" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a young parent say a young</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.980" end="00:12:11.010" style="s2">father he has a crying baby and if he</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.860" end="00:12:12.930" style="s2">has sovereignty he is able to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.010" end="00:12:13.950" style="s2">the situation effectively right he has</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.930" end="00:12:15.870" style="s2">emotional resilience</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.950" end="00:12:17.100" style="s2">it isn&#39;t get pulled into the drama he</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.870" end="00:12:18.720" style="s2">has the tools to deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.100" end="00:12:19.529" style="s2">effectively even if that just means</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.720" end="00:12:22.680" style="s2">asking for help</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.529" end="00:12:25.470" style="s2">if he lacks sovereignty he gets pulled</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.680" end="00:12:27.570" style="s2">into it he becomes reactive he becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.470" end="00:12:29.339" style="s2">crying baby himself and he loses the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.570" end="00:12:31.250" style="s2">capacity to have any real agency quite</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.339" end="00:12:33.450" style="s2">often just selecting from a series of</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.250" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">habituated responses that are very</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.450" end="00:12:37.860" style="s2">unlikely to be effective so the problem</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.480" end="00:12:39.420" style="s2">of collective intelligence is very</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.860" end="00:12:42.000" style="s2">deeply related to the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.420" end="00:12:44.279" style="s2">sovereignty and how we construct human</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.000" end="00:12:45.990" style="s2">coherence is around mutually reinforcing</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.279" end="00:12:47.730" style="s2">sovereignty I&#39;ll give you an example</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.990" end="00:12:49.709" style="s2">that we actually pretty good at right</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.730" end="00:12:51.720" style="s2">now this is in the super hyper local</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.709" end="00:12:53.940" style="s2">space I don&#39;t mean cities and towns I</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.720" end="00:12:56.190" style="s2">mean like elite special forces teams or</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.940" end="00:12:58.320" style="s2">startup companies these are environments</p>

<p begin="00:12:59.610" end="00:13:03.810" style="s2">alignment with each other they recognize</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.740" end="00:13:05.730" style="s2">that the success of the whole is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.810" end="00:13:07.200" style="s2">tied to the increasing capacity to act</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.730" end="00:13:09.120" style="s2">increasing the sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.200" end="00:13:11.190" style="s2">of each member and when decisions need</p>

<p begin="00:13:11.190" end="00:13:15.360" style="s2">the right people or groups of people</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.630" end="00:13:17.910" style="s2">when conflict arises it has to actually</p>

<p begin="00:13:17.910" end="00:13:21.810" style="s2">to be resolved as to be healed or new</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.889" end="00:13:25.110" style="s2">capacities have to be built to make it</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.810" end="00:13:27.839" style="s2">no longer relevant and this is the exact</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.110" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">appropriate response to live complexity</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.839" end="00:13:32.850" style="s2">this kind of a collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.519" end="00:13:35.430" style="s2">is highly adaptive to the unpredictable</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.850" end="00:13:38.370" style="s2">nature of complexity and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.430" end="00:13:40.649" style="s2">startup companies are so much more</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.370" end="00:13:43.680" style="s2">effective at navigating innovation space</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.649" end="00:13:45.269" style="s2">which is complex than large much better</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.680" end="00:13:46.860" style="s2">resourced corporations that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.269" end="00:13:50.130" style="s2">operating in a state of complication</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.860" end="00:13:51.510" style="s2">right so at the hyper local level and</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.130" end="00:13:53.250" style="s2">these in these narrow bands are actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.510" end="00:13:55.139" style="s2">pretty good and building these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.250" end="00:13:59.519" style="s2">things they&#39;re built on things like deep</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.139" end="00:14:01.589" style="s2">trust responsibility healing but we</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.519" end="00:14:02.820" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to scale them and when</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.589" end="00:14:04.769" style="s2">you start adding people into these</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.820" end="00:14:06.420" style="s2">groups 20 40 60 certainly when you get</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.769" end="00:14:08.970" style="s2">to the Dunbar limit they start to break</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.420" end="00:14:10.680" style="s2">down either vulcanize into sub tribes so</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.970" end="00:14:14.010" style="s2">they have to flop over to some form of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.680" end="00:14:16.410" style="s2">hierarchy so the challenge is how do we</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.010" end="00:14:18.089" style="s2">scale these techniques of collective</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.410" end="00:14:20.660" style="s2">intelligence how do we scale things like</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.089" end="00:14:23.610" style="s2">trust and responsibilities and healing</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.660" end="00:14:25.589" style="s2">so that then brings us finally back to</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.610" end="00:14:28.019" style="s2">the beginning of the conversation to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.589" end="00:14:30.360" style="s2">problem of sense making because our</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.019" end="00:14:32.310" style="s2">current circumstances I believe offer us</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.360" end="00:14:34.920" style="s2">a very interesting and singular</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.310" end="00:14:37.079" style="s2">opportunity the fact that an entire</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.920" end="00:14:39.570" style="s2">architecture of legacy sense-making is</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.079" end="00:14:41.730" style="s2">in crisis the fact that a critical mass</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.570" end="00:14:43.860" style="s2">of people right now recognize deep down</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.730" end="00:14:45.690" style="s2">like viscerally that they can&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.860" end="00:14:48.329" style="s2">the authorities that they used to rely</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.690" end="00:14:50.610" style="s2">on means we have an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.329" end="00:14:52.560" style="s2">present them with a new mechanism a new</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.610" end="00:14:55.470" style="s2">architecture for collaborative sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.560" end="00:14:57.180" style="s2">making and if we design it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.470" end="00:14:59.699" style="s2">it actually generates collective</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.180" end="00:15:02.100" style="s2">intelligence it&#39;s based upon mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.699" end="00:15:03.839" style="s2">of a meshwork of sovereigns then if they</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.100" end="00:15:06.060" style="s2">adopt it and if they use it and its</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.839" end="00:15:07.860" style="s2">scales we&#39;ve solved one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.060" end="00:15:10.649" style="s2">problems from at the executive function</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.860" end="00:15:12.089" style="s2">of a collective intelligence so let me</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.649" end="00:15:15.240" style="s2">wrap up I&#39;ve just describing what I</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.089" end="00:15:17.850" style="s2">think are the parameters of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.240" end="00:15:18.970" style="s2">an architecture this is very maven II</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.850" end="00:15:22.180" style="s2">stuff if we remember</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.970" end="00:15:24.399" style="s2">language from earlier the first is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.180" end="00:15:28.660" style="s2">it has to be intrinsically resilient to</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.399" end="00:15:30.129" style="s2">capture control and censorship at an</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.660" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">architectural level physically at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.129" end="00:15:33.040" style="s2">design level now fortunately we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.079" end="00:15:34.540" style="s2">actually pretty good at that</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.040" end="00:15:36.579" style="s2">this is just meaning that it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.540" end="00:15:39.069" style="s2">deeply decentralized so that no</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.579" end="00:15:40.600" style="s2">centralized structure can take over and</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.069" end="00:15:41.110" style="s2">when a centralized structure tries to</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.600" end="00:15:43.389" style="s2">take over</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.110" end="00:15:46.089" style="s2">the architecture adapts to that we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.389" end="00:15:49.180" style="s2">solve that problem the second is more</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.089" end="00:15:50.949" style="s2">subtle the second is that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.180" end="00:15:54.759" style="s2">architecture needs to be sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.949" end="00:15:58.089" style="s2">and to down-regulate bad faith discourse</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.759" end="00:16:00.730" style="s2">and bad faith discourse propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.089" end="00:16:02.920" style="s2">deliberate manipulation effort izing</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.730" end="00:16:04.870" style="s2">even recklessness with the signal that</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.920" end="00:16:07.540" style="s2">you&#39;re putting into the collective this</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.870" end="00:16:10.180" style="s2">is absolutely anathema to collective</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.540" end="00:16:12.310" style="s2">intelligence and is probably the number</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.180" end="00:16:15.850" style="s2">one and possibly the only cardinal sin</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.310" end="00:16:16.990" style="s2">of the future of what we&#39;re doing so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.850" end="00:16:18.310" style="s2">system actually need to be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.990" end="00:16:20.379" style="s2">sensitive that and this is probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.310" end="00:16:22.060" style="s2">through some variety of reputation</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.379" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">tokens and currencies and things like</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.060" end="00:16:25.870" style="s2">that so the decentralized environment</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:28.230" style="s2">can can help the system identify and</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.870" end="00:16:32.410" style="s2">then down regulate bad faith discourse</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.230" end="00:16:34.269" style="s2">the third is subtler still the third has</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.410" end="00:16:35.769" style="s2">to do with the fact that the system</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.269" end="00:16:39.399" style="s2">needs to be able to identify and</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.769" end="00:16:41.649" style="s2">decohere master narratives now the point</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.399" end="00:16:45.399" style="s2">here is that what we want what we need</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.649" end="00:16:47.709" style="s2">is your authentic experience as a member</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.399" end="00:16:49.930" style="s2">of this human sensor network we need you</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.709" end="00:16:52.180" style="s2">to tell your stories right your actual</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.930" end="00:16:53.829" style="s2">lives first-person experience of being</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.180" end="00:16:55.509" style="s2">in the world and provide your</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.829" end="00:16:58.509" style="s2">perspective because if we have this</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.509" end="00:17:00.670" style="s2">giant Omni prospective sphere looking at</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.509" end="00:17:03.129" style="s2">reality that&#39;s how we understand what</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.670" end="00:17:04.510" style="s2">reality really is but the seconds are</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.129" end="00:17:07.089" style="s2">actually telling somebody else&#39;s story</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.510" end="00:17:08.829" style="s2">the second your pre processing your</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.089" end="00:17:11.439" style="s2">experience through some other lens</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.829" end="00:17:12.939" style="s2">that&#39;s how we get into echo chambers and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.439" end="00:17:15.669" style="s2">that&#39;s how we fall into a collective</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.939" end="00:17:17.110" style="s2">delusion so the system also has to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.669" end="00:17:18.549" style="s2">resilient to that and it makes needs to</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.110" end="00:17:20.260" style="s2">make sure that it pushes Authority and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.549" end="00:17:22.480" style="s2">responsibility all the way to the edge</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.260" end="00:17:24.370" style="s2">and it&#39;s all about collecting people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.480" end="00:17:26.829" style="s2">stories as they&#39;re living in in a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.370" end="00:17:30.690" style="s2">continuous basis and then any synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.829" end="00:17:30.690" style="s2">that&#39;s made is fluid very</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.720" end="00:17:35.740" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s where we are now I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.779" end="00:17:39.789" style="s2">like to leave you with just two</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.740" end="00:17:42.639" style="s2">considerations if this sounds hard which</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.789" end="00:17:45.009" style="s2">it is consider the stakes</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.639" end="00:17:47.529" style="s2">I consider the pivot point that we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.009" end="00:17:49.119" style="s2">right now we&#39;re definitely going to have</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.529" end="00:17:51.909" style="s2">to work hard to make it through this</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.119" end="00:17:56.200" style="s2">century and that&#39;s not an objection if</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.909" end="00:17:58.509" style="s2">it sounds impossible consider the sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.200" end="00:18:00.759" style="s2">maker you&#39;re using to make that</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.509" end="00:18:02.440" style="s2">assessment and how effectively it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.759" end="00:18:06.669" style="s2">predicting things for you for the past</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.440" end="00:18:08.019" style="s2">say year because in my experience things</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.669" end="00:18:10.059" style="s2">have this weird habit of going from</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.019" end="00:18:12.809" style="s2">absolutely impossible to completely</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.059" end="00:18:16.499" style="s2">inevitable in the most surprising ways</p>
