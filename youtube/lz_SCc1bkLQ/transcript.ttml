<p begin="00:08:30.730" end="00:08:38.890" style="s2">so so so to understand that is what we</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.670" end="00:08:40.570" style="s2">need and then understand the beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.890" end="00:08:42.280" style="s2">what we started this is all for a</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.570" end="00:08:45.910" style="s2">students of fundamentals racism the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.280" end="00:08:47.710" style="s2">beauty of containing knowledge outside</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.910" end="00:08:49.750" style="s2">of the brain and writing it down and</p>

<p begin="00:08:49.750" end="00:08:55.450" style="s2">to be able to create a larger trike to</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.530" end="00:08:58.030" style="s2">go from tribe to climb from clan to</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.450" end="00:09:02.620" style="s2">nation and maybe one day we&#39;ll help the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.030" end="00:09:04.570" style="s2">machines go from nation to go so</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.620" end="00:09:07.600" style="s2">this whole journey is the overall</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.570" end="00:09:09.160" style="s2">journey of humanity let&#39;s see if we</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.600" end="00:09:11.110" style="s2">could take the last step or if this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.160" end="00:09:12.700" style="s2">actually where we fail history&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.110" end="00:09:14.410" style="s2">continued we don&#39;t know we&#39;re gonna end</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.700" end="00:09:16.780" style="s2">up whether we will fail at this or not</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.410" end="00:09:18.910" style="s2">if you fail we&#39;ll fail miserably if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.780" end="00:09:22.240" style="s2">succeed it will be awesome there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.910" end="00:09:27.010" style="s2">in-between so that starts with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.240" end="00:09:29.080" style="s2">cultivation of the ground okay first we</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.010" end="00:09:30.850" style="s2">were the race cattle but so does get</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.080" end="00:09:32.620" style="s2">catalan we took the manure from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.850" end="00:09:35.710" style="s2">cattle and put it on the ground we could</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.620" end="00:09:38.560" style="s2">start to farm in farming required a</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.710" end="00:09:40.300" style="s2">larger community each required way more</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.560" end="00:09:42.610" style="s2">knowledge and wisdom we had in the past</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.300" end="00:09:44.920" style="s2">them that we had to write things down</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.610" end="00:09:47.050" style="s2">and accumulate knowledge outside of our</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.920" end="00:09:49.420" style="s2">own brains to pass it on from one</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.050" end="00:09:51.250" style="s2">generation to the next that is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.420" end="00:09:53.980" style="s2">biggest revolution that ever happened to</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.250" end="00:09:55.960" style="s2">us mm-hmm digital probably gonna be the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.980" end="00:09:59.740" style="s2">second biggest one the printing press is</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.960" end="00:10:01.330" style="s2">a small revolution in between the G the</p>

<p begin="00:10:01.330" end="00:10:04.750" style="s2">started it and I think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.950" end="00:10:06.850" style="s2">accomplish that fully because are we</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.750" end="00:10:09.130" style="s2">gonna contain a plan for ten million ten</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.850" end="00:10:10.840" style="s2">million people on it all interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.130" end="00:10:12.880" style="s2">with each other that&#39;s gonna take so</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.840" end="00:10:14.080" style="s2">much energy so much electricity so much</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.880" end="00:10:16.690" style="s2">of the resources that have to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.080" end="00:10:18.310" style="s2">recycled and you reuse know that and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.690" end="00:10:20.440" style="s2">much of the sunlight being taken and all</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.310" end="00:10:21.670" style="s2">that for us to be able to do that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.440" end="00:10:23.520" style="s2">we need it&#39;s called through the entire</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.670" end="00:10:27.010" style="s2">planet and that&#39;s exactly why the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.520" end="00:10:29.920" style="s2">overall goal of controlling and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.010" end="00:10:32.050" style="s2">cultivating climate it&#39;s not to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.920" end="00:10:35.440" style="s2">climate disaster now but to save us from</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.050" end="00:10:37.769" style="s2">the next Ice Age mmm-hmm now if we set</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.440" end="00:10:40.470" style="s2">the goal there</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.769" end="00:10:42.149" style="s2">then we have the exodus of Technology</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.470" end="00:10:44.100" style="s2">the Exodus a relationship between on a</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.149" end="00:10:48.509" style="s2">machine we know what machine</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.100" end="00:10:50.069" style="s2">intelligence you do to serve us and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.509" end="00:10:52.079" style="s2">can answer the biggest questions of our</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.069" end="00:10:53.639" style="s2">times that way because we finally set</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.079" end="00:10:55.339" style="s2">the goal in the right direction we put</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.639" end="00:10:57.720" style="s2">the goal in the right place and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.339" end="00:11:00.480" style="s2">everything else the aspects of the day</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.720" end="00:11:02.489" style="s2">is just like byproducts all that overall</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.480" end="00:11:04.199" style="s2">grand narrative that&#39;s exactly why the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.489" end="00:11:06.449" style="s2">grand narratives incredibly important</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.199" end="00:11:08.069" style="s2">because all the different ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.449" end="00:11:10.889" style="s2">were then creates to orientate ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.069" end="00:11:16.049" style="s2">in the world will be by-product so their</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.889" end="00:11:17.819" style="s2">overall grand narrative mm-hmm oh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.049" end="00:11:19.769" style="s2">talking about a grand narrative and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.819" end="00:11:21.449" style="s2">all the other narratives that would kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.769" end="00:11:24.029" style="s2">of grow from it like a tree or I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.449" end="00:11:27.480" style="s2">stopped by products there&#39;s subdivisions</p>

<p begin="00:11:27.480" end="00:11:31.619" style="s2">we&#39;re now unified with worse priests</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.850" end="00:11:34.559" style="s2">we&#39;re standing there seeing that okay</p>
