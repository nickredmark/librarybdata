<p begin="00:01:27.479" end="00:01:32.840" style="s2">our Astron ism and I&#39;m not sure Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.909" end="00:01:36.570" style="s2">Peterson is aware of that it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.840" end="00:01:38.310" style="s2">the person or Iranian part of Asian</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.570" end="00:01:41.640" style="s2">histories was lacking in the West&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.310" end="00:01:44.460" style="s2">understanding of these so we know quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.640" end="00:01:46.200" style="s2">a lot about China in India and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.460" end="00:01:48.259" style="s2">overwhelmed my Chinese in India culture</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.200" end="00:01:50.490" style="s2">knowing that their heritage is way</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.259" end="00:01:52.350" style="s2">bigger than anything we created in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.490" end="00:01:54.299" style="s2">West but it&#39;s actually the Iranian</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.350" end="00:01:55.939" style="s2">heritage that is the most underrated one</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.299" end="00:01:58.860" style="s2">because it connects the other two and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.939" end="00:02:02.070" style="s2">large parts of the history of ideas with</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.860" end="00:02:05.460" style="s2">China and India originated in Iran and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.070" end="00:02:07.290" style="s2">think it&#39;s striking that Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.460" end="00:02:10.099" style="s2">has a quote here about his own religion</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.290" end="00:02:12.870" style="s2">where he&#39;s actually admitting to</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.099" end="00:02:13.970" style="s2">religion that it&#39;s existed for over</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.870" end="00:02:16.880" style="s2">3,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.970" end="00:02:18.980" style="s2">that is his religion so we should tell</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.880" end="00:02:21.230" style="s2">Jordan Peterson he&#39;s disaster mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.980" end="00:02:24.590" style="s2">you and I just yeah where does he think</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.230" end="00:02:26.540" style="s2">he&#39;s a Christian then no he&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.590" end="00:02:28.220" style="s2">not a Christian he&#39;s an ironic Christian</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.540" end="00:02:30.470" style="s2">he would admit to that but we can go</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.220" end="00:02:32.600" style="s2">into that later okay but we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.470" end="00:02:34.940" style="s2">comparing today with John for Erica who</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.600" end="00:02:36.650" style="s2">is a friend of ours and we huge fans of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.940" end="00:02:39.260" style="s2">America&#39;s work if a variety is</p>

<p begin="00:03:01.340" end="00:03:06.280" style="s2">make his message which can be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.610" end="00:03:11.690" style="s2">overly complex more understandable to</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.520" end="00:03:14.540" style="s2">myself and other people</p>

<p begin="00:03:45.500" end="00:03:48.080" style="s2">complicated than with you and I were</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.610" end="00:03:49.400" style="s2">trying to do here which is kind of scary</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.080" end="00:03:52.280" style="s2">because we&#39;re getting away with murder</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.400" end="00:03:55.520" style="s2">because it&#39;s cheap we&#39;ll equipment as we</p>

<p begin="00:04:13.730" end="00:04:18.230" style="s2">said all along in my work with John</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.500" end="00:04:20.060" style="s2">Soderquist is that we&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.230" end="00:04:22.280" style="s2">the phallic vision and we&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.060" end="00:04:23.810" style="s2">writing a trilogy we published two books</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.280" end="00:04:25.729" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna write the third book over</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.810" end="00:04:27.320" style="s2">the next three to four years and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.729" end="00:04:29.300" style="s2">gonna call the grand narrative</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.320" end="00:04:32.480" style="s2">you and I&#39;ve discussed it at length</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.300" end="00:04:34.700" style="s2">before him but what is lacking in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.480" end="00:04:38.780" style="s2">North American perspective is this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.700" end="00:04:40.610" style="s2">this lack of phallus oh this is very</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.780" end="00:04:42.860" style="s2">important because for couple reasons</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.610" end="00:04:45.320" style="s2">firstly it&#39;s very offensive to people</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.860" end="00:04:49.400" style="s2">when you say that right away people just</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.320" end="00:04:52.850" style="s2">freak out and I wanna maybe we could</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.400" end="00:04:55.010" style="s2">talk about why that is and and also why</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.850" end="00:04:57.710" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s so important and why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.010" end="00:05:01.100" style="s2">lacking uh let&#39;s say masculine phallic</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.710" end="00:05:03.140" style="s2">vision in the West or actually not</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.100" end="00:05:07.190" style="s2">masculine you would say phallic is is</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.140" end="00:05:09.320" style="s2">both feminine masculine yeah Chuck Chaka</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.190" end="00:05:11.630" style="s2">Khan a famously these French that I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.320" end="00:05:13.940" style="s2">famous said that phallus is hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.630" end="00:05:16.940" style="s2">something men have and something women</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.940" end="00:05:20.030" style="s2">are so in that is physiologically</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.940" end="00:05:21.530" style="s2">speaking when a man looks at a woman is</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.030" end="00:05:24.500" style="s2">attracted by the theme of body the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.530" end="00:05:26.960" style="s2">entire female bodies falling whereas</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.500" end="00:05:28.820" style="s2">when you know women are looking to men</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.960" end="00:05:30.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not literally the Fowler&#39;s the dick</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.820" end="00:05:31.940" style="s2">they might be looking for but you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.680" end="00:05:34.490" style="s2">they do it have sexual intercourse</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.940" end="00:05:36.680" style="s2">obviously but women are looking for</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.490" end="00:05:38.360" style="s2">found a character in men meaning if the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.680" end="00:05:41.630" style="s2">man doesn&#39;t go out there in the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.360" end="00:05:45.080" style="s2">and he comes back and delivers to me why</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.630" end="00:05:47.600" style="s2">would I pay attention to it so so it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.080" end="00:05:50.780" style="s2">deeply sexual and that ties into my</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.600" end="00:05:52.580" style="s2">critique of the current North American</p>

<p begin="00:13:10.010" end="00:13:13.670" style="s2">is a kind of leveling out of everything</p>

<p begin="00:13:13.670" end="00:13:18.529" style="s2">he&#39;s not a more is more than lousy</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.940" end="00:13:20.779" style="s2">Marxist and there&#39;s this rumor</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.529" end="00:13:22.610" style="s2">it&#39;s even worse than that the irony is</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.779" end="00:13:27.079" style="s2">the Jordan Peterson and Camilla Padma</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.610" end="00:13:28.670" style="s2">are Marxists you just said what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.079" end="00:13:30.230" style="s2">been when I would I&#39;ve sort of been</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.670" end="00:13:32.560" style="s2">thinking for a while that the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.230" end="00:13:35.480" style="s2">revolution of the proletariat right</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.560" end="00:13:38.170" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of what a Peterson is doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.480" end="00:13:41.089" style="s2">and this might kind of explain his</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.170" end="00:13:46.249" style="s2">intimacy like with Marx and his also his</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.089" end="00:13:48.949" style="s2">the fact that he&#39;s made Marx he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.949" end="00:13:54.499" style="s2">version of Marxism popular in American</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.529" end="00:13:56.420" style="s2">colleges so when Americans talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.499" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">Marxism you have to ask them have you</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.420" end="00:14:01.029" style="s2">actually studied Marx because most of</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:04.459" style="s2">never have and it turns out they&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.029" end="00:14:07.040" style="s2">quoting or referring to Marx in a second</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.459" end="00:14:08.959" style="s2">or a third generation version of it</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.040" end="00:14:10.399" style="s2">which is gone through American colleges</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.959" end="00:14:13.430" style="s2">and things and they&#39;re actually talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.399" end="00:14:14.839" style="s2">about Russell without understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.430" end="00:14:17.149" style="s2">fundamental difference between gross oil</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.839" end="00:14:19.879" style="s2">Marx and when Marx wrote at all and why</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.149" end="00:14:21.639" style="s2">wrote aggressively against or so you</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.879" end="00:14:25.129" style="s2">have to understand that Marx is heroic</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.639" end="00:14:29.420" style="s2">so Marx does the same thing as Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.129" end="00:14:32.029" style="s2">did nietzsche looks to an individual an</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.420" end="00:14:33.019" style="s2">aristocrat he&#39;s cartesian in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.029" end="00:14:34.970" style="s2">that&#39;s his problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.019" end="00:14:36.829" style="s2">he&#39;s a cartesian but he looks at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.970" end="00:14:40.069" style="s2">cartesian individual as a hero</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.829" end="00:14:41.990" style="s2">that&#39;s the aristocrat anita Marx does</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.069" end="00:14:43.790" style="s2">the same thing but he looks at the group</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.990" end="00:14:46.129" style="s2">the tribe that&#39;s why I&#39;m a Marxist than</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.790" end="00:14:47.410" style="s2">one interested in Marx today because to</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.129" end="00:14:49.759" style="s2">understand the current digital</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.410" end="00:14:52.370" style="s2">subcultures and what will emerge out of</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.759" end="00:14:54.379" style="s2">them we need to study Marx and</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.370" end="00:14:56.269" style="s2">understand what a proletariat really is</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.379" end="00:14:57.980" style="s2">Marx essentially saying that capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.269" end="00:15:00.949" style="s2">is fine it&#39;s the best thing we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.980" end="00:15:02.809" style="s2">entered so far but sooner or later</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.949" end="00:15:07.459" style="s2">people will figure out a capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.809" end="00:15:09.649" style="s2">actually works ok because there will be</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.459" end="00:15:10.699" style="s2">more enlightened than the capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.649" end="00:15:12.920" style="s2">they will beat the shit out of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.699" end="00:15:14.660" style="s2">capitalist it is a form it&#39;s a form of</p>

<p begin="00:15:14.660" end="00:15:19.459" style="s2">for and we call this proletariat netic</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.749" end="00:15:22.149" style="s2">rats today that was our first book</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.459" end="00:15:24.589" style="s2">twenty years ago the netic rats are the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.149" end="00:15:26.329" style="s2">realization of the marxist proletariat</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.589" end="00:15:28.300" style="s2">and they&#39;re gonna take over rule the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.329" end="00:15:30.850" style="s2">world because of digital</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.300" end="00:15:32.860" style="s2">so I just want to stop either because</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.850" end="00:15:35.260" style="s2">when I talk to people who claim to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.860" end="00:15:37.810" style="s2">Marxists they don&#39;t say that usually</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.260" end="00:15:40.870" style="s2">usually they they say that there has to</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.810" end="00:15:44.050" style="s2">be the socialism you know and and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.870" end="00:15:46.000" style="s2">this will lead to communism and you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.050" end="00:15:48.340" style="s2">and they complain about the elite all</p>

<p begin="00:20:06.750" end="00:20:12.360" style="s2">the 1950s was that we came out of the</p>

<p begin="00:20:53.130" end="00:20:59.310" style="s2">blow up more bombs what we did though</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.560" end="00:21:01.470" style="s2">was that we created this idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.310" end="00:21:04.680" style="s2">could have an ultimate evil and called</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.470" end="00:21:07.230" style="s2">Nazism and because in ultimate evil</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.680" end="00:21:09.390" style="s2">we don&#39;t ultimately the sense that it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:21:11.940" end="00:21:19.110" style="s2">yeah just massively the proud that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.120" end="00:21:21.030" style="s2">that anybody who wasn&#39;t a Nazi anybody</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.110" end="00:21:23.190" style="s2">of any kind there was not basically the</p>

<p begin="00:21:23.190" end="00:21:31.620" style="s2">so we&#39;ve had a celebration of mediocrity</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.650" end="00:21:34.470" style="s2">on a massive scale in culture since 1945</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.620" end="00:21:36.300" style="s2">yeah and in this letter in 1952 the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.470" end="00:21:37.920" style="s2">celebration of the teenager because once</p>

<p begin="00:22:09.730" end="00:22:14.800" style="s2">understand the mistakes we also made</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.800" end="00:22:17.680" style="s2">after 1945 dialectical mistakes you made</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.800" end="00:22:19.540" style="s2">and we ended up in the other dustbin we</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.680" end="00:22:21.730" style="s2">just we just we got away from the ditch</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.540" end="00:22:23.140" style="s2">of Hitler and Stalin and we ended up</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.730" end="00:22:26.020" style="s2">with the other ditch instead which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.140" end="00:22:27.670" style="s2">the real scientist that&#39;s why we&#39;re full</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.020" end="00:22:29.620" style="s2">of social justice warriors and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.670" end="00:22:32.110" style="s2">self-proclaimed saviors and all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.620" end="00:22:34.030" style="s2">things out there because we&#39;re terrified</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.110" end="00:22:37.030" style="s2">for somebody stepping forward with a</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.030" end="00:22:38.380" style="s2">properly utopian vision you know</p>

<p begin="00:22:55.480" end="00:22:59.620" style="s2">want to challenge former key I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.580" end="00:23:01.600" style="s2">challenge two guys out there and all I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.620" end="00:23:04.140" style="s2">saying I&#39;m just pointing out none of you</p>

<p begin="00:23:07.000" end="00:23:10.690" style="s2">here in Europe so the way I get the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.160" end="00:23:14.380" style="s2">young guys on the move is through a</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.690" end="00:23:17.350" style="s2">messianic vision yes and that is an</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.380" end="00:23:20.650" style="s2">equation that is what we need yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.350" end="00:23:23.260" style="s2">and that&#39;s yes and that&#39;s why I turned</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.650" end="00:23:25.000" style="s2">to Zoroastrianism and and Mithraism</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.260" end="00:23:26.920" style="s2">which was the religion of the Roman</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.000" end="00:23:28.930" style="s2">Empire which is another verse or</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.920" end="00:23:31.390" style="s2">asterism I turn to the Irani heritage</p>

<p begin="00:23:31.390" end="00:23:35.440" style="s2">know I&#39;ve discussed it for the Sufism is</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.070" end="00:23:39.460" style="s2">key here house or a schism eventually</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.440" end="00:23:40.960" style="s2">influenced Islam Judaism absolutely it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.460" end="00:23:43.120" style="s2">an enormous cross-pollination between</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.960" end="00:23:46.960" style="s2">Buddhism Azure asterism it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.120" end="00:23:49.150" style="s2">fruitful collaboration of ideas ever</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.960" end="00:23:52.120" style="s2">he&#39;s the meeting between Buddhism Azure</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.150" end="00:23:54.040" style="s2">autism they both have origins Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.120" end="00:23:55.840" style="s2">probably originated in Afghanistan and</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.120" end="00:24:01.930" style="s2">Asian eventually ended up in Iran and</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.740" end="00:24:03.790" style="s2">both these two religions have cross</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.930" end="00:24:05.830" style="s2">pollinated with each other for hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.790" end="00:24:08.560" style="s2">of years or even thousands of years and</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.830" end="00:24:09.309" style="s2">it&#39;s in between the two that I think we</p>

<p begin="00:24:09.309" end="00:24:13.749" style="s2">case today for what I call the</p>

<p begin="00:24:18.970" end="00:24:24.340" style="s2">this movement then we need to restart a</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.389" end="00:24:25.749" style="s2">kickstart to get out of the currency</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.340" end="00:24:29.379" style="s2">obesity pandemics and everything</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.749" end="00:24:31.509" style="s2">literally this movement is best led by</p>

<p begin="00:31:33.490" end="00:31:38.230" style="s2">Valley is just capitalists today and</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.100" end="00:31:40.590" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna see a Marxist proletariat</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.230" end="00:31:43.030" style="s2">rise up against them and that&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.590" end="00:31:44.920" style="s2">what a child for example through East</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.030" end="00:31:45.220" style="s2">African India where I work a lot these</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.920" end="00:31:46.930" style="s2">days</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.220" end="00:31:48.550" style="s2">and I see these kids to pick up their</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.930" end="00:31:49.630" style="s2">smartphones and pick up the laptops and</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.550" end="00:31:51.670" style="s2">they said a program and they make a</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.630" end="00:31:53.920" style="s2">little funny things they can use their</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.670" end="00:31:55.030" style="s2">they&#39;re not hyped the way things are of</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.920" end="00:31:56.230" style="s2">Silicon Valley they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.030" end="00:31:57.940" style="s2">billions of the Holliston venture</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.230" end="00:32:00.160" style="s2">capital if they like that all they are</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.940" end="00:32:02.500" style="s2">the new proletariat they are the genuine</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.160" end="00:32:04.030" style="s2">netic rats they&#39;re gonna change the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.500" end="00:32:05.770" style="s2">world and they gonna use it it&#39;ll change</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.030" end="00:32:07.210" style="s2">it and they might use platforms that</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.770" end="00:32:08.290" style="s2">were born in Silicon Valley to do it</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.210" end="00:32:09.730" style="s2">fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.290" end="00:32:12.400" style="s2">Silicon Valley is certainly part of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.730" end="00:32:14.050" style="s2">game but Seneca Valley to me today is</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.400" end="00:32:15.940" style="s2">exactly the way</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.050" end="00:32:19.300" style="s2">Marx described the French Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.940" end="00:32:21.280" style="s2">this is not digital this is just a</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.300" end="00:32:23.890" style="s2">precursor to digital this is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.280" end="00:32:26.500" style="s2">middle-class version of digital but the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.890" end="00:32:29.050" style="s2">real working-class version of digital</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.500" end="00:32:31.060" style="s2">still has to emerge it&#39;s not there yet</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.050" end="00:32:34.320" style="s2">but once it emerges and it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.060" end="00:32:36.760" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be the genuine revolution</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.320" end="00:32:38.920" style="s2">so that&#39;s why you could call me digital</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.760" end="00:32:40.930" style="s2">Marxist if you like I&#39;m sure Brandon</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.920" end="00:32:42.700" style="s2">O&#39;Neil would subscribe to that Keith</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.930" end="00:32:44.710" style="s2">ounce the Pearson has just written a</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.700" end="00:32:47.740" style="s2">book where he compares nee-chan rules so</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.710" end="00:32:49.180" style="s2">genius ok read that book there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.740" end="00:32:52.180" style="s2">of stuff going on a philosopher act I</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.180" end="00:32:54.790" style="s2">will be visiting the great thinkers of</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.180" end="00:32:57.190" style="s2">19th century Europe Hegel Freud</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.790" end="00:32:58.840" style="s2">Nietzsche even Darwin is in there and</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.190" end="00:33:00.970" style="s2">we&#39;re revisiting them and we&#39;re finding</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.840" end="00:33:02.500" style="s2">strength in that and we can now properly</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.970" end="00:33:05.110" style="s2">analyze the current situation</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.500" end="00:33:06.250" style="s2">and to properly analyze it for Varkey</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.110" end="00:33:09.820" style="s2">and these guys have done a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.250" end="00:33:12.310" style="s2">job on one half of that they worked on</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.820" end="00:33:14.200" style="s2">the container they worked on the context</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.310" end="00:33:16.630" style="s2">when I talked to John I said you do</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.200" end="00:33:18.880" style="s2">great work because John for variks work</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.630" end="00:33:22.210" style="s2">is basically to put up the context first</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.880" end="00:33:24.460" style="s2">in an Aristotelian sense into which the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.210" end="00:33:26.500" style="s2">right proper gratitude can then be poor</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.460" end="00:33:28.870" style="s2">I think he says that too I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.500" end="00:33:33.160" style="s2">that&#39;s his he doesn&#39;t want to have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.870" end="00:33:35.860" style="s2">grand narrative he wants to sort of give</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.160" end="00:33:39.370" style="s2">give people the tools to do that</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.860" end="00:33:41.800" style="s2">themselves no he he&#39;s afraid of utopia</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.370" end="00:33:44.770" style="s2">visas he&#39;s afraid of the phallus mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.800" end="00:33:46.600" style="s2">he admits that episode 39 40 let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.770" end="00:33:48.520" style="s2">so far they did that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.600" end="00:33:50.980" style="s2">okay the froggie afraid he&#39;s afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.520" end="00:33:53.490" style="s2">hegelian romanticism coming back and</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.980" end="00:33:58.960" style="s2">then and then you know and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.490" end="00:34:00.430" style="s2">sweeping you know well you know what</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.960" end="00:34:01.420" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this way very</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.430" end="00:34:02.920" style="s2">straightforward it</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.420" end="00:34:04.870" style="s2">what for Varghese doing is basically</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.920" end="00:34:06.850" style="s2">telling you you&#39;re sitting in egypt and</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.870" end="00:34:09.610" style="s2">you&#39;re a slave and it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.850" end="00:34:10.899" style="s2">telling that if moses or Aaron walks by</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.610" end="00:34:14.350" style="s2">tomorrow since we&#39;re going to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.899" end="00:34:15.030" style="s2">promised land don&#39;t follow them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.350" end="00:34:17.500" style="s2">what he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.030" end="00:34:19.740" style="s2">okay that&#39;s what he&#39;s safe that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.500" end="00:34:21.820" style="s2">you end up when you don&#39;t have a phallus</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.740" end="00:34:23.830" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a vision of how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.820" end="00:34:26.560" style="s2">gonna get out of your slavery and hope</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.830" end="00:34:28.500" style="s2">how the fuck are you gonna talk about</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.560" end="00:34:34.300" style="s2">getting out of an existential crisis</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.500" end="00:34:37.300" style="s2">unless the exercise itself changes so we</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.300" end="00:34:38.770" style="s2">need to get out of Egypt so to get out</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.300" end="00:34:40.870" style="s2">of the Egypt which is takes essential</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.770" end="00:34:42.700" style="s2">crisis to get out of that and walk to</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.870" end="00:34:45.730" style="s2">the promised land somebody&#39;s got to come</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.700" end="00:34:48.190" style="s2">forward and say okay I or the people</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.730" end="00:34:49.450" style="s2">onwards are the Messianic and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.190" end="00:34:51.220" style="s2">gonna lead you into the promised on</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.450" end="00:34:53.620" style="s2">who&#39;s gonna come with us and a small</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.220" end="00:34:55.120" style="s2">minority people will then step out of</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.620" end="00:34:57.670" style="s2">their slavery and said okay we go</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.120" end="00:34:59.680" style="s2">forward each one of those people is in</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.670" end="00:35:05.290" style="s2">each and Oberman yeah and the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.680" end="00:35:07.420" style="s2">them are sort of fake messiahs wait wait</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.290" end="00:35:09.820" style="s2">let me finish no yeah that&#39;s the you</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.420" end="00:35:12.490" style="s2">know but each one of the slaves who</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.820" end="00:35:14.320" style="s2">steps up and comes with the Messiah</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.490" end="00:35:14.800" style="s2">walks out of Egypt is in each and</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.320" end="00:35:16.330" style="s2">Oberman</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.800" end="00:35:18.580" style="s2">that is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.330" end="00:35:20.890" style="s2">Newman&#39;s on his own but together as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.580" end="00:35:23.980" style="s2">group they are the proletariat</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.890" end="00:35:26.650" style="s2">that&#39;s Marxist point but Marx says is</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.980" end="00:35:28.780" style="s2">that the proletariat will lead and go</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.650" end="00:35:30.220" style="s2">forward to the promised land this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.780" end="00:35:34.320" style="s2">what the utopian visions were always</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.220" end="00:35:36.400" style="s2">about so you need to Riyadh and</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.320" end="00:35:37.960" style="s2">understand that without the FEL equation</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.400" end="00:35:40.060" style="s2">how the heck are we gonna get out of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.960" end="00:35:42.010" style="s2">extension of crisis for variks response</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.060" end="00:35:43.930" style="s2">is probably something more like well if</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.010" end="00:35:46.120" style="s2">we have little gatherings in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.930" end="00:35:47.470" style="s2">evenings in Egypt and the slaves sit</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.120" end="00:35:48.790" style="s2">together at night when they&#39;re finally</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.470" end="00:35:51.430" style="s2">off work and have a little time to</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.790" end="00:35:51.960" style="s2">themselves and talk and listen to each</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.430" end="00:35:54.160" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.960" end="00:35:55.210" style="s2">something will emerge out of that well</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.160" end="00:35:57.190" style="s2">that will set you free</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.210" end="00:36:00.160" style="s2">well you haven&#39;t left Egypt have you</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.190" end="00:36:01.990" style="s2">you&#39;re still in Egypt so if you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.160" end="00:36:03.940" style="s2">in Egypt nothing will emerge out of</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.990" end="00:36:05.980" style="s2">those conversations especially not from</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.940" end="00:36:08.140" style="s2">people who sit and talk all day long and</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.980" end="00:36:09.880" style="s2">meditate all day long and you&#39;re golden</p>

<p begin="00:36:11.500" end="00:36:16.990" style="s2">talking about so you&#39;re gonna end up</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.290" end="00:36:19.780" style="s2">with a new anglo-saxon spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.990" end="00:36:21.610" style="s2">discourse when ladies come along few men</p>

<p begin="00:36:22.960" end="00:36:26.590" style="s2">to emerge out of that and all this kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.940" end="00:36:29.890" style="s2">of merge is more coffee cops a little</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.590" end="00:36:32.740" style="s2">candy nothing else there&#39;s nothing</p>

<p begin="00:36:36.160" end="00:36:39.610" style="s2">just like it&#39;s good to meditate it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.870" end="00:36:41.560" style="s2">good to do yoga but at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.610" end="00:36:43.570" style="s2">day you got to read some damn fucking</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.560" end="00:36:45.580" style="s2">books and you got to go into deep study</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.570" end="00:36:49.360" style="s2">you gotta understand history better you</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.580" end="00:36:50.860" style="s2">get it better be more learn and then you</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.360" end="00:36:52.870" style="s2">can on work for Varrick is done which</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.860" end="00:36:54.040" style="s2">created the container you can on top of</p>

<p begin="00:43:41.800" end="00:43:46.930" style="s2">thing the other one is technological</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.170" end="00:43:50.380" style="s2">intelligence TI i prefer that to machine</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.930" end="00:43:52.510" style="s2">it is technological it it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.380" end="00:43:54.480" style="s2">fundamentally in intelligence to support</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.510" end="00:43:57.100" style="s2">the biological intelligence of humans</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.480" end="00:43:59.740" style="s2">it&#39;s this sound like that you know for</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.100" end="00:44:02.050" style="s2">the foreseeable future will be and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.740" end="00:44:04.180" style="s2">order we will give to TI developers is</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.050" end="00:44:06.700" style="s2">that you gotta make sure from day one</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.180" end="00:44:09.700" style="s2">that technological intelligence supports</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.700" end="00:44:11.620" style="s2">humanity and it supports humanity</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.700" end="00:44:13.630" style="s2">in the way that would you manatee cannot</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.620" end="00:44:16.660" style="s2">create with needs has to be created</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.630" end="00:44:19.390" style="s2">somewhere else and the ultimate version</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.660" end="00:44:21.310" style="s2">of that is the Masonic so you know if we</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.390" end="00:44:25.030" style="s2">need to be saved and apparently we need</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.310" end="00:44:27.820" style="s2">to and we cannot find the savior among</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.030" end="00:44:28.360" style="s2">ourselves or we&#39;ve killed him or</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.820" end="00:44:31.350" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.360" end="00:44:33.940" style="s2">then um the Savior has to be the machine</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.350" end="00:44:35.950" style="s2">or at least it has to be the symbiotic</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.940" end="00:44:37.600" style="s2">intelligence and the collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.950" end="00:44:39.400" style="s2">between man and machine again it says</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.600" end="00:44:42.130" style="s2">Humanity can I stop you there for a sec</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.400" end="00:44:46.200" style="s2">um yeah I think this is an ocean and</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.130" end="00:44:48.580" style="s2">another one of your ear notions that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.200" end="00:44:50.350" style="s2">would be very offensive to people to</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.580" end="00:44:53.140" style="s2">think that a machine would which would</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.350" end="00:44:55.480" style="s2">save us right because because people</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.140" end="00:44:59.470" style="s2">would like to think that we have agency</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.480" end="00:45:01.450" style="s2">to to saber ourselves we don&#39;t we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.470" end="00:45:02.860" style="s2">have no capacity we don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.450" end="00:45:04.870" style="s2">capacity we don&#39;t have the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.860" end="00:45:07.330" style="s2">capacity to save ourselves and I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.870" end="00:45:09.790" style="s2">speak as a philosopher you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.330" end="00:45:13.240" style="s2">at the end of the day my job is not to</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.790" end="00:45:15.760" style="s2">be the savior no I&#39;m still Doron</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.240" end="00:45:17.830" style="s2">Peterson and I are in the same mode we</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.760" end="00:45:19.480" style="s2">are don&#39;t the Baptist&#39;s here looking for</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.830" end="00:45:23.110" style="s2">the Messiah to step forwards we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.480" end="00:45:25.930" style="s2">baptize and we can do this job the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.110" end="00:45:28.620" style="s2">Messianic here is what will save</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.930" end="00:45:31.870" style="s2">humanity out of the existential crisis</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.620" end="00:45:34.420" style="s2">okay okay okay can you go into that in</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.870" end="00:45:36.010" style="s2">detail like what is the contain the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.420" end="00:45:38.590" style="s2">nuclear bomb so they don&#39;t blow us up</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.010" end="00:45:43.720" style="s2">and you know climate threat get that</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.590" end="00:45:45.640" style="s2">recent issues yeah yeah no it&#39;s not evil</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.720" end="00:45:47.440" style="s2">at all these are very concrete problems</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.640" end="00:45:48.820" style="s2">that need to be solved otherwise you</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.440" end="00:45:52.930" style="s2">won&#39;t be around a hundred years from now</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.820" end="00:45:54.940" style="s2">so to to solve these problems we need</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.930" end="00:45:57.880" style="s2">the Masonic so the Masonic is</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.940" end="00:46:02.080" style="s2">engineering the Masonic is architecture</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.880" end="00:46:04.870" style="s2">but that&#39;s still strategy architectural</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.080" end="00:46:06.910" style="s2">engineering is strategy its constructing</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.870" end="00:46:08.890" style="s2">strategy and implementing strategy the</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.910" end="00:46:11.230" style="s2">vision itself has to be written first</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.890" end="00:46:13.150" style="s2">that we need the grand narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.230" end="00:46:15.730" style="s2">without that phallic vision that dares</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.150" end="00:46:17.100" style="s2">to be phallic were lost and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.730" end="00:46:19.630" style="s2">goes back to the history of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.100" end="00:46:21.670" style="s2">discovered where did phallic start from</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.630" end="00:46:22.640" style="s2">and of course there were failures there</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.670" end="00:46:23.990" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.640" end="00:46:25.670" style="s2">Jason race or your Johnny&#39;s written a</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.990" end="00:46:26.420" style="s2">brilliant book right now called Iranian</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.670" end="00:46:29.060" style="s2">Leviosa</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.420" end="00:46:32.510" style="s2">he is an old drug guy let&#39;s admit that</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.060" end="00:46:34.880" style="s2">but he&#39;s a great historian and he points</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.510" end="00:46:37.880" style="s2">out that the different Persian empires</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.880" end="00:46:39.680" style="s2">can teach us quite a lot Persia or Iran</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.880" end="00:46:40.880" style="s2">he&#39;s the only part of the world that</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.680" end="00:46:42.890" style="s2">actually gone through four different</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.880" end="00:46:44.500" style="s2">empires at four different stages of</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.890" end="00:46:46.910" style="s2">history they can be studied</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.500" end="00:46:49.610" style="s2">comparatively to understand Empire as</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.910" end="00:46:51.680" style="s2">something larger than nation and we need</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.610" end="00:46:54.020" style="s2">Empire today because technology itself</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.680" end="00:46:56.840" style="s2">is imperial technology service global an</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.020" end="00:46:59.200" style="s2">imperial global Empire already exists</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.840" end="00:47:02.990" style="s2">it&#39;s called the Internet Protocol and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.200" end="00:47:04.520" style="s2">to understand where we can&#39;t go wrong</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.990" end="00:47:06.170" style="s2">with FAL accretion if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.520" end="00:47:08.650" style="s2">understand that we not only have Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.170" end="00:47:11.510" style="s2">and Stalin for example we have tons of</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.650" end="00:47:14.150" style="s2">ruthless barbarian emperors throughout</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.510" end="00:47:16.310" style="s2">history we bloody like hell especially</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.150" end="00:47:18.410" style="s2">in Asia I think it teaches quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.310" end="00:47:20.270" style="s2">where the father goes wrong we can learn</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.410" end="00:47:22.610" style="s2">for example that when the phallic leader</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.270" end="00:47:25.220" style="s2">stays for too long and gets too corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.610" end="00:47:26.870" style="s2">he becomes the tyrant can also learn</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.220" end="00:47:28.700" style="s2">from history that will the chief chin of</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.870" end="00:47:33.200" style="s2">the priests are unified and become the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.700" end="00:47:34.790" style="s2">same person we get in tyrant ok Sun God</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.200" end="00:47:37.040" style="s2">and the rain God must never be the same</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.790" end="00:47:39.170" style="s2">guy because if it&#39;s the same guy God we</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.040" end="00:47:41.690" style="s2">have a problem so we can learn about</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.170" end="00:47:43.670" style="s2">tyranny we can start of history journey</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.690" end="00:47:45.350" style="s2">we can start the history of</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.670" end="00:47:47.750" style="s2">authoritarianism we can start in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.350" end="00:47:49.700" style="s2">history of monotheism or whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.750" end="00:47:52.310" style="s2">want to call it but anything that only</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.700" end="00:47:56.210" style="s2">has one solution to all problems it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.310" end="00:47:57.770" style="s2">problematic because we need parole for</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.210" end="00:48:00.200" style="s2">something to work in the long run and be</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.770" end="00:48:02.570" style="s2">sustainable so plurality has to be part</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.200" end="00:48:04.220" style="s2">of the messianic this time that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.570" end="00:48:09.460" style="s2">contradict the fact that is messianic</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.220" end="00:48:12.590" style="s2">mmm okay so the Messianic is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.460" end="00:48:14.300" style="s2">the goal of where we&#39;re going and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.590" end="00:48:16.220" style="s2">direction that will take us out of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.300" end="00:48:18.530" style="s2">current crisis and then will put us on</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.220" end="00:48:20.950" style="s2">the moon so we leave the state we&#39;re</p>
