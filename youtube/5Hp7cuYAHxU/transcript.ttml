<p begin="00:00:01.040" end="00:00:06.330" style="s2">welcome to the stola the stoah is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.959" end="00:00:08.910" style="s2">digital campfire where we go here and</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.910" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">night&#39;s edge what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.949" end="00:00:27.740" style="s2">all right welcome to the stoah and this</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.300" end="00:00:30.140" style="s2">was supposed to be posted for a couple</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.740" end="00:00:32.629" style="s2">of days ago but just admin stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.140" end="00:00:35.480" style="s2">couldn&#39;t just slip through the cracks I</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.629" end="00:00:36.920" style="s2">kind of like it this way because you</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.480" end="00:00:43.160" style="s2">know this is probably going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.920" end="00:00:47.449" style="s2">messy experiment and um so the idea here</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.160" end="00:00:50.210" style="s2">is Jason Jared and myself when we last</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.449" end="00:00:51.830" style="s2">talked about mimetic mediation we had</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.210" end="00:00:53.839" style="s2">this notion of having this campfire</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.830" end="00:00:56.269" style="s2">all right this digital campfire and</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.839" end="00:00:59.420" style="s2">people gather around and kind of talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.269" end="00:01:02.900" style="s2">shop mediation shop about what people</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.420" end="00:01:04.309" style="s2">would be good to have around the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.900" end="00:01:07.100" style="s2">campfire together what kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.309" end="00:01:09.979" style="s2">mimetic opponents to have and just have</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.100" end="00:01:14.150" style="s2">a heart-to-heart conversation about what</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.979" end="00:01:15.740" style="s2">they believe to be true and so what we</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.150" end="00:01:18.200" style="s2">thought were kind of our ruff workshop</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.740" end="00:01:20.510" style="s2">for today was that Jason Jared and</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.200" end="00:01:22.100" style="s2">myself maybe just talked for like 5-10</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.510" end="00:01:23.810" style="s2">minutes about what we&#39;re doing here and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.100" end="00:01:28.510" style="s2">then we&#39;ll open it up to group</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.810" end="00:01:32.840" style="s2">discussion so that being said I will</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.510" end="00:01:39.040" style="s2">unmute Jason and Jared and we could</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.840" end="00:01:43.610" style="s2">begin thanks thank you thank you Peter</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.040" end="00:01:46.670" style="s2">well maybe just a brief intro the term</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.610" end="00:01:49.640" style="s2">yeah of America mediation was coined</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.670" end="00:01:53.120" style="s2">actually by Peter and his article with</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.640" end="00:01:55.670" style="s2">Connor Barnes and since then you know a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.120" end="00:01:57.920" style="s2">bunch a bunch of folks have have been</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.670" end="00:01:59.600" style="s2">kind of you know thinking about that</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.920" end="00:02:02.299" style="s2">term trying to trying to think how it</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.600" end="00:02:04.760" style="s2">can be applied you know writing about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.299" end="00:02:06.620" style="s2">there&#39;s like a letter wiki I&#39;m between</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.760" end="00:02:09.530" style="s2">me and Peter but there&#39;s also more of an</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.620" end="00:02:11.780" style="s2">open source document and the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.530" end="00:02:14.379" style="s2">basically it&#39;s nothing really new but</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.780" end="00:02:17.950" style="s2">it&#39;s just you know it seems to be that</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.379" end="00:02:22.430" style="s2">especially online there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.950" end="00:02:24.040" style="s2">warring subgroups with people that might</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.430" end="00:02:27.260" style="s2">have more in common than they think and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.040" end="00:02:29.670" style="s2">especially in these days when we need in</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.260" end="00:02:31.740" style="s2">my view a more decentralized distributed</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.670" end="00:02:33.569" style="s2">networked alternative to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.740" end="00:02:35.550" style="s2">establishment which in certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.569" end="00:02:37.050" style="s2">institutions that seemed not to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.550" end="00:02:38.819" style="s2">working you know we need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.050" end="00:02:40.200" style="s2">talk to each other and make sense with</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.819" end="00:02:41.940" style="s2">each other even if we don&#39;t like each</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.200" end="00:02:43.440" style="s2">other so I thought I&#39;d just give that</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.940" end="00:02:45.720" style="s2">little intro and that&#39;s kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.440" end="00:02:48.209" style="s2">brought us brought us here is something</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.720" end="00:02:50.190" style="s2">that you know we&#39;ve been writing about</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.209" end="00:02:59.220" style="s2">anything about for a while but just an</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.190" end="00:03:01.260" style="s2">open source concept yeah and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.220" end="00:03:07.470" style="s2">in our last conversation for those who</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.260" end="00:03:11.310" style="s2">didn&#39;t here we&#39;re kind of were exploring</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.470" end="00:03:14.760" style="s2">a bit of the boundaries between kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.310" end="00:03:17.940" style="s2">deliberate and structured mediation</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.760" end="00:03:22.110" style="s2">versus implicit kind of emergent</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.940" end="00:03:24.239" style="s2">mediation and I think both of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.110" end="00:03:28.380" style="s2">things these these approaches you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.239" end="00:03:30.420" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of bottom-up top-down approach</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.380" end="00:03:34.890" style="s2">to this need to be considered for sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.420" end="00:03:37.590" style="s2">and and yeah this is I mean maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.890" end="00:03:40.100" style="s2">is a way of building some structure a</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.590" end="00:03:42.900" style="s2">bit of a place for us to start</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.100" end="00:03:44.880" style="s2">collaborating and and see what emerges</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.900" end="00:03:47.579" style="s2">so so yeah thanks Peter for for creating</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.880" end="00:03:50.910" style="s2">the structure and the forum for this -</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.579" end="00:03:52.980" style="s2">for this emergent exploration - to come</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.910" end="00:03:55.290" style="s2">up my pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.980" end="00:03:57.239" style="s2">so the question I have for you two guys</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.290" end="00:03:59.730" style="s2">looking maybe we can jam for a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.239" end="00:04:05.190" style="s2">minutes it&#39;s coming to mind is this a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.730" end="00:04:06.180" style="s2">street I did recently about like if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.190" end="00:04:10.350" style="s2">right now I don&#39;t really give a</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.180" end="00:04:12.090" style="s2">about the medium of broadcast of content</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.350" end="00:04:13.820" style="s2">broadcast like oh my podcast with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.090" end="00:04:16.680" style="s2">YouTube channel I have I just threw up</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.820" end="00:04:18.390" style="s2">and I thought it like huh there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.680" end="00:04:20.489" style="s2">conflation sometimes between the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.390" end="00:04:23.789" style="s2">of a community that arises in these</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.489" end="00:04:27.479" style="s2">domains versus the actual like broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.789" end="00:04:30.479" style="s2">output of it the medium for that and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.479" end="00:04:34.080" style="s2">like huh so if you kind of focus more on</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.479" end="00:04:35.250" style="s2">the ladder the medium for content</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.080" end="00:04:37.540" style="s2">broadcasting that&#39;s going to create a</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.250" end="00:04:39.310" style="s2">medic tribes</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.540" end="00:04:41.290" style="s2">but if you focus on this digital</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.310" end="00:04:43.090" style="s2">campfire and build real communities</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.290" end="00:04:47.560" style="s2">around it there&#39;s a potential to create</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.090" end="00:04:48.940" style="s2">embody tribes so that&#39;s coming to my</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.560" end="00:04:52.630" style="s2">right now just maybe wanted to see if</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.940" end="00:04:54.340" style="s2">anything landed there for you guys yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.630" end="00:04:55.690" style="s2">so maybe maybe flesh out a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.340" end="00:04:58.810" style="s2">what we talked about with it with this</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.690" end="00:05:00.760" style="s2">idea from what I remember is that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.810" end="00:05:02.260" style="s2">know I know a few people have been kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.760" end="00:05:04.420" style="s2">of thinking along these lines of having</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.260" end="00:05:07.390" style="s2">say a YouTube channel that that is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.420" end="00:05:09.130" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of a you know it might be</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.390" end="00:05:11.230" style="s2">managed by somebody but you know you</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.130" end="00:05:13.510" style="s2">might you can have any kind of set of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.230" end="00:05:16.420" style="s2">people you know could be a pair three</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.510" end="00:05:18.070" style="s2">people who can record something and put</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.420" end="00:05:20.770" style="s2">it on you know put it on this channel</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.070" end="00:05:23.170" style="s2">that you know is basically with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.770" end="00:05:24.970" style="s2">theme of you know trying to have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.170" end="00:05:26.770" style="s2">sincere and constructive conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.970" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">and so you know it might be people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.770" end="00:05:31.540" style="s2">would you know have been beefing on</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:34.960" style="s2">Twitter or you know and some other</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.540" end="00:05:36.250" style="s2">platform and you know they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:37.600" style="s2">really having a constructive dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.250" end="00:05:40.660" style="s2">with each other it was getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.600" end="00:05:42.760" style="s2">contentious and this would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.660" end="00:05:44.320" style="s2">opportunity to be like kind of like with</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.760" end="00:05:46.720" style="s2">letter wiki it&#39;s like hey why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.320" end="00:05:49.060" style="s2">folks write a letter to each other well</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.720" end="00:05:51.310" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.060" end="00:05:53.080" style="s2">analogy analog of that but on on</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.310" end="00:05:55.540" style="s2">something like YouTube or some other</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.080" end="00:05:57.520" style="s2">video platform where you could be like</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.540" end="00:06:00.340" style="s2">hey let&#39;s get on and have a recorded</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.520" end="00:06:03.070" style="s2">video and I guess doesn&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.340" end="00:06:04.750" style="s2">recorded but and so this channel would</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.070" end="00:06:06.550" style="s2">just be you know you would see this you</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.750" end="00:06:08.170" style="s2">go to the channel and you&#39;d be like you</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.550" end="00:06:10.510" style="s2">know whoever&#39;s part of this network and</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.170" end="00:06:12.040" style="s2">and who wants to you know so maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.510" end="00:06:14.230" style="s2">would sign up like letter wiki whoever</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.040" end="00:06:15.700" style="s2">wants to sign up and be you know start a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.230" end="00:06:17.200" style="s2">conversation they can do that and put it</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.700" end="00:06:20.050" style="s2">up to the channel is that is that kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.200" end="00:06:22.510" style="s2">of what you had in mind Peter for this</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.050" end="00:06:25.810" style="s2">digital campfire thing yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.510" end="00:06:28.990" style="s2">something like that it&#39;s I guess to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.810" end="00:06:34.150" style="s2">even more central was just a space for</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.990" end="00:06:37.240" style="s2">people to kind of spit ball and workshop</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.150" end="00:06:38.860" style="s2">about what would be how to have an</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.240" end="00:06:40.180" style="s2">emetic mediate in this Lana liminal war</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.860" end="00:06:42.940" style="s2">that were in her culture war that were</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.180" end="00:06:45.220" style="s2">in and because when I talked to you</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.940" end="00:06:46.840" style="s2">yesterday you mentioned you know that</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.220" end="00:06:48.940" style="s2">certain spat or beef that is happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.840" end="00:06:50.260" style="s2">and I wasn&#39;t aware of it or you talked</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.940" end="00:06:50.960" style="s2">about any also talked about Richard and</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.260" end="00:06:52.610" style="s2">Jack</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.960" end="00:06:54.320" style="s2">yeah and I don&#39;t know that they had a</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.610" end="00:06:55.970" style="s2">spat I might go I said hurt and that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.320" end="00:06:57.139" style="s2">just like you know you nailed that match</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.970" end="00:06:58.460" style="s2">right there and I don&#39;t know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.139" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">gonna happen but that&#39;s a perfect match</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.460" end="00:07:04.580" style="s2">and I am I was ignorant of that panis</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:05.810" style="s2">fat but if we have more people gather</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.580" end="00:07:08.539" style="s2">around the digital campfire that</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.810" end="00:07:09.770" style="s2">resonate with mimetic mediation then we</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.539" end="00:07:11.990" style="s2">can kind of source out those those</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.770" end="00:07:14.000" style="s2">potential matches and then brainstorm</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.990" end="00:07:15.320" style="s2">ways to figure out how to make it happen</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.000" end="00:07:18.410" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.320" end="00:07:20.509" style="s2">so I think that is the the essence yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.410" end="00:07:23.000" style="s2">and one thing I would like to emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.509" end="00:07:24.979" style="s2">and maybe maybe you might disagree but</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.000" end="00:07:26.240" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t even have to be on the topic</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.979" end="00:07:28.250" style="s2">of what they were spouting about it</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.240" end="00:07:31.130" style="s2">could just be a conversation getting to</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.250" end="00:07:32.419" style="s2">know each other and and they can you</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.130" end="00:07:35.330" style="s2">know do that without recording or they</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.419" end="00:07:36.860" style="s2">could record it it could also be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.330" end="00:07:37.940" style="s2">like we&#39;re doing here with a group where</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.860" end="00:07:41.120" style="s2">you know they&#39;re having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.940" end="00:07:42.910" style="s2">for 20 minutes or so and then they open</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.120" end="00:07:44.990" style="s2">it up and other people can kind of help</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.910" end="00:07:46.039" style="s2">diagnose what you know if there is</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.990" end="00:07:48.919" style="s2">disagreement where is the source</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.039" end="00:07:50.300" style="s2">disagreement you know to kind of of</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.919" end="00:07:53.750" style="s2">course you know you&#39;d you&#39;d want it to</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.300" end="00:07:55.940" style="s2">be people who you know that that weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.750" end="00:07:58.430" style="s2">you know rushing to one side and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.940" end="00:08:01.580" style="s2">know something like that it would be you</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.430" end="00:08:05.389" style="s2">know people who could play the role of</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.580" end="00:08:07.729" style="s2">memetic mediators I guess yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.389" end="00:08:10.000" style="s2">or Eggman you know performative agnostic</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.729" end="00:08:12.470" style="s2">or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.000" end="00:08:16.190" style="s2">yeah something that&#39;s that&#39;s coming up</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.470" end="00:08:19.039" style="s2">for me and I know I mentioned it before</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.190" end="00:08:21.590" style="s2">I&#39;m definitely not allergic to conflict</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.039" end="00:08:25.729" style="s2">and I know that the conflict is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.590" end="00:08:27.760" style="s2">inherent in the selection of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.729" end="00:08:32.599" style="s2">people here if we&#39;re kind of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.760" end="00:08:34.580" style="s2">bridge ideological or tribal gaps but I</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.599" end="00:08:39.080" style="s2">do think you know to kind of keep with</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.580" end="00:08:41.240" style="s2">this metaphor of the campfire the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.080" end="00:08:42.800" style="s2">reason that it one of the components</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.240" end="00:08:45.140" style="s2">that seems to be very rich there is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.800" end="00:08:51.320" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of a warmth right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.140" end="00:08:54.110" style="s2">like providing a you know a a source of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.320" end="00:08:59.060" style="s2">life for everybody involved so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.110" end="00:09:01.790" style="s2">kind of like a an inherent positive</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.060" end="00:09:04.070" style="s2">frame that needs to be included as in as</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.790" end="00:09:05.060" style="s2">well and and that being said</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.070" end="00:09:06.560" style="s2">you know this doesn&#39;t have weight I</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.060" end="00:09:09.649" style="s2">don&#39;t want to like systematize it so</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.560" end="00:09:11.839" style="s2">much but I think if we can think about</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.649" end="00:09:13.279" style="s2">how we&#39;re framing these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.839" end="00:09:16.220" style="s2">depending on who&#39;s going to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.279" end="00:09:17.930" style="s2">conversations it&#39;ll be very important</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.220" end="00:09:20.509" style="s2">and sometimes that I think that&#39;ll mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.930" end="00:09:22.310" style="s2">that we have to find some topic that</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.509" end="00:09:24.769" style="s2">there&#39;s some agreement already on and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.310" end="00:09:26.810" style="s2">maybe seeing you know slightly to tell</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.769" end="00:09:28.579" style="s2">you differences you know and then some</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.810" end="00:09:30.529" style="s2">some tribes are very comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.579" end="00:09:32.180" style="s2">conflict and they want to brawl it out</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.529" end="00:09:35.630" style="s2">and they&#39;re fine and afterwards they can</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.180" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">hug and and and you know and and and not</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.630" end="00:09:40.009" style="s2">not break any bridges or anything like</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.519" end="00:09:44.149" style="s2">that but there has to be some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.009" end="00:09:45.649" style="s2">conviviality or pro-social orientation I</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.149" end="00:09:48.380" style="s2">think if we gonna if we&#39;re gonna be set</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.649" end="00:09:49.790" style="s2">in these these dialogues up so so it</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.380" end="00:09:52.130" style="s2">feels really live right now is something</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.790" end="00:09:54.350" style="s2">that both of you said I really like what</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.130" end="00:09:55.670" style="s2">you said Jason that you know doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.350" end="00:09:58.730" style="s2">have to be about disagreements it could</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.670" end="00:10:02.600" style="s2">just be about like relating in front of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.730" end="00:10:04.040" style="s2">the campfire yeah and it looks like at</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.600" end="00:10:05.990" style="s2">the edge of my thinking with all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.040" end="00:10:07.639" style="s2">mimetic tribal culture where stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.990" end="00:10:09.769" style="s2">all the propositions are just like red</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.639" end="00:10:11.720" style="s2">herrings for just sort of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.769" end="00:10:13.910" style="s2">like trigger beefs that they&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.720" end="00:10:16.100" style="s2">or emotional like you know they get</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.910" end="00:10:17.569" style="s2">triggered in a certain way and so and</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.100" end="00:10:19.639" style="s2">then going with to you what you just</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.569" end="00:10:23.180" style="s2">said Jared it&#39;s like finding the right</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.639" end="00:10:24.949" style="s2">angle or the right topic the right frame</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.180" end="00:10:27.560" style="s2">that like speech to both of their day</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.949" end="00:10:28.880" style="s2">moans and then setting up a situation so</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.560" end="00:10:30.440" style="s2">they gather around the digital campfire</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.880" end="00:10:34.370" style="s2">so they can have what you just described</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.440" end="00:10:35.990" style="s2">Jason mmm yeah well the question is how</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.370" end="00:10:37.220" style="s2">much do we set up the frame and how much</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.990" end="00:10:38.899" style="s2">do they set up the frame right because</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.220" end="00:10:42.019" style="s2">if they&#39;re if it&#39;s something like letter</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.899" end="00:10:43.790" style="s2">wiki where you know one person they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.019" end="00:10:45.350" style="s2">both signed up to the to let our wiki</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.790" end="00:10:47.029" style="s2">and they invite the other one to start a</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.350" end="00:10:48.410" style="s2">letter like they&#39;re the ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.029" end="00:10:50.990" style="s2">really setting the frame and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.410" end="00:10:54.350" style="s2">wondering how you know like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.990" end="00:10:56.149" style="s2">balance the individual is involved kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.350" end="00:10:58.850" style="s2">of setting the frame versus you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.149" end="00:11:03.230" style="s2">ensuring that you have some kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.850" end="00:11:06.200" style="s2">know conviviality and constructiveness</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.230" end="00:11:07.870" style="s2">to the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.200" end="00:11:11.350" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.870" end="00:11:13.820" style="s2">yeah it feels if you know my my</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.350" end="00:11:17.240" style="s2">intuition is that you know since there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.820" end="00:11:20.680" style="s2">going to be such a diversity in in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.240" end="00:11:22.940" style="s2">dynamics of who&#39;s going to be attending</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.680" end="00:11:25.459" style="s2">it feels like there there needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.940" end="00:11:29.089" style="s2">some it would be very beneficial to have</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.459" end="00:11:30.890" style="s2">some sort of process to go through and</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.089" end="00:11:33.560" style="s2">as I&#39;m thinking it through it might be</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.890" end="00:11:34.880" style="s2">you know answer these three questions as</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.560" end="00:11:38.870" style="s2">you&#39;re coming into it like you know what</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.880" end="00:11:41.149" style="s2">are your goals for this conversation you</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.870" end="00:11:42.709" style="s2">know what are you afraid of of being</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.149" end="00:11:44.660" style="s2">triggered by or something like that kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.709" end="00:11:46.310" style="s2">of error in your own ideological biases</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.660" end="00:11:48.050" style="s2">and making it transparent so that</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.310" end="00:11:49.880" style="s2">everybody&#39;s kind of aware of what the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.050" end="00:11:51.410" style="s2">agenda is and something like oh I I</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.880" end="00:11:53.930" style="s2">think we&#39;d have to like actually sit</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.410" end="00:11:55.630" style="s2">down and kind of think through and we</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.930" end="00:11:58.579" style="s2">can probably use some of the previous</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.630" end="00:11:59.990" style="s2">discussions and the letter wiki&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.579" end="00:12:01.820" style="s2">stuff like that to kind of boil down</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.990" end="00:12:03.200" style="s2">like these essential pork point points</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.820" end="00:12:06.170" style="s2">of memetic mediation and make sure each</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.200" end="00:12:07.790" style="s2">of them is kind of being is visible for</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.170" end="00:12:09.740" style="s2">everybody that&#39;s involved involved or</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.790" end="00:12:13.130" style="s2">something like that but I&#39;d like it for</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.740" end="00:12:15.709" style="s2">it to be to your point Jason something</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.130" end="00:12:17.990" style="s2">that they emerge that they arrive at and</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.709" end="00:12:19.279" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of meaning every time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.990" end="00:12:21.199" style="s2">gonna be a completely different frame</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.279" end="00:12:22.610" style="s2">that they&#39;re setting but people within</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.199" end="00:12:27.829" style="s2">the conversation Alonso that are doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.610" end="00:12:29.690" style="s2">it so let&#39;s open up to the group in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.829" end="00:12:31.220" style="s2">moment about let&#39;s maybe do one I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.690" end="00:12:32.300" style="s2">have a final thought and maybe we can do</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.220" end="00:12:36.110" style="s2">one around the final thoughts and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.300" end="00:12:37.610" style="s2">we&#39;ll open it up and ki just asked can</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.110" end="00:12:40.100" style="s2">someone define mimetic mediation for me</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.610" end="00:12:45.769" style="s2">please we&#39;re gonna let&#39;s pause that for</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.100" end="00:12:47.540" style="s2">a moment because this is sort of a let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.769" end="00:12:49.610" style="s2">pause that for a moment because I kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.540" end="00:12:54.019" style="s2">of want to kick out about this right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.610" end="00:12:56.899" style="s2">and not get to the 101 territory so the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.019" end="00:13:01.880" style="s2">final thought here is for me before we</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.899" end="00:13:06.890" style="s2">open up to the group is as the kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.880" end="00:13:08.390" style="s2">marketing angle and you know I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.890" end="00:13:09.589" style="s2">hundreds of events in person and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.390" end="00:13:10.850" style="s2">it&#39;s like you kind of like want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.589" end="00:13:14.120" style="s2">market a certain way and I&#39;ve done like</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.850" end="00:13:16.100" style="s2">35 events here the store already and how</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.120" end="00:13:18.050" style="s2">the event is marketed or how its framed</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.100" end="00:13:19.579" style="s2">how it&#39;s like the coin it attracts a</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.050" end="00:13:20.930" style="s2">certain people has like a bias to</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.579" end="00:13:21.160" style="s2">attract the filter is kind of for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.930" end="00:13:22.329" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.160" end="00:13:25.329" style="s2">people in a way it&#39;s marketed correctly</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.329" end="00:13:27.069" style="s2">and leaning into kind of my</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.329" end="00:13:28.389" style="s2">sensitivities on the culture war and</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.069" end="00:13:30.519" style="s2">being able to sort of method act all</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.389" end="00:13:31.930" style="s2">these different reality tunnels if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.519" end="00:13:35.230" style="s2">can do that well enough then you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.930" end="00:13:37.480" style="s2">kind of find the angle potentially of</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.230" end="00:13:38.649" style="s2">what speaks to them and they find the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.480" end="00:13:39.850" style="s2">angle at what speaks the other person</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.649" end="00:13:41.680" style="s2">and then maybe find the intersection</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.850" end="00:13:43.449" style="s2">between the two and then that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.680" end="00:13:47.319" style="s2">present to them like hey would you like</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.449" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">to come to the store for this so my side</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.319" end="00:13:50.949" style="s2">could be wrong here I do like the idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:52.389" style="s2">that we have to let it emerge but</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.949" end="00:13:54.550" style="s2">especially people are don&#39;t want to even</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.389" end="00:13:56.410" style="s2">talk to each other it&#39;s like almost like</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.550" end="00:13:59.199" style="s2">some of the the front end work it was on</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.410" end="00:14:04.300" style="s2">up to us to figure out how to seduce</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.199" end="00:14:05.560" style="s2">them in a way mm-hmm yeah so it seems</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.300" end="00:14:07.029" style="s2">like you could have both you could you</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.560" end="00:14:09.850" style="s2">could have you know something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.029" end="00:14:12.339" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of you know like one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.850" end="00:14:14.079" style="s2">somebody notices a couple people not</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.339" end="00:14:16.360" style="s2">having constructive dialogue but you</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.079" end="00:14:18.220" style="s2">know perhaps they could and they you</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.360" end="00:14:20.290" style="s2">know then they they workshop with a</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.220" end="00:14:22.779" style="s2">field of people marketing you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.290" end="00:14:24.550" style="s2">of a framing of the conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.779" end="00:14:27.040" style="s2">they present it to the folks and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.550" end="00:14:28.779" style="s2">they do it we&#39;re not and then people who</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.040" end="00:14:30.279" style="s2">spontaneously say like hey I&#39;ve had some</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.779" end="00:14:31.899" style="s2">like not-so-great interactions with use</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.279" end="00:14:33.579" style="s2">day on Twitter let&#39;s have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.899" end="00:14:35.079" style="s2">let&#39;s record it and let&#39;s let&#39;s just try</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.579" end="00:14:37.990" style="s2">and go into this with good faith and</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.079" end="00:14:39.759" style="s2">perhaps we can ask somebody else a third</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.990" end="00:14:41.800" style="s2">party to sit in there and be the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.759" end="00:14:43.990" style="s2">quote-unquote mediator you know not that</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.800" end="00:14:45.819" style="s2">the mediator will say much but you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.990" end="00:14:48.550" style="s2">we&#39;ll be somebody that both parties can</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.819" end="00:14:59.139" style="s2">trust to you know not not to tip the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.550" end="00:15:00.279" style="s2">scales in one direction or another yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.139" end="00:15:05.740" style="s2">it sounds like we&#39;ve thrown a lot out</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.279" end="00:15:08.589" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of curious yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.740" end="00:15:10.540" style="s2">so uh yeah just I&#39;m gonna set the frame</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.589" end="00:15:12.759" style="s2">here that this is a admittedly a</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.540" end="00:15:14.410" style="s2">high-level discussion and if you have no</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.759" end="00:15:16.180" style="s2">idea what the mimetic mediation is</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.410" end="00:15:17.980" style="s2">we did a Jason did a nice little brief</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.180" end="00:15:19.750" style="s2">intro so if you came late and of course</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.980" end="00:15:21.720" style="s2">that you missed that you can go to that</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.750" end="00:15:23.740" style="s2">cultural white paper and just search</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.720" end="00:15:25.480" style="s2">magnetic mediation to get maybe you just</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.740" end="00:15:27.189" style="s2">read that section of it but this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.480" end="00:15:28.569" style="s2">pretty high level and we&#39;re and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.189" end="00:15:30.240" style="s2">gonna keep it high level or at least I</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.569" end="00:15:33.639" style="s2">have a desire to keep it high level</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.240" end="00:15:35.080" style="s2">because that being said anything and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.639" end="00:15:36.820" style="s2">trust everyone&#39;s a sermon and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.080" end="00:15:38.980" style="s2">so just kind of unmute yourself let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.820" end="00:15:40.330" style="s2">see if everyone has that option we all</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.980" end="00:15:42.550" style="s2">have that option so just unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.330" end="00:15:44.230" style="s2">and just kind of share what what came</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.550" end="00:15:48.400" style="s2">alive for your what you you want to add</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.230" end="00:15:52.180" style="s2">to the conversation yeah sorry I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.400" end="00:15:54.900" style="s2">quickly interrupt I never talk to Jared</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.180" end="00:15:57.580" style="s2">directly hello Jared</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.900" end="00:16:01.690" style="s2">one thing I just like came up to me when</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.580" end="00:16:03.790" style="s2">when Jason was talking is um you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.690" end="00:16:05.860" style="s2">you described you know two people that</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.790" end="00:16:08.440" style="s2">had a disagreement on Twitter they then</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.860" end="00:16:12.310" style="s2">get into this space and then they have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.440" end="00:16:14.110" style="s2">third mediator right but then we also</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.310" end="00:16:17.350" style="s2">talked about okay what if we have other</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.110" end="00:16:19.690" style="s2">people in the space listening in and</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.350" end="00:16:23.170" style="s2">then after a 20 minute or 30 minute who</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.690" end="00:16:25.000" style="s2">knows how long back and forth these</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.170" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">people can then like now on mute or</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.000" end="00:16:30.190" style="s2">unmute themselves and then put in their</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:32.530" style="s2">you know inputs could state they I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.190" end="00:16:34.510" style="s2">that then you just have so much a wealth</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.530" end="00:16:36.910" style="s2">of information to draw from in so many</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.510" end="00:16:39.820" style="s2">different angles to perhaps yeah mediate</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.910" end="00:16:42.070" style="s2">between the two and that that could be</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.820" end="00:16:44.290" style="s2">super beneficial instead of just a third</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.070" end="00:16:48.010" style="s2">like just three people so what do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.290" end="00:16:51.310" style="s2">think of that mm-hm I think it might</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.010" end="00:16:53.530" style="s2">vary depending on on the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.310" end="00:16:54.430" style="s2">individual interaction so I mean one</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.530" end="00:16:57.190" style="s2">thing I&#39;d be concerned about with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.430" end="00:16:59.500" style="s2">big group is that you know it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.190" end="00:17:01.660" style="s2">pile-on on one side right and so it</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.500" end="00:17:04.089" style="s2">would have to be in the group people who</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.660" end="00:17:06.400" style="s2">could who could somewhat play the role</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.089" end="00:17:08.199" style="s2">of performative agnostic meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.400" end="00:17:10.839" style="s2">they can kind of put aside their views a</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.199" end="00:17:12.670" style="s2">little bit and just try to help clarify</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.839" end="00:17:14.770" style="s2">the conversation like like where people</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.670" end="00:17:16.660" style="s2">misunderstanding each other you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.770" end="00:17:18.970" style="s2">like like maybe when you said this you</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.660" end="00:17:20.770" style="s2">react this way they you know like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.970" end="00:17:21.790" style="s2">you were misinterpreting them and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.770" end="00:17:22.959" style="s2">know and they could you maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.790" end="00:17:25.480" style="s2">interpreted this way then the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.959" end="00:17:28.200" style="s2">person says is that fair to you and yes</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.480" end="00:17:30.340" style="s2">it kind of just how kind of mediate and</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.200" end="00:17:33.310" style="s2">the nice thing about just one or two</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.340" end="00:17:34.930" style="s2">mediators is that you can beforehand you</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.310" end="00:17:37.450" style="s2">know you can get the buy-in of both</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.930" end="00:17:41.860" style="s2">participants saying hey these two people</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.450" end="00:17:44.440" style="s2">you know do they you know do you you</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.860" end="00:17:47.320" style="s2">trust these two people enough to mediate</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.440" end="00:17:48.260" style="s2">this conversation but I think it will</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.320" end="00:17:49.760" style="s2">depends</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.260" end="00:17:51.950" style="s2">you know personally honest in this</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.760" end="00:17:54.169" style="s2">situation and I think sometimes having</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.950" end="00:17:57.200" style="s2">you know eight people like like now</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.169" end="00:17:59.870" style="s2">extra people make sense and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.200" end="00:18:02.030" style="s2">maybe maybe less or sometimes none you</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.870" end="00:18:04.549" style="s2">know if if the two people think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.030" end="00:18:06.620" style="s2">they can handle themselves you know and</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.549" end="00:18:09.320" style="s2">they don&#39;t need a third mediator they</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.620" end="00:18:10.970" style="s2">can also ought for that as well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.320" end="00:18:13.100" style="s2">what&#39;s coming to mind there is two it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.970" end="00:18:14.510" style="s2">like let&#39;s say if there&#39;s two matches or</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.100" end="00:18:15.950" style="s2">two people that we think would be good</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.510" end="00:18:19.730" style="s2">to talk to each other but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.950" end="00:18:20.600" style="s2">sort of resistance that they have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.730" end="00:18:23.030" style="s2">talk to one another</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.600" end="00:18:25.100" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s almost like when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.030" end="00:18:27.230" style="s2">viewing the stoah space is like being an</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.100" end="00:18:30.169" style="s2">artist of experience so each session is</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.230" end="00:18:32.780" style="s2">kind of different and it could be like</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.169" end="00:18:34.610" style="s2">you know United Jason did empathy</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.780" end="00:18:36.580" style="s2">circles for example right maybe although</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.610" end="00:18:38.960" style="s2">we do an empathy circle for one session</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.580" end="00:18:40.820" style="s2">maybe something&#39;s as simple as just</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.960" end="00:18:42.620" style="s2">sharing your emotional reality in front</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.820" end="00:18:45.140" style="s2">of someone you don&#39;t really like or you</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.620" end="00:18:47.240" style="s2">don&#39;t like their ideas and what keep the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.140" end="00:18:50.270" style="s2">mine was when Jack Murphy came on a a</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.240" end="00:18:51.590" style="s2">couple of days ago you know some</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.270" end="00:18:53.419" style="s2">sessions I opened up with like a sharing</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.590" end="00:18:54.919" style="s2">my emotional reality some we don&#39;t but I</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.419" end="00:18:56.900" style="s2">felt like you know what he has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.919" end="00:18:58.880" style="s2">his liminal kind of alpha males in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.900" end="00:18:59.720" style="s2">audience and you know he&#39;s like a alpha</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.880" end="00:19:01.280" style="s2">male so I&#39;m like you know I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.720" end="00:19:03.260" style="s2">share my emotional reality I&#39;m gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.280" end="00:19:05.720" style="s2">that I&#39;m nervous right now which I was</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.260" end="00:19:07.100" style="s2">and then that I think invited him to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.720" end="00:19:08.929" style="s2">that he was nervous because he shared it</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.100" end="00:19:10.340" style="s2">when he he went up is he thought like</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.929" end="00:19:11.000" style="s2">okay I&#39;m not a philosopher or like what</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.340" end="00:19:14.000" style="s2">am I doing here</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.000" end="00:19:15.890" style="s2">and I felt him more and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.000" end="00:19:17.210" style="s2">people felt the more so imagine if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.890" end="00:19:18.679" style="s2">like Richard and Jack just kind of share</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.210" end="00:19:21.470" style="s2">their emotions just some like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.679" end="00:19:27.559" style="s2">right and so they build that that bond</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.470" end="00:19:33.770" style="s2">beyond the propositions yeah that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.559" end="00:19:36.760" style="s2">I was gonna bring up is the whole point</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.770" end="00:19:41.510" style="s2">of a medic mediation the way I see it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.760" end="00:19:44.799" style="s2">not so much to resolve things at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.510" end="00:19:50.360" style="s2">mimetic level but to resolve things at a</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.799" end="00:19:55.850" style="s2">deeper embodied level like a felt like</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.360" end="00:20:00.020" style="s2">that the the felt bond with another</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.850" end="00:20:02.059" style="s2">person that when you</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.020" end="00:20:05.660" style="s2">to that place the propositions sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.059" end="00:20:07.610" style="s2">lose their there they&#39;re holding their</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.660" end="00:20:10.040" style="s2">strength on you and it&#39;s it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.610" end="00:20:12.590" style="s2">about that anymore it&#39;s like well these</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.040" end="00:20:16.340" style="s2">are just tools that we&#39;re using to try</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.590" end="00:20:18.590" style="s2">and figure things out together so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.340" end="00:20:23.630" style="s2">the vulnerability fostering</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.590" end="00:20:25.760" style="s2">vulnerability that aspect of mediation I</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.630" end="00:20:29.240" style="s2">think is really important and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.760" end="00:20:34.670" style="s2">about this a lot in terms of family and</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.240" end="00:20:39.080" style="s2">close friends in my local community like</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.670" end="00:20:42.320" style="s2">physical local community and people I</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.080" end="00:20:47.830" style="s2">already have some sort of a bond with</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.320" end="00:20:52.490" style="s2">and you know I&#39;ve just been mindful of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.830" end="00:20:55.940" style="s2">of up settling into that bond when I go</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.490" end="00:20:57.530" style="s2">to have a discussion you know about</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.940" end="00:21:00.350" style="s2">which you know there are propositions</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.530" end="00:21:03.890" style="s2">where we when we disagree about things</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.350" end="00:21:09.980" style="s2">it&#39;s like well let&#39;s get on the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.890" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">page at a deeper level and and then see</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.980" end="00:21:18.170" style="s2">where we&#39;re at and that that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:22.000" style="s2">make a huge difference at least at least</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.170" end="00:21:27.050" style="s2">for me when I when I&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.000" end="00:21:33.350" style="s2">someone else&#39;s worldview through that</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.050" end="00:21:37.610" style="s2">felt sense of shared relationality yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.350" end="00:21:44.260" style="s2">belonging with this person yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.610" end="00:21:46.700" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a the feeling into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.260" end="00:21:51.679" style="s2">evoked emotional responses and</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.700" end="00:21:54.170" style="s2">displaying it verbally is like you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.679" end="00:21:56.420" style="s2">it&#39;s a very quick way to do move out of</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.170" end="00:21:58.309" style="s2">the ideology and back into the body and</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.420" end="00:22:00.920" style="s2">then seeing that it&#39;s happening across</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.309" end="00:22:03.860" style="s2">the board it&#39;s creating some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.920" end="00:22:06.260" style="s2">connection or agreement that hey we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.860" end="00:22:08.900" style="s2">both bodies you know kind of we&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.260" end="00:22:12.160" style="s2">humans and so yeah the embodied</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.900" end="00:22:12.160" style="s2">component is really big</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.769" end="00:22:18.840" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s interesting you know on one</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.139" end="00:22:20.850" style="s2">end of the spectrum I think we had a</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.840" end="00:22:22.470" style="s2">Peter be in a conversation a while ago</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.850" end="00:22:24.389" style="s2">with some of the letter wiki folks and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.470" end="00:22:26.159" style="s2">we were talking about what a medic</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.389" end="00:22:28.860" style="s2">mediator would look like in that text</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.159" end="00:22:30.659" style="s2">form - and there&#39;s like a couple quick</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.860" end="00:22:32.669" style="s2">things that kind of came up you know one</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.659" end="00:22:35.399" style="s2">of them being like the loominator</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.669" end="00:22:36.600" style="s2">requesting a definition because they</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.399" end="00:22:39.960" style="s2">noticed that there were playing a</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.600" end="00:22:41.880" style="s2">semantics game or you know in this case</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.960" end="00:22:45.120" style="s2">we&#39;re saying hey let&#39;s do a state check</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.880" end="00:22:48.260" style="s2">and talk about our emotional place right</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.120" end="00:22:49.889" style="s2">now other times it could be you know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.260" end="00:22:51.240" style="s2">mediator especially in these</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.889" end="00:22:53.460" style="s2">conversations I think a lot of their</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.240" end="00:22:55.470" style="s2">values to kind of say hey I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.460" end="00:22:57.720" style="s2">that I agree with both of you but in</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.470" end="00:22:59.010" style="s2">different ways so it&#39;s like the fact</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.720" end="00:23:02.190" style="s2">that they could see that they that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.010" end="00:23:03.120" style="s2">possible to to agree on both sides even</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.190" end="00:23:05.460" style="s2">though they see you their selves as</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.120" end="00:23:06.690" style="s2">diametrically opposed it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.460" end="00:23:09.570" style="s2">there&#39;s you know there&#39;s a very large</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.690" end="00:23:12.269" style="s2">tool that can be wielded by the mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.570" end="00:23:16.679" style="s2">mediators and and if we were to make</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.269" end="00:23:18.419" style="s2">this if the mediators were if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.679" end="00:23:20.880" style="s2">lot of them as opposed to just a few key</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.419" end="00:23:22.289" style="s2">people it might be it might be good to</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.880" end="00:23:23.850" style="s2">kind of put together a toolkit as well</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.289" end="00:23:26.549" style="s2">you know like here are some of the go-to</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.850" end="00:23:28.950" style="s2">things like you know if things are going</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.549" end="00:23:30.870" style="s2">off the rails here&#39;s a here&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.950" end="00:23:33.380" style="s2">things in the playbook to kind of create</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.870" end="00:23:35.269" style="s2">some you know break the tension or the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.380" end="00:23:38.639" style="s2">conflict or something like that to you</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.269" end="00:23:43.529" style="s2">yeah just a random thought I&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.639" end="00:23:46.200" style="s2">come up Peter do you see so on one end</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.529" end="00:23:48.210" style="s2">of the spectrum we&#39;re talking about kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.200" end="00:23:54.149" style="s2">of an open space where it&#39;s many people</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.210" end="00:23:55.529" style="s2">can gather but like how how how often do</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.149" end="00:23:58.500" style="s2">you think there would be like a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.529" end="00:24:00.929" style="s2">common you know maybe it&#39;s us three that</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.500" end="00:24:02.909" style="s2">would be kind of setting the frame for</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.929" end="00:24:05.190" style="s2">this and maybe even interacting and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.909" end="00:24:07.500" style="s2">conversations or do we where we get the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.190" end="00:24:09.899" style="s2">open source route seems to be a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.500" end="00:24:12.269" style="s2">thing but you know it&#39;s it&#39;s also then</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.899" end="00:24:14.130" style="s2">something like a toolkit or creating</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.269" end="00:24:18.299" style="s2">some more method and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.130" end="00:24:20.309" style="s2">would be in hand at least needed what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.299" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">was thinking was just sort of like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.309" end="00:24:24.899" style="s2">I guess tease out the vision or the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.799" end="00:24:25.750" style="s2">impulse of this kind of event is I like</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.899" end="00:24:29.320" style="s2">the idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.750" end="00:24:31.480" style="s2">the three of us Griffen for five to 15</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.320" end="00:24:34.120" style="s2">minutes and then open up to the group to</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.480" end="00:24:36.100" style="s2">talk about what exactly madam AK</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.120" end="00:24:37.960" style="s2">mediation is for the Provost session or</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.100" end="00:24:41.830" style="s2">what it could be in this liminal war and</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.960" end="00:24:44.200" style="s2">then who would need to have you know to</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.830" end="00:24:46.270" style="s2">be mediated in the culture war and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.200" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">I kind of imagine like different maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.270" end="00:24:51.040" style="s2">whoever&#39;s inspired to go about it could</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:52.630" style="s2">just do like a project if you know like</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.040" end="00:24:54.370" style="s2">okay yeah like I can I can I could</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.630" end="00:24:55.930" style="s2">probably do it like a mash those two</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.370" end="00:24:57.940" style="s2">together and then you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.930" end="00:25:00.190" style="s2">emerges from this and I think if we</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.940" end="00:25:02.980" style="s2">record these and in broadcast some of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.190" end="00:25:04.540" style="s2">them if people don&#39;t veto it then I</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.980" end="00:25:06.820" style="s2">imagine that kind of inspiration could</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.540" end="00:25:09.430" style="s2">just spread so I I was definitely</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.820" end="00:25:12.940" style="s2">thinking the more open-source realm and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.430" end="00:25:14.680" style="s2">I also add I like the idea of a toolkit</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.940" end="00:25:16.690" style="s2">and it also could be just sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.680" end="00:25:18.970" style="s2">certain moves conversational moves</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.690" end="00:25:21.160" style="s2">someone could do to be a good mediator</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.970" end="00:25:22.870" style="s2">and what&#39;s coming alive right now I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.160" end="00:25:24.880" style="s2">just talking to Daniel if his engine</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.870" end="00:25:27.670" style="s2">does the metagame master my here at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.880" end="00:25:30.880" style="s2">store and you know that kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.670" end="00:25:33.460" style="s2">postmodern and skill set where you hear</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.880" end="00:25:35.260" style="s2">a word right like a verbal dispute if</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.460" end="00:25:37.210" style="s2">you hear a word that triggers someone</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.260" end="00:25:39.130" style="s2">and just kind of pause and then just</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.210" end="00:25:41.470" style="s2">allow the person to describe the felt</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.130" end="00:25:43.990" style="s2">sense reality of that word like how do</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.470" end="00:25:45.610" style="s2">they feel when they say it you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.990" end="00:25:46.570" style="s2">because like if you took think about any</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.610" end="00:25:48.160" style="s2">words like the Kyle was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.570" end="00:25:49.330" style="s2">how tomorrow died for me recently if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.160" end="00:25:50.800" style="s2">think that the concept of tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.330" end="00:25:53.560" style="s2">tomorrow has a certain felt since</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.800" end="00:25:55.030" style="s2">reality behind it and like forget about</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.560" end="00:25:56.620" style="s2">the propositional accuracy of what that</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.030" end="00:25:58.270" style="s2">what that really means but it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.620" end="00:26:01.720" style="s2">like flesh out what what do you feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.270" end="00:26:03.910" style="s2">like when racism comes up right or some</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.720" end="00:26:04.930" style="s2">other kind of hot term and just talk</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.910" end="00:26:06.580" style="s2">about and let&#39;s see if we can build a</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.930" end="00:26:09.000" style="s2">relationship with those emotional</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.580" end="00:26:09.000" style="s2">realities</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.869" end="00:26:16.590" style="s2">I think one thing that is the first well</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.879" end="00:26:19.879" style="s2">the first or second thing to decide is</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.590" end="00:26:25.639" style="s2">that who&#39;s what is the star of the show</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.879" end="00:26:31.379" style="s2">so is this role model is the mediator</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.639" end="00:26:34.289" style="s2">going to be visible and is that the star</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.379" end="00:26:39.809" style="s2">or is it is the mediator going to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.289" end="00:26:44.659" style="s2">invisible and is that the star or is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.809" end="00:26:52.099" style="s2">ultimate combination of a chord an</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.659" end="00:26:55.249" style="s2">agreement is that the star and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.099" end="00:27:01.789" style="s2">thinking I like the idea of warmth and</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.249" end="00:27:04.739" style="s2">so there have there has to be something</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.789" end="00:27:06.089" style="s2">there has to be either a visible or</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.739" end="00:27:10.909" style="s2">invisible</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.089" end="00:27:10.909" style="s2">you know structure somewhere right</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.269" end="00:27:19.379" style="s2">that&#39;s to make you don&#39;t want the all</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.769" end="00:27:23.460" style="s2">the videos to be just you know random</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.379" end="00:27:28.529" style="s2">videos you want them to be maybe proving</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.460" end="00:27:31.049" style="s2">a point or you know if it&#39;s emergent</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.529" end="00:27:36.029" style="s2">there&#39;s no who&#39;s going to want to watch</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.049" end="00:27:44.119" style="s2">1 through 10 videos that are all</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.029" end="00:27:44.119" style="s2">completely different that&#39;s my thought</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.009" end="00:27:49.120" style="s2">curious</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.440" end="00:27:52.690" style="s2">of others others in this group who</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.120" end="00:27:55.269" style="s2">haven&#39;t talked yet have any ideas I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.690" end="00:27:59.590" style="s2">speak to that but I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ll speak</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.269" end="00:28:02.379" style="s2">to it about it from a work approach so</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.590" end="00:28:05.519" style="s2">in terms of a conflict example you could</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.379" end="00:28:08.559" style="s2">throw me and Jordan on the table I</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.519" end="00:28:12.429" style="s2">haven&#39;t been gentleman by any means at</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.559" end="00:28:15.460" style="s2">the same time if your goal is the end</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.429" end="00:28:16.840" style="s2">product of developing a work then that</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.460" end="00:28:19.389" style="s2">needs to be what people are focused on</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.840" end="00:28:21.690" style="s2">by and large I don&#39;t care what</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.389" end="00:28:23.919" style="s2">your opinion is as long as it&#39;s informed</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.690" end="00:28:25.929" style="s2">if it&#39;s informed it could be different</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.919" end="00:28:28.419" style="s2">than mine so there&#39;s no requirement for</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.929" end="00:28:29.830" style="s2">any kind of concordance but if people</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.419" end="00:28:31.629" style="s2">are going to bring to the table</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.830" end="00:28:34.000" style="s2">and distractions that&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.629" end="00:28:36.159" style="s2">different deal so one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.000" end="00:28:38.740" style="s2">effective worth relationships I ever had</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.159" end="00:28:42.429" style="s2">was with this dude named Simon we always</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.740" end="00:28:44.289" style="s2">saw things 92 180 degrees different but</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.429" end="00:28:46.600" style="s2">we continuously push things back and</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.289" end="00:28:49.840" style="s2">forth back and forth by the time we were</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.600" end="00:28:50.950" style="s2">done we had a very optimal solution to</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.840" end="00:28:53.259" style="s2">whatever problem it was we were</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.950" end="00:28:55.419" style="s2">addressing at the time people need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.259" end="00:28:57.039" style="s2">set the ego stuff aside and start</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.419" end="00:28:58.840" style="s2">looking at what the big picture goal is</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.039" end="00:29:00.460" style="s2">and it&#39;s not attached to you it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.840" end="00:29:05.610" style="s2">attached to your outcome like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.460" end="00:29:05.610" style="s2">trying to do something bigger here I</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.659" end="00:29:13.029" style="s2">think some of the some of the community</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.419" end="00:29:15.580" style="s2">building needs to be around engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.029" end="00:29:17.980" style="s2">mutual projects together where there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.580" end="00:29:19.450" style="s2">some kind of difficulty because I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.980" end="00:29:20.950" style="s2">you need some commonality of shared</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.450" end="00:29:23.620" style="s2">experience in order to build a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.950" end="00:29:28.000" style="s2">community and if that experience is</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.620" end="00:29:32.919" style="s2">arduous then the depth of camaraderie is</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.000" end="00:29:34.450" style="s2">definitely higher yeah I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.919" end="00:29:37.000" style="s2">great point I mean of course the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.450" end="00:29:40.269" style="s2">challenge is you know this is mainly</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.000" end="00:29:41.799" style="s2">from online space you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.269" end="00:29:45.039" style="s2">hard to just get kind of you know I</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.799" end="00:29:47.470" style="s2">agree that having a larger goal in terms</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.039" end="00:29:50.409" style="s2">of you know why do we want to mediate</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.470" end="00:29:53.110" style="s2">with each other besides just everyone</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.409" end="00:29:56.980" style="s2">you know feeling nice about it well</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.110" end="00:29:59.230" style="s2">because you know there&#39;s a lot going on</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.980" end="00:30:01.179" style="s2">in the world right now and you know we</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.230" end="00:30:04.149" style="s2">need real collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.179" end="00:30:06.940" style="s2">to you know improve our response you</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.149" end="00:30:09.759" style="s2">know resilience and our collective</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.940" end="00:30:13.269" style="s2">intelligence and be able to actually you</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.759" end="00:30:15.789" style="s2">know make us you know make the world a</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.269" end="00:30:17.499" style="s2">better place I think a big chunk of that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.789" end="00:30:20.019" style="s2">is just bringing people more into adult</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.499" end="00:30:22.029" style="s2">mode instead of the coddling and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.019" end="00:30:24.279" style="s2">everybody okay well we&#39;re adults we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.029" end="00:30:26.080" style="s2">got to get done here if you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.279" end="00:30:28.509" style="s2">something that needs con that has some</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.080" end="00:30:30.339" style="s2">kind of attention take it offline but in</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.509" end="00:30:31.839" style="s2">the meantime there needs to be some kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.339" end="00:30:35.039" style="s2">of a focus even if it&#39;s just project</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.839" end="00:30:38.859" style="s2">based but I think a big part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.039" end="00:30:40.739" style="s2">encouraging people to develop the kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.859" end="00:30:44.409" style="s2">of skills that keep them in adult state</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.739" end="00:30:47.950" style="s2">so less on the body and the emotions but</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.409" end="00:30:51.190" style="s2">more I mean if there&#39;s always a balance</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.950" end="00:30:52.509" style="s2">between the getting caught up your</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.190" end="00:30:54.580" style="s2">theater head up your ass with hyper</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.509" end="00:30:58.229" style="s2">rationalism and not having any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.580" end="00:31:01.809" style="s2">grounded reality to you know emotional</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.229" end="00:31:03.789" style="s2">realism but at the same time the</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.809" end="00:31:05.979" style="s2">emotional stuff is almost always just a</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.789" end="00:31:09.190" style="s2">trap it&#39;s an easy way for people to</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.979" end="00:31:10.960" style="s2">throw their little hook in divert the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.190" end="00:31:12.789" style="s2">course of the conversation towards</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.960" end="00:31:15.129" style="s2">whatever and they&#39;re seeking for their</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.789" end="00:31:17.019" style="s2">own gratification as opposed to staying</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.129" end="00:31:18.700" style="s2">on focus to what the actual task is and</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.019" end="00:31:20.649" style="s2">doing the planning doing the exercises</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.700" end="00:31:24.940" style="s2">that need to get done to see that to</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.649" end="00:31:26.649" style="s2">fruition and I probably sound kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.940" end="00:31:30.099" style="s2">tactical because my background is soccer</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.649" end="00:31:31.960" style="s2">and systems architecture and heavily it</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.099" end="00:31:36.609" style="s2">towards the engineering side of things</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.960" end="00:31:39.330" style="s2">not a motive but in terms of having to</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.609" end="00:31:41.019" style="s2">get done in big complex situations</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.330" end="00:31:42.969" style="s2">that&#39;s how it works</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.019" end="00:31:46.649" style="s2">those are the tools that&#39;s need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.969" end="00:31:46.649" style="s2">engage in order to reach those goals</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.059" end="00:31:55.409" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.710" end="00:31:57.360" style="s2">interesting I think we&#39;re so at least in</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.409" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">my mind there&#39;s kind of an implied</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.360" end="00:32:04.340" style="s2">project in just the phrasing mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.240" end="00:32:07.380" style="s2">mediation and that is simply that</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.340" end="00:32:11.100" style="s2">decentralized and a collective approach</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.380" end="00:32:15.210" style="s2">to building a new new ways of operating</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.100" end="00:32:17.549" style="s2">and collaborating is not happening right</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.210" end="00:32:23.909" style="s2">now and so the mimetic mediation as</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.549" end="00:32:25.860" style="s2">opposed to being or it&#39;s predominantly</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.909" end="00:32:27.929" style="s2">focused on kind of the in-between space</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.860" end="00:32:30.000" style="s2">the in between projects right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.929" end="00:32:33.210" style="s2">like the more mediation that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.000" end="00:32:35.460" style="s2">the easier it is for ideas and memes to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.210" end="00:32:39.480" style="s2">prop cross propagate across different</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.460" end="00:32:41.100" style="s2">groups and then you know next time you</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.480" end="00:32:43.620" style="s2">know next time the software product is</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.100" end="00:32:46.080" style="s2">created it might take in to</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.620" end="00:32:48.270" style="s2">consideration different different lenses</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.080" end="00:32:49.799" style="s2">and ideas because they were talking to</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.270" end="00:32:51.870" style="s2">people that they weren&#39;t they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.799" end="00:32:53.669" style="s2">talking to previously and then other</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.870" end="00:32:56.460" style="s2">thing I&#39;d like to kind of throw out</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.669" end="00:32:59.730" style="s2">there as well is that I think conflict</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.460" end="00:33:01.740" style="s2">is you know the the predominant frame</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.730" end="00:33:03.840" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about here but I</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.740" end="00:33:05.909" style="s2">think that we can also talk about just</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.840" end="00:33:09.210" style="s2">simply disconnection I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.909" end="00:33:11.010" style="s2">these campfires should be getting people</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.210" end="00:33:13.200" style="s2">together that have no idea that they</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.010" end="00:33:16.020" style="s2">exist and maybe they don&#39;t even disagree</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.200" end="00:33:18.659" style="s2">but they need to be talking to each</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.020" end="00:33:21.000" style="s2">other right so it&#39;s like this is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.659" end="00:33:23.899" style="s2">this prop this cross propagation you</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.000" end="00:33:26.460" style="s2">know that the encouraging the</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.899" end="00:33:27.929" style="s2">permeability of the the membranes of</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.460" end="00:33:31.440" style="s2">each of our groups is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.929" end="00:33:33.570" style="s2">primary big-picture focus but you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.440" end="00:33:35.100" style="s2">Robert and and Jason both you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.570" end="00:33:38.909" style="s2">mentioning that it seems like there</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.100" end="00:33:41.399" style="s2">needs to be some more micro takeaways as</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.909" end="00:33:43.620" style="s2">well even if it&#39;s in one conversation or</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.399" end="00:33:45.610" style="s2">a smaller midterm project or something</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.620" end="00:33:48.909" style="s2">like that too</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.610" end="00:33:51.460" style="s2">I like the idea nothing as you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.909" end="00:33:53.980" style="s2">hard to think of what what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.460" end="00:33:57.580" style="s2">projects might be readily available to</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.980" end="00:34:00.820" style="s2">graft on to that yeah so I think I have</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.580" end="00:34:03.700" style="s2">something coming up and yeah what Jason</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.820" end="00:34:05.830" style="s2">said didn&#39;t resonate with me and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.700" end="00:34:08.200" style="s2">uh-oh kind of flesh out why and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.830" end="00:34:13.089" style="s2">kind of present my like working theory</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.200" end="00:34:16.359" style="s2">on this I do agree like I like the adult</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.089" end="00:34:18.159" style="s2">metaphor that an adult adults can get in</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.359" end="00:34:20.200" style="s2">the room together and figure out the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.159" end="00:34:21.490" style="s2">super ordinate goal that unites them</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.200" end="00:34:23.319" style="s2">there and then they kind of like to</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.490" end="00:34:25.960" style="s2">reason figure out what the to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.319" end="00:34:27.579" style="s2">right but when you&#39;re in a situation and</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.960" end="00:34:29.079" style="s2">like culture war 2.0 and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.579" end="00:34:31.569" style="s2">these medic tribes I understand reality</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.079" end="00:34:33.099" style="s2">differently how do you get them to have</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.569" end="00:34:35.260" style="s2">a super ordinate goal by just allowing</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.099" end="00:34:38.470" style="s2">them to talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.260" end="00:34:40.480" style="s2">they don&#39;t talk to each other and so I</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.470" end="00:34:42.639" style="s2">think the beats are the movements and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.480" end="00:34:45.790" style="s2">could be mistaken about this but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.639" end="00:34:48.520" style="s2">step one build the capacity for good</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.790" end="00:34:50.349" style="s2">faith right built the capacity to have</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.520" end="00:34:52.089" style="s2">good faith for someone and I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.349" end="00:34:53.440" style="s2">that&#39;s emotional capacity you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.089" end="00:34:54.940" style="s2">actually kind of like have a heart are</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.440" end="00:34:58.690" style="s2">connected with similar or kind of feel</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.940" end="00:35:00.609" style="s2">them then step two then reason together</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.690" end="00:35:02.230" style="s2">hey Jess like I get to get to the brass</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.609" end="00:35:06.880" style="s2">tacks of the proposition what&#39;s what is</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.230" end="00:35:09.970" style="s2">true and what not I will hold on and my</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.880" end="00:35:11.859" style="s2">sense is that that that is sort of one</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.970" end="00:35:13.450" style="s2">of the essence of the digital campfires</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.859" end="00:35:17.410" style="s2">to get that kind of heart-to-heart like</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.450" end="00:35:19.240" style="s2">what Jason said earlier and and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.410" end="00:35:22.240" style="s2">like the the trickster in me is like</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.240" end="00:35:25.799" style="s2">each session and this is the answer</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.240" end="00:35:28.089" style="s2">Roberts question each sort of memetic</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.799" end="00:35:30.280" style="s2">project that could emerge from these</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.089" end="00:35:32.950" style="s2">spitballing sessions could have its own</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.280" end="00:35:34.359" style="s2">super ordinate goal that speaks to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.950" end="00:35:36.780" style="s2">two people who should be speaking with</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.359" end="00:35:39.579" style="s2">each other so maybe it&#39;s an empathy to</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.780" end="00:35:41.380" style="s2">circles maybe it&#39;s an anti debate maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.579" end="00:35:44.290" style="s2">just a good old debate maybe it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.380" end="00:35:45.900" style="s2">like a sharing a circle so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.290" end="00:35:51.730" style="s2">came up</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.900" end="00:35:53.559" style="s2">second responder over my life experience</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.730" end="00:35:55.240" style="s2">I think it&#39;s less important to try to</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.559" end="00:35:56.559" style="s2">reach everybody as it as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.240" end="00:35:59.490" style="s2">reach the people who are actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.559" end="00:36:01.800" style="s2">thinking and they&#39;re not many of them</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.490" end="00:36:03.900" style="s2">they&#39;re hard to find but if we can get</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.800" end="00:36:04.830" style="s2">them working together then we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.900" end="00:36:07.500" style="s2">something to work with</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.830" end="00:36:09.600" style="s2">trying to bootstrap everybody up is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.500" end="00:36:11.580" style="s2">long and tedious and more time of</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.600" end="00:36:13.410" style="s2">fruitless process you need to build</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.580" end="00:36:15.180" style="s2">trust relationships on two vectors I</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.410" end="00:36:17.070" style="s2">need to trust your capacity and your</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.180" end="00:36:18.690" style="s2">intentions and the only way I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.070" end="00:36:21.680" style="s2">see that is through collaborations of</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.690" end="00:36:25.830" style="s2">experience working together I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.680" end="00:36:29.460" style="s2">speaking of trust I agree with that line</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.830" end="00:36:32.220" style="s2">of thinking and I should say that I also</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.460" end="00:36:34.740" style="s2">appreciate um the the intention of</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.220" end="00:36:36.900" style="s2">transparency and open source projects</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.740" end="00:36:39.840" style="s2">creating a toolkit and having a</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.900" end="00:36:42.000" style="s2">beneficial process to go through for</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.840" end="00:36:44.730" style="s2">like questions that can be answered for</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.000" end="00:36:49.170" style="s2">people to have these mimetic mediations</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.730" end="00:36:52.230" style="s2">um I&#39;d like to point out that I I enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.170" end="00:36:55.800" style="s2">the stola for the the the definitely</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.230" end="00:36:58.590" style="s2">experimental process that it can be and</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.800" end="00:37:00.990" style="s2">I am completely an intro and I keep</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.590" end="00:37:03.480" style="s2">saying that every time I do come onto</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.990" end="00:37:06.240" style="s2">the space because I am I really am</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.480" end="00:37:09.720" style="s2">learning from scratch uh these these</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.240" end="00:37:11.670" style="s2">kinds of philosophical topics so I say</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.720" end="00:37:16.740" style="s2">that and I started with trust because um</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.670" end="00:37:19.320" style="s2">I had to find this particular session I</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.740" end="00:37:21.120" style="s2">I went to the stellar calm which I go on</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.320" end="00:37:22.980" style="s2">there like every time to check out the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.120" end="00:37:25.020" style="s2">events and I&#39;m speaking in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.980" end="00:37:26.730" style="s2">tone because yeah this is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.020" end="00:37:29.760" style="s2">like personality then I go into the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.730" end="00:37:32.250" style="s2">stove Oh with sometimes um so I clicked</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.760" end="00:37:34.710" style="s2">on stove accom and I saw that this event</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.250" end="00:37:37.530" style="s2">um was going to be at 1:00 p.m. but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.710" end="00:37:40.170" style="s2">was on at 1:30 I was like oh wow it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.530" end="00:37:41.880" style="s2">probably already done um but I was like</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.170" end="00:37:43.530" style="s2">hey there&#39;s still a link here so I</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.880" end="00:37:46.590" style="s2">clicked on it clicked on it and it said</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.530" end="00:37:52.380" style="s2">3:30 on the Google Docs and like damn</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.590" end="00:37:54.150" style="s2">guys I can still join so I joined um and</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.380" end="00:37:55.860" style="s2">I&#39;m really glad that I did because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.150" end="00:37:57.690" style="s2">learning a lot and I and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.860" end="00:37:59.850" style="s2">participate in it and I love being able</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.690" end="00:38:01.740" style="s2">to participate in these things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.850" end="00:38:04.800" style="s2">learning from different types of people</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.740" end="00:38:07.830" style="s2">I love like project-based focuses on</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.800" end="00:38:12.960" style="s2">focus eyes focus I like a project-based</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.830" end="00:38:15.690" style="s2">focus because it does lead towards</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.960" end="00:38:20.240" style="s2">problem-solving methods that are framed</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.690" end="00:38:23.520" style="s2">in ways that lead to informed</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.240" end="00:38:28.740" style="s2">discussions and that balance of</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:31.020" style="s2">emotional the emotions and the the logic</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.740" end="00:38:33.690" style="s2">and the reason is is really really</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.020" end="00:38:36.960" style="s2">needed in all of us that embodied way of</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.690" end="00:38:41.010" style="s2">thinking and that um that that highly</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.960" end="00:38:44.280" style="s2">philosophical like logical proposition</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.010" end="00:38:46.200" style="s2">statements ideas are all are both</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.280" end="00:38:47.730" style="s2">important in their own ways so to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.200" end="00:38:49.650" style="s2">able to put those things together and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.730" end="00:38:51.240" style="s2">have the space to do so thank you Peter</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.650" end="00:38:53.130" style="s2">and thank you to the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.240" end="00:38:57.180" style="s2">coming in here so if you just need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.130" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">say those things I have a question so</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.180" end="00:39:01.290" style="s2">like Jason said right like people who</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.520" end="00:39:03.570" style="s2">can get things done they are the ones</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.290" end="00:39:05.160" style="s2">that matter and how Peter and the others</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.570" end="00:39:08.940" style="s2">are kind of trying to frame you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.160" end="00:39:11.460" style="s2">asking like you know what about the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.940" end="00:39:13.290" style="s2">others who want to come in and learn who</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.460" end="00:39:18.360" style="s2">want kind of help and kind of putting</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.290" end="00:39:19.770" style="s2">things together want to be a part so if</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.360" end="00:39:21.480" style="s2">we had mediate between these two</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.770" end="00:39:24.510" style="s2">different viewpoints the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.480" end="00:39:26.310" style="s2">again keeps coming up for me is the fact</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.510" end="00:39:28.590" style="s2">that you need a common shared project on</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.310" end="00:39:30.420" style="s2">which we can then distribute the</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.590" end="00:39:34.020" style="s2">processing right so if you distribute</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.420" end="00:39:36.060" style="s2">processing right everybody becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.020" end="00:39:38.070" style="s2">node everybody is allowed to go into</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.060" end="00:39:41.640" style="s2">their rabbit hole bring back what they</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.070" end="00:39:44.190" style="s2">can bring then we sit together and in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.640" end="00:39:46.650" style="s2">given particular context we examine that</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.190" end="00:39:48.360" style="s2">together right and those that need to</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.650" end="00:39:50.490" style="s2">take leaps take leave those that need to</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.360" end="00:39:51.780" style="s2">mediate mediate so each one kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.490" end="00:39:54.150" style="s2">moves on to the spectrum of their</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.780" end="00:39:56.100" style="s2">personality and they kind of like work</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.150" end="00:39:58.230" style="s2">on that project together from there we</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.100" end="00:40:00.270" style="s2">can actually see what words what is not</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.230" end="00:40:02.250" style="s2">work you know how other what are the</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.270" end="00:40:04.260" style="s2">frameworks we supposed to employ these</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.250" end="00:40:07.740" style="s2">kind of things because what we do it</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.260" end="00:40:09.150" style="s2">like what I do at my work right be</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.740" end="00:40:12.960" style="s2">building a platform where we are trying</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.150" end="00:40:15.870" style="s2">to see how we can allow people to kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.960" end="00:40:17.700" style="s2">of move out and distribute their</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.870" end="00:40:20.280" style="s2">cognitive capacity so rather than me</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.700" end="00:40:21.750" style="s2">trying to do something on my own how can</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.280" end="00:40:23.730" style="s2">I get for example let me just use an</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.750" end="00:40:25.530" style="s2">example this is easy right let&#39;s say I</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.730" end="00:40:26.490" style="s2">need to study about a subject cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.530" end="00:40:28.410" style="s2">psychology right</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.490" end="00:40:32.069" style="s2">I can read one book at a time now if I</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.410" end="00:40:33.599" style="s2">call Jared I called the Jason I called</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.069" end="00:40:35.160" style="s2">Peter and I said hey man this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.599" end="00:40:36.390" style="s2">want to learn about you is also</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.160" end="00:40:37.859" style="s2">interested oh you guys looking to stick</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.390" end="00:40:38.339" style="s2">to so come along so we gave you</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.859" end="00:40:40.710" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.339" end="00:40:42.000" style="s2">Egypt has read five different books on</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.710" end="00:40:44.700" style="s2">the subject meat country so we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.000" end="00:40:46.980" style="s2">distributed that then we come back just</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.700" end="00:40:48.779" style="s2">like how Jason said we trust each other</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.980" end="00:40:50.789" style="s2">for our capacity all of that stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.779" end="00:40:52.829" style="s2">then we go and we kind of like distill</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.789" end="00:40:54.329" style="s2">what we&#39;ve learned them we compiled all</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.829" end="00:40:55.829" style="s2">these five from the five different</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.329" end="00:40:57.779" style="s2">vantage points five different notes we</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.829" end="00:40:59.730" style="s2">compile all of that information and from</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.779" end="00:41:01.289" style="s2">there we start kind of like pulling in</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.730" end="00:41:02.700" style="s2">and pulling out so when that pulley what</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.289" end="00:41:04.500" style="s2">needs to stay and what needs to go</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.700" end="00:41:06.809" style="s2">conversation starts that&#39;s when the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.500" end="00:41:09.510" style="s2">actual mimetic mediation kind of flag</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.809" end="00:41:13.170" style="s2">comes in because I I personally believe</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.510" end="00:41:15.119" style="s2">that coming from yes culture war yes but</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.170" end="00:41:16.529" style="s2">that&#39;s move now right</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.119" end="00:41:18.270" style="s2">so rather than trying to bring people</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.529" end="00:41:19.890" style="s2">from extremes together we should come to</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.270" end="00:41:21.539" style="s2">the middle and see who are the people on</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.890" end="00:41:23.460" style="s2">either side who are closer to the middle</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.539" end="00:41:25.770" style="s2">and what are the strategies that we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.460" end="00:41:28.170" style="s2">do to engage them and once we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.770" end="00:41:29.579" style="s2">build from that core place where we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.170" end="00:41:31.440" style="s2">see okay you know these people will</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.579" end="00:41:33.390" style="s2">invest time and energy into this how</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.440" end="00:41:35.309" style="s2">from there then can be like start</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.390" end="00:41:37.049" style="s2">scaling outwards and pull their you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.309" end="00:41:38.670" style="s2">people at the extremities to that kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.049" end="00:41:47.700" style="s2">of country so that would be the strategy</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.670" end="00:41:48.900" style="s2">I would employ yeah if I can speak to</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.700" end="00:41:52.859" style="s2">the campfire for a minute</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.900" end="00:41:54.270" style="s2">when this covert stuff is done I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.859" end="00:41:58.369" style="s2">a nice spot up here just outside of</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.270" end="00:41:58.369" style="s2">Toronto we can maybe do it as a city I</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.599" end="00:42:04.799" style="s2">think a lot of the stuff that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.240" end="00:42:07.260" style="s2">dealing with in terms of subject matter</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.799" end="00:42:10.740" style="s2">and information within it it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.260" end="00:42:11.849" style="s2">exceedingly complex but I think in large</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.740" end="00:42:12.930" style="s2">part there&#39;s a couple of things that are</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.849" end="00:42:16.670" style="s2">missing off the table in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.930" end="00:42:19.500" style="s2">conversation I think there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.670" end="00:42:22.319" style="s2">late learning methodologies within</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.500" end="00:42:27.270" style="s2">information technology that are easily</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.319" end="00:42:28.799" style="s2">adaptable to the cognitive stuff and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.270" end="00:42:30.839" style="s2">think one of the things that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.799" end="00:42:33.559" style="s2">missing in the big picture of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.839" end="00:42:38.029" style="s2">discussion is some kind of grounding in</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.559" end="00:42:38.029" style="s2">you know formalized mystery tradition</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.250" end="00:42:43.990" style="s2">I went around the discussion I just I</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.310" end="00:42:45.910" style="s2">don&#39;t see a whole lot of depth of people</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.990" end="00:42:48.310" style="s2">who have actually engaged that pathway</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.910" end="00:42:48.940" style="s2">and I don&#39;t see a lot of people talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.310" end="00:42:51.190" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.940" end="00:42:57.300" style="s2">I mean from personal perspective I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.190" end="00:43:00.940" style="s2">been involved in Freemasonry since 2002</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.300" end="00:43:04.000" style="s2">and as an institutional model both</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.940" end="00:43:09.640" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of the ritual model in</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.000" end="00:43:11.800" style="s2">terms of engaging or inculcating lessons</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.640" end="00:43:14.590" style="s2">to the individual I think is very</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.800" end="00:43:17.320" style="s2">effective yeah the use of the object</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.590" end="00:43:19.390" style="s2">lesson and I think the institutional</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.320" end="00:43:21.040" style="s2">model where you take someone you</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.390" end="00:43:21.940" style="s2">basically start them at the SI gate and</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.040" end="00:43:23.980" style="s2">you bring them in and put them through</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.940" end="00:43:25.930" style="s2">all these seats or chairs that are</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.980" end="00:43:28.180" style="s2">required to run an organization</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.930" end="00:43:29.619" style="s2">effectively and as you&#39;re bringing them</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.180" end="00:43:31.570" style="s2">through you&#39;re basically progressing</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.619" end="00:43:34.450" style="s2">them as a person and also training them</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.570" end="00:43:37.990" style="s2">to be capable of actually running the</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.450" end="00:43:39.820" style="s2">organization so I think there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.990" end="00:43:41.349" style="s2">value in that model that I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.820" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">really seen brought to the table in any</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.349" end="00:43:53.099" style="s2">kind of depth yet yeah so I just had a</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.920" end="00:43:57.490" style="s2">couple thoughts I know these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.099" end="00:44:01.150" style="s2">in-between space conversations and kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.490" end="00:44:02.410" style="s2">of speculation and Barry Peters point we</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.150" end="00:44:05.440" style="s2">just kind of started with this high</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.410" end="00:44:09.190" style="s2">level frame and not quite in the needy</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.440" end="00:44:12.849" style="s2">greedy yet and then you know Jason when</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.190" end="00:44:14.619" style="s2">you showed us your campfire I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.849" end="00:44:16.900" style="s2">felt why I was feeling kind of weird</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.619" end="00:44:18.609" style="s2">about this like what are we making what</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.900" end="00:44:22.180" style="s2">are we doing what project what are the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.609" end="00:44:25.240" style="s2">deliverables from this and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.180" end="00:44:26.740" style="s2">that was quickly or he came to me very</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.240" end="00:44:28.570" style="s2">quickly when I saw that campfire and</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.740" end="00:44:30.730" style="s2">that&#39;s the sense like when that last</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.570" end="00:44:33.730" style="s2">time I was at a campfire there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.730" end="00:44:37.660" style="s2">no agenda it was it was just let&#39;s enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.730" end="00:44:39.700" style="s2">each other&#39;s presence and have</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.660" end="00:44:43.180" style="s2">conversations and relate and build</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.700" end="00:44:45.070" style="s2">connections after we&#39;ve were done</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.180" end="00:44:48.940" style="s2">working for the day you know we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.070" end="00:44:51.780" style="s2">we&#39;ve been goal-oriented and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.940" end="00:44:53.850" style="s2">collaborating on a daily basis and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.780" end="00:44:56.070" style="s2">is a time for us kind of reflect get</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.850" end="00:44:58.470" style="s2">some distance and bring in some other</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.070" end="00:45:00.420" style="s2">perspectives so maybe that that might be</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.470" end="00:45:03.330" style="s2">why I was having some kind of resistance</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.420" end="00:45:06.390" style="s2">to the the extreme the extremely kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.330" end="00:45:09.780" style="s2">hyper focused goal-oriented face and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.390" end="00:45:11.340" style="s2">you know this also speaks to other work</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.780" end="00:45:13.590" style="s2">environments I know apples kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.340" end="00:45:18.660" style="s2">renowned for for building their offices</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.590" end="00:45:21.030" style="s2">to to in a way that promotes collisions</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.660" end="00:45:22.590" style="s2">from very different perspectives you</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.030" end="00:45:24.180" style="s2">know they put the the bathrooms all on</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.590" end="00:45:25.680" style="s2">one side so that all these people have</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.180" end="00:45:27.150" style="s2">to be that our different compartments</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.680" end="00:45:29.580" style="s2">are kind of running into each other and</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.150" end="00:45:32.370" style="s2">having these chance conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.580" end="00:45:33.810" style="s2">no agenda but those those types of</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.370" end="00:45:36.570" style="s2">environments are usually really most</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.810" end="00:45:39.060" style="s2">kind of rich insight and unique</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.570" end="00:45:42.210" style="s2">processes emerge and that&#39;s because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.060" end="00:45:45.660" style="s2">in this unordered space and I largely</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.210" end="00:45:48.480" style="s2">well I think they have to be intimately</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.660" end="00:45:50.340" style="s2">connected mimetic mediation feels like</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.480" end="00:45:53.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot more about the space in</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.340" end="00:45:56.270" style="s2">between the projects and the goals and</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.160" end="00:45:59.340" style="s2">and and yeah so yeah and that&#39;s just uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.270" end="00:46:01.260" style="s2">yeah I guess but but you know I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.340" end="00:46:03.270" style="s2">goal-oriented guy and then I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.260" end="00:46:05.610" style="s2">heads down doing stuff with projects</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.270" end="00:46:07.380" style="s2">every day but sometimes I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.610" end="00:46:11.520" style="s2">shoot the of the campfire in place</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.380" end="00:46:15.960" style="s2">with the Stars fun that no Dino photo</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.520" end="00:46:19.380" style="s2">wave yeah on that note Jason as Jared</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.960" end="00:46:21.900" style="s2">say I like that because the hyper goal</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.380" end="00:46:23.220" style="s2">thing doesn&#39;t resonate with me when I</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.900" end="00:46:25.440" style="s2">think of this project of memetic</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.220" end="00:46:27.090" style="s2">mediation and if I were to kind of put</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.440" end="00:46:29.550" style="s2">myself in that mindset almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.090" end="00:46:33.900" style="s2">sense of arrogance emerges oh I know</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.550" end="00:46:35.310" style="s2">what the superordinate goal is and just</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.900" end="00:46:36.930" style="s2">like that campfire thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.310" end="00:46:38.460" style="s2">mentioned Jared and then I keep</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.930" end="00:46:40.920" style="s2">returning what you said earlier Jason</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.460" end="00:46:42.600" style="s2">just sort of like just crack open a beer</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.920" end="00:46:44.850" style="s2">with someone at the campfire and I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.600" end="00:46:47.430" style="s2">I got it again is he said he was talking</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.850" end="00:46:49.380" style="s2">about how Vice broke up and his</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.430" end="00:46:51.030" style="s2">heuristic was that like yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.380" end="00:46:52.530" style="s2">when you stop grabbing beer with your</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.030" end="00:46:56.340" style="s2">co-founder you know shit&#39;s gonna hit the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.530" end="00:46:58.020" style="s2">fan and so like the thought emerges like</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.340" end="00:46:59.690" style="s2">who do we want to have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.020" end="00:47:04.460" style="s2">encourage to have a beer with each other</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.690" end="00:47:04.460" style="s2">around this kind of memetic campfire</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.600" end="00:47:10.550" style="s2">yeah I have to say I I&#39;m kind of leaning</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.880" end="00:47:13.670" style="s2">both in what Peter and Jared are saying</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.550" end="00:47:16.430" style="s2">is that I think the superordinate goal</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.670" end="00:47:18.440" style="s2">come comes later I think the you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.430" end="00:47:19.760" style="s2">for me the the main issue and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.440" end="00:47:21.980" style="s2">think it&#39;s that some people are thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.760" end="00:47:25.100" style="s2">and some people are run by their</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.980" end="00:47:27.500" style="s2">emotions I disagree with that diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.100" end="00:47:31.040" style="s2">I think that a lot of people have the</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.500" end="00:47:32.960" style="s2">capacity to think but because of their</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.040" end="00:47:35.060" style="s2">ideologies which is you know tied to</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.960" end="00:47:36.590" style="s2">their identity and emotions is causing</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.060" end="00:47:38.480" style="s2">them not to talk to each other when they</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.590" end="00:47:41.510" style="s2">could actually have you know very</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.480" end="00:47:44.570" style="s2">constructive more logical propositional</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.510" end="00:47:47.210" style="s2">conversations but because they have some</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.570" end="00:47:49.130" style="s2">kind of allergy to an ideological</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.210" end="00:47:52.190" style="s2">allergy that they never even get in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.130" end="00:47:53.900" style="s2">room with each other and so I I I just I</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.190" end="00:47:57.020" style="s2">just don&#39;t see that with the world in</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.900" end="00:47:59.330" style="s2">the way that you do Jason fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.020" end="00:48:02.420" style="s2">maybe people do I see where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.330" end="00:48:04.970" style="s2">coming from but I I think this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.420" end="00:48:06.800" style="s2">putting aside your emotions I think you</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.970" end="00:48:07.880" style="s2">can&#39;t do that because the emotions are</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.800" end="00:48:09.800" style="s2">still in the background and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.880" end="00:48:12.920" style="s2">gonna come back and bite ya like you</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.800" end="00:48:16.040" style="s2">need like the idea that before you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.920" end="00:48:18.260" style="s2">engage in a goal or in a logical</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.040" end="00:48:19.520" style="s2">propositional conversation you just need</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.260" end="00:48:21.410" style="s2">to get comfortable with each other a</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.520" end="00:48:24.410" style="s2">basic bonding process as we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.410" end="00:48:26.150" style="s2">before or not and I relate this to to</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.410" end="00:48:27.890" style="s2">like Kagan stages as an analogy where</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.150" end="00:48:30.710" style="s2">you know Stage three is the more sub</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.890" end="00:48:33.230" style="s2">ideological relational stage and I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.710" end="00:48:34.460" style="s2">you need a good foundation there before</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.230" end="00:48:36.500" style="s2">you start getting into the more like</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.460" end="00:48:39.650" style="s2">let&#39;s develop coherent ideology together</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.500" end="00:48:42.880" style="s2">or let&#39;s develop you know something else</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.650" end="00:48:46.010" style="s2">you know a set of values together and</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.880" end="00:48:48.310" style="s2">that might involve being vulnerable and</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.010" end="00:48:51.380" style="s2">you know allowing yourself to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.310" end="00:48:53.119" style="s2">emotional in front of each other and but</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.380" end="00:48:55.070" style="s2">in the safe environment where it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.119" end="00:49:00.410" style="s2">going to blow up and you know cause even</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.070" end="00:49:02.660" style="s2">further division well add a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.410" end="00:49:04.250" style="s2">there too there really is there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.660" end="00:49:06.350" style="s2">conversations that don&#39;t have emotions</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.250" end="00:49:09.560" style="s2">involved right like you know if we just</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.350" end="00:49:12.790" style="s2">look at psychological research we find</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.560" end="00:49:16.430" style="s2">that rationalization is the predominant</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.790" end="00:49:19.010" style="s2">is rationalizing our emotional reactions</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.430" end="00:49:20.210" style="s2">in many ways and so this is the medic</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.010" end="00:49:22.640" style="s2">mediation what we&#39;re doing especially</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.210" end="00:49:24.560" style="s2">when we were talking about getting in</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.640" end="00:49:28.520" style="s2">touch with the felt sense this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.560" end="00:49:30.830" style="s2">showing us our own boundaries and in</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.520" end="00:49:31.970" style="s2">trying to you know say okay well this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.830" end="00:49:33.560" style="s2">normally something I can&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.970" end="00:49:36.770" style="s2">and talk about because it&#39;s just too</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.560" end="00:49:38.570" style="s2">ridiculous to me or to or it&#39;s absurd or</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.770" end="00:49:41.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s violent or it&#39;s whatever</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.570" end="00:49:44.240" style="s2">it is but you know it the more we kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.480" end="00:49:47.120" style="s2">of feel into those spaces and and relate</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.240" end="00:49:48.620" style="s2">with each other kind of there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.120" end="00:49:51.470" style="s2">dissolving that happens and it actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.620" end="00:49:54.160" style="s2">allows our thinking to be more broad and</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.470" end="00:49:58.370" style="s2">inclusive as opposed to stuck into very</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:49:59.990" style="s2">our kind of conditioned reality of this</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.370" end="00:50:02.150" style="s2">is what&#39;s right this is what&#39;s wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.990" end="00:50:03.830" style="s2">stuff like that so so yeah just to kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.150" end="00:50:07.970" style="s2">of add some more meat on the bones of</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.830" end="00:50:10.220" style="s2">Jason&#39;s emotional comments when you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.970" end="00:50:12.920" style="s2">those hooks into the limbic system the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.220" end="00:50:14.360" style="s2">default mode network or anything that</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.920" end="00:50:15.890" style="s2">kicks off the limbic system is going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.360" end="00:50:17.690" style="s2">kick off the default mode Network and</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.890" end="00:50:18.920" style="s2">kind of drop down the the working</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.690" end="00:50:21.620" style="s2">feeling of what you&#39;re actually capable</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.920" end="00:50:23.180" style="s2">of so the emotional states I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.620" end="00:50:26.120" style="s2">look at them as like indicator lights on</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.180" end="00:50:28.460" style="s2">a car if they&#39;re telling you something</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.120" end="00:50:30.710" style="s2">you&#39;ve missed something in a situational</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.460" end="00:50:34.940" style="s2">awareness up to that point they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.710" end="00:50:36.770" style="s2">of like the last resort indicators so I</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.940" end="00:50:38.750" style="s2">yeah the process is we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.770" end="00:50:40.730" style="s2">figure out how not to let those</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.750" end="00:50:43.310" style="s2">indicator lights interfere with us</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.730" end="00:50:45.820" style="s2">actually operating the machine so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.310" end="00:50:47.690" style="s2">take that whole hell of a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.820" end="00:50:49.610" style="s2">constipation is no healthier than</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.690" end="00:50:53.000" style="s2">diarrhea and transience of the process</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.610" end="00:50:54.440" style="s2">of the system so we can&#39;t be just you</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.000" end="00:50:56.630" style="s2">know eating our and swallowing it</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.440" end="00:51:00.440" style="s2">down and not coming to terms with any</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.630" end="00:51:01.790" style="s2">kind of the realistic consequences about</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.440" end="00:51:04.340" style="s2">emotive stress or anything else like</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.790" end="00:51:08.450" style="s2">that but at the same time watching</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.340" end="00:51:11.690" style="s2">people they play that game pretty hard</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.450" end="00:51:12.380" style="s2">like a lot of people dwell and revel in</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.690" end="00:51:14.660" style="s2">their misery</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.380" end="00:51:16.670" style="s2">do large degree you can see that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.660" end="00:51:19.010" style="s2">something that has upset them they just</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.670" end="00:51:21.620" style="s2">glom onto it and attached to it and</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.010" end="00:51:23.090" style="s2">won&#39;t let that thing go or is it they</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.620" end="00:51:27.440" style="s2">can just soften the grip a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.090" end="00:51:28.790" style="s2">step back then it&#39;s a little easier to</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.440" end="00:51:30.160" style="s2">walk through and process that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.790" end="00:51:33.320" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.160" end="00:51:36.800" style="s2">let&#39;s say one of them so there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.320" end="00:51:44.890" style="s2">different goals there&#39;s a goal for a</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.800" end="00:51:44.890" style="s2">resolution of an an ideological question</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.250" end="00:51:55.730" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that we care what the</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.119" end="00:52:04.070" style="s2">answers are we&#39;ll find out the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.730" end="00:52:10.490" style="s2">to show something - I like the words now</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.070" end="00:52:14.840" style="s2">warmth and space and I agreed that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.490" end="00:52:19.160" style="s2">emergent in some sense it&#39;s a chat by</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.840" end="00:52:26.030" style="s2">the campfire it doesn&#39;t have a direction</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.160" end="00:52:31.820" style="s2">but it also does have a goal in another</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.030" end="00:52:39.080" style="s2">sense and that goal isn&#39;t isn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.820" end="00:52:43.520" style="s2">intellectual correctness or nothing&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.080" end="00:52:51.140" style="s2">going to be produced it&#39;s it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.520" end="00:52:54.290" style="s2">about connecting and it&#39;s the space has</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.140" end="00:52:59.350" style="s2">to have some sort of role model though</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.290" end="00:53:04.540" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know how to do that but</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.350" end="00:53:08.570" style="s2">something is pedagogic write something</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.540" end="00:53:12.740" style="s2">and it all just be structured and not a</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.570" end="00:53:15.440" style="s2">third person being a mediator but</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.740" end="00:53:17.270" style="s2">something there has to be that point but</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.440" end="00:53:19.720" style="s2">that point is different from like what</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.270" end="00:53:23.030" style="s2">is the correct answer so we&#39;re not I</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.720" end="00:53:25.210" style="s2">mean in my view we&#39;re not looking for</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.030" end="00:53:29.150" style="s2">the correct answer we&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.210" end="00:53:33.380" style="s2">what I what I said so I&#39;m just going to</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.150" end="00:53:36.080" style="s2">jump in this time I want to invite</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.380" end="00:53:36.800" style="s2">anyone who hasn&#39;t spoken if they feel</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.080" end="00:53:39.710" style="s2">called to speak</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.800" end="00:53:40.940" style="s2">if not then me Jason and Jared will just</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.710" end="00:53:42.890" style="s2">kind of do her closing thoughts and</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.940" end="00:53:43.790" style="s2">we&#39;ll close up today let&#39;s give a moment</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.890" end="00:53:49.070" style="s2">for anyone who who</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.790" end="00:53:50.090" style="s2">to speak who hasn&#39;t spoken yet I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.070" end="00:53:55.040" style="s2">started looking at you James</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.090" end="00:53:57.050" style="s2">I met a modern friend you want me to say</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.040" end="00:54:00.950" style="s2">something Peter I&#39;m curious if you have</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.050" end="00:54:03.310" style="s2">any thoughts well you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.950" end="00:54:05.720" style="s2">interesting just seeing everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.310" end="00:54:10.250" style="s2">perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.720" end="00:54:15.290" style="s2">you know I am more of a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.250" end="00:54:19.970" style="s2">theorist I guess you might say so even</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.290" end="00:54:21.950" style="s2">though I&#39;m by far not an academic I like</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.970" end="00:54:25.610" style="s2">to understand the sort of social</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.950" end="00:54:29.390" style="s2">historical analysis behind this and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.610" end="00:54:32.240" style="s2">see if I can&#39;t deconstruct it and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.390" end="00:54:34.340" style="s2">see what it takes to reconstruct it that</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.240" end="00:54:37.880" style="s2">makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.340" end="00:54:41.020" style="s2">so you know it&#39;s just what are you you</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.880" end="00:54:43.490" style="s2">know if you&#39;re gonna if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.020" end="00:54:49.700" style="s2">in other words it&#39;s almost like you have</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.490" end="00:54:53.510" style="s2">to have but and then you&#39;ve got to kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.700" end="00:54:58.340" style="s2">of draw out what is the what is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.510" end="00:55:04.040" style="s2">thing that needs to be mediated and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.340" end="00:55:07.070" style="s2">gonna depend on very complex individual</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.040" end="00:55:08.690" style="s2">and situational analysis so you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.070" end="00:55:15.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole there&#39;s a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.690" end="00:55:17.360" style="s2">talk here that is you know just by you</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.770" end="00:55:19.880" style="s2">know the eight of us remember in your</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.360" end="00:55:24.680" style="s2">talk and that&#39;s gonna take a lot longer</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.880" end="00:55:26.480" style="s2">than an hour the kind of figure out but</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.680" end="00:55:29.540" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s just kind of where I&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.480" end="00:55:33.130" style="s2">you know I is you know Peter here I kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.540" end="00:55:36.290" style="s2">of think of it in terms of you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.130" end="00:55:38.780" style="s2">cultural areas and generations and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.290" end="00:55:42.290" style="s2">you know I&#39;m right now I&#39;ve been reading</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.780" end="00:55:48.260" style="s2">a lot of literature on the academic</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.290" end="00:55:52.610" style="s2">history of the generation gastrin kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.260" end="00:55:55.610" style="s2">of an anomaly mediate that over the</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.610" end="00:55:57.590" style="s2">course of history which is that just</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.610" end="00:56:00.140" style="s2">what I</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.590" end="00:56:04.460" style="s2">what to do but have nobody probably</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.140" end="00:56:06.080" style="s2">cares about that specific instance but</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.460" end="00:56:11.780" style="s2">you know that&#39;s just what I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.080" end="00:56:14.330" style="s2">so oh cool thank you beyond speaking so</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.780" end="00:56:16.880" style="s2">how about will close up maybe just one</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.330" end="00:56:18.380" style="s2">minute each guys like Jared and Jason</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.880" end="00:56:19.660" style="s2">let&#39;s just do a one-minute closing</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.380" end="00:56:25.340" style="s2">thoughts and then we&#39;ll end it today</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.660" end="00:56:26.990" style="s2">mm-hmm I think we don&#39;t we it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.340" end="00:56:28.430" style="s2">anticipate what the problems are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.990" end="00:56:30.700" style="s2">be that we&#39;re gonna need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.430" end="00:56:33.830" style="s2">collaborate on in an intelligent way and</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.700" end="00:56:36.350" style="s2">make sense with each other and so for me</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.830" end="00:56:39.260" style="s2">mimetic mediation is kind of set in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.350" end="00:56:41.390" style="s2">condition for that to happen when the</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.260" end="00:56:43.280" style="s2">need to collaborate will you know will</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.390" end="00:56:46.010" style="s2">arise you know I think this Kovas</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.280" end="00:56:48.020" style="s2">situation maybe is a good example where</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.010" end="00:56:51.800" style="s2">you know if you look at the information</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.020" end="00:56:55.240" style="s2">ecology you know different groups knew</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.800" end="00:56:57.880" style="s2">about the the virus and the potential</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.240" end="00:57:00.740" style="s2">danger of the virus you know very early</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.880" end="00:57:02.480" style="s2">and groups that don&#39;t normally talk to</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.740" end="00:57:05.720" style="s2">each other right and they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.480" end="00:57:08.240" style="s2">medically sealed off from each other and</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.720" end="00:57:11.180" style="s2">if they could have been communicating</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.240" end="00:57:13.400" style="s2">much earlier you know that might have</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.180" end="00:57:15.530" style="s2">had a greater impact on the overall prep</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.400" end="00:57:17.930" style="s2">you know probit preparation of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.530" end="00:57:19.520" style="s2">culture because you know a lot of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.930" end="00:57:22.370" style="s2">of these folks like on Twitter do have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.520" end="00:57:25.250" style="s2">lot of influence right and so for me</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.370" end="00:57:26.900" style="s2">it&#39;s not about you know finding the</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.250" end="00:57:28.340" style="s2">problem that you want to solve right</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.900" end="00:57:30.290" style="s2">away it&#39;s it&#39;s getting people</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.340" end="00:57:33.440" style="s2">comfortable with each other and at least</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.290" end="00:57:34.790" style="s2">respectful of each other&#39;s views such</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.440" end="00:57:37.520" style="s2">that they&#39;re not gonna strawman each</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.790" end="00:57:39.680" style="s2">other and you know that such that when</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.520" end="00:57:42.950" style="s2">problems do arise they can very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.680" end="00:57:44.630" style="s2">connect and you know work together to</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.950" end="00:57:47.120" style="s2">get you know to get something</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.630" end="00:57:48.430" style="s2">accomplished so that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.120" end="00:57:51.710" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.430" end="00:57:56.090" style="s2">I can go next and then Jared maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.710" end="00:57:57.830" style="s2">close yeah lots of things I thought that</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.090" end="00:57:59.450" style="s2">was a lot of a lot of great metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.830" end="00:58:01.330" style="s2">and thoughts came up here and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.450" end="00:58:04.370" style="s2">seeds were definitely planted so I</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.330" end="00:58:06.950" style="s2">appreciated of this sort of mediation</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.370" end="00:58:08.420" style="s2">campfire I like that and this is last</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.950" end="00:58:09.350" style="s2">minute we asked the juicy conversation</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.420" end="00:58:11.010" style="s2">so imagine if they had like a week</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.350" end="00:58:14.160" style="s2">advance of the post of this what could</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.010" end="00:58:17.280" style="s2">happen and then I just I wanted to flake</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.160" end="00:58:19.500" style="s2">something that something I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.280" end="00:58:23.130" style="s2">Jason and Peter said and the way I</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.500" end="00:58:26.450" style="s2">interpreted I felt that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.130" end="00:58:31.530" style="s2">conveyance of what I felt I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.450" end="00:58:32.970" style="s2">misunderstood or something that I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.530" end="00:58:34.950" style="s2">that was projected a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.970" end="00:58:36.210" style="s2">narrative or framework on me that I</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.950" end="00:58:38.040" style="s2">didn&#39;t agree with and I had that could</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.210" end="00:58:39.720" style="s2">be totally my miss reading of it but I</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.040" end="00:58:40.770" style="s2">noticed when I had that I got triggered</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.720" end="00:58:42.240" style="s2">I got emotion I got emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.770" end="00:58:43.500" style="s2">triggered alright I just wanted to like</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.240" end="00:58:44.880" style="s2"> like let&#39;s fight let&#39;s suppose</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.500" end="00:58:48.570" style="s2"> debate right I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.880" end="00:58:50.430" style="s2">get in that mode and so let&#39;s assume</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.570" end="00:58:52.020" style="s2">that is this all my my end or let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.430" end="00:58:54.210" style="s2">just you know another reality let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.020" end="00:58:57.030" style="s2">assume that I was misinterpreted right I</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.210" end="00:58:58.020" style="s2">think for me personally at my edge and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.030" end="00:59:00.390" style="s2">think this is a good skills that they</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.020" end="00:59:13.620" style="s2">have is be very very comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.390" end="00:59:15.450" style="s2">being misinterpreted yeah it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.620" end="00:59:18.240" style="s2">that you say that being misinterpreted</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.450" end="00:59:20.820" style="s2">because I just uh I talked to my wife a</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.240" end="00:59:22.260" style="s2">lot about how I&#39;m very frustrated with</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.820" end="00:59:23.580" style="s2">language because I don&#39;t think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.260" end="00:59:25.260" style="s2">any way that I can express what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.580" end="00:59:26.670" style="s2">actually feeling and when I hear I say</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.260" end="00:59:28.080" style="s2">myself say it on my own that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.670" end="00:59:31.170" style="s2">sound like at all</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.080" end="00:59:35.310" style="s2">I don&#39;t know that does not it and so it</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.170" end="00:59:36.990" style="s2">is it&#39;s definitely a struggle yeah my</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.310" end="00:59:40.560" style="s2">main thought here right now is actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.990" end="00:59:42.240" style="s2">I hate to say it but I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.560" end="00:59:46.740" style="s2">thinking that the mimetic mediation</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.240" end="00:59:48.600" style="s2">might have some colloquial assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.740" end="00:59:51.060" style="s2">baked into it especially the mediation</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.600" end="00:59:53.460" style="s2">port port point in the sense that it</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.060" end="00:59:59.190" style="s2">seems to be focused on the resolution of</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.460" end="01:00:02.070" style="s2">conflict and you know you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.190" end="01:00:04.440" style="s2">simple rebranding that comes to mind</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.070" end="01:00:06.300" style="s2">right now is like what would I think if</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.440" end="01:00:07.890" style="s2">we called it a memetic campfire like</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.300" end="01:00:09.510" style="s2">that just changes the frame completely</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.890" end="01:00:12.390" style="s2">right because we kind of speaking to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.510" end="01:00:17.370" style="s2">fact that this campfire metaphor has so</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.390" end="01:00:19.560" style="s2">many so much less resolution oriented</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.370" end="01:00:21.660" style="s2">goals it&#39;s just just let&#39;s be together</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.560" end="01:00:22.890" style="s2">and let&#39;s let&#39;s have some interpersonal</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.660" end="01:00:24.660" style="s2">contact</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.890" end="01:00:26.189" style="s2">so yeah I don&#39;t know just some thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.660" end="01:00:28.499" style="s2">but you have that being said mimetic</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.189" end="01:00:33.479" style="s2">mediation itself I still think is kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.499" end="01:00:37.199" style="s2">of like the underlying long-term goal or</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.479" end="01:00:39.359" style="s2">orientation at the same time but but</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.199" end="01:00:41.609" style="s2">it&#39;s a long new magnesian is a long game</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.359" end="01:00:43.410" style="s2">we&#39;re not changing minds in single</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.609" end="01:00:46.979" style="s2">conversations too slow</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.410" end="01:00:50.809" style="s2">slow process of relating so yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.979" end="01:00:50.809" style="s2">know just just just a few of my thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.900" end="01:00:58.679" style="s2">there that I like that okay so if anyone</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.829" end="01:01:00.719" style="s2">wants to veto this recording just</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.679" end="01:01:02.459" style="s2">message me in the chat box now or find</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.719" end="01:01:04.859" style="s2">me elsewhere a public post maybe later</p>

<p begin="01:01:04.859" end="01:01:09.239" style="s2">will delete it if not it&#39;ll probably go</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.109" end="01:01:10.709" style="s2">up on YouTube other than that I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.239" end="01:01:11.849" style="s2">going to debrief with Jason and Jared</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.709" end="01:01:14.419" style="s2">hopefully and then we&#39;ll see what we can</p>
