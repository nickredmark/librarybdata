<p begin="00:00:27.689" end="00:00:31.800" style="s2">that&#39;s how I originally started was to</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.490" end="00:00:33.840" style="s2">explain Michael cooperative and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.800" end="00:00:37.050" style="s2">gonna take the opportunity to do that</p>

<p begin="00:00:38.969" end="00:00:42.899" style="s2">was originally the point of these and</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.440" end="00:00:45.180" style="s2">then I was watching Kanye&#39;s videos and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.899" end="00:00:47.129" style="s2">wanted to start being more vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.180" end="00:00:49.079" style="s2">and explaining more of myself which I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.129" end="00:00:51.210" style="s2">still do I&#39;m just gonna figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.079" end="00:00:52.350" style="s2">days I feel like doing what and where I</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.210" end="00:00:54.329" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to talk about I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.350" end="00:00:56.690" style="s2">have a topic to talk about I will talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.329" end="00:00:58.649" style="s2">about the global cooperative and</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.690" end="00:01:01.680" style="s2">discussing this morning with my roommate</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.649" end="00:01:02.850" style="s2">what what those things look like and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.680" end="00:01:05.369" style="s2">love having discussion that should be</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.850" end="00:01:06.570" style="s2">the video I do like stuff that I need</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.369" end="00:01:08.939" style="s2">the other person to be okay with being</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.570" end="00:01:10.650" style="s2">on video but just recording discussions</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.939" end="00:01:13.380" style="s2">of the global cooperative and people</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.650" end="00:01:14.729" style="s2">bringing up issues like what what about</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.380" end="00:01:17.070" style="s2">this like I just feel like it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.729" end="00:01:18.689" style="s2">answer to everything I was saying that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.070" end="00:01:21.330" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the next step is I know</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.689" end="00:01:23.340" style="s2">what all that and I do I do know what it</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.330" end="00:01:25.220" style="s2">is I have it it&#39;s done I mean it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.340" end="00:01:29.159" style="s2">done you actually do it</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.220" end="00:01:32.970" style="s2">the preliminary idea and it isn&#39;t for me</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.159" end="00:01:35.009" style="s2">to be the leader and or the person with</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.970" end="00:01:38.310" style="s2">all the solutions it&#39;s to create a</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.009" end="00:01:41.280" style="s2">system that enables us to easily</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.310" end="00:01:43.619" style="s2">implement solutions from the discussing</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.280" end="00:01:48.180" style="s2">the problem that the solution solves or</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.619" end="00:01:50.009" style="s2">makes better - even if you come with</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.180" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">that idea already there implementing it</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.009" end="00:01:53.790" style="s2">like how do you actually get it to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.360" end="00:01:55.229" style="s2">people who need it without taking a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.790" end="00:01:57.270" style="s2">of risk it without spending a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.229" end="00:02:00.899" style="s2">money without anything coming from it</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.270" end="00:02:02.939" style="s2">and we need solutions on this planet</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.899" end="00:02:05.729" style="s2">like that&#39;s what we are desperately in</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.939" end="00:02:07.020" style="s2">need of is solutions for everything for</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.729" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">education system for our healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.020" end="00:02:12.360" style="s2">systems for our transportation system</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:15.690" style="s2">for racism and sexist</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.360" end="00:02:18.710" style="s2">which need solutions all kinds of them</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.690" end="00:02:21.990" style="s2">and the system right now is designed</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.710" end="00:02:23.720" style="s2">that it has to be marketable and even if</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.990" end="00:02:27.330" style="s2">that means you&#39;re in here an NGO</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.720" end="00:02:29.490" style="s2">starting nonprofit and you still be</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.330" end="00:02:35.160" style="s2">marketable yourself have enough of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.490" end="00:02:36.710" style="s2">market if people give you money I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.160" end="00:02:40.680" style="s2">really passionate about sharing</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.710" end="00:02:43.920" style="s2">knowledge and connection so that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.680" end="00:02:46.440" style="s2">communities relationships and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.920" end="00:02:49.290" style="s2">searching for the former my whole well</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.440" end="00:02:51.930" style="s2">most of my life this idea of this like</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.290" end="00:02:53.670" style="s2">group that accepts me as the individual</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.930" end="00:02:55.470" style="s2">that I am and also I&#39;m able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.670" end="00:02:57.870" style="s2">contribute to and just feel fulfilled</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.470" end="00:02:59.580" style="s2">being part of it&#39;s something that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.870" end="00:03:01.260" style="s2">constant theme I&#39;ve been seeking and as</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.580" end="00:03:03.030" style="s2">for all of the themes in my life</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.260" end="00:03:06.000" style="s2">realizing I&#39;m actually exactly where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.030" end="00:03:08.220" style="s2">supposed to be and surrounded by amazing</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:09.480" style="s2">people even if it doesn&#39;t look like what</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.220" end="00:03:11.520" style="s2">I thought it would look like where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.480" end="00:03:13.770" style="s2">like you know I don&#39;t know grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.520" end="00:03:15.360" style="s2">the friends era of like six friends you</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.770" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">get together and have coffee every day</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.360" end="00:03:19.500" style="s2">and Co over to each other&#39;s house it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:21.000" style="s2">and we&#39;re like a unit and that&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.500" end="00:03:24.090" style="s2">been my life so why I thought that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.000" end="00:03:25.140" style="s2">gonna just materialize it nowhere but</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.090" end="00:03:27.150" style="s2">that&#39;s part of it&#39;s not talking with a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.140" end="00:03:30.630" style="s2">little paw burger today at least I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.150" end="00:03:33.510" style="s2">like pitchy and the whole thing but some</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.630" end="00:03:36.769" style="s2">of us suck at finding relationships</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.510" end="00:03:39.989" style="s2">whether they&#39;re the entire community or</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.769" end="00:03:41.700" style="s2">significant other friendships and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.989" end="00:03:43.560" style="s2">think technology can help us with that</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.700" end="00:03:45.209" style="s2">it already has with online dating but</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.560" end="00:03:47.760" style="s2">then we have issues with online dating</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.209" end="00:03:49.170" style="s2">and online dating is designed to be it</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.760" end="00:03:51.239" style="s2">was designed for extroverts designed for</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.170" end="00:03:53.730" style="s2">people who may come off good in pictures</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.239" end="00:03:57.720" style="s2">or in writing and can solve themselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.730" end="00:03:58.709" style="s2">and but does it necessarily those are</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.720" end="00:04:01.830" style="s2">the people who are the best at</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.709" end="00:04:02.550" style="s2">relationships and then there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.830" end="00:04:04.769" style="s2">who aren&#39;t good at relationships</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.550" end="00:04:08.120" style="s2">themselves and being able to have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.769" end="00:04:10.590" style="s2">system that walks you through how to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.120" end="00:04:15.420" style="s2">deal with an issue in your relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.590" end="00:04:18.450" style="s2">or how to come to a decision together</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.420" end="00:04:20.520" style="s2">how to make up after a fight how to keep</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.450" end="00:04:21.870" style="s2">the spark alive in a relationship I</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.520" end="00:04:23.460" style="s2">think technology talked with all about</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.870" end="00:04:25.020" style="s2">it does mean it&#39;s only technology of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.460" end="00:04:27.150" style="s2">course this tool behind it but</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.020" end="00:04:28.860" style="s2">I mean I know I&#39;m pretty good at</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.150" end="00:04:30.330" style="s2">maintaining a relationship it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.860" end="00:04:32.550" style="s2">getting into relationship but maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.330" end="00:04:35.250" style="s2">so great at and I know for if I&#39;m with a</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.550" end="00:04:36.419" style="s2">good human being I always am because I</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.250" end="00:04:39.620" style="s2">mean you&#39;re not gonna last a baby we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.419" end="00:04:43.410" style="s2">not a good human being that</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.620" end="00:04:45.630" style="s2">concentrating on the good is what keeps</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.410" end="00:04:48.090" style="s2">it good because everyone has good and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.630" end="00:04:49.650" style="s2">bad about them if you concentrate on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.090" end="00:04:50.729" style="s2">negative which is what it&#39;s naturally</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.650" end="00:04:52.110" style="s2">for us to do we get together with</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.729" end="00:04:54.870" style="s2">friends we bitch about our significant</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.110" end="00:04:56.729" style="s2">others when we get together online it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.870" end="00:04:59.699" style="s2">like we bitch about our jobs but that</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.729" end="00:05:01.349" style="s2">then that&#39;s what we focus on we focus on</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.699" end="00:05:02.430" style="s2">the net so then we&#39;re concepts like they</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.349" end="00:05:04.050" style="s2">chew it they&#39;re both open and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.430" end="00:05:06.000" style="s2">like oh we can hear it it just grows and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.050" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">it becomes bigger in our relationship as</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.000" end="00:05:12.449" style="s2">opposed to taking time to without the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:14.460" style="s2">other person even present realizing what</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.449" end="00:05:16.199" style="s2">we&#39;re grateful for with them right and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.460" end="00:05:17.849" style="s2">do with my own life we&#39;ve been if not</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.199" end="00:05:22.020" style="s2">with relationships and some not in one</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.849" end="00:05:23.940" style="s2">but like when I find myself annoyed at a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.020" end="00:05:26.580" style="s2">human being that I do love did you just</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.940" end="00:05:31.310" style="s2">sit and be like what but what do I love</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.580" end="00:05:31.310" style="s2">about them and it can be a hard a hard</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.750" end="00:05:37.680" style="s2">thing to do in that moment but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.300" end="00:05:39.210" style="s2">well worth it and we&#39;re in a</p>

<p begin="00:05:39.210" end="00:05:43.560" style="s2">take that time to be grateful for who</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.009" end="00:05:47.039" style="s2">they are and what they do for themselves</p>
