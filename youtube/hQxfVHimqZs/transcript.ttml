<p begin="00:00:00.050" end="00:00:12.330" style="s2">so just to summarize of it one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.770" end="00:00:15.330" style="s2">distinctions I want to make is what what</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.330" end="00:00:19.859" style="s2">then do the different models have to say</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.330" end="00:00:25.019" style="s2">about this question or hypothesis of</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.859" end="00:00:30.269" style="s2">moving beyond dialectical thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.019" end="00:00:36.149" style="s2">so one of the limitations i think of</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.269" end="00:00:45.300" style="s2">these models is that so we have current</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.149" end="00:00:50.070" style="s2">models and then we have the hypothetical</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.300" end="00:00:54.629" style="s2">territory that we would like to look in</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.070" end="00:00:58.410" style="s2">and i think one of the if I had to make</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.629" end="00:01:01.289" style="s2">a short list of what we could look to</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.410" end="00:01:05.390" style="s2">advance is that in the current models</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.289" end="00:01:11.659" style="s2">for example you&#39;ll hear a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.390" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">subject-object ships so there would be</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.659" end="00:01:17.820" style="s2">Kagan statement that the subject of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.600" end="00:01:21.180" style="s2">previous level becomes the object of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.820" end="00:01:24.509" style="s2">subject of the next level but nowhere in</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.180" end="00:01:29.880" style="s2">these models does the question of rise</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.509" end="00:01:38.659" style="s2">for example is what is it for an object</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.880" end="00:01:43.560" style="s2">for example to be for a subject and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.659" end="00:01:48.200" style="s2">that&#39;s a much more Eastern question so</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.560" end="00:01:50.399" style="s2">the model is inherently limited by the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.200" end="00:01:54.570" style="s2">conventional assumptions of what a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.399" end="00:01:57.000" style="s2">subject and object are and so when you</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.570" end="00:01:59.340" style="s2">start to move into this territory and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.000" end="00:02:01.409" style="s2">say well let me get underneath this</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.340" end="00:02:04.530" style="s2">assumption and ask a question is what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.409" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">it for an object to be an object for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.530" end="00:02:12.690" style="s2">subject then the whole foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:15.080" style="s2">what my inquiry is becomes much more</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.690" end="00:02:20.610" style="s2">complicate</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.080" end="00:02:22.860" style="s2">um also for example we&#39;re looking at in</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.610" end="00:02:26.820" style="s2">the current models of ego development</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.860" end="00:02:28.980" style="s2">and how the ego makes meaning but we</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.820" end="00:02:31.380" style="s2">have really don&#39;t ask the question or</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.980" end="00:02:36.570" style="s2">incorporate into these models what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.380" end="00:02:38.970" style="s2">ego in the first place we just assume</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.570" end="00:02:43.980" style="s2">there&#39;s an assumption that we are</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.970" end="00:02:46.350" style="s2">studying something that is identifiable</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.980" end="00:02:48.780" style="s2">and has a certain Western meaning but</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.350" end="00:02:52.230" style="s2">that we&#39;ve not delve into the question</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.780" end="00:02:57.540" style="s2">the model is not subject to the question</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.230" end="00:03:01.350" style="s2">what is ego okay these I think kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.540" end="00:03:06.900" style="s2">questions move us to exploring new</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.350" end="00:03:12.560" style="s2">territory there&#39;s this aspect that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.900" end="00:03:16.230" style="s2">mentioned early of complexification or</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.560" end="00:03:22.260" style="s2">sophistication of reasoning up toward</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.230" end="00:03:24.570" style="s2">principles but there&#39;s no mention or</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.260" end="00:03:31.190" style="s2">study of this move in the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.570" end="00:03:31.190" style="s2">direction which is to deeper ontological</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.910" end="00:03:38.100" style="s2">we could call them principles but the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.400" end="00:03:40.530" style="s2">word principle seems to only mean higher</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.100" end="00:03:42.870" style="s2">and more complex or deeper ontological</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.530" end="00:03:47.610" style="s2">point principles they&#39;re in a sense can</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.870" end="00:03:52.140" style="s2">be simpler in a way we&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.610" end="00:03:58.970" style="s2">foundational and so there&#39;s this whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.140" end="00:04:03.560" style="s2">direction of awareness that is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.970" end="00:04:03.560" style="s2">studied in conventional models</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.299" end="00:04:12.660" style="s2">conventional or current models have</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.230" end="00:04:16.590" style="s2">expressed a lot of when describes a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.660" end="00:04:19.380" style="s2">around this issue of polarity but the in</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.590" end="00:04:21.900" style="s2">my opinion the ultimate polarity that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.380" end="00:04:25.980" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been looked at is the figure</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.900" end="00:04:28.830" style="s2">ground relation</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.980" end="00:04:34.250" style="s2">which we&#39;ll talk about in a subsequent</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.830" end="00:04:36.360" style="s2">video but I believe that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.250" end="00:04:39.090" style="s2">foundational polarity for all the other</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.360" end="00:04:42.320" style="s2">polarities in it in there&#39;s some mention</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.090" end="00:04:44.910" style="s2">of figure ground reversals but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.320" end="00:04:47.040" style="s2">something that moves in any of these</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.910" end="00:04:48.990" style="s2">developmental models and I think that if</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.040" end="00:04:52.950" style="s2">these developmental models could see</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.990" end="00:04:59.010" style="s2">that this could move then they would</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.950" end="00:05:03.470" style="s2">advance into new territory there is</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.010" end="00:05:07.220" style="s2">obviously in a corporate bration of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.470" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">developmental processes but there is no</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.220" end="00:05:22.770" style="s2">attempt to rigorously tie these into</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.840" end="00:05:25.380" style="s2">evolutionary ones and then even when</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.770" end="00:05:28.800" style="s2">there&#39;s the mention of evolution and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.380" end="00:05:33.210" style="s2">might my opinion that&#39;s not while</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:41.210" style="s2">rigorous there&#39;s certainly no attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.210" end="00:05:50.040" style="s2">look at involution Airy processes and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.210" end="00:05:52.830" style="s2">we&#39;re even the case of looking at for</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.040" end="00:05:55.860" style="s2">incorporating into the inquiry of</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.830" end="00:06:01.550" style="s2">symbolic representation is brought in</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.860" end="00:06:06.120" style="s2">there certainly not much discussion</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.550" end="00:06:08.660" style="s2">about non symbolic representation now</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.120" end="00:06:11.850" style="s2">the word representation is probably</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.660" end="00:06:18.170" style="s2">problematic here or so we might say non</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.850" end="00:06:18.170" style="s2">symbolic presentation of self let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.910" end="00:06:31.940" style="s2">now what would drive what could possibly</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.760" end="00:06:35.840" style="s2">drive development beyond these stages if</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.940" end="00:06:40.880" style="s2">not polarity because we&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.840" end="00:06:44.720" style="s2">polarity is dialectic and dualistic and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.880" end="00:06:47.750" style="s2">the new stages won&#39;t be driven by that</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.720" end="00:06:53.300" style="s2">so what would drive development beyond</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.750" end="00:06:56.870" style="s2">to even paleri itself and so we can look</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.300" end="00:07:01.150" style="s2">this at this from the skills and task</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.870" end="00:07:06.310" style="s2">models and they actually themselves</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.150" end="00:07:13.150" style="s2">offer this and that is when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.310" end="00:07:21.590" style="s2">task complexity and you look at skill</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.150" end="00:07:34.400" style="s2">capacity there in many cases what is</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.590" end="00:07:44.350" style="s2">seen is that the modern world presents a</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.400" end="00:07:48.229" style="s2">problem like this that skills and tasks</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.350" end="00:07:54.470" style="s2">are not growing at the same rate and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.229" end="00:07:57.020" style="s2">during this era the skill capacity grew</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.470" end="00:08:01.729" style="s2">faster than the task so we saw progress</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.020" end="00:08:07.810" style="s2">and we could solve problems but in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.729" end="00:08:12.590" style="s2">modern era currently yes we have crises</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.810" end="00:08:22.090" style="s2">because the skills even at a meta meta</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.590" end="00:08:26.270" style="s2">meta or cross paradigmatic or systems of</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.090" end="00:08:28.430" style="s2">principles level problems are not going</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.270" end="00:08:31.760" style="s2">to not being solved the problems are</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.430" end="00:08:34.719" style="s2">more complex than these highest levels</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.760" end="00:08:34.719" style="s2">can solve</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.320" end="00:08:42.490" style="s2">and if it keeps going like that this</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.390" end="00:08:49.610" style="s2">point of crisis will become a</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.490" end="00:08:52.160" style="s2">catastrophe so even the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.610" end="00:08:59.330" style="s2">working on developmental models in this</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.160" end="00:09:05.930" style="s2">skill set inquiry have pointed out this</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.330" end="00:09:10.460" style="s2">problem in terms of the negotiation of</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.930" end="00:09:14.500" style="s2">polarities we will look at in the next</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.460" end="00:09:19.670" style="s2">video which is kind of a feature video</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.500" end="00:09:23.300" style="s2">presentation that the moving to the two</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.670" end="00:09:29.540" style="s2">highest levels creates an option but to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.300" end="00:09:34.820" style="s2">different kinds of responses in both of</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.540" end="00:09:48.020" style="s2">them are problematic because it creates</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.820" end="00:09:54.670" style="s2">a crisis of ego and a interest in ego</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.020" end="00:10:01.450" style="s2">transcendence and in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.670" end="00:10:05.800" style="s2">dialectical process of development in</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.450" end="00:10:12.370" style="s2">outline by facetious so this was mostly</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.800" end="00:10:15.370" style="s2">Fisher the Pope Gloria Gloria and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.370" end="00:10:15.370" style="s2">fishes</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.480" end="00:10:29.990" style="s2">one of the problems is that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.980" end="00:10:34.610" style="s2">paradoxes that drive the dialectical if</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.990" end="00:10:34.610" style="s2">eventually become apparent in recursive</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.620" end="00:10:46.709" style="s2">and so those people enter into the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.060" end="00:10:49.050" style="s2">higher stages of trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.709" end="00:10:59.660" style="s2">and negotiate polarities and so these</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.050" end="00:11:03.330" style="s2">are three crises that signify the end of</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.660" end="00:11:06.570" style="s2">development in this trajectory and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.330" end="00:11:10.820" style="s2">potential of development toward a</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.570" end="00:11:16.260" style="s2">completely new trajectory driven by</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.820" end="00:11:19.160" style="s2">these three very serious problems one is</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.260" end="00:11:23.060" style="s2">a kind of an empirical world</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.160" end="00:11:30.870" style="s2">problem-solving capacity that is lacking</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.060" end="00:11:33.930" style="s2">one is a just a reasoning capability or</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.870" end="00:11:37.620" style="s2">explanation problem-solving is lacking</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.930" end="00:11:42.690" style="s2">and that brings us into actually crisis</p>
