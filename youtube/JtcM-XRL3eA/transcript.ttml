<p begin="00:01:07.439" end="00:01:11.670" style="s2">tolerate editing my own voice I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.570" end="00:01:13.830" style="s2">did do it once I did edit one episode of</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.670" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">the show just to see how it was done and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.830" end="00:01:19.409" style="s2">I decided never again I can avoid it</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:21.000" style="s2">but I asked you onto the show not for</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.409" end="00:01:21.930" style="s2">you know your relationship to the show</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.000" end="00:01:25.020" style="s2">but because we had an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.930" end="00:01:26.939" style="s2">discussion on Twitter as people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.020" end="00:01:28.350" style="s2">listen to the show know and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.939" end="00:01:31.110" style="s2">people who listen to me on other</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.350" end="00:01:35.150" style="s2">people&#39;s podcasts I&#39;m known to go off on</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.110" end="00:01:38.880" style="s2">a rant whatever the S word is used</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.150" end="00:01:41.549" style="s2">spirituality anyway we got into it on</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:43.380" style="s2">that topic once on Twitter and so back</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.549" end="00:01:45.180" style="s2">and forth and I thought we start at</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.380" end="00:01:47.939" style="s2">least started to approach some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.180" end="00:01:50.640" style="s2">almost agreement I thought it might be</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.939" end="00:01:53.070" style="s2">worth you know some redo degree redoing</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.640" end="00:01:54.720" style="s2">that discussion and then expanding it</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.070" end="00:01:55.950" style="s2">and see where it leads yeah that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:01:57.390" style="s2">great yeah I mean it was a good</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.950" end="00:01:59.310" style="s2">discussion it really was it was lively</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.390" end="00:02:01.799" style="s2">and since then you know based on your</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.310" end="00:02:04.409" style="s2">suggestion and others I&#39;ve been probing</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.799" end="00:02:06.780" style="s2">more into the area you suggest that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.409" end="00:02:09.000" style="s2">read Sam Harris is waking up which I did</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.780" end="00:02:11.129" style="s2">and as somebody else it might well been</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.000" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">Jason Snyder suggests that the science</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.129" end="00:02:16.110" style="s2">of enlightenment by Sinjin Yong</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">which I&#39;m about halfway through so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.110" end="00:02:20.610" style="s2">let&#39;s get down to it stealing</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:23.750" style="s2">let me start why I cringe and or worse</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.610" end="00:02:26.940" style="s2">or starting fuming when I hear the word</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.750" end="00:02:28.830" style="s2">spirituality the problem to me isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.940" end="00:02:32.100" style="s2">essence of what the word is often used</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.830" end="00:02:33.240" style="s2">for in fact the more I&#39;ve read and more</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.100" end="00:02:35.160" style="s2">I&#39;ve listened the more I&#39;ve talked to</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.240" end="00:02:37.740" style="s2">people like yourself and others you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.160" end="00:02:40.200" style="s2">I can come up to a virgin of which that</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.740" end="00:02:43.080" style="s2">word points to which isn&#39;t too offensive</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.200" end="00:02:44.910" style="s2">in fact is actually good but why in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.080" end="00:02:48.030" style="s2">world do we have to include the word</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.910" end="00:02:52.170" style="s2">spirit in it to my mind you know it</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.030" end="00:02:54.600" style="s2">appeals to Cartesian dualism ie the idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.170" end="00:02:57.090" style="s2">that mind and body are two completely</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.600" end="00:03:00.120" style="s2">separate kinds of material and are not</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.090" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">related in the real world you know it</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.120" end="00:03:05.070" style="s2">brings up to my mind at least you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.400" end="00:03:07.200" style="s2">ghosts and spooks and you know angels</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.070" end="00:03:09.240" style="s2">and demons and all various kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.200" end="00:03:13.400" style="s2">spirits that may just be an overreaction</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.240" end="00:03:16.740" style="s2">to my youthful Catholicism which I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.400" end="00:03:18.420" style="s2">defiantly rejected when I was 11 but</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.740" end="00:03:20.880" style="s2">that&#39;s what that word rings up for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.420" end="00:03:22.320" style="s2">yeah I mean actually you know I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.880" end="00:03:25.920" style="s2">sympathize a lot because I&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.320" end="00:03:27.920" style="s2">the exact same place so I grew up in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:30.420" style="s2">kind of like hard-line secular</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.920" end="00:03:32.520" style="s2">upbringing so it wasn&#39;t even around the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.420" end="00:03:34.980" style="s2">church and yeah that the religion or</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.520" end="00:03:38.070" style="s2">spirituality were we&#39;re know goes for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.980" end="00:03:40.500" style="s2">for my first 26 years or something like</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.070" end="00:03:42.870" style="s2">that and even when I started to meditate</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.500" end="00:03:44.700" style="s2">it was you know secular mindfulness was</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.870" end="00:03:47.880" style="s2">the attractive point you know I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.700" end="00:03:49.890" style="s2">to become the most optimal body mind as</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.880" end="00:03:53.100" style="s2">possible and so it was a very much</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.890" end="00:03:55.350" style="s2">self-improvement project but then kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.100" end="00:03:58.770" style="s2">of weighted my way into some of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.350" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">deeper waters and now for for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.770" end="00:04:03.000" style="s2">reason to describe the character of some</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:06.030" style="s2">of the subjective experiences that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.000" end="00:04:08.700" style="s2">found along the contemplative spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.030" end="00:04:10.050" style="s2">mystical path whatever it is you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.700" end="00:04:12.390" style="s2">that they really lend themselves to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.050" end="00:04:15.030" style="s2">religious language that if taken from an</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.390" end="00:04:17.910" style="s2">objective standpoint is obviously absurd</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.030" end="00:04:20.820" style="s2">but yeah I think the the one thing to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.910" end="00:04:24.570" style="s2">keep in mind is when it&#39;s being used</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.820" end="00:04:26.639" style="s2">correctly and not being applied to areas</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.570" end="00:04:29.759" style="s2">that it shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.639" end="00:04:32.599" style="s2">it&#39;s primarily a subjective exploration</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.759" end="00:04:37.219" style="s2">and there is unfortunately this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.599" end="00:04:40.439" style="s2">intangible non-material internal kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.219" end="00:04:42.659" style="s2">spirit to the practice that for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.439" end="00:04:44.550" style="s2">reason that that word is just so</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.659" end="00:04:47.610" style="s2">available and far more descriptive</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.550" end="00:04:49.379" style="s2">rather than using more scientific</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.610" end="00:04:50.789" style="s2">language like saying that you know your</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.379" end="00:04:53.009" style="s2">your default mode network or a</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.789" end="00:04:54.360" style="s2">prefrontal cortex or dampens and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.009" end="00:04:56.999" style="s2">know we could talk about these from a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.360" end="00:04:59.009" style="s2">third-person perspective but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.999" end="00:05:01.650" style="s2">do a ton of value when we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.009" end="00:05:02.759" style="s2">talking about the practice so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.650" end="00:05:04.020" style="s2">don&#39;t know maybe there&#39;s there&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.759" end="00:05:06.300" style="s2">place to start</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.020" end="00:05:08.789" style="s2">yeah then you&#39;ve hit probably right</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.300" end="00:05:10.259" style="s2">about on where the interesting seem is</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.789" end="00:05:12.509" style="s2">which is the difference between the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.259" end="00:05:15.240" style="s2">first-person or subjective experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.509" end="00:05:18.120" style="s2">and the analytical or objective</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.240" end="00:05:21.389" style="s2">third-person experience and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.120" end="00:05:23.279" style="s2">interesting question how we integrate on</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.389" end="00:05:25.349" style="s2">one side or tease apart those two</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.279" end="00:05:27.509" style="s2">perspectives yeah well you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.349" end="00:05:29.969" style="s2">your thoughts on that I mean to what</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.509" end="00:05:31.979" style="s2">degree are they two aspects of the same</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.969" end="00:05:35.849" style="s2">thing or are they two fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.979" end="00:05:37.680" style="s2">different thing yeah well and this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.849" end="00:05:39.620" style="s2">kind of the the interesting thing like</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.680" end="00:05:43.050" style="s2">you said in the beginning that even the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.620" end="00:05:45.180" style="s2">Declaration of some sort of spirit to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.050" end="00:05:47.279" style="s2">in touch with does kind of immediately</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.180" end="00:05:49.050" style="s2">bring up this connotation of a dualistic</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.279" end="00:05:51.569" style="s2">perspective saying that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.050" end="00:05:54.240" style="s2">other thing other part of our experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.569" end="00:05:56.279" style="s2">that we should prioritize and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.240" end="00:05:58.529" style="s2">strange thing is that early on in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.279" end="00:06:01.229" style="s2">practice it really does feel like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.529" end="00:06:03.300" style="s2">there is you know it&#39;s trying to become</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.229" end="00:06:06.389" style="s2">acquainted with this certain subtle</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.300" end="00:06:08.779" style="s2">nuanced subjective experiences that feel</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.389" end="00:06:12.240" style="s2">completely separate from our everyday</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.779" end="00:06:13.889" style="s2">material reality when we&#39;re at work when</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.240" end="00:06:15.930" style="s2">we&#39;re you know in a job interview and</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.889" end="00:06:18.419" style="s2">we&#39;re going to grocery shopping or</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.930" end="00:06:21.330" style="s2">something like that but I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.419" end="00:06:23.189" style="s2">while that early practice can have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.330" end="00:06:25.860" style="s2">of benefits there can be some major</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.189" end="00:06:28.199" style="s2">milestones and shifts in perspective</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.860" end="00:06:29.909" style="s2">that start to unify those two</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.199" end="00:06:31.240" style="s2">perspectives and and this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.909" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">would kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.240" end="00:06:35.470" style="s2">in a blanket phrase point two as as the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:39.039" style="s2">the juice of the practice which is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.470" end="00:06:41.650" style="s2">more non-dual experience we&#39;re subject</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.039" end="00:06:43.300" style="s2">object distinctions and Cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.650" end="00:06:46.000" style="s2">dualism applied in many different</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.300" end="00:06:48.400" style="s2">aspects of our life it starts to break</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.000" end="00:06:50.229" style="s2">down so it&#39;s kind of a yes and no in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.400" end="00:06:51.850" style="s2">sense that dualism is kind of something</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.229" end="00:06:53.620" style="s2">that&#39;s there in the beginning but if we</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.850" end="00:06:55.330" style="s2">go deep enough it&#39;s it quickly dissolves</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.620" end="00:06:57.370" style="s2">and and that brings some very</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.330" end="00:06:58.570" style="s2">interesting impacts to our our</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.370" end="00:07:00.850" style="s2">moment-to-moment experience as well</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.570" end="00:07:02.620" style="s2">maybe for the audience&#39;s sake it may be</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.850" end="00:07:05.259" style="s2">good describe if you can remember what</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.620" end="00:07:07.360" style="s2">some of those subtle kind of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.259" end="00:07:11.560" style="s2">dualistic experiences might have been</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.360" end="00:07:14.860" style="s2">early on in your practice well and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.560" end="00:07:16.300" style="s2">we could we could also state as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.860" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">a bit of a distinction point here I</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.300" end="00:07:21.280" style="s2">think that it&#39;s really common when we</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.639" end="00:07:24.070" style="s2">talk about contemplative or spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.280" end="00:07:28.020" style="s2">practices or specifically spiritual or</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.070" end="00:07:31.449" style="s2">contemplative States to emphasize the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.020" end="00:07:33.849" style="s2">extremely extraordinary almost magical</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.449" end="00:07:35.530" style="s2">elements of those states or those</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.849" end="00:07:37.570" style="s2">moments and this these same things come</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.530" end="00:07:39.490" style="s2">up with you know exploration the</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.570" end="00:07:40.990" style="s2">psychedelic realm as well and can be</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.490" end="00:07:42.520" style="s2">induced in things like sport is you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.990" end="00:07:45.010" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s available in pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.520" end="00:07:47.560" style="s2">any aspects of our lives but we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.010" end="00:07:50.680" style="s2">find it more in religious and high</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.560" end="00:07:51.940" style="s2">concentrated States but I guess I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.680" end="00:07:53.650" style="s2">it&#39;s important to separate two things</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.940" end="00:07:55.449" style="s2">here&#39;s there&#39;s there are the states and</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.650" end="00:07:57.190" style="s2">those are interesting and powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.449" end="00:07:59.949" style="s2">often can be big motivations to continue</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.190" end="00:08:01.539" style="s2">down the path but what I see is the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.949" end="00:08:04.060" style="s2">real kind of rubber hits the road is</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.539" end="00:08:05.349" style="s2">more of a trait conversion and this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.060" end="00:08:06.820" style="s2">very subtle in the sense that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.349" end="00:08:08.650" style="s2">you know now when I&#39;m in that job</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.820" end="00:08:10.720" style="s2">interview I you know it feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.650" end="00:08:12.550" style="s2">sacred space or something you know for</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.720" end="00:08:14.050" style="s2">the lack of the more enchanted or you</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.550" end="00:08:15.610" style="s2">know so one of these words that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.050" end="00:08:18.400" style="s2">problematic on a many different levels</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.610" end="00:08:19.870" style="s2">and so yeah and really well in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.400" end="00:08:22.030" style="s2">beginning the states can be very</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.870" end="00:08:24.849" style="s2">motivating and fascinating in the long</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.030" end="00:08:27.789" style="s2">run it&#39;s these character shifts that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.849" end="00:08:30.190" style="s2">kind of lasting and durable and very</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.789" end="00:08:32.950" style="s2">profound in shifts shifts and now we see</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.190" end="00:08:34.599" style="s2">things do you want me to go into like I</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.950" end="00:08:36.310" style="s2">mean I could talk about some of the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.599" end="00:08:38.589" style="s2">heightened states I&#39;ve had that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.310" end="00:08:38.890" style="s2">interesting I suppose yeah that&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.589" end="00:08:41.529" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.890" end="00:08:44.740" style="s2">and then I&#39;ll share some of my own cool</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.529" end="00:08:45.160" style="s2">cool so he did quite a few different</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.740" end="00:08:46.690" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.160" end="00:08:49.150" style="s2">and depending on the type of practices</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.690" end="00:08:50.950" style="s2">you&#39;re doing the type of experiences can</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.150" end="00:08:52.930" style="s2">be drastically different one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.950" end="00:08:54.940" style="s2">first ones that comes to mind was</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.930" end="00:08:57.220" style="s2">actually an experience of pain</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.940" end="00:08:58.690" style="s2">so speaking of shins and young as you</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.220" end="00:09:00.100" style="s2">mentioned he has this really great</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.690" end="00:09:02.710" style="s2">equation that I think is really</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.100" end="00:09:04.930" style="s2">foundational to understanding what is</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.710" end="00:09:07.030" style="s2">happening to the psyche as we go on this</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.930" end="00:09:10.720" style="s2">contemplatively and that is defining</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.030" end="00:09:12.790" style="s2">suffering as pain times resistance so</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.720" end="00:09:15.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a multiplicative equals the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.790" end="00:09:19.180" style="s2">suffering component and the problem here</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.880" end="00:09:20.410" style="s2">is that by default in everyday life we</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.180" end="00:09:22.450" style="s2">can&#39;t really make a distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.410" end="00:09:24.820" style="s2">the resistance to the pain and the pain</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.450" end="00:09:26.710" style="s2">itself and you can have these</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.820" end="00:09:29.170" style="s2">experiences in meditation from time to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.710" end="00:09:31.030" style="s2">time where the resistance component of</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.170" end="00:09:33.850" style="s2">the suffering drops out pretty</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.030" end="00:09:37.180" style="s2">drastically or in a very clear decisive</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.850" end="00:09:38.830" style="s2">way and so one time I was on a weekend</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.180" end="00:09:40.600" style="s2">Solo retreat and meditating you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.830" end="00:09:41.860" style="s2">eight or nine hours a day and as you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.600" end="00:09:44.290" style="s2">imagine I was having some pretty extreme</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.860" end="00:09:46.450" style="s2">back pain and you know I&#39;ve been sitting</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.290" end="00:09:48.160" style="s2">for like an hour or so and I knew I</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.450" end="00:09:50.170" style="s2">could tell it was about an hour so I and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.160" end="00:09:52.090" style="s2">all of a sudden you know the back pain</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.170" end="00:09:53.800" style="s2">was just screaming like it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.090" end="00:09:55.150" style="s2">excruciating I was like I gotta maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.800" end="00:09:57.160" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna call it I can&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.150" end="00:09:59.920" style="s2">the full hour hour and a half whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.160" end="00:10:02.230" style="s2">it was and for whatever reason I just</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.920" end="00:10:03.970" style="s2">decided well screw it I&#39;m just gonna sit</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.230" end="00:10:06.310" style="s2">through it and so I resigned to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.970" end="00:10:08.320" style="s2">that there was gonna be pain and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.310" end="00:10:11.170" style="s2">moment that happened you know my back</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.320" end="00:10:13.510" style="s2">pain went from basically like a you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.170" end="00:10:15.760" style="s2">nine or a 10 on the scale of discomfort</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.510" end="00:10:17.740" style="s2">to about a two so all of a sudden it</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.760" end="00:10:18.910" style="s2">felt like a very subtle constriction in</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.740" end="00:10:20.710" style="s2">the middle of my back because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.910" end="00:10:23.230" style="s2">that room that resistance component</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.710" end="00:10:25.120" style="s2">wasn&#39;t in there and so yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.230" end="00:10:26.800" style="s2">that&#39;s important because the more</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.120" end="00:10:30.220" style="s2">familiar you become with mental</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.800" end="00:10:33.130" style="s2">resistance to discomfort or even mental</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.220" end="00:10:34.660" style="s2">attraction to comfort the inverse the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.130" end="00:10:36.940" style="s2">more you can kind of start seeing on a</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.660" end="00:10:38.110" style="s2">moment-to-moment day-to-day basis how</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.940" end="00:10:38.740" style="s2">much of your own suffering is</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.110" end="00:10:41.080" style="s2">self-created</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.740" end="00:10:42.760" style="s2">and that was the first impactful thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.080" end="00:10:44.530" style="s2">that comes to mind I&#39;ve had you know a</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.760" end="00:10:45.970" style="s2">number of other interesting things but</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.530" end="00:10:48.700" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re not quite as applicable to</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.970" end="00:10:50.380" style="s2">the day-to-day existence let&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.700" end="00:10:52.330" style="s2">branch a little bit here cuz have it</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.380" end="00:10:55.180" style="s2">down further on my list of topics but it</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.330" end="00:10:57.820" style="s2">comes up whenever one visits what I</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.180" end="00:10:58.579" style="s2">would call Buddhist inspired approaches</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.820" end="00:11:01.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.579" end="00:11:02.540" style="s2">focused on suffering and actually using</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.040" end="00:11:05.119" style="s2">the word suffering in a somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.540" end="00:11:06.829" style="s2">peculiar way yeah you know you come away</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.119" end="00:11:08.929" style="s2">reading this stuff I mean Sam Harris in</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.829" end="00:11:12.649" style="s2">particular seems to think it all of life</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.929" end="00:11:14.149" style="s2">is suffering I go what the fuck right we</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.649" end="00:11:16.009" style="s2">may have our aches and pains and</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.149" end="00:11:18.379" style="s2">problems and this and that but is it</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.009" end="00:11:23.329" style="s2">reasonable to think that all of life is</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.379" end="00:11:24.920" style="s2">suffering mm-hmm well I think the first</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.329" end="00:11:27.679" style="s2">thing to do when we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.920" end="00:11:30.319" style="s2">suffering question is definitely to look</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.679" end="00:11:31.730" style="s2">at the translation and so you know well</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.319" end="00:11:33.799" style="s2">life is suffering is a very provocative</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.730" end="00:11:36.019" style="s2">statement I think it&#39;s actually would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.799" end="00:11:39.170" style="s2">actually more skillfully translated as</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.019" end="00:11:42.589" style="s2">life is pervaded with unsatisfactoriness</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.170" end="00:11:44.929" style="s2">and the real rub is that this subtle</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.589" end="00:11:46.759" style="s2">unsatisfactoriness which every human</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.929" end="00:11:49.189" style="s2">experiences from a certain degree in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.759" end="00:11:50.480" style="s2">sense that we pursue goals and the hopes</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.189" end="00:11:52.720" style="s2">of being able to achieve them and</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.480" end="00:11:54.860" style="s2">possibly get to the place where</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.720" end="00:11:57.019" style="s2">circumstances are right and we&#39;ve kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.860" end="00:11:58.579" style="s2">of arrived and sometimes we can tell</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.019" end="00:11:59.569" style="s2">ourselves these stories about oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.579" end="00:12:01.429" style="s2">all about the journey and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.569" end="00:12:03.919" style="s2">conceptually knowing that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.429" end="00:12:05.869" style="s2">entirely true is helpful but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.919" end="00:12:07.549" style="s2">different way of seeing that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.869" end="00:12:10.970" style="s2">sometimes we&#39;re still operating under</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.549" end="00:12:13.339" style="s2">these assumptions that if we could only</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.970" end="00:12:15.889" style="s2">get or if we could only avoid or we</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.339" end="00:12:18.350" style="s2">could only be content you know these</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.889" end="00:12:20.540" style="s2">these if the circumstances came in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.350" end="00:12:22.429" style="s2">right place suddenly I would be happy</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.540" end="00:12:25.429" style="s2">there would be no or nowhere to go I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.429" end="00:12:27.499" style="s2">just be in that moment and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.429" end="00:12:29.029" style="s2">that&#39;s a far better description and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.499" end="00:12:31.970" style="s2">interesting thing too is that this</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.029" end="00:12:33.919" style="s2">unsatisfactoriness is very pervasive and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.970" end="00:12:36.230" style="s2">it&#39;s very subtle it&#39;s very like it</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.919" end="00:12:38.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not really pronounced and</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.230" end="00:12:40.809" style="s2">if it&#39;s always been there it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.600" end="00:12:42.739" style="s2">really gonna draw much of our attention</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.809" end="00:12:45.110" style="s2">one of the things that I can think of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.739" end="00:12:47.449" style="s2">actually there&#39;s a slight digression</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.110" end="00:12:49.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a simple fact that when I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.449" end="00:12:51.949" style="s2">growing up I was diagnosed with cystic</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.279" end="00:12:54.410" style="s2">fibrosis when I was born mr. dennit</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.949" end="00:12:56.449" style="s2">genetic condition and one of the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.410" end="00:12:59.869" style="s2">results of this is that you have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.449" end="00:13:02.629" style="s2">of GI problems growing up so you know it</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.869" end="00:13:04.790" style="s2">just was a standard thing that every day</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.629" end="00:13:05.809" style="s2">or you know a couple every other day or</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.790" end="00:13:07.879" style="s2">something like that I was going to have</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.809" end="00:13:09.199" style="s2">some sort of issue with my stomach and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.879" end="00:13:12.110" style="s2">some days were worse and some days were</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.199" end="00:13:13.880" style="s2">better and when I was in my early 20s I</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.110" end="00:13:17.090" style="s2">went on a diet that for whatever reason</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.880" end="00:13:19.430" style="s2">allowed my stomach to kind of reboot and</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.090" end="00:13:22.520" style="s2">all of a sudden I felt what it was like</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.430" end="00:13:25.040" style="s2">to not have any stomach discomfort at</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.520" end="00:13:27.710" style="s2">all a zero and in that moment I realized</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.040" end="00:13:29.570" style="s2">oh my God my whole life I&#39;ve been at a</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.710" end="00:13:31.610" style="s2">stomach discomfort level of five at a</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.570" end="00:13:34.760" style="s2">minimum and I never knew that there was</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.610" end="00:13:37.430" style="s2">a zero and this is very similar to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.760" end="00:13:40.190" style="s2">kind of psychological effect of chronic</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.430" end="00:13:43.640" style="s2">low-grade unsatisfaction with what is</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.190" end="00:13:45.320" style="s2">happening in the moment and the more we</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.640" end="00:13:47.060" style="s2">unravel this and understand the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.320" end="00:13:49.640" style="s2">mechanisms that that lead to this</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.060" end="00:13:50.900" style="s2">unsatisfactoriness the more rich kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.640" end="00:13:52.220" style="s2">life gets because there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.900" end="00:13:54.350" style="s2">nowhere to go and that you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.220" end="00:13:56.630" style="s2">just basking in the in the moment I</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.350" end="00:13:58.250" style="s2">suppose that doesn&#39;t sound too good</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.630" end="00:14:01.190" style="s2">sounds like a bunch of fucking hippies</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.250" end="00:14:03.200" style="s2">in mud huts isn&#39;t unsatisfactoriness</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.190" end="00:14:05.000" style="s2">what keeps us getting up in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.200" end="00:14:08.030" style="s2">and punching the world making progress</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.000" end="00:14:10.150" style="s2">and and all that sort of stuff oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.030" end="00:14:13.160" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to be on what is it</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.150" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">unsatisfactory missus I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.160" end="00:14:16.820" style="s2">unsatisfied with the way things are I</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:18.830" style="s2">mean as you know I&#39;m fairly involved in</p>

<p begin="00:14:35.680" end="00:14:40.370" style="s2">unsatisfactoriness about the world yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.180" end="00:14:41.750" style="s2">there&#39;s something fucked about our world</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.370" end="00:14:43.580" style="s2">and I don&#39;t like I don&#39;t want to leave</p>

<p begin="00:14:45.290" end="00:14:50.030" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong with that</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.790" end="00:14:52.250" style="s2">mmm-hmm nothing really unfortunately I</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.030" end="00:14:54.080" style="s2">have to say I agree with you I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.250" end="00:14:56.000" style="s2">come from the same place but I think we</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.080" end="00:14:59.570" style="s2">could probably reuse this suffering</p>

<p begin="00:14:59.570" end="00:15:03.710" style="s2">way there can still be pain there</p>

<p begin="00:15:03.710" end="00:15:08.060" style="s2">discomfort is a wanting to make things</p>

<p begin="00:15:12.440" end="00:15:19.040" style="s2">that are there for the right reason and</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.140" end="00:15:22.100" style="s2">it&#39;s simply the way that we react to</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.040" end="00:15:23.510" style="s2">these these drives and it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.100" end="00:15:25.170" style="s2">just the negative ones it&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.510" end="00:15:27.320" style="s2">positive ones too</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.170" end="00:15:31.079" style="s2">that we&#39;re adding this whole layer of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.320" end="00:15:33.990" style="s2">wanting something to either go away</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.079" end="00:15:35.490" style="s2">when it&#39;s not or wanting something to</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.990" end="00:15:36.810" style="s2">stay we know it&#39;s going to go away</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.490" end="00:15:39.089" style="s2">because there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.810" end="00:15:42.680" style="s2">permanent in our experience and both of</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.089" end="00:15:45.630" style="s2">these things create this unsatisfactory</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.680" end="00:15:47.040" style="s2">quality that pervades all of our our</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.630" end="00:15:49.589" style="s2">moment-to-moment so it&#39;s kind of like a</p>

<p begin="00:15:49.589" end="00:15:54.060" style="s2">trying to exclude but regardless</p>

<p begin="00:16:03.029" end="00:16:08.730" style="s2">drive is still there you&#39;re just not so</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.240" end="00:16:11.010" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like being on a roller coaster</p>

<p begin="00:16:11.010" end="00:16:15.079" style="s2">the hell out of it versus you know</p>

<p begin="00:16:15.079" end="00:16:20.279" style="s2">like you have some sort of control about</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.790" end="00:16:22.290" style="s2">where it&#39;s going to go or not wanting it</p>

<p begin="00:16:28.680" end="00:16:34.050" style="s2">sense a little bit though I can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.279" end="00:16:36.750" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever felt like I was existing the</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.750" end="00:16:42.120" style="s2">philosophy I people so what if I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.560" end="00:16:43.890" style="s2">pay attention to business philosophy but</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.120" end="00:16:46.800" style="s2">after I retired I could decided that in</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.890" end="00:16:50.250" style="s2">retrospect my business philosophy could</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.800" end="00:16:52.440" style="s2">be summarized in the Hunter s Thompson</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.250" end="00:16:54.240" style="s2">sentence faster and faster until the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.440" end="00:16:57.720" style="s2">thrill of speed exceeds the fear of</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.240" end="00:16:59.519" style="s2">death so I was always a letter fly</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.720" end="00:17:01.470" style="s2">motherfucker kind of first yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.519" end="00:17:03.300" style="s2">and just go for it right don&#39;t worry too</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.470" end="00:17:05.790" style="s2">much right shit hits the wall explodes</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.300" end="00:17:07.199" style="s2">which it did once oh well all right we</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.790" end="00:17:10.169" style="s2">just you know get up pick herself up</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.199" end="00:17:11.640" style="s2">dust ourselves off and go do it again so</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.169" end="00:17:13.890" style="s2">how much I&#39;ve ever felt this you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.640" end="00:17:16.020" style="s2">white-knuckle oh my god oh my god life</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.890" end="00:17:18.209" style="s2">sucks lifestyle yeah yeah well the and</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.020" end="00:17:19.620" style="s2">the white knuckled metaphor is is a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.209" end="00:17:21.660" style="s2">provocative one because it illustrates</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.620" end="00:17:23.429" style="s2">and kind of caricature eyes is this</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.660" end="00:17:24.390" style="s2">resistance but obviously it&#39;s on a</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.429" end="00:17:26.130" style="s2">spectrum here right</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.390" end="00:17:28.860" style="s2">and everybody&#39;s psychology is probably</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.130" end="00:17:30.780" style="s2">leading to more or less of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.860" end="00:17:32.370" style="s2">dissatisfaction in their</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.780" end="00:17:34.590" style="s2">moment-to-moment experience and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.370" end="00:17:37.620" style="s2">weird thing is that even if it is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.590" end="00:17:38.550" style="s2">small portion of our experience so and</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.620" end="00:17:41.760" style="s2">you know this is this kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.550" end="00:17:43.620" style="s2">speaks to the the subtleness of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.760" end="00:17:46.470" style="s2">the components here in the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.620" end="00:17:48.660" style="s2">contemplative unraveling they you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.470" end="00:17:52.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a good metaphor that I like is kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.660" end="00:17:56.060" style="s2">of like if we were to look at ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.440" end="00:17:58.800" style="s2">or our experience as being comprised of</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.060" end="00:18:00.480" style="s2">a puddle of water</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.800" end="00:18:02.520" style="s2">I suppose so all of our experience the</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.480" end="00:18:05.940" style="s2">totality of our experience is summarized</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.520" end="00:18:08.820" style="s2">in a puddle of water and there is a big</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.940" end="00:18:11.510" style="s2">difference between there being a drop of</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.820" end="00:18:13.770" style="s2">red dye that colors the entire</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.510" end="00:18:16.170" style="s2">experience and all of a sudden it has</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.770" end="00:18:20.220" style="s2">this this lens or you&#39;re kind of living</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.170" end="00:18:21.900" style="s2">in this very subtle this redness quality</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.220" end="00:18:25.380" style="s2">and then what it looks like when you go</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.900" end="00:18:27.630" style="s2">from just 0.01% of dissatisfaction to</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.380" end="00:18:29.280" style="s2">zero dissatisfaction the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.630" end="00:18:32.700" style="s2">counterintuitive thing here is that it</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.280" end="00:18:34.260" style="s2">feels significantly different and all of</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.700" end="00:18:35.670" style="s2">a sudden you can see from one edge of</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.260" end="00:18:38.130" style="s2">the puddle to the other instead of three</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.670" end="00:18:39.510" style="s2">feet in front of your face and you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.130" end="00:18:42.270" style="s2">everything&#39;s vast everything&#39;s open</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.510" end="00:18:44.190" style="s2">everything is very light and yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.270" end="00:18:46.740" style="s2">I know it&#39;s hard to explain but this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.190" end="00:18:50.100" style="s2">part of understanding the component of</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.740" end="00:18:51.540" style="s2">resistance to our experience is having</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.100" end="00:18:53.250" style="s2">these subtle experiences that when you</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.540" end="00:18:55.800" style="s2">say them don&#39;t really sound that</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.250" end="00:18:57.900" style="s2">interesting and that&#39;s why maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.800" end="00:19:00.510" style="s2">sometimes this religious language is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.900" end="00:19:01.920" style="s2">way of communicating the profundity of</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.510" end="00:19:04.080" style="s2">the experiences because it sounds a lot</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.920" end="00:19:07.350" style="s2">more interesting to dwell in the Kingdom</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.080" end="00:19:09.090" style="s2">of Heaven than it does to you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.350" end="00:19:11.010" style="s2">slightly damp in your default mode</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.090" end="00:19:13.290" style="s2">Network so that there&#39;s a less of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.010" end="00:19:16.040" style="s2">filtering experience but from the larger</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.290" end="00:19:18.750" style="s2">aspect of your brain or something right</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.040" end="00:19:20.400" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just me you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.750" end="00:19:22.200" style="s2">there are probably people like me that</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.400" end="00:19:24.900" style="s2">know you talk me about that kingdom of</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.200" end="00:19:27.090" style="s2">God and all this stuff all my natural</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.900" end="00:19:29.700" style="s2">knee-jerk just go bullshit balls it</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.090" end="00:19:32.100" style="s2">balls it right you know we&#39;ve had you</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.700" end="00:19:33.630" style="s2">know a world plagued by these religions</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.100" end="00:19:35.760" style="s2">you know as far back as anybody could</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.630" end="00:19:37.950" style="s2">find it seems like we we seem to have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.760" end="00:19:39.540" style="s2">weakness for it right you know even sam</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.950" end="00:19:41.940" style="s2">harris says yeah you walk into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.540" end="00:19:43.590" style="s2">aisles of any spiritual bookstore and</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.940" end="00:19:47.160" style="s2">you&#39;re confronted with the yearnings and</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.590" end="00:19:50.310" style="s2">credulity of our species by the yard</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.160" end="00:19:52.020" style="s2">hey you&#39;ve been into the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.310" end="00:19:54.360" style="s2">section of a bookstore you go holy shit</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.020" end="00:19:58.130" style="s2">right you know sleeping under pyramids</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.360" end="00:20:00.330" style="s2">astrology regressing to past lives</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.130" end="00:20:01.800" style="s2">probably these this day and age probably</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.330" end="00:20:05.340" style="s2">some flat earth stuff in there that</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.800" end="00:20:09.390" style="s2">humans seem to have a weakness for these</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.340" end="00:20:11.820" style="s2">complicated and ungrounded stories yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.390" end="00:20:13.350" style="s2">and you know I and as I&#39;ve learned more</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.820" end="00:20:15.450" style="s2">in particular I have really spent some</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.350" end="00:20:17.790" style="s2">time trying to learn about this stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.450" end="00:20:19.710" style="s2">can definitely see where the benefit</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.790" end="00:20:21.470" style="s2">comes from I mean there&#39;s a large body</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.710" end="00:20:24.030" style="s2">of work about just the plain old</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.470" end="00:20:26.010" style="s2">physiological benefits of equanimity</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.030" end="00:20:27.480" style="s2">that comes through things like</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.010" end="00:20:30.420" style="s2">meditation or other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.480" end="00:20:33.830" style="s2">contemplative practices and I&#39;m at least</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.420" end="00:20:36.900" style="s2">willing to provisionally by this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.830" end="00:20:38.670" style="s2">curing something like unsatisfactoriness</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.900" end="00:20:41.790" style="s2">without making you lay in bed all day</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.670" end="00:20:44.040" style="s2">which we kind of saw but I still resist</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.790" end="00:20:46.440" style="s2">being taken anywhere near the kingdom of</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.040" end="00:20:48.600" style="s2">heaven or any goddamn altars or chalices</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.440" end="00:20:52.470" style="s2">or incense burning around that horseshit</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.600" end="00:20:54.810" style="s2">right yeah and I&#39;m sure about the only</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.470" end="00:20:56.970" style="s2">one I mean you know Sam&#39;s book Sam</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.810" end="00:20:59.640" style="s2">Harris his book yeah he&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.970" end="00:21:01.920" style="s2">bummer of a dude I&#39;m afraid does not</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.640" end="00:21:04.290" style="s2">seem like a very happy guy right it</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.920" end="00:21:07.020" style="s2">seems odd for a person who talks about</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.290" end="00:21:09.390" style="s2">the endless hours including like a year</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.020" end="00:21:11.280" style="s2">one time doing nothing but better days I</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.390" end="00:21:12.200" style="s2">mean Jesus if I was as miserable as that</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.280" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">motherfucker</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.200" end="00:21:17.430" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:19.680" style="s2">but you know nonetheless you know he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.430" end="00:21:21.240" style="s2">atheist too in it and yet he&#39;s able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.680" end="00:21:22.470" style="s2">sort of buy into this but didn&#39;t doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.240" end="00:21:26.040" style="s2">seem to have made him happy he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.470" end="00:21:27.270" style="s2">seem happy dude at all yeah I guess well</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.040" end="00:21:30.300" style="s2">there&#39;s the interesting thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.270" end="00:21:32.130" style="s2">when we say happy even happiness right</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.300" end="00:21:34.140" style="s2">so one of the I think there&#39;s a million</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.130" end="00:21:35.970" style="s2">ways that we could dissect it but one of</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.140" end="00:21:37.410" style="s2">my favorite definitions of what</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.970" end="00:21:40.170" style="s2">happiness is doesn&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.410" end="00:21:42.840" style="s2">anything to do with like joyful elated</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.170" end="00:21:44.670" style="s2">States but it&#39;s actually just being okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.840" end="00:21:46.290" style="s2">with everything the way it is in this</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.670" end="00:21:49.860" style="s2">moment right and sometimes that might be</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.290" end="00:21:51.590" style="s2">mean being okay with being annoyed or</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.860" end="00:21:55.520" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.590" end="00:21:56.780" style="s2">wanted to tell the Muslim world what</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.520" end="00:21:58.460" style="s2">they need to be doing yeah whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.780" end="00:22:00.770" style="s2">is right you know Sam Harris is variant</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.460" end="00:22:04.460" style="s2">or anybody else the psychology of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.770" end="00:22:07.010" style="s2">human still seems to unfold itself and</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.460" end="00:22:09.410" style="s2">and maybe even to make a connection the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.010" end="00:22:12.380" style="s2">last episode was with Mohanji fran yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.410" end="00:22:14.120" style="s2">and I think one of the really important</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.380" end="00:22:16.970" style="s2">things to think of here is that there</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.120" end="00:22:19.190" style="s2">are multiple levels of human development</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.970" end="00:22:21.530" style="s2">and they interact with each other in</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.190" end="00:22:25.490" style="s2">interesting ways in the sense that if</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.530" end="00:22:27.230" style="s2">you&#39;re rational understanding of your</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.490" end="00:22:29.290" style="s2">place in the world and kind of how the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.230" end="00:22:33.770" style="s2">thing how the world works is very</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.290" end="00:22:36.500" style="s2">undeveloped may be very salsa stick or</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.770" end="00:22:37.820" style="s2">you know a very in group oriented where</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.500" end="00:22:39.620" style="s2">you&#39;re only can have compassion for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.820" end="00:22:41.030" style="s2">people that are you know the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.620" end="00:22:42.950" style="s2">religion or come from the same piece of</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.030" end="00:22:44.600" style="s2">land as you or something like that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.950" end="00:22:46.960" style="s2">can still have some of these really</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.600" end="00:22:49.610" style="s2">profound spiritual experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.960" end="00:22:51.320" style="s2">unfortunately the way you experience it</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.610" end="00:22:55.130" style="s2">will be through the lens of how</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.320" end="00:22:56.540" style="s2">developed you are in the the kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.130" end="00:22:58.460" style="s2">know for the I&#39;ve really liked the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.540" end="00:23:01.070" style="s2">phrase the growing up component of your</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.460" end="00:23:03.740" style="s2">personal development and the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.070" end="00:23:06.290" style="s2">stuff is more related to to waking up</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.740" end="00:23:07.910" style="s2">err aspect of our experience but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.290" end="00:23:09.860" style="s2">they&#39;re intimately connected and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.910" end="00:23:12.980" style="s2">unfortunately a lot of our traditions</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.860" end="00:23:16.250" style="s2">that explore these waking up elements of</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.980" end="00:23:19.510" style="s2">our experience were created in a you</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.250" end="00:23:22.880" style="s2">know pre-modern age and so they used</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.510" end="00:23:25.130" style="s2">magical crazy ideas of how the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.880" end="00:23:28.160" style="s2">works and they use those those elements</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.130" end="00:23:30.710" style="s2">to to describe what the what the path is</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.160" end="00:23:32.660" style="s2">like I suppose and yeah I think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.710" end="00:23:35.870" style="s2">it&#39;s just a happy accident that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.660" end="00:23:37.490" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re being able to unbounded</p>

<p begin="00:23:37.490" end="00:23:41.210" style="s2">provocative things that they wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.930" end="00:23:45.590" style="s2">that we&#39;re not housed by logic and</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.210" end="00:23:48.590" style="s2">reason in the science it still somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.590" end="00:23:50.510" style="s2">is is a there&#39;s there&#39;s still value in</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.590" end="00:23:53.210" style="s2">the sense that it could be easier to</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.510" end="00:23:55.100" style="s2">point out parts of our experience that</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.210" end="00:23:57.080" style="s2">are profound using some of the religious</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.100" end="00:24:00.800" style="s2">language still but if I&#39;m using it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.080" end="00:24:02.800" style="s2">always from a very critical lens and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.800" end="00:24:05.050" style="s2">one way it&#39;s complete bullshit and</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.800" end="00:24:07.570" style="s2">it&#39;s the most it&#39;s it&#39;s far more true of</p>

<p begin="00:24:07.570" end="00:24:11.470" style="s2">this moment yeah I love that I love that</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.490" end="00:24:13.840" style="s2">line I still don&#39;t fully understand it</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.470" end="00:24:16.210" style="s2">but I would you know like to over you</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.840" end="00:24:18.850" style="s2">know the next year or so learn more</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.210" end="00:24:20.470" style="s2">about just what that line is because</p>

<p begin="00:24:36.640" end="00:24:41.170" style="s2">truth is I&#39;ve actually had lots of these</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.770" end="00:24:43.600" style="s2">experiences and I did LSD</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.170" end="00:24:46.360" style="s2">a half-dozen times when I was a young</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.600" end="00:24:48.370" style="s2">adult I&#39;ve done other non mainstream but</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.360" end="00:24:51.790" style="s2">powerful psychedelics probably a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.370" end="00:24:54.100" style="s2">times you know I&#39;ve had very deep what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.790" end="00:24:57.370" style="s2">call mystical experiences typically</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.100" end="00:25:00.090" style="s2">involved in the outdoors and certain</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.370" end="00:25:03.670" style="s2">kinds of lighting and times of day etc</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.090" end="00:25:05.740" style="s2">you know and I can I think I even did it</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.670" end="00:25:08.140" style="s2">on one of our podcasts was maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.740" end="00:25:12.280" style="s2">why I did with Hansie or or I can flip</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.140" end="00:25:14.500" style="s2">myself into a state of non self that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.280" end="00:25:16.480" style="s2">it&#39;s actually just perception and</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.500" end="00:25:17.890" style="s2">processing without itself there but it</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.480" end="00:25:20.440" style="s2">can only do it for about two seconds yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.890" end="00:25:22.450" style="s2">and so I do all these things and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.440" end="00:25:25.810" style="s2">kind of cool and for a while I was doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.450" end="00:25:28.510" style="s2">some things with Bayern &#39;el sounds and</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.810" end="00:25:29.760" style="s2">guided meditation and stuff there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.510" end="00:25:31.870" style="s2">interesting and it&#39;s kind of enjoyable</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.760" end="00:25:33.520" style="s2">but I guess I don&#39;t see anything</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.870" end="00:25:35.590" style="s2">profound it may have I not gone far</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.520" end="00:25:41.190" style="s2">enough or am I just a naturally shallow</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.590" end="00:25:45.460" style="s2">person well that&#39;s a big question</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.190" end="00:25:49.750" style="s2">either we&#39;re all shallow in our own ways</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.460" end="00:25:51.010" style="s2">right yeah I don&#39;t know um well one</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.750" end="00:25:51.670" style="s2">thing that I think that you and I both</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.010" end="00:25:53.350" style="s2">have in common</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.670" end="00:25:55.630" style="s2">as you said I seem like a pretty happy</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.350" end="00:25:58.690" style="s2">person you know a lot of people that</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.630" end="00:26:00.940" style="s2">start this the spiritual project are</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.690" end="00:26:02.950" style="s2">there because life&#39;s tough and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.940" end="00:26:05.260" style="s2">not happy and they want to address this</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.950" end="00:26:08.140" style="s2">this very you know obviously pronounced</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.260" end="00:26:09.340" style="s2">you know higher than than normal or</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.140" end="00:26:10.900" style="s2">higher than average amount of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.340" end="00:26:13.510" style="s2">unsatisfactoriness in their experience</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.900" end="00:26:15.440" style="s2">then there&#39;s other people myself I had</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.510" end="00:26:17.059" style="s2">include where you know I actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.440" end="00:26:19.940" style="s2">I was extremely happy I was always happy</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.059" end="00:26:23.269" style="s2">you know I grew up as being you know in</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.940" end="00:26:25.730" style="s2">my family known as the kind of always</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.269" end="00:26:28.100" style="s2">equina meais always smiling making the</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.730" end="00:26:29.299" style="s2">best of every situation person and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.100" end="00:26:31.009" style="s2">know I never really felt any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.299" end="00:26:33.649" style="s2">lack of meaning or purpose in my life</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.009" end="00:26:36.110" style="s2">and yeah I was very self-assured you</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.649" end="00:26:39.440" style="s2">know psychologically you know other than</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.110" end="00:26:41.000" style="s2">maybe some some ego aggrandizement I</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.440" end="00:26:42.950" style="s2">didn&#39;t really have many of pathologies</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.000" end="00:26:44.899" style="s2">to solve with this and I actually went</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.950" end="00:26:47.059" style="s2">in there into this project with the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.899" end="00:26:50.090" style="s2">idea of making my the best self I could</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.059" end="00:26:52.789" style="s2">possibly create and it can it definitely</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.090" end="00:26:55.389" style="s2">as you said the practices do help us</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.789" end="00:26:58.309" style="s2">from a just kind of a day-to-day</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.389" end="00:27:00.679" style="s2">operating perspective you know how we</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.309" end="00:27:03.139" style="s2">choose to use our attention is a really</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.679" end="00:27:05.509" style="s2">important skill it&#39;s not only developed</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.139" end="00:27:08.809" style="s2">in meditation people live certain lives</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.509" end="00:27:10.700" style="s2">of as you said being in nature you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.809" end="00:27:12.799" style="s2">kind of away from some of the abstract</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.700" end="00:27:14.840" style="s2">concepts and things that of everyday</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.799" end="00:27:17.480" style="s2">life and able to kind of just connect to</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.840" end="00:27:19.279" style="s2">the moment and you know how be feel like</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.480" end="00:27:22.370" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re part of nature that</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.279" end="00:27:23.929" style="s2">dissolves some of that boundary get</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.370" end="00:27:25.399" style="s2">doing deep concentrate of things like</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.929" end="00:27:27.379" style="s2">you know just reading a lot and being</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.399" end="00:27:29.809" style="s2">able to hold your sustain your attention</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.379" end="00:27:34.940" style="s2">make make connections can be a good way</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.809" end="00:27:37.009" style="s2">of practicing mindful techniques and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.940" end="00:27:39.860" style="s2">and a lot of these can also be applied</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.009" end="00:27:41.149" style="s2">toward the the psychological you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.860" end="00:27:42.500" style="s2">trauma and stuff like that as well I</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.149" end="00:27:46.129" style="s2">don&#39;t really have much experience with</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.500" end="00:27:48.830" style="s2">that but there&#39;s a number of ways that</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.129" end="00:27:51.350" style="s2">it enhances our experience in a very</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.830" end="00:27:52.850" style="s2">real way one I guess the best the best</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.350" end="00:27:54.889" style="s2">way that I can think of I think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.850" end="00:27:56.529" style="s2">mentioned before the stories we tell</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.889" end="00:27:58.399" style="s2">about our experience is largely</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.529" end="00:27:59.330" style="s2">confabulated by the mind you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.399" end="00:28:01.879" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.330" end="00:28:04.309" style="s2">experience that put people in situations</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.879" end="00:28:06.649" style="s2">where they&#39;re they&#39;re being subtly or</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.309" end="00:28:08.419" style="s2">subconsciously motivated to do something</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.649" end="00:28:09.710" style="s2">and then they ask the person why and</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.419" end="00:28:12.799" style="s2">they&#39;ve come up with some story that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.710" end="00:28:16.340" style="s2">somewhat self coherent but not</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.799" end="00:28:18.830" style="s2">ultimately true in any real way because</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.340" end="00:28:20.539" style="s2">they don&#39;t have access to or not access</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.830" end="00:28:22.490" style="s2">to but but visibility of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.539" end="00:28:23.690" style="s2">machinery that&#39;s leading to decisions</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.490" end="00:28:26.450" style="s2">and things like that and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.690" end="00:28:28.400" style="s2">things that comes up as you continue to</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.450" end="00:28:31.700" style="s2">go down this path</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.400" end="00:28:33.020" style="s2">is understanding the intentions that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.700" end="00:28:34.700" style="s2">arising in your moment to moment</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.020" end="00:28:37.880" style="s2">experience that lead to you doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.700" end="00:28:39.580" style="s2">something and the the very fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.880" end="00:28:42.770" style="s2">thing that we start to realize is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.580" end="00:28:44.360" style="s2">because we&#39;re a ego in the trap behind</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.770" end="00:28:46.580" style="s2">the head</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.360" end="00:28:48.230" style="s2">in most of our waking life like you said</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.580" end="00:28:49.790" style="s2">we have these moments where that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.230" end="00:28:52.310" style="s2">gets stripped away and it&#39;s just process</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.790" end="00:28:54.410" style="s2">happening and unfolding in a unbounded</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.310" end="00:28:55.790" style="s2">way but when we&#39;re constricted into this</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.410" end="00:28:57.410" style="s2">agent who&#39;s separate from his</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.790" end="00:29:01.790" style="s2">environment trying to get wet he or she</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.410" end="00:29:04.100" style="s2">wants it can be frustrating and all of</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.790" end="00:29:05.480" style="s2">our decisions are self oriented like you</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.100" end="00:29:07.580" style="s2">know that&#39;s like what do I need to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.480" end="00:29:10.340" style="s2">happy in this situation and the more you</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.580" end="00:29:11.780" style="s2">start to realize how prevalent this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.340" end="00:29:12.710" style="s2">in our moment alone experience and this</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.780" end="00:29:14.720" style="s2">is deeply connected to that</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.710" end="00:29:16.970" style="s2">unsatisfactoriness what can I get from</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:18.110" style="s2">my environment that I don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.970" end="00:29:20.840" style="s2">more you realize that it&#39;s you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.110" end="00:29:21.980" style="s2">working less in harmony with others and</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.840" end="00:29:23.720" style="s2">so this is maybe something that I said</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.980" end="00:29:25.640" style="s2">that was kind of provocative on the game</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.720" end="00:29:29.390" style="s2">B topic on Twitter where I said you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.640" end="00:29:33.290" style="s2">without sufficiently deconstructing the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.390" end="00:29:35.900" style="s2">ego collectivist action is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.290" end="00:29:36.860" style="s2">really hard to solve because everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.900" end="00:29:39.500" style="s2">acting selfishly</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.860" end="00:29:41.450" style="s2">and the the rub is we don&#39;t know that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.500" end="00:29:42.740" style="s2">ROCK were acting selfishly so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.450" end="00:29:45.500" style="s2">kind of put ourselves in those spaces</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.740" end="00:29:48.230" style="s2">where self other distinctions start to</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.500" end="00:29:50.780" style="s2">dissolve in order to be acting from a</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.230" end="00:29:53.210" style="s2">place of you know working toward a</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.780" end="00:29:55.490" style="s2">common group goal and maybe that&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.210" end="00:29:57.170" style="s2">one example very tactical stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.490" end="00:29:58.460" style="s2">that&#39;s connected or directly to some of</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.170" end="00:30:00.980" style="s2">the game P discussion that you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.460" end="00:30:03.560" style="s2">as well these days yeah and as you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.980" end="00:30:05.450" style="s2">in my recent essay a journey to game B I</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.560" end="00:30:08.360" style="s2">laid out a couple of good-sized sections</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.450" end="00:30:10.520" style="s2">on psycho technologies for exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.360" end="00:30:13.520" style="s2">reason you know I would say I&#39;m less</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.520" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">sure of exactly what and exactly how but</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.520" end="00:30:17.780" style="s2">it does seem to me that contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:20.270" style="s2">practices psychedelics and neurofeedback</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.780" end="00:30:23.360" style="s2">who knows what neuro stimulation even</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.270" end="00:30:25.850" style="s2">who knows may allow us to operate better</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.360" end="00:30:27.770" style="s2">together as coherent groups and cohesive</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.850" end="00:30:30.980" style="s2">groups yeah than we do in our current</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.770" end="00:30:32.450" style="s2">kind of toxic society let me go back on</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.980" end="00:30:34.970" style="s2">a couple other things that you talked</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.450" end="00:30:38.240" style="s2">about in passing one is indeed my</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.970" end="00:30:40.880" style="s2">favorite topic of the confabulate er</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.240" end="00:30:42.260" style="s2">mmm-hmm this isn&#39;t really to my mind a</p>

<p begin="00:30:53.810" end="00:30:58.190" style="s2">and some another and his mentor I forget</p>

<p begin="00:31:05.090" end="00:31:09.380" style="s2">images were presented that only one half</p>

<p begin="00:31:15.890" end="00:31:20.000" style="s2">to explain what they had seen and make</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.440" end="00:31:23.090" style="s2">up stories that somehow the thing that</p>

<p begin="00:31:23.090" end="00:31:27.770" style="s2">gets embedded into a story etc and</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.600" end="00:31:30.470" style="s2">Gazzaniga and his people he worked with</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.770" end="00:31:33.200" style="s2">called this confabulation a recent book</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.470" end="00:31:35.600" style="s2">I read goes further an amazing way and</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.200" end="00:31:37.190" style="s2">you know I&#39;m gonna read this book again</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.600" end="00:31:39.260" style="s2">and then I&#39;m gonna have the author on</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.190" end="00:31:41.900" style="s2">the podcast and the books called the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.260" end="00:31:45.350" style="s2">mind is flat and the author is Nick</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.900" end="00:31:48.530" style="s2">shader CH a ter he takes the really</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.350" end="00:31:51.680" style="s2">radical perspective that we are nothing</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.530" end="00:31:53.810" style="s2">but a series of memories which can be</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.680" end="00:31:56.030" style="s2">searched in pair in parallel and then a</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.810" end="00:31:58.070" style="s2">confabulate ER which tries to make the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.030" end="00:32:00.680" style="s2">best sense out of them that it can and a</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.070" end="00:32:04.220" style="s2">story that it tells to ourself yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.680" end="00:32:06.650" style="s2">think it is a largely true description</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.220" end="00:32:09.650" style="s2">of what is happening in human cognition</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.650" end="00:32:11.690" style="s2">and so this is where maybe that that</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.650" end="00:32:13.940" style="s2">spirit were where it comes in the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.690" end="00:32:17.450" style="s2">interesting thing is that our experience</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.940" end="00:32:18.650" style="s2">is also pervaded by non conceptual stuff</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.450" end="00:32:20.420" style="s2">you know so we have our feelings and</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.650" end="00:32:21.980" style="s2">emotions and the the feel you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.420" end="00:32:23.630" style="s2">understanding what it means to be a body</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.980" end="00:32:24.890" style="s2">that has all these different sensory</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.630" end="00:32:26.420" style="s2">organs that are constantly taking a</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.890" end="00:32:28.820" style="s2">bunch of information from arcs our</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.420" end="00:32:31.400" style="s2">experience as well and yes that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.820" end="00:32:34.700" style="s2">incorporated directly with the the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.400" end="00:32:36.530" style="s2">mind process what&#39;s interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.700" end="00:32:40.760" style="s2">so many of the practices that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.530" end="00:32:43.960" style="s2">doing is actually aimed at looking in</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.760" end="00:32:45.560" style="s2">between the thoughts in the stories or</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.960" end="00:32:47.779" style="s2">deconstructing the thoughts and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.560" end="00:32:49.609" style="s2">stories and seeing how they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.779" end="00:32:51.409" style="s2">what where they&#39;re coming from and</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.609" end="00:32:54.499" style="s2">seeing that their confabulations and</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.409" end="00:32:56.179" style="s2">when we see it in a real deep way all of</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.499" end="00:32:57.710" style="s2">a sudden we kind of take ourselves a</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.179" end="00:32:59.690" style="s2">little less seriously you know like</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.710" end="00:33:01.940" style="s2">these ideas like wow I mean they could</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.690" end="00:33:03.259" style="s2">be kind of true and and yeah you know we</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.940" end="00:33:04.789" style="s2">do have other tools to be able to help</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.259" end="00:33:07.099" style="s2">out like the scientific method where we</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.789" end="00:33:10.129" style="s2">can actually put them to the test to</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.099" end="00:33:12.590" style="s2">help orient closer to what is actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.129" end="00:33:13.759" style="s2">happening but the interesting thing is</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.590" end="00:33:16.820" style="s2">that I think a lot of what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.759" end="00:33:18.859" style="s2">and another reason that action becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.820" end="00:33:21.619" style="s2">little bit more skillful where maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.859" end="00:33:24.259" style="s2">little bit a lot a lot more skillful is</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.619" end="00:33:28.609" style="s2">that we get such so tunnel-visioned on</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.259" end="00:33:31.279" style="s2">the allowed conceptual elements the</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.609" end="00:33:33.379" style="s2">thoughts the ideas the images of our</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.279" end="00:33:35.809" style="s2">experience and don&#39;t see what&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.379" end="00:33:39.379" style="s2">in between which is the feelings and</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.809" end="00:33:41.839" style="s2">there is and there&#39;s also an element of</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.379" end="00:33:45.229" style="s2">our experience that that pervades every</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.839" end="00:33:47.239" style="s2">like that is prior to it feels making</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.229" end="00:33:50.629" style="s2">any kind of objective claims here but</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.239" end="00:33:53.960" style="s2">there is a a feeling of a more raw just</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.629" end="00:33:56.719" style="s2">simple knowingness that you can start to</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.960" end="00:33:59.299" style="s2">tap into and you realize that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.719" end="00:34:01.969" style="s2">knowingness is not just attached that</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.299" end="00:34:05.089" style="s2">allowed sensory experiences it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.969" end="00:34:07.669" style="s2">attached to you know more subtle things</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.089" end="00:34:09.020" style="s2">in between that the space in between the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.669" end="00:34:11.569" style="s2">silence in between I think you&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.020" end="00:34:14.299" style="s2">about like hearing the the songless a</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.569" end="00:34:16.369" style="s2">song or whatever it is yeah the song</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.299" end="00:34:18.079" style="s2">with no words I mean when I get into a</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.369" end="00:34:20.119" style="s2">very very deep you know with the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.079" end="00:34:22.609" style="s2">heaviest psychedelics or the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.119" end="00:34:24.770" style="s2">trances or you know I shitload of</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.609" end="00:34:28.609" style="s2">nitrous oxide I always get to this point</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.770" end="00:34:30.710" style="s2">where the same song is playing and it</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.609" end="00:34:33.349" style="s2">has words but it doesn&#39;t have words it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.710" end="00:34:35.210" style="s2">just the weirdest fucking thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.349" end="00:34:36.679" style="s2">yeah I mean and that&#39;s the weird thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.210" end="00:34:38.450" style="s2">right we have this you know these very</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.679" end="00:34:40.789" style="s2">subtle elements of our experience would</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.450" end="00:34:42.859" style="s2">you start never present in our</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.789" end="00:34:44.210" style="s2">moment-to-moment experience and I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.859" end="00:34:46.190" style="s2">this is what a lot of those those major</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.210" end="00:34:47.419" style="s2">trade shifts like the the you know they</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.190" end="00:34:49.010" style="s2">talk about kind of hitting certain</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.419" end="00:34:51.079" style="s2">milestones where all of a sudden your</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.010" end="00:34:52.669" style="s2">perspective is completely shifted it can</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.079" end="00:34:54.770" style="s2">be not through effort but just</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.669" end="00:34:56.389" style="s2">implicitly running in the background</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.770" end="00:34:58.460" style="s2">where you&#39;re kind of have a broader</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.389" end="00:34:59.630" style="s2">awareness of the context of your</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.460" end="00:35:00.770" style="s2">thoughts and feelings and everything</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.630" end="00:35:02.660" style="s2">like that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.770" end="00:35:06.290" style="s2">kind of expands the available</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.660" end="00:35:08.570" style="s2">information to cohesively make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.290" end="00:35:11.360" style="s2">and you know I think this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.570" end="00:35:12.710" style="s2">this is what it feels like at least and</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.360" end="00:35:15.200" style="s2">and it points to a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.710" end="00:35:17.060" style="s2">discussions about meaningfulness how to</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.200" end="00:35:18.950" style="s2">navigate toward the meaningful elements</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.060" end="00:35:21.410" style="s2">of our experience it requires us to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.950" end="00:35:22.910" style="s2">available to all of our senses and</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.410" end="00:35:25.670" style="s2">everything that&#39;s going on and if we get</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.910" end="00:35:28.670" style="s2">constricted into you know one small</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.670" end="00:35:32.810" style="s2">chain maybe an idea or a thought of or a</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.670" end="00:35:35.450" style="s2">string of words and images strewn</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.810" end="00:35:36.920" style="s2">together if while that is going on we</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.450" end="00:35:39.800" style="s2">can also be in touch with our emotional</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.920" end="00:35:41.510" style="s2">experience and that may be the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.800" end="00:35:44.300" style="s2">experience of others around us because</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.510" end="00:35:45.470" style="s2">we&#39;re social humans we if we&#39;re aware of</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.300" end="00:35:47.600" style="s2">it we sense into other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.470" end="00:35:49.280" style="s2">reactions as well all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.600" end="00:35:50.150" style="s2">there&#39;s this like larger coherence that</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.280" end="00:35:52.250" style="s2">can arise</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.150" end="00:35:54.530" style="s2">instead of being localized into just one</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.250" end="00:35:56.870" style="s2">tiny element of our experience and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.530" end="00:35:58.490" style="s2">constriction comes from having an</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.870" end="00:36:02.810" style="s2">agendas about things being different</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.490" end="00:36:04.160" style="s2">than what they should be like even if</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.810" end="00:36:06.710" style="s2">it&#39;s already there so like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.160" end="00:36:10.220" style="s2">great and simple definitions of this big</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.710" end="00:36:13.100" style="s2">word enlightenment that I like is simply</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.220" end="00:36:14.480" style="s2">the complete cooperation with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.100" end="00:36:16.400" style="s2">inevitable what has happened has</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.480" end="00:36:20.960" style="s2">happened and you are only looking</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.400" end="00:36:23.090" style="s2">forward as opposed to being stuck on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.960" end="00:36:25.190" style="s2">things that you wish were different and</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.090" end="00:36:26.840" style="s2">so yeah that but for whatever that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.190" end="00:36:28.700" style="s2">worth that&#39;s pulling the number of</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.840" end="00:36:31.220" style="s2">threads together and seeing if they they</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.700" end="00:36:33.380" style="s2">work for you you know the last part I</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.220" end="00:36:35.300" style="s2">like a lot of any people who work with</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.380" end="00:36:38.090" style="s2">me and known with me that is very very</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.300" end="00:36:40.370" style="s2">similar to the advice I my cheap five</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.090" end="00:36:42.290" style="s2">cents worth of psychological advice is</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.370" end="00:36:44.840" style="s2">fuck the past that&#39;s why they call it</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.290" end="00:36:47.240" style="s2">the past right that&#39;s basically the</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.840" end="00:36:49.130" style="s2">ruddy in psychotherapy which I can give</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.240" end="00:36:50.990" style="s2">to anybody for a nickel right you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.130" end="00:36:52.280" style="s2">why the hell do we get so wrapped up in</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.990" end="00:36:53.900" style="s2">the past can&#39;t do anything about it you</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.280" end="00:36:55.550" style="s2">know all kinds of fucked up things have</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.900" end="00:36:57.260" style="s2">happened to all of us right not a</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.550" end="00:36:59.210" style="s2">goddamn thing we can do about it</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.260" end="00:37:00.500" style="s2">you know let&#39;s focus on moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.210" end="00:37:02.750" style="s2">but I want to hit a couple other things</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.500" end="00:37:05.840" style="s2">first let&#39;s retouch on that but you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.750" end="00:37:08.420" style="s2">just some science touch points one that</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.840" end="00:37:10.010" style="s2">speaks to this sense that you know our</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.420" end="00:37:13.190" style="s2">actions are more ineffable than we</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.010" end="00:37:14.570" style="s2">likely know the work of benjamin lai</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.190" end="00:37:17.960" style="s2">&#39;but the famous live</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.570" end="00:37:19.250" style="s2">experiments which show reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.960" end="00:37:21.320" style="s2">convincingly and as far as I know</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.250" end="00:37:23.330" style="s2">they&#39;ve not been refuted anybody knows a</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.320" end="00:37:25.940" style="s2">refutation of the lie but let me know</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.330" end="00:37:28.250" style="s2">but it appears we make a decision like</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.940" end="00:37:31.160" style="s2">to move our hand to pick up a glass of</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.250" end="00:37:34.210" style="s2">water before we&#39;re consciously aware of</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.160" end="00:37:37.460" style="s2">it and so that our consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.210" end="00:37:40.640" style="s2">essentially the movie of rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.460" end="00:37:42.290" style="s2">mechanism by which the the decisions are</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.640" end="00:37:43.670" style="s2">actually made and the other one this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.290" end="00:37:45.440" style="s2">a book I recommended I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.670" end="00:37:48.260" style="s2">many times I&#39;m going to do it again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.440" end="00:37:51.050" style="s2">by Antonio Damasio and it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.260" end="00:37:53.720" style="s2">feeling of what happens body and emotion</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.050" end="00:37:56.270" style="s2">in the making of consciousness he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.720" end="00:37:58.940" style="s2">clinical psychologist and he goes into</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.270" end="00:38:00.940" style="s2">some of his cases of people who have</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.940" end="00:38:03.920" style="s2">certain kinds of free frontal cortex</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.940" end="00:38:05.750" style="s2">injuries where the emotional signal</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.920" end="00:38:07.940" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get to the decision-making at</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.750" end="00:38:09.260" style="s2">all and they literally would starve to</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.940" end="00:38:10.820" style="s2">death because they couldn&#39;t decide what</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.260" end="00:38:13.310" style="s2">they have for breakfast yeah at the end</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.820" end="00:38:16.480" style="s2">of the day most of our decisions are not</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.310" end="00:38:19.400" style="s2">actually analytically derived by some</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.480" end="00:38:21.440" style="s2">you know Aristotelian logic or some such</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.400" end="00:38:23.840" style="s2">we got them sort of roughly framed up</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.440" end="00:38:25.550" style="s2">and then emotion tips the hand for us</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.840" end="00:38:28.250" style="s2">right that&#39;s what&#39;s really going on and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.550" end="00:38:30.950" style="s2">I think both lie bit and Damacio are</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.250" end="00:38:33.440" style="s2">very strong support for that perspective</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.950" end="00:38:35.330" style="s2">let me also jump back to something that</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.440" end="00:38:37.460" style="s2">you talked about that cause my ears to</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.330" end="00:38:39.230" style="s2">really prick up and if if true this</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.460" end="00:38:42.020" style="s2">would be a cool and maybe a good way to</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.230" end="00:38:44.480" style="s2">rebrand all this stuff could one say</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.020" end="00:38:46.970" style="s2">that becoming an expert at meditative</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.480" end="00:38:49.010" style="s2">contemplative practice is basically</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.970" end="00:38:51.770" style="s2">learning how to hack the confabulate er</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.010" end="00:38:54.650" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.770" end="00:38:57.530" style="s2">yeah I mean this is the weird thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.650" end="00:38:58.940" style="s2">right like to understand the Machine if</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.530" end="00:39:01.190" style="s2">you understand how it&#39;s being made it</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.940" end="00:39:02.900" style="s2">gives you some influence on when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.190" end="00:39:05.240" style="s2">being constructed in the future just</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.900" end="00:39:06.460" style="s2">because there&#39;s an awareness of it you</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.240" end="00:39:10.250" style="s2">know it&#39;s kind of the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.460" end="00:39:11.300" style="s2">being a UI designer who&#39;s putting</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.250" end="00:39:13.340" style="s2">together the different elements for a</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.300" end="00:39:17.060" style="s2">website but then there&#39;s also this</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.340" end="00:39:19.580" style="s2">underlying source code that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.060" end="00:39:21.200" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s creating the images and</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.580" end="00:39:24.080" style="s2">the interaction that you&#39;re having with</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.200" end="00:39:26.300" style="s2">the screen and so a lot of yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.080" end="00:39:28.100" style="s2">confabulate ER is is kind of the process</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.300" end="00:39:30.440" style="s2">of understanding the source code of our</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.100" end="00:39:31.790" style="s2">find the fundamental components the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.440" end="00:39:34.520" style="s2">better you understand the system the</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.790" end="00:39:36.470" style="s2">easier it is for it to work in harmony I</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.520" end="00:39:38.680" style="s2">suppose I don&#39;t know yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.470" end="00:39:43.960" style="s2">weird thing here as you say it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.680" end="00:39:46.700" style="s2">you&#39;re not driving but your action is</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.960" end="00:39:48.020" style="s2">dependent on how much information how</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.700" end="00:39:50.090" style="s2">much bandwidth you&#39;re getting in your</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.020" end="00:39:52.220" style="s2">moment-to-moment experience and if that</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.090" end="00:39:54.350" style="s2">can include the source code it can be</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.220" end="00:39:56.030" style="s2">really powerful that that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.350" end="00:39:57.380" style="s2">but I have a slightly different thought</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.030" end="00:39:58.550" style="s2">I&#39;m just I&#39;m sort of thinking out loud</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.380" end="00:40:01.160" style="s2">here so this might end up being</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.550" end="00:40:04.070" style="s2">gibberish but I&#39;m trying to actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.160" end="00:40:06.740" style="s2">formulate here on the fly a way that if</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.070" end="00:40:08.750" style="s2">getting good at contemplative practice</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.740" end="00:40:11.030" style="s2">allows one to hack the confabulate er</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.750" end="00:40:15.590" style="s2">how long could actually use that to</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.030" end="00:40:19.370" style="s2">steer the ship and that is if we assume</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.590" end="00:40:22.150" style="s2">that labelling Damacio are essentially</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.370" end="00:40:24.500" style="s2">right that a whole series of unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.150" end="00:40:27.740" style="s2">mechanisms end up making the final</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.500" end="00:40:29.930" style="s2">decision but nonetheless those</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.740" end="00:40:31.490" style="s2">unconscious processes have to be working</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.930" end="00:40:34.700" style="s2">on something and what they&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.490" end="00:40:37.460" style="s2">is our memories plus our conscious</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.700" end="00:40:40.400" style="s2">contents now interestingly our conscious</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.460" end="00:40:42.800" style="s2">contents also include and maybe only for</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.400" end="00:40:44.240" style="s2">humans something called internal talk</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.800" end="00:40:47.090" style="s2">you know we&#39;re talking to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.240" end="00:40:49.370" style="s2">internally yeah fairly often in fact</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.090" end="00:40:51.740" style="s2">paulten yeah maybe not all the time</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.370" end="00:40:54.020" style="s2">maybe not when we&#39;re actively engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.740" end="00:40:55.670" style="s2">a hardcore activity the action mode</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.020" end="00:40:57.740" style="s2">Network but when we&#39;re in the default</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.670" end="00:41:00.260" style="s2">mode Network we&#39;re certainly talking to</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.740" end="00:41:02.150" style="s2">ourselves a lot and so what happens if</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.260" end="00:41:04.310" style="s2">rather than just letting the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.150" end="00:41:06.710" style="s2">throw up what the fuck up once this</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.310" end="00:41:09.860" style="s2">level of awareness that&#39;s hacking the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.710" end="00:41:11.420" style="s2">confabulate err intentionally while</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.860" end="00:41:14.990" style="s2">watching the moving parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.420" end="00:41:18.890" style="s2">confabulate er from inside decides what</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.990" end="00:41:21.710" style="s2">new internal talk tokens ie words to</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.890" end="00:41:23.510" style="s2">shove into conscious content and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.710" end="00:41:25.490" style="s2">you&#39;re not exactly sure what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.510" end="00:41:27.140" style="s2">confabulate err will do with it but you</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.490" end="00:41:28.850" style="s2">do know when you change the content it</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.140" end="00:41:31.040" style="s2">changes the output of the confabulate er</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.850" end="00:41:34.220" style="s2">and if you were to test this you could</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.040" end="00:41:37.040" style="s2">become perhaps fairly good at out</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.220" end="00:41:40.100" style="s2">hacking the confabulate er by instead of</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.040" end="00:41:41.910" style="s2">allowing you know unknown words to pop</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.100" end="00:41:43.890" style="s2">up from the unconsciousness</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.910" end="00:41:48.150" style="s2">let this intermediate level of awareness</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.890" end="00:41:50.130" style="s2">pop words into the conscious frank is</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.150" end="00:41:53.039" style="s2">that insane or is that neat reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.130" end="00:41:55.200" style="s2">it&#39;s reasonable but again that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.039" end="00:41:57.420" style="s2">counter a paradoxical element here is</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.200" end="00:42:00.480" style="s2">that something similar to that process</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.420" end="00:42:02.819" style="s2">does happen the the wider you open your</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.480" end="00:42:04.920" style="s2">moment to moment experience and less</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.819" end="00:42:07.109" style="s2">hyper focused and tunnel visioned we get</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.920" end="00:42:08.780" style="s2">on certain elements of it it allows for</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.109" end="00:42:11.339" style="s2">these disparate connections and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.780" end="00:42:12.569" style="s2">awareness of the thoughts most of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.339" end="00:42:13.920" style="s2">time we&#39;re not aware of the vast</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.569" end="00:42:15.539" style="s2">majority of the thoughts that come up</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.920" end="00:42:17.039" style="s2">they kind of just go under the radar and</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.539" end="00:42:19.109" style="s2">we&#39;re very subtly aware of them or</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.039" end="00:42:20.819" style="s2">something like that you know my early</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.109" end="00:42:23.130" style="s2">what am i early meditation was like just</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.819" end="00:42:24.630" style="s2">watching thoughts and you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.130" end="00:42:27.059" style="s2">they&#39;re weird they just spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.630" end="00:42:29.160" style="s2">pop out of nothing and you know and if</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.059" end="00:42:30.359" style="s2">you get focused on one of them all of a</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.160" end="00:42:32.339" style="s2">sudden they start building on each other</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.359" end="00:42:34.410" style="s2">but you know a lot of times they just</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.339" end="00:42:37.410" style="s2">come out of nowhere and you you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.410" end="00:42:39.270" style="s2">watching them pop up but anyways so if</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.410" end="00:42:41.010" style="s2">if you&#39;re opening the the playing field</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.270" end="00:42:45.299" style="s2">for all of the potential thoughts to</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.010" end="00:42:47.490" style="s2">arise it gives you a far better measure</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.299" end="00:42:48.720" style="s2">of what to do but you know here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.490" end="00:42:51.799" style="s2">interesting thing especially when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.720" end="00:42:55.020" style="s2">talking about thought the thoughts are a</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.799" end="00:42:59.819" style="s2">conceptuality mind conceptuality images</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.020" end="00:43:02.160" style="s2">and words they are and sounds as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.819" end="00:43:04.770" style="s2">covering mentally generated content</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.160" end="00:43:07.319" style="s2">there are a very important part of how</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.770" end="00:43:08.849" style="s2">we&#39;re navigating the world but the</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.319" end="00:43:11.789" style="s2">interesting thing is that the more you</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.849" end="00:43:13.740" style="s2">become aware of your embodied experience</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.789" end="00:43:16.680" style="s2">you know that a lot of people would say</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.740" end="00:43:18.450" style="s2">emotional or intuitive you start to</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.680" end="00:43:21.059" style="s2">realize that the body is far more</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.450" end="00:43:23.160" style="s2">informed to actually make decisions even</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.059" end="00:43:25.680" style="s2">though the mental content is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.160" end="00:43:27.869" style="s2">triggering those emotional reactions of</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.680" end="00:43:29.130" style="s2">go toward it or go away from it and</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.869" end="00:43:30.420" style="s2">here&#39;s the other interesting thing I</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.130" end="00:43:31.890" style="s2">think this is why it&#39;s still important</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.420" end="00:43:33.150" style="s2">because if we&#39;re saying that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.890" end="00:43:35.099" style="s2">controlling your thoughts then why the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.150" end="00:43:36.869" style="s2">hell do we read in philosophy or doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.099" end="00:43:38.849" style="s2">science right we don&#39;t have control over</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.869" end="00:43:40.470" style="s2">any of it but the thing is is that more</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.849" end="00:43:43.319" style="s2">conceptual &#39;ti we feed ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.470" end="00:43:46.140" style="s2">it actually permeates our psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.319" end="00:43:48.990" style="s2">burrows its way deep in so the the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.140" end="00:43:51.000" style="s2">intuitions are kind of a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.990" end="00:43:53.940" style="s2">all of the things all of your prior</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.000" end="00:43:55.310" style="s2">experience that it knows but it&#39;s subtle</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.940" end="00:43:57.160" style="s2">because it&#39;s non conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.310" end="00:44:00.050" style="s2">because you have the are embodied</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.160" end="00:44:02.600" style="s2">movement is probably evolutionarily far</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.050" end="00:44:04.820" style="s2">older than the the mind oriented version</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.600" end="00:44:07.270" style="s2">of it and so you kind of have to have</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.820" end="00:44:10.100" style="s2">these two modes working together to</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.270" end="00:44:12.290" style="s2">optimally move through your your</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.100" end="00:44:13.640" style="s2">experience and it creates the space</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.290" end="00:44:15.800" style="s2">where you know this is where sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.640" end="00:44:17.720" style="s2">the word you know that has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.800" end="00:44:19.940" style="s2">baggage with it is weird</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.720" end="00:44:22.670" style="s2">it requires sometimes that that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.940" end="00:44:25.250" style="s2">a faith in your intuition and you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.670" end="00:44:27.260" style="s2">no idea why and you know that any story</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.250" end="00:44:28.340" style="s2">that comes up any confabulation of why</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.260" end="00:44:28.700" style="s2">it is that you&#39;re doing what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.340" end="00:44:31.640" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.700" end="00:44:33.290" style="s2">is that really true even though there is</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.640" end="00:44:34.940" style="s2">we can&#39;t always say that yes there are</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.290" end="00:44:37.040" style="s2">there are truths in all of our</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.940" end="00:44:39.110" style="s2">experience but our mental contents far</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.040" end="00:44:41.900" style="s2">less true than we assume and when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.110" end="00:44:44.720" style="s2">in this subject object dualistic default</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.900" end="00:44:47.690" style="s2">human mode we give most of our attention</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.720" end="00:44:50.300" style="s2">to the thoughts in the memories and less</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.690" end="00:44:51.740" style="s2">to the actual embodied censorial</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.300" end="00:44:53.960" style="s2">experience of what&#39;s happening in that</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.740" end="00:44:56.180" style="s2">moment and if we want to tune into the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.960" end="00:44:58.190" style="s2">the flow of things you know this is why</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.180" end="00:44:59.210" style="s2">we call it flow and you&#39;re in the when</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.190" end="00:45:01.250" style="s2">you&#39;re in play into sports or something</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.210" end="00:45:03.080" style="s2">like that or having a great conversation</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.250" end="00:45:06.200" style="s2">it&#39;s an embodied thing it&#39;s felt it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.080" end="00:45:07.880" style="s2">not a not a thought process well I would</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.200" end="00:45:09.740" style="s2">argue that the that thoughts might be</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.880" end="00:45:10.130" style="s2">part of that right definitely part of it</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.740" end="00:45:12.020" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.130" end="00:45:14.480" style="s2">for instance you know I&#39;ve written about</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.020" end="00:45:17.780" style="s2">how one of the ways I solve hard</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.480" end="00:45:19.520" style="s2">problems is to go for a walk and get my</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.780" end="00:45:21.470" style="s2">head in a state where it&#39;s having a</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.520" end="00:45:23.630" style="s2">conversation with itself about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.470" end="00:45:25.490" style="s2">problem yeah I do this particularly for</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.630" end="00:45:26.990" style="s2">a really difficult programming problem I</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.490" end="00:45:29.750" style="s2">still write software some time the time</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.990" end="00:45:32.120" style="s2">and being not an everyday professional</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.750" end="00:45:34.160" style="s2">ain&#39;t as good at is it I used to be but</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.120" end="00:45:36.560" style="s2">if I can run into a dead end and I can</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.160" end="00:45:38.990" style="s2">go walk for 20 minutes and let my brain</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.560" end="00:45:41.360" style="s2">have a conversation with itself only</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.990" end="00:45:45.380" style="s2">about the problem and about nothing else</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.360" end="00:45:47.060" style="s2">it&#39;s astounding how far I can I&#39;m almost</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.380" end="00:45:49.550" style="s2">like a spectator at this show it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.060" end="00:45:53.120" style="s2">really quite amazing and you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.550" end="00:45:56.450" style="s2">routine way I solve problems and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.120" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">body is probably in the loop of helping</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.450" end="00:45:59.930" style="s2">choose what the next word from the</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:02.510" style="s2">unconsciousness is in this dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.930" end="00:46:04.700" style="s2">to your point why study or why work why</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.510" end="00:46:07.100" style="s2">read books the other thing that&#39;s key is</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.700" end="00:46:09.579" style="s2">our memories are the raw material from</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.100" end="00:46:12.040" style="s2">which the unconscious is hauling stuff</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.579" end="00:46:13.930" style="s2">so the more relevant stuff you have in</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.040" end="00:46:16.569" style="s2">your memory and the more it&#39;s linked</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.930" end="00:46:18.310" style="s2">correctly I you actually have proper</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.569" end="00:46:20.470" style="s2">knowledge structures in your brain</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.310" end="00:46:21.730" style="s2">rather than just the garbage that so</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.470" end="00:46:22.990" style="s2">many people have that a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.730" end="00:46:26.200" style="s2">disconnected words but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.990" end="00:46:30.369" style="s2">structured in a in a rich fashion then</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.200" end="00:46:32.500" style="s2">the intuitions in your memory and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.369" end="00:46:34.690" style="s2">structures of your memory work together</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.500" end="00:46:37.030" style="s2">to produce this dance of internal</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.690" end="00:46:40.480" style="s2">conversation which was some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.030" end="00:46:43.270" style="s2">magic prefrontal light self like touch</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.480" end="00:46:44.619" style="s2">stays converged on the problem rather</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.270" end="00:46:46.180" style="s2">than wandering off my what I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.619" end="00:46:48.430" style="s2">have for lunch or something and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.180" end="00:46:51.460" style="s2">just amazing to watch this dialogue take</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.430" end="00:46:54.819" style="s2">place and fairly rapidly solve the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.460" end="00:46:56.740" style="s2">problem yeah and I would say the the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.819" end="00:46:58.210" style="s2">core mechanism is that you know as long</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.740" end="00:47:00.190" style="s2">as there&#39;s a strong intention to stay</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.210" end="00:47:01.450" style="s2">with something I will stay with it okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.190" end="00:47:02.680" style="s2">and the more you practice it staying</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.450" end="00:47:05.200" style="s2">with something but the easier it is to</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.680" end="00:47:07.119" style="s2">to do so yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.200" end="00:47:10.300" style="s2">conceptual that he&#39;s huge it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.119" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">part of it you know like and even if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.300" end="00:47:13.990" style="s2">get into the the deep waters of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.160" end="00:47:16.660" style="s2">content of space you you spend a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.990" end="00:47:18.609" style="s2">time reading and understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.660" end="00:47:20.680" style="s2">philosophy behind this stuff you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.609" end="00:47:23.800" style="s2">then it just comes down to to putting it</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.680" end="00:47:25.770" style="s2">into practice so so in your sense what I</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.800" end="00:47:28.540" style="s2">would say is that the thought is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.770" end="00:47:31.089" style="s2">allowing us to explore a certain</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.540" end="00:47:34.660" style="s2">territory or problem or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.089" end="00:47:36.160" style="s2">but the body is actually the judge so</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.660" end="00:47:38.230" style="s2">it&#39;s saying like yeah that that makes</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.160" end="00:47:40.510" style="s2">sense or no that doesn&#39;t and you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.230" end="00:47:42.609" style="s2">this also gets kind of echoed if we look</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.510" end="00:47:44.500" style="s2">at the field of persuasion you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.609" end="00:47:46.000" style="s2">what&#39;s the best way to convince of</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.500" end="00:47:47.950" style="s2">somebody of something it&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.000" end="00:47:50.440" style="s2">convince them through a logical argument</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.950" end="00:47:52.510" style="s2">it&#39;s to arise a certain emotional</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.440" end="00:47:54.069" style="s2">reaction from them of agreement there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.510" end="00:47:56.560" style="s2">there&#39;s tricks you can do to the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.069" end="00:47:57.910" style="s2">other end to where you want them to get</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.560" end="00:47:59.109" style="s2">them against something so that then</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.910" end="00:48:01.270" style="s2">they&#39;re willing to fight it or something</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.109" end="00:48:03.490" style="s2">like that you know we might be saying a</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.270" end="00:48:06.550" style="s2">lot about some of our geopolitics right</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.490" end="00:48:09.490" style="s2">now but yeah the emotion the body the</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.550" end="00:48:12.310" style="s2">feelings are kind of the they&#39;re the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.490" end="00:48:14.980" style="s2">vehicle and while they might be driving</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.310" end="00:48:16.960" style="s2">based on what the mind is serving yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.980" end="00:48:19.240" style="s2">and what the mind is you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.960" end="00:48:21.010" style="s2">other big thing here is as you say the</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.240" end="00:48:21.680" style="s2">body&#39;s intuitions is informed by</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.010" end="00:48:23.299" style="s2">previous</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.680" end="00:48:25.549" style="s2">mind content so they are intimately</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.299" end="00:48:27.650" style="s2">connected but yeah I would say when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.549" end="00:48:29.240" style="s2">going on a hard problem and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.650" end="00:48:30.740" style="s2">about it left and right I then realized</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.240" end="00:48:33.410" style="s2">that once it&#39;s actually time to make a</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.740" end="00:48:34.490" style="s2">decision and put it in action I need to</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.410" end="00:48:36.410" style="s2">stop thinking about it and just feel</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.490" end="00:48:37.819" style="s2">into the experience you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.410" end="00:48:40.099" style="s2">this interview would be a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.819" end="00:48:42.980" style="s2">example I&#39;ve thought about a lot of ways</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.099" end="00:48:44.480" style="s2">that this could go but I consciously you</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.980" end="00:48:46.789" style="s2">know as soon as I can went in here set</p>

<p begin="00:48:46.789" end="00:48:51.230" style="s2">where a heads and and leaving myself</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.039" end="00:48:52.220" style="s2">kind of opened up to the winds and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.230" end="00:48:53.569" style="s2">obviously are bringing a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.220" end="00:48:56.329" style="s2">structure to the stew so I can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.569" end="00:48:59.480" style="s2">draft off of your your conceptual winds</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.329" end="00:49:02.690" style="s2">I suppose yeah I&#39;m a windy motherfucker</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.480" end="00:49:04.190" style="s2">no doubt about that you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.690" end="00:49:05.599" style="s2">probably in a fairly similar place we</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.190" end="00:49:08.059" style="s2">may think about it slightly differently</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.599" end="00:49:10.520" style="s2">and that you know I see this internal</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.059" end="00:49:11.960" style="s2">talk mediated by unconscious emotional</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.520" end="00:49:14.380" style="s2">states which are coming from the body</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.960" end="00:49:16.250" style="s2">and possibly also loops from the</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.380" end="00:49:17.770" style="s2">conscious state and the conscious</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.250" end="00:49:19.789" style="s2">contents is just a very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.770" end="00:49:21.349" style="s2">multi-dimensional dance yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.789" end="00:49:23.990" style="s2">and I don&#39;t necessarily say anybody is</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.349" end="00:49:25.640" style="s2">in control as demacia say you can&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.990" end="00:49:26.869" style="s2">any part out of it and have it still</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.640" end="00:49:28.579" style="s2">work if you didn&#39;t have your conscious</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.869" end="00:49:30.109" style="s2">contents it wouldn&#39;t work or at least</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.579" end="00:49:31.220" style="s2">would be no better than a chimp right</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.109" end="00:49:33.740" style="s2">like it wouldn&#39;t even be as good as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.220" end="00:49:35.480" style="s2">gym so you got to have them all let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.740" end="00:49:37.190" style="s2">move on now we&#39;re on let me Dan we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.480" end="00:49:38.809" style="s2">having a good time yeah let me just</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.190" end="00:49:40.460" style="s2">delete it add something there to to puts</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.809" end="00:49:42.829" style="s2">a little bit of meat on this bones of</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.460" end="00:49:44.119" style="s2">you know the rub the reason that it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.829" end="00:49:46.069" style="s2">terrifying to think that we&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.119" end="00:49:48.200" style="s2">control even though we feel like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.069" end="00:49:49.880" style="s2">in control is because you&#39;re like oh my</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.200" end="00:49:55.940" style="s2">god like you know this is this thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.880" end="00:49:58.220" style="s2">that&#39;s completely unacceptable am the</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.940" end="00:49:59.480" style="s2">agent in the situation and when we have</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.220" end="00:50:01.430" style="s2">a lot of evidence to point to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.480" end="00:50:04.099" style="s2">that actually it&#39;s just kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.430" end="00:50:05.809" style="s2">processes unfolding and and the this</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.099" end="00:50:08.000" style="s2">little story that&#39;s coming up with from</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.809" end="00:50:11.210" style="s2">the tiny element of your brain is is</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.000" end="00:50:14.329" style="s2">just confabulating things this actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.210" end="00:50:16.339" style="s2">speaks to the most profound experience</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.329" end="00:50:18.230" style="s2">that I had which I guess you know sam</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.339" end="00:50:20.390" style="s2">would categorize this as a no self</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.230" end="00:50:23.420" style="s2">experiences where after being on a</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.390" end="00:50:24.890" style="s2">retreat I came back the next day and not</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.420" end="00:50:26.270" style="s2">while sitting you know this is another</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.890" end="00:50:28.220" style="s2">thing that some people think is that all</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.270" end="00:50:29.180" style="s2">of your your spiritual unfolding has to</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.220" end="00:50:31.130" style="s2">happen while you&#39;re sitting on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.180" end="00:50:32.940" style="s2">cushion but I was just kind of hanging</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.130" end="00:50:34.650" style="s2">out the next day had been at my</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.940" end="00:50:36.150" style="s2">and mulling over some of the concepts</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.650" end="00:50:39.569" style="s2">that came up without the self on this</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.150" end="00:50:43.410" style="s2">retreat and spontaneously just dropped</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.569" end="00:50:45.240" style="s2">into this space where all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.410" end="00:50:47.490" style="s2">all of those mechanisms that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.240" end="00:50:49.319" style="s2">confabulate er was suddenly exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.490" end="00:50:51.540" style="s2">me you know is like it was like knowing</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.319" end="00:50:53.190" style="s2">I was a puppet to instantly go into</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.540" end="00:50:55.170" style="s2">being able to feel the strings as they</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.190" end="00:50:56.910" style="s2">were being pulled and that was profound</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.170" end="00:50:58.140" style="s2">you know then all of a sudden there is</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.910" end="00:51:00.300" style="s2">no agent there&#39;s just processes</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.140" end="00:51:01.530" style="s2">unfolding and you know that was it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.300" end="00:51:02.880" style="s2">such a profound experience and it</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.530" end="00:51:04.200" style="s2">happened while I was you know just</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.880" end="00:51:06.569" style="s2">walking around that&#39;ll last for a few</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.200" end="00:51:08.550" style="s2">weeks and I was uh you know but that</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.569" end="00:51:10.829" style="s2">that was that was really when you know I</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.550" end="00:51:12.750" style="s2">had been already meditating for three or</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.829" end="00:51:15.150" style="s2">four years but that was when my real</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.750" end="00:51:16.530" style="s2">practice started so yeah just a fun</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.150" end="00:51:18.060" style="s2">little kind of correlation here I was</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.530" end="00:51:21.300" style="s2">saying like the S the confabulate er is</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.060" end="00:51:22.619" style="s2">real and it can be seen yeah that and</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.300" end="00:51:23.819" style="s2">that&#39;s the character by point that whom</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.619" end="00:51:25.770" style="s2">I&#39;m just thinking I&#39;m just gonna think</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.819" end="00:51:28.020" style="s2">some more about this how does one use</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.770" end="00:51:30.839" style="s2">these methods to get inside the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.020" end="00:51:35.430" style="s2">confabulate er deconstruct it and hack</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.839" end="00:51:37.650" style="s2">it to make it do one&#39;s bidding well</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.430" end="00:51:40.920" style="s2">unfortunately the answer is you got to</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.650" end="00:51:42.930" style="s2">get out of the way but now which is now</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.920" end="00:51:45.140" style="s2">the transition to the next big topic</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.930" end="00:51:47.490" style="s2">which you just set up perfectly is</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.140" end="00:51:49.380" style="s2">suffering is something these guys talk</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.490" end="00:51:52.859" style="s2">about a lot but they talk at least as</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.380" end="00:51:54.770" style="s2">much about self right and what is self</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.859" end="00:51:56.849" style="s2">right and they have somewhat different</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.770" end="00:52:00.270" style="s2">perspectives though they all come back</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.849" end="00:52:03.859" style="s2">at some level to some degree a</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.270" end="00:52:08.099" style="s2">qualification to say life is an illusion</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.859" end="00:52:09.210" style="s2">yeah yeah we could approach this at</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.099" end="00:52:10.740" style="s2">different a bunch of different ways I</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.210" end="00:52:13.740" style="s2">mean one of the first things to say I</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.740" end="00:52:15.690" style="s2">think is that again translations</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.740" end="00:52:17.640" style="s2">especially a lot of this languages come</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.690" end="00:52:19.200" style="s2">from a Buddhist context was Eastern and</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.640" end="00:52:22.230" style="s2">Tibetan is a very different language and</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.200" end="00:52:24.240" style="s2">before that Sanskrit and and other</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.230" end="00:52:26.069" style="s2">ancient languages you know kind of where</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.240" end="00:52:27.900" style="s2">the source material for all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.069" end="00:52:29.250" style="s2">and we&#39;re translating it over to English</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.900" end="00:52:31.530" style="s2">and I think there&#39;s a lot lost in that</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.250" end="00:52:32.970" style="s2">process and a lot of people we all spend</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.530" end="00:52:35.339" style="s2">their whole careers trying to you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.970" end="00:52:38.339" style="s2">do some work to iron out some of these</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.339" end="00:52:40.020" style="s2">things and so one way of thinking of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.339" end="00:52:42.030" style="s2">self is like you know that it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.020" end="00:52:45.000" style="s2">personality it&#39;s like who you are the</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.030" end="00:52:46.540" style="s2">unique expression of personality human</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.000" end="00:52:49.090" style="s2">psychology that you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.540" end="00:52:51.880" style="s2">and I think that that still exists that</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.090" end="00:52:55.360" style="s2">that still runs that exists the problem</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.880" end="00:52:56.620" style="s2">though is that our confabulate ER and</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.360" end="00:53:00.130" style="s2">and this is on a moment-to-moment</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.620" end="00:53:03.010" style="s2">experience as we make stories up about</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.130" end="00:53:04.540" style="s2">our psychology you know well I bike this</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.010" end="00:53:06.760" style="s2">and I don&#39;t like this and I have this</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.540" end="00:53:09.010" style="s2">strength and I hate this thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.760" end="00:53:11.140" style="s2">don&#39;t I love this one and this person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.010" end="00:53:12.730" style="s2">an asshole whatever it is we believe</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.140" end="00:53:13.990" style="s2">those stories like they&#39;re true you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.730" end="00:53:15.700" style="s2">that we don&#39;t think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.990" end="00:53:17.620" style="s2">confabulations and so all of a sudden we</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.700" end="00:53:20.770" style="s2">get this we start drying this picture of</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.620" end="00:53:23.020" style="s2">this of this person this is just Jared</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.770" end="00:53:24.460" style="s2">yo here&#39;s all of his preferences and</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.020" end="00:53:27.610" style="s2">here&#39;s all the things but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.460" end="00:53:29.890" style="s2">happening as we start to see the process</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.610" end="00:53:31.690" style="s2">at that confabulation as its arising and</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.890" end="00:53:34.330" style="s2">we become aware of it and like notice</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.690" end="00:53:35.860" style="s2">the source code of it we start to see</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.330" end="00:53:38.290" style="s2">that it&#39;s oh it&#39;s you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.860" end="00:53:41.410" style="s2">confabulation it&#39;s a próximas ation and</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.290" end="00:53:43.660" style="s2">if we really understand it we realized</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.410" end="00:53:45.370" style="s2">that that psychology is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.660" end="00:53:48.100" style="s2">changing and if it&#39;s constantly changing</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.370" end="00:53:50.710" style="s2">then it&#39;s not a thing that we can can</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.100" end="00:53:53.950" style="s2">orient toward and the other element here</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.710" end="00:53:56.500" style="s2">is that not only do we believe this idea</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.950" end="00:53:58.090" style="s2">of some sort of static self or ideal</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.500" end="00:54:00.640" style="s2">self and probably a lot of this comes</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.090" end="00:54:02.620" style="s2">from our kind of judeo-christian Western</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.640" end="00:54:04.840" style="s2">perspective and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.620" end="00:54:07.150" style="s2">physiological correlation in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.840" end="00:54:10.030" style="s2">that there&#39;s this sensation or feeling</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.150" end="00:54:12.640" style="s2">that we have locality in our experience</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.030" end="00:54:13.720" style="s2">like I&#39;m behind my eyes you know in some</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.640" end="00:54:15.550" style="s2">cultures it&#39;s different that&#39;s behind</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.720" end="00:54:17.590" style="s2">there it&#39;s their heart they see it as</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.550" end="00:54:19.240" style="s2">the center of the self but for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.590" end="00:54:21.280" style="s2">reason the confabulate ER says okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.240" end="00:54:23.200" style="s2">here&#39;s the solid story you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.280" end="00:54:25.330" style="s2">who we are where are we located in this</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.200" end="00:54:28.060" style="s2">situation it puts us in a place and so</p>

<p begin="00:54:28.060" end="00:54:31.270" style="s2">at the stories deconstruct them and</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.950" end="00:54:32.800" style="s2">understand that there&#39;s gaps and they</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.270" end="00:54:34.750" style="s2">conflict with each other and none of</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:37.950" style="s2">them are permanent and when you do that</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.750" end="00:54:42.390" style="s2">then there&#39;s no kind of lasting you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.950" end="00:54:45.160" style="s2">aspect of arcs of who we are and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.390" end="00:54:47.890" style="s2">often when we have these insights it can</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.160" end="00:54:49.900" style="s2">release that feeling of having a certain</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.890" end="00:54:51.940" style="s2">location in our experience and all of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.900" end="00:54:53.250" style="s2">sudden we realize that everything that</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.940" end="00:54:55.960" style="s2">we&#39;re experiencing right now is</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.250" end="00:54:59.099" style="s2">confabulated so it&#39;s in some sense not</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.960" end="00:55:01.529" style="s2">true right not ultimately true</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.099" end="00:55:02.699" style="s2">but but if it&#39;s not true in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.529" end="00:55:03.839" style="s2">that you&#39;re separate you know really</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.699" end="00:55:05.459" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about here is</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.839" end="00:55:07.859" style="s2">the truth of being separate from the</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.459" end="00:55:09.779" style="s2">world if it&#39;s not ultimately true then</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.859" end="00:55:11.279" style="s2">we all said and are connected with the</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.779" end="00:55:13.680" style="s2">larger world and your experience goes</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.279" end="00:55:15.569" style="s2">from being in one place to you know the</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.680" end="00:55:17.849" style="s2">behind your eyes to then just being</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.569" end="00:55:20.219" style="s2">whatever is happening now you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.849" end="00:55:22.229" style="s2">matrix like it&#39;s all equally fabricated</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.219" end="00:55:24.930" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing and the stories we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.229" end="00:55:26.309" style="s2">saying and then the realness is actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.930" end="00:55:28.380" style="s2">fat like if there is a candidate for</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.309" end="00:55:32.009" style="s2">what&#39;s real in your experience what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.380" end="00:55:34.019" style="s2">lasting it&#39;s some of this stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.009" end="00:55:36.920" style="s2">really is described well as saying</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.019" end="00:55:38.759" style="s2">spirit it&#39;s this intangible raw</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.920" end="00:55:40.140" style="s2">knowingness that doesn&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.759" end="00:55:41.910" style="s2">appearance it doesn&#39;t have a taste it</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.140" end="00:55:44.069" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a smell it&#39;s just this</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.910" end="00:55:46.890" style="s2">weird knowingness but it&#39;s so subtle</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.069" end="00:55:50.999" style="s2">that if we get fascinated with the</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.890" end="00:55:52.109" style="s2">stories we can&#39;t we lose track of it but</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.999" end="00:55:53.489" style="s2">it&#39;s also not something that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.109" end="00:55:54.900" style="s2">foreign because as soon as you see it</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.489" end="00:55:57.989" style="s2">it&#39;s always like a it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.900" end="00:56:00.119" style="s2">rediscovery you&#39;re like oh that you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.989" end="00:56:02.009" style="s2">that&#39;s what I call waking up oh you wake</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.119" end="00:56:04.229" style="s2">up you&#39;re like oh this was a dream this</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.009" end="00:56:05.849" style="s2">is a dream here&#39;s the real you know the</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.229" end="00:56:07.259" style="s2">only thing that&#39;s not changing my</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.849" end="00:56:09.839" style="s2">experience is just that there is an</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.259" end="00:56:12.809" style="s2">experience and there&#39;s that quality too</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.839" end="00:56:15.390" style="s2">you know everything all my sensory input</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.809" end="00:56:16.680" style="s2">that is that is common that&#39;s why a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.390" end="00:56:18.539" style="s2">of traditions will call this like the</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.680" end="00:56:20.489" style="s2">true self Buddhism doesn&#39;t make this</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.539" end="00:56:22.589" style="s2">claim where they usually say no self</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.489" end="00:56:24.660" style="s2">which kind of leaves things a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.589" end="00:56:27.959" style="s2">more nebulous and I think there&#39;s pros</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.660" end="00:56:29.880" style="s2">and cons in that that approach but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.959" end="00:56:31.170" style="s2">I thought that&#39;s I don&#39;t know if that</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.880" end="00:56:32.459" style="s2">sort of but that&#39;s coming to mind at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.170" end="00:56:34.920" style="s2">moments when we talked about this idea</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.459" end="00:56:36.869" style="s2">of what a self is well yeah that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.920" end="00:56:40.940" style="s2">I like it very evocative you know here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.869" end="00:56:43.589" style="s2">my take on it which is that the self is</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.940" end="00:56:45.269" style="s2">basically it&#39;s you know this is this</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.589" end="00:56:46.949" style="s2">it&#39;s an analogy and analogies are never</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.269" end="00:56:49.859" style="s2">perfect but it&#39;s essentially a program</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.949" end="00:56:52.559" style="s2">that runs on the brain and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.859" end="00:56:54.420" style="s2">it&#39;s not running right when we know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.559" end="00:56:57.269" style="s2">not running when we&#39;re in a coma or in</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.420" end="00:56:59.489" style="s2">deep Delta wave sleep and I think more</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.269" end="00:57:01.829" style="s2">interestingly we know it&#39;s not running</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.489" end="00:57:04.890" style="s2">when you take a mega dose of LSD you</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.829" end="00:57:06.900" style="s2">know one time did 400 micrograms Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.890" end="00:57:09.329" style="s2">Christ right true ego death right there</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.900" end="00:57:11.869" style="s2">was no there there right it was some</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.329" end="00:57:13.759" style="s2">entirely different kind of state and</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.869" end="00:57:15.349" style="s2">as I mentioned early on I can knock the</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.759" end="00:57:17.599" style="s2">self offline for about two to three</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.349" end="00:57:18.109" style="s2">seconds it&#39;s just a certain little brain</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.599" end="00:57:19.910" style="s2">move</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.109" end="00:57:21.769" style="s2">so I basically caused the program to</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.910" end="00:57:24.440" style="s2">suspend and swap out to disk and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.769" end="00:57:26.180" style="s2">come back two seconds later so you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.440" end="00:57:28.099" style="s2">it seems to me that it&#39;s a it&#39;s not real</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.180" end="00:57:30.079" style="s2">it&#39;s not quite what I want to say at</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.099" end="00:57:32.059" style="s2">least what I want to say is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.079" end="00:57:34.430" style="s2">not the only thing that can run on your</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.059" end="00:57:36.140" style="s2">brain it&#39;s just a program that runs and</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.430" end="00:57:37.789" style="s2">I shouldn&#39;t say just because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.140" end="00:57:40.579" style="s2">most important program that runs on our</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.789" end="00:57:42.859" style="s2">brain because it&#39;s the program that</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.579" end="00:57:45.079" style="s2">allows us to survive in the world</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.859" end="00:57:47.720" style="s2">you know it&#39;s the piece of machinery</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.079" end="00:57:49.880" style="s2">that actually makes decisions you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.720" end="00:57:52.519" style="s2">you can&#39;t make decisions or take more</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.880" end="00:57:54.319" style="s2">actually decisions are not the most</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.519" end="00:57:55.940" style="s2">important thing actually it&#39;s actions</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.319" end="00:57:56.990" style="s2">right you can make all the decisions you</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.940" end="00:57:59.509" style="s2">want they don&#39;t take any actions you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.990" end="00:58:01.849" style="s2">still gonna starve to death and so when</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.509" end="00:58:04.819" style="s2">I think about what is it that conscious</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.849" end="00:58:07.940" style="s2">cognition is actually at for it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.819" end="00:58:11.359" style="s2">essentially connect perception to memory</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.940" end="00:58:14.059" style="s2">to processing and then optionally from</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.359" end="00:58:16.730" style="s2">time to time trigger and affordance on</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.059" end="00:58:17.930" style="s2">one of the conscious contents and you</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.730" end="00:58:20.329" style="s2">know that could be as simple as walk</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.930" end="00:58:22.539" style="s2">away or approach move to the left to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.329" end="00:58:25.730" style="s2">right pick it up and use it as a hammer</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.539" end="00:58:28.999" style="s2">etc and to do all those things requires</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.730" end="00:58:31.640" style="s2">that the self program be running yeah to</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.999" end="00:58:33.170" style="s2">it to a large degree yeah and to my</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.640" end="00:58:34.999" style="s2">point it&#39;s not like you stopped being a</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.170" end="00:58:37.249" style="s2">human if you were in these altered</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.999" end="00:58:40.430" style="s2">states and in some ways that you almost</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.249" end="00:58:41.989" style="s2">feel more human you know like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.430" end="00:58:43.519" style="s2">this weird paradox of like to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.989" end="00:58:45.230" style="s2">people who have had height in the States</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.519" end="00:58:47.869" style="s2">whether it&#39;s you know psychedelic people</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.230" end="00:58:49.849" style="s2">or extreme athletes or something like</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.869" end="00:58:51.200" style="s2">that and in one breath they&#39;ll say well</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.849" end="00:58:53.150" style="s2">that&#39;s when I feel the most like myself</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.200" end="00:58:54.499" style="s2">and then in enough breath they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.150" end="00:58:55.670" style="s2">well there&#39;s no self there you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.499" end="00:58:57.710" style="s2">just everything is just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.670" end="00:58:59.150" style="s2">happening I&#39;m not nobody&#39;s in charge so</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.710" end="00:59:03.019" style="s2">it is this this kind of strange paradox</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.150" end="00:59:06.170" style="s2">I think yeah that&#39;s kind of the flow</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.019" end="00:59:09.859" style="s2">self right or flown a question is is</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.170" end="00:59:11.180" style="s2">flow a you know to my mind I&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.859" end="00:59:12.559" style="s2">some crazy flow states on a few</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.180" end="00:59:14.180" style="s2">occasions I can tell you some stories</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.559" end="00:59:17.180" style="s2">the shit I did and I was in these states</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.180" end="00:59:19.609" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing but I&#39;d always felt like it</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.180" end="00:59:21.799" style="s2">was me it was definitely not the same as</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.609" end="00:59:25.640" style="s2">four hundred micrograms of LSD egodeath</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.799" end="00:59:28.250" style="s2">right it was a you know a best form of</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.640" end="00:59:31.760" style="s2">self basically we might take on it at</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.250" end="00:59:33.200" style="s2">least yeah yeah it&#39;s a strange one you</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.760" end="00:59:35.569" style="s2">know and at the same point if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.200" end="00:59:37.849" style="s2">were to slap a MRI scanner on you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.569" end="00:59:40.970" style="s2">fairly confident to say that the aspects</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.849" end="00:59:44.619" style="s2">of your mind that are largely correlated</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.970" end="00:59:48.260" style="s2">with self confabulation would be very</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.619" end="00:59:50.630" style="s2">deregulated in those spaces so you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.260" end="00:59:53.059" style="s2">it but but really it&#39;s it&#39;s you know I</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.630" end="00:59:55.579" style="s2">like to think of the the these things</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.059" end="00:59:59.089" style="s2">all of these kind of conceptual overlays</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.579" end="01:00:01.430" style="s2">as being really valuable maps there are</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.089" end="01:00:03.470" style="s2">approximations of how to navigate our</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.430" end="01:00:04.940" style="s2">territory and they&#39;re super valuable cuz</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.470" end="01:00:07.160" style="s2">they simplify things because the world</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.940" end="01:00:09.440" style="s2">is friggin complex man it&#39;s correcting</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.160" end="01:00:11.539" style="s2">outright it&#39;s it&#39;s for a human it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.440" end="01:00:14.960" style="s2">infinite there has to be some heuristics</p>

<p begin="01:00:14.960" end="01:00:19.329" style="s2">actually could make decisions and not be</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.730" end="01:00:22.339" style="s2">completely overwhelmed and just you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.329" end="01:00:25.369" style="s2">gawk I&#39;d look at the Stars all day long</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.339" end="01:00:27.260" style="s2">every day yeah absolutely I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.369" end="01:00:28.789" style="s2">again my own model of conscious</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.260" end="01:00:30.829" style="s2">cognition that&#39;s what consciousness is</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.789" end="01:00:33.619" style="s2">for it actually turns out just to be a</p>

<p begin="01:00:36.019" end="01:00:41.299" style="s2">and forces the decision every 250</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.329" end="01:00:42.920" style="s2">milliseconds basically and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.299" end="01:00:45.289" style="s2">always right by any means right and</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.920" end="01:00:46.279" style="s2">those of us who have lived a life know</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.289" end="01:00:48.500" style="s2">we make mistakes</p>

<p begin="01:00:50.869" end="01:00:54.559" style="s2">it&#39;s only what to pay attention to next</p>

<p begin="01:00:55.250" end="01:00:58.940" style="s2">yeah yeah I mean you have to continue</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.289" end="01:01:01.549" style="s2">this map metaphor it&#39;d be like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.940" end="01:01:04.579" style="s2">difference between you know going on a</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.549" end="01:01:07.670" style="s2">hike and you know basically stopping</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.579" end="01:01:09.440" style="s2">where you are pulling the map up to your</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.670" end="01:01:11.869" style="s2">head to try and figure out where you</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.440" end="01:01:13.339" style="s2">need to be going and holding it so close</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.869" end="01:01:15.769" style="s2">that you can no longer see what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.339" end="01:01:17.450" style="s2">on and then try to walk right like so so</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.769" end="01:01:19.970" style="s2">the trick here is to like figure out how</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.450" end="01:01:21.529" style="s2">to to hold it it a bit of a distance and</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.970" end="01:01:23.390" style="s2">compare and contrast because the real</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.529" end="01:01:24.950" style="s2">world is far more complex than this 2d</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.390" end="01:01:27.200" style="s2">map representation that we&#39;ve come up</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.950" end="01:01:28.759" style="s2">with and we&#39;re going to have to use all</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.200" end="01:01:31.009" style="s2">of our other senses not just our sight</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.759" end="01:01:32.900" style="s2">and conceptual mind but our feelings and</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.009" end="01:01:34.099" style="s2">you know if we hit a run into a rock we</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.900" end="01:01:35.809" style="s2">should that should be a cue that whoa</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.099" end="01:01:38.119" style="s2">well the rocks not on the map but it</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.809" end="01:01:39.540" style="s2">sure is in real life so you have to you</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.119" end="01:01:41.730" style="s2">have to hold both of these things</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.540" end="01:01:44.820" style="s2">in cognition for there to be a good</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.730" end="01:01:48.270" style="s2">interaction and you know a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.820" end="01:01:50.460" style="s2">ideas of self that we have they continue</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.270" end="01:01:53.070" style="s2">to run you know the colloquial phrases</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.460" end="01:01:54.480" style="s2">that continue to run the maps are still</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.070" end="01:01:56.310" style="s2">available it&#39;s just you just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.480" end="01:01:57.540" style="s2">believe them because we get so entranced</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.310" end="01:01:59.160" style="s2">with them that we forget that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.540" end="01:02:01.140" style="s2">actually out of hike we&#39;re just staring</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.160" end="01:02:04.530" style="s2">at the map all day long and that that</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.140" end="01:02:05.370" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get get us very far that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.530" end="01:02:08.280" style="s2">like that it&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.370" end="01:02:11.280" style="s2">metaphor and it gets us to my next topic</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.280" end="01:02:13.620" style="s2">which is very closely aligned which is</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.280" end="01:02:15.840" style="s2">attention mmm you know in my own work</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.620" end="01:02:18.060" style="s2">I&#39;d like to say that attention is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.840" end="01:02:20.940" style="s2">cursor of consciousness that our</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.060" end="01:02:22.980" style="s2">consciousness is actually made from the</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.940" end="01:02:26.160" style="s2">changes in states of attention that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.980" end="01:02:28.680" style="s2">the clock of our consciousness and can</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.160" end="01:02:31.200" style="s2">happen probably no more frequently than</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.680" end="01:02:33.570" style="s2">40 milliseconds something like that more</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.200" end="01:02:35.580" style="s2">often happens at about 250 milliseconds</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.570" end="01:02:37.980" style="s2">and when I think about some of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.580" end="01:02:42.690" style="s2">writings I&#39;ve read particularly Sinjin</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.980" end="01:02:45.150" style="s2">Jung&#39;s talk about concentration as being</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.690" end="01:02:46.770" style="s2">what he describes it it&#39;s central to</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.150" end="01:02:49.080" style="s2">meditation he says anything that does</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.770" end="01:02:51.480" style="s2">not improve your concentration is not</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.080" end="01:02:53.580" style="s2">meditation when I think of concentration</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.480" end="01:02:55.800" style="s2">I think of some ability to manage</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.580" end="01:02:58.320" style="s2">attention mm-hmm your thoughts on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.800" end="01:02:59.940" style="s2">relationship between Jung&#39;s idea of</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.320" end="01:03:03.140" style="s2">concentration and maybe the more</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.940" end="01:03:05.550" style="s2">cognitive science idea of attention hmm</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.140" end="01:03:07.230" style="s2">this is fun because you know I spent a</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.550" end="01:03:09.390" style="s2">lot of time with Shinzon the system</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.230" end="01:03:11.310" style="s2">called unified mindfulness and went</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.390" end="01:03:13.950" style="s2">through their teacher program and did a</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.310" end="01:03:15.900" style="s2">bunch of online classes and and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.950" end="01:03:17.700" style="s2">very familiar with it and I loved a lot</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.900" end="01:03:19.620" style="s2">of his the maps that he comes up with</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.700" end="01:03:23.100" style="s2">the describe what we&#39;re doing here with</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.620" end="01:03:25.200" style="s2">our minds and I actually when I stopped</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.100" end="01:03:27.780" style="s2">doing the the unified mindfulness thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.200" end="01:03:30.450" style="s2">it was because I discovered another</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.780" end="01:03:32.820" style="s2">system by a guy named Joe dasa who has a</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.450" end="01:03:34.620" style="s2">map called the mind Allah where it came</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.820" end="01:03:35.910" style="s2">from a book called the mind illuminated</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.620" end="01:03:39.180" style="s2">which is actually like a very</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.910" end="01:03:40.920" style="s2">traditional old-school Buddhism approach</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.180" end="01:03:42.990" style="s2">to the practice but one of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.920" end="01:03:45.000" style="s2">heuristics is for how he thinks of</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.990" end="01:03:47.730" style="s2">attention is he likes to break it up</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.000" end="01:03:49.760" style="s2">into two different qualities so he</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.730" end="01:03:51.700" style="s2">basically says that like optimal</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.760" end="01:03:54.460" style="s2">movement through our environment</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.700" end="01:03:57.250" style="s2">is the optimal interaction between</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.460" end="01:03:58.420" style="s2">attention and awareness and I think he</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.250" end="01:04:00.400" style="s2">also because he has a bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.420" end="01:04:02.349" style="s2">psychological and neuroscience</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.400" end="01:04:04.630" style="s2">background I know that he&#39;s made some</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.349" end="01:04:06.820" style="s2">correlations to brain locations that</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.630" end="01:04:08.740" style="s2">correlate with the awareness and</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.820" end="01:04:10.660" style="s2">attention I couldn&#39;t speak to it with</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.740" end="01:04:12.190" style="s2">any authority at this moment but I can</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.660" end="01:04:13.390" style="s2">tell you what it feels like and you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.190" end="01:04:14.950" style="s2">while these distinctions might be</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.390" end="01:04:16.420" style="s2">arbitrary and we could just say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.950" end="01:04:17.940" style="s2">kind of like a on one end of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.420" end="01:04:21.780" style="s2">spectrum we have attention which is</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.940" end="01:04:23.980" style="s2">extremely hyper focused high detail</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.780" end="01:04:25.869" style="s2">another characteristic of our attention</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.980" end="01:04:27.849" style="s2">that is if there&#39;s an intention to it it</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.869" end="01:04:29.619" style="s2">feels like we&#39;re putting our it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.849" end="01:04:31.480" style="s2">for a reason we put it there there was</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.619" end="01:04:33.190" style="s2">an agent behind it and then we on the</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.480" end="01:04:37.390" style="s2">other end of the spectrum we have this</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.190" end="01:04:39.310" style="s2">really broad low-density peripheral</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.390" end="01:04:42.550" style="s2">element of our experience which would be</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.310" end="01:04:44.140" style="s2">more aligned with awareness and that</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.550" end="01:04:45.550" style="s2">one&#39;s weird because it&#39;s you know it</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.140" end="01:04:47.820" style="s2">doesn&#39;t feel like there&#39;s much of it in</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.550" end="01:04:50.440" style="s2">intention in bringing that quality of</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.820" end="01:04:52.599" style="s2">experience but this is also extremely</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.440" end="01:04:54.910" style="s2">important because it puts whatever is an</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.599" end="01:04:56.740" style="s2">intention in a certain context so like</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.910" end="01:04:59.680" style="s2">one of the classic examples that I love</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.740" end="01:05:02.710" style="s2">is just to think of looking at you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.680" end="01:05:04.569" style="s2">a stack of the other Zen rocks on on a</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.710" end="01:05:06.849" style="s2">beach and they&#39;re you know that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.569" end="01:05:07.930" style="s2">beautiful provocative and if you were to</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.849" end="01:05:10.060" style="s2">see it right in front of you you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.930" end="01:05:12.130" style="s2">staring at it and and you know it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.060" end="01:05:13.960" style="s2">perfect clarity and without thinking</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.130" end="01:05:16.000" style="s2">about it you know immediately I&#39;m on a</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.960" end="01:05:17.890" style="s2">beach if my attention is really stable</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.000" end="01:05:19.000" style="s2">you know the periphery starts to expand</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.890" end="01:05:20.349" style="s2">a little bit and get a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.000" end="01:05:23.380" style="s2">detail a little bit more white a little</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.349" end="01:05:25.119" style="s2">bit wider that can tell me about things</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.380" end="01:05:27.099" style="s2">that are competing for my attention you</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.119" end="01:05:29.680" style="s2">know somebody is jogging next to me and</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.099" end="01:05:31.630" style="s2">I catch it in my periphery and you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.680" end="01:05:33.190" style="s2">it&#39;s very very subtle but just enough</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.630" end="01:05:35.050" style="s2">information to decide whether I want to</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.190" end="01:05:36.910" style="s2">go bring my attention over there or not</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.050" end="01:05:39.190" style="s2">if we&#39;re in either state in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.910" end="01:05:41.609" style="s2">where there&#39;s only awareness where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.190" end="01:05:43.359" style="s2">just this completely open broad thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.609" end="01:05:45.910" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna do anything in that</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.359" end="01:05:48.550" style="s2">situation or if you&#39;re in complete hyper</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.910" end="01:05:51.220" style="s2">tunnel focus then you can be completely</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.550" end="01:05:53.380" style="s2">unaware of what&#39;s happening around the</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.220" end="01:05:54.849" style="s2">edges you know a classic example that</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.380" end="01:05:56.650" style="s2">everybody has is getting caught up by</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.849" end="01:05:58.030" style="s2">anger yeah on the highway and somebody</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.650" end="01:05:59.619" style="s2">cuts us off and we flip them off feel</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.030" end="01:06:02.349" style="s2">like we&#39;re the anger is all of our</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.619" end="01:06:03.940" style="s2">experience and we aren&#39;t seeing the the</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.349" end="01:06:04.549" style="s2">periphery the larger you know like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.940" end="01:06:06.380" style="s2">on a highway</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.549" end="01:06:08.150" style="s2">this is dangerous you know all these</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.380" end="01:06:09.380" style="s2">other things to consider you know and</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.150" end="01:06:12.019" style="s2">you can strengthen both of these</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.380" end="01:06:13.699" style="s2">elements and then a lot of meditation is</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.019" end="01:06:15.349" style="s2">figuring out how to get them to work</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.699" end="01:06:17.479" style="s2">together and you know you can&#39;t sustain</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.349" end="01:06:19.999" style="s2">attention without being aware of what is</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.479" end="01:06:21.380" style="s2">gonna be possibly distracting you so</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.999" end="01:06:23.449" style="s2">that you can deliberately make the</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.380" end="01:06:26.539" style="s2">choice to stay keep attention with with</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.449" end="01:06:28.579" style="s2">what you&#39;ve chosen and the the other</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.539" end="01:06:30.529" style="s2">element here is the intention there has</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.579" end="01:06:32.049" style="s2">to be an intention to maintain focus and</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.529" end="01:06:35.449" style="s2">there has to be an intention to maintain</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.049" end="01:06:38.209" style="s2">peripheral awareness so yeah that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.449" end="01:06:41.059" style="s2">my favorite like neuroscience</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.209" end="01:06:43.519" style="s2">psychological pop psychological the</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.059" end="01:06:46.119" style="s2">description of moment to moment</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.519" end="01:06:48.890" style="s2">experience especially in a contemplative</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.119" end="01:06:51.229" style="s2">perspective or frame I like it so you</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.890" end="01:06:53.119" style="s2">would essentially describe a tension or</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.229" end="01:06:56.049" style="s2">actually you could adjust presidental</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.119" end="01:06:59.689" style="s2">these parameters between awareness and</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.049" end="01:07:01.549" style="s2">focus yeah so you know very simply right</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.689" end="01:07:03.319" style="s2">you could if you hold your hand up in</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.549" end="01:07:06.709" style="s2">front of your face right now you can</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.319" end="01:07:09.170" style="s2">really dial in on that every tiny little</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.709" end="01:07:11.569" style="s2">detail and and you look the crack and</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.170" end="01:07:13.489" style="s2">the more the more you get engrossed with</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.569" end="01:07:15.140" style="s2">that the more your periphery starts to</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.489" end="01:07:16.910" style="s2">dampen down so the awareness becomes a</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.140" end="01:07:17.839" style="s2">little less but you can loosen it a</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.910" end="01:07:19.429" style="s2">little bit and just be like oh I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.839" end="01:07:21.410" style="s2">going to look at the whole hand keep it</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.429" end="01:07:23.449" style="s2">in an attention but all the sudden I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.410" end="01:07:25.189" style="s2">very you know the periphery has become</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.449" end="01:07:26.660" style="s2">very a lot more broad I kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.189" end="01:07:29.900" style="s2">understand the context of where the hand</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.660" end="01:07:31.849" style="s2">is what it&#39;s doing so yeah it&#39;s a you</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.900" end="01:07:32.989" style="s2">know we can play with both of these and</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.849" end="01:07:35.140" style="s2">you can build both of those in different</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.989" end="01:07:38.689" style="s2">ways using different practices as well</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.140" end="01:07:40.009" style="s2">of course in normal life what&#39;s a person</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.689" end="01:07:43.009" style="s2">who&#39;s not doing these kinds of things</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.009" end="01:07:44.869" style="s2">the brain is basically driving itself</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.009" end="01:07:47.420" style="s2">through a whole series of attention</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.869" end="01:07:49.160" style="s2">changes I mean I use attention in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.420" end="01:07:51.859" style="s2">cognitive science sense typically a</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.160" end="01:07:54.529" style="s2">large amount of focus on one single</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.859" end="01:07:57.170" style="s2">object within the conscious frame it</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.529" end="01:07:59.329" style="s2">could be a visual object to sound object</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.170" end="01:08:02.509" style="s2">there could be an internal speech word</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.329" end="01:08:05.239" style="s2">it&#39;d be a reading word and it basically</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.509" end="01:08:07.130" style="s2">hops about on average no faster than</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.239" end="01:08:09.679" style="s2">once every quarter of a second sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.130" end="01:08:11.869" style="s2">a bit faster and we can concentrate our</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.679" end="01:08:13.880" style="s2">attention on a single object but this is</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.869" end="01:08:14.539" style="s2">the interesting thing the brain does not</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.880" end="01:08:17.299" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.539" end="01:08:17.779" style="s2">the longer you concentrate on one object</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.299" end="01:08:19.489" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.779" end="01:08:21.349" style="s2">or it wants you to switch to something</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.489" end="01:08:22.369" style="s2">else you know and after about five</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.349" end="01:08:24.529" style="s2">seconds</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.369" end="01:08:26.809" style="s2">it really gets pretty hard to keep</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.529" end="01:08:28.730" style="s2">focused on one object because of</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.809" end="01:08:30.559" style="s2">essentially the brain does not want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.730" end="01:08:31.880" style="s2">do that because it has learned it has</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.559" end="01:08:34.279" style="s2">learned quote-unquote</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.880" end="01:08:36.730" style="s2">too anthropomorphic there through</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.279" end="01:08:39.589" style="s2">evolution it has been tuned such that</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.730" end="01:08:42.589" style="s2">changing attention you know no more than</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.589" end="01:08:45.710" style="s2">once every five seconds is probably good</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.589" end="01:08:46.940" style="s2">in terms of being adaptive ie being able</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.710" end="01:08:49.009" style="s2">to survive to the point you have</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.940" end="01:08:50.770" style="s2">children yeah yeah well and and I think</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.009" end="01:08:52.940" style="s2">that this brings up a really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.770" end="01:08:55.279" style="s2">evolutionary argument in the perspective</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.940" end="01:08:58.219" style="s2">of if we&#39;re looking at you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.279" end="01:09:01.339" style="s2">200,000 years of tribal life that led up</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.219" end="01:09:03.589" style="s2">to modern society you can quickly see</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.339" end="01:09:05.150" style="s2">that life would be a lot slower and</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.589" end="01:09:06.799" style="s2">there would be a lot of deliberate tasks</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.150" end="01:09:09.409" style="s2">and not a lot of other things demanding</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.799" end="01:09:11.150" style="s2">our attention so if I were to make a</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.409" end="01:09:13.759" style="s2">hypothesis here I&#39;d say that the amount</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.150" end="01:09:14.900" style="s2">of attention shifting in a tribal</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.759" end="01:09:16.759" style="s2">circumstance where you&#39;re in nature</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.900" end="01:09:18.170" style="s2">everything&#39;s kind of moving at a similar</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.759" end="01:09:19.670" style="s2">pace there&#39;s not these clear</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.170" end="01:09:20.929" style="s2">distinctions you&#39;re completely in</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.670" end="01:09:22.309" style="s2">whatever you need to be doing you need</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.929" end="01:09:24.710" style="s2">needs your full attention because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.309" end="01:09:27.109" style="s2">uh you know got to be keeping in your</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.710" end="01:09:28.489" style="s2">safety in mind and safety of your family</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.109" end="01:09:29.779" style="s2">and all these stuff like you know that</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.489" end="01:09:32.869" style="s2">environment I think is far more</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.779" end="01:09:34.909" style="s2">conducive to a more natural amount of</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.869" end="01:09:38.020" style="s2">attention and awareness and attentional</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.909" end="01:09:41.179" style="s2">shifting now we fast forward to today</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.020" end="01:09:43.099" style="s2">and we just start bombarded you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.179" end="01:09:45.650" style="s2">everything&#39;s vying for our attention you</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.099" end="01:09:47.750" style="s2">know with our social networks our our</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.650" end="01:09:50.150" style="s2">work environment that&#39;s loud and crazy</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.750" end="01:09:51.859" style="s2">and the the TV shows they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.150" end="01:09:52.940" style="s2">faster because people can&#39;t pay even pay</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.859" end="01:09:55.070" style="s2">attention so it&#39;s kind of a self</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.940" end="01:09:56.750" style="s2">amplifying mechanism here right now and</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.070" end="01:09:58.789" style="s2">this is why I think it&#39;s that that</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.750" end="01:10:00.679" style="s2">practice that leads to attention</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.789" end="01:10:02.389" style="s2">stability is becoming more and more</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.679" end="01:10:04.610" style="s2">important and you can like I said you</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.389" end="01:10:06.260" style="s2">can maintain attention deliberately and</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.610" end="01:10:08.179" style="s2">use attention awareness in any</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.260" end="01:10:10.219" style="s2">circumstance you want it just so happens</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.179" end="01:10:12.199" style="s2">that sitting on a cushion is maybe like</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.219" end="01:10:13.610" style="s2">the power lifting variant you know where</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.199" end="01:10:16.190" style="s2">it&#39;s just like that&#39;s all you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.610" end="01:10:18.530" style="s2">it&#39;s all you know it&#39;s very isolated so</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.190" end="01:10:20.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a good bang for your buck but every</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.530" end="01:10:21.739" style="s2">moment we&#39;re kind of falling into</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.360" end="01:10:23.630" style="s2">habitual patterns of how we use our</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.739" end="01:10:26.550" style="s2">attention and awareness and to your</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.630" end="01:10:27.690" style="s2">point we become so used to shifting</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.550" end="01:10:29.070" style="s2">our attention and it becomes very</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.690" end="01:10:31.800" style="s2">unnatural and uncomfortable especially</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.070" end="01:10:34.680" style="s2">in the beginning to maintain it in one</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.800" end="01:10:36.930" style="s2">place but here&#39;s the rub too if you</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.680" end="01:10:40.200" style="s2">spend some time doing concentrative</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.930" end="01:10:42.120" style="s2">practices and these are probably the</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.200" end="01:10:44.370" style="s2">ones that take the most time and</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.120" end="01:10:46.830" style="s2">commitment you know probably if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.370" end="01:10:48.420" style="s2">not doing an hour or two a day you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.830" end="01:10:50.180" style="s2">not gonna get very far and it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.420" end="01:10:52.050" style="s2">every day because you&#39;ll lose progress</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.180" end="01:10:53.550" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna get very far in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.050" end="01:10:54.960" style="s2">concentration round because life&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.550" end="01:10:56.640" style="s2">not very conducive to it but the</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.960" end="01:10:58.920" style="s2">interesting thing is that once the mind</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.640" end="01:11:00.600" style="s2">starts to get settled and comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.920" end="01:11:03.300" style="s2">with being completely focused on one</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.600" end="01:11:05.460" style="s2">area it actually is very pleasureful and</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.300" end="01:11:06.810" style="s2">depending on how distracted we are some</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.460" end="01:11:09.030" style="s2">people have well there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.810" end="01:11:11.730" style="s2">types of reactions to concept the</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.030" end="01:11:14.040" style="s2">concentrated mind that happened to arise</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.730" end="01:11:15.890" style="s2">but they go actually in a predictable</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.040" end="01:11:18.330" style="s2">order - and it starts with like a very</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.890" end="01:11:19.920" style="s2">ecstatic joy so all of a sudden your</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.330" end="01:11:21.690" style="s2">mind has decided it&#39;s staying where it</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.920" end="01:11:24.780" style="s2">is and it&#39;s not going anywhere that will</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.690" end="01:11:27.450" style="s2">it can release these extreme bouts of</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.780" end="01:11:30.180" style="s2">joy your skin feels like it&#39;s bursting</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.450" end="01:11:32.280" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s hot it&#39;s vibrating or</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.180" end="01:11:33.780" style="s2">something like that and then after if</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.280" end="01:11:35.490" style="s2">that can stabilize if you stay</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.780" end="01:11:37.290" style="s2">concentrated you can move into a little</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.490" end="01:11:39.390" style="s2">bit more of a tranquil Pleasant</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.290" end="01:11:40.740" style="s2">sensation if you stay with that a little</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.390" end="01:11:42.870" style="s2">bit things start to get a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.740" end="01:11:45.180" style="s2">more a little more subtle it&#39;s just kind</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.870" end="01:11:47.460" style="s2">of equanimity and eventually you can get</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.180" end="01:11:48.990" style="s2">to the place you know where you you kind</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.460" end="01:11:51.450" style="s2">of bottomed out and this is just radical</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.990" end="01:11:54.000" style="s2">equanimity where everything is 100%</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.450" end="01:11:56.880" style="s2">perfect and there&#39;s only a tiny thing in</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.000" end="01:11:59.400" style="s2">your it&#39;s the sensation of of your</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.880" end="01:12:00.510" style="s2">breath or a location in your experience</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.400" end="01:12:02.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s all that&#39;s there and</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.510" end="01:12:03.690" style="s2">everything has been dampened out so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.520" end="01:12:05.400" style="s2">actually they can be very pleasurable</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.690" end="01:12:06.900" style="s2">and a lot of people who do these</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.400" end="01:12:08.970" style="s2">practices get called so these</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.900" end="01:12:10.800" style="s2">concentration practice is often leading</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.970" end="01:12:12.900" style="s2">to these things called jhanas these deep</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.800" end="01:12:15.270" style="s2">concentrated states and it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.900" end="01:12:16.770" style="s2">fun little anecdote that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.270" end="01:12:18.120" style="s2">will talk about how some people get so</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.770" end="01:12:19.380" style="s2">addicted to the pleasure that they call</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.120" end="01:12:20.790" style="s2">them jhana junkies where all they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.380" end="01:12:22.800" style="s2">doing is sitting down you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.790" end="01:12:26.070" style="s2">high concentrated states and bliss it</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.800" end="01:12:27.710" style="s2">out so yeah it seems dangerous to me you</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.070" end="01:12:29.760" style="s2">know that you know as I wrote my essay</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.710" end="01:12:31.920" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen this I&#39;ve seen where people</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.760" end="01:12:34.230" style="s2">get pulled away from the work of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.920" end="01:12:36.870" style="s2">world and essentially become navel</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.230" end="01:12:39.450" style="s2">gazers right and you know there is such</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.870" end="01:12:40.040" style="s2">positive feedback and probably strong</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.450" end="01:12:43.040" style="s2">dopamine</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.040" end="01:12:44.000" style="s2">signals to do it again right that people</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.040" end="01:12:45.800" style="s2">who get involved with these things</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.000" end="01:12:48.020" style="s2">should realize that you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.800" end="01:12:50.240" style="s2">like heroin you know heroin is you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.020" end="01:12:51.620" style="s2">very very they tell me at least I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.240" end="01:12:53.510" style="s2">smoked some opium a couple times never</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.620" end="01:12:55.100" style="s2">done Aaron but I have heard people who</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.510" end="01:12:57.890" style="s2">have done it that is like the best thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.100" end="01:12:59.540" style="s2">ever right but hey you don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.890" end="01:13:01.340" style="s2">doing the best thing ever all the time</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.540" end="01:13:03.350" style="s2">but there&#39;s the work of the world I mean</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.340" end="01:13:05.240" style="s2">we&#39;re in the world to do the work of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.350" end="01:13:07.910" style="s2">world at least I would say and these</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.240" end="01:13:09.530" style="s2">other things are means to that end and</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.910" end="01:13:13.220" style="s2">we need to be careful that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.530" end="01:13:14.720" style="s2">become ends rather than means yeah that</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.220" end="01:13:17.270" style="s2">when the rubber hits the road it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.720" end="01:13:18.980" style="s2">being in the world and there is an</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.270" end="01:13:20.390" style="s2">uncomfortable reality that in some</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.980" end="01:13:22.220" style="s2">senses sometimes sometimes people have</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.390" end="01:13:25.400" style="s2">to dedicate good portions of their life</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.220" end="01:13:28.400" style="s2">or time to pursuing these states in</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.400" end="01:13:30.260" style="s2">isolation not interacting that deeply</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.400" end="01:13:32.780" style="s2">with the world at least to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.260" end="01:13:34.640" style="s2">unravel their shit so that when they do</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.780" end="01:13:36.320" style="s2">engage in the world they&#39;re not so self</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.640" end="01:13:38.150" style="s2">and other harming you know they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.320" end="01:13:39.980" style="s2">such a they&#39;re not a hazard we have the</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.150" end="01:13:41.360" style="s2">default human psychology I&#39;d argue is</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.980" end="01:13:43.160" style="s2">kind of like a bull in a china shop</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.360" end="01:13:45.830" style="s2">we&#39;re you know we&#39;re causing a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.160" end="01:13:48.440" style="s2">damage so yeah you have to hold both of</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.830" end="01:13:50.110" style="s2">these in kind of same hand and and and</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.440" end="01:13:52.160" style="s2">that&#39;s just one you know the pleasure</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.110" end="01:13:53.930" style="s2">getting attached to pleasure in your</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.160" end="01:13:55.700" style="s2">meditation practice that&#39;s one of a</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.930" end="01:13:57.530" style="s2">million koltes acts there&#39;s all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.700" end="01:13:59.870" style="s2">spiritual bypassing that people can fall</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.530" end="01:14:02.360" style="s2">trap to so I think it&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.870" end="01:14:05.630" style="s2">to talk about how in the end this is</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.360" end="01:14:08.600" style="s2">about being in the world effecting</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.630" end="01:14:10.490" style="s2">change interacting with people and you</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.600" end="01:14:12.440" style="s2">know and there&#39;s there&#39;s a Zen phrase</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.490" end="01:14:15.470" style="s2">that&#39;s always fun and it says before</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.440" end="01:14:18.170" style="s2">enlightenment you carry wood and get and</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.470" end="01:14:20.240" style="s2">gather water and after enlightenment you</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.170" end="01:14:23.090" style="s2">carry wood and gather water right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.240" end="01:14:26.960" style="s2">like I don&#39;t like that at all okay so</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.090" end="01:14:30.310" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about a lot of the ways in</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.960" end="01:14:33.890" style="s2">which this is useful right and</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.310" end="01:14:35.990" style="s2">pleasurable and now and again this is</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.890" end="01:14:39.080" style="s2">the area where I am still very resistant</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.990" end="01:14:41.390" style="s2">and i think sam harris is too i like to</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.080" end="01:14:44.480" style="s2">hear what your view is are there any</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.390" end="01:14:46.610" style="s2">metaphysical truths to be found here in</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.480" end="01:14:49.010" style="s2">these contemplative practices or they</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.610" end="01:14:51.680" style="s2">just are the confabulate er fire and</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.010" end="01:14:53.660" style="s2">shit up as we go into non-typical brain</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.680" end="01:14:57.300" style="s2">rhythms and networks</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.660" end="01:15:00.150" style="s2">this is interesting I do think it has a</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.300" end="01:15:01.710" style="s2">role it&#39;s just we can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.150" end="01:15:03.780" style="s2">fundamentalists about it in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.710" end="01:15:05.880" style="s2">that to be non-dual is to realize that</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.780" end="01:15:07.530" style="s2">we are their bodies and minds right</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.880" end="01:15:09.780" style="s2">they&#39;re like to your point this isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.530" end="01:15:11.990" style="s2">Cartesian separation they&#39;re intimately</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.780" end="01:15:14.970" style="s2">intertwined to not separate whatsoever</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.990" end="01:15:17.520" style="s2">and so if that holds true then obviously</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.970" end="01:15:19.890" style="s2">there&#39;s got to be some part of this</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.520" end="01:15:22.110" style="s2">contemplative project that has some real</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.890" end="01:15:23.810" style="s2">world implications when it comes to the</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.110" end="01:15:26.100" style="s2">metaphysical and philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.810" end="01:15:30.120" style="s2">underpinnings of what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.100" end="01:15:33.300" style="s2">happening out there well here&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.120" end="01:15:35.580" style="s2">interesting thing right so wisdom in in</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.300" end="01:15:37.620" style="s2">a Buddhist context it&#39;s kind of like a</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.580" end="01:15:39.690" style="s2">an enlightened quality and sense that</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.620" end="01:15:41.940" style="s2">gets you know to act from wisdom is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.690" end="01:15:44.070" style="s2">very renowned and what wisdom is</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.940" end="01:15:46.560" style="s2">correlated to in the Buddhist teachings</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.070" end="01:15:49.920" style="s2">is actually something called emptiness</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.560" end="01:15:54.450" style="s2">so it&#39;s not-- no thingness nothingness</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.920" end="01:15:56.190" style="s2">and so I think that the the value here</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.450" end="01:15:58.520" style="s2">and this this makes some connections to</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.190" end="01:16:00.840" style="s2">the postmodern shift as well is</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.520" end="01:16:04.530" style="s2">understanding in our experience if we</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.840" end="01:16:07.320" style="s2">can get so intimately familiar with our</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.530" end="01:16:08.850" style="s2">confabulate er that is making stories up</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.320" end="01:16:11.160" style="s2">and some of them are more or less true</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.850" end="01:16:14.700" style="s2">and and resonate with the larger world</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.160" end="01:16:17.460" style="s2">the more we start to see that if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.700" end="01:16:19.560" style="s2">all maps none of the things that our</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.460" end="01:16:21.000" style="s2">mind can offer up are going to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.560" end="01:16:22.590" style="s2">ultimately true there are all</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.000" end="01:16:26.190" style="s2">simplifications of what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.590" end="01:16:28.050" style="s2">happening and that can be a terrifying</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.190" end="01:16:30.090" style="s2">perspective from an objective stance</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.050" end="01:16:33.000" style="s2">because you&#39;re basically saying that all</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.090" end="01:16:36.390" style="s2">of our theories are can&#39;t ultimately be</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.000" end="01:16:38.970" style="s2">proven you know and for a large degree</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.390" end="01:16:41.940" style="s2">you know physics and and science</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.970" end="01:16:43.740" style="s2">progresses under the auspices or the the</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.940" end="01:16:45.840" style="s2">intention that maybe we can actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.740" end="01:16:48.000" style="s2">find out what the the source code of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.840" end="01:16:49.680" style="s2">of the world is we can boil it down we</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.000" end="01:16:51.030" style="s2">can really understand it but when we</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.680" end="01:16:53.700" style="s2">realize that it&#39;s something that our</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.030" end="01:16:56.220" style="s2">mind is creating it allows us to view it</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.700" end="01:16:59.670" style="s2">in a different way and the cool thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.220" end="01:17:02.010" style="s2">about this here is that we can be</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.670" end="01:17:04.489" style="s2">flexible with our metaphysics in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.010" end="01:17:07.280" style="s2">sense that we can see that each of them</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.489" end="01:17:09.590" style="s2">can have a valuable perspective or lens</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.280" end="01:17:12.199" style="s2">to apply in different situations and</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.590" end="01:17:14.210" style="s2">we&#39;re not really that worried about them</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.199" end="01:17:17.270" style="s2">disagreeing with each other they become</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.210" end="01:17:19.790" style="s2">far more about how their utility and far</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.270" end="01:17:21.170" style="s2">less about their truth well not far less</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.790" end="01:17:23.270" style="s2">about their truth but understanding that</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.170" end="01:17:25.100" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s no ultimate answer that</p>

<p begin="01:17:33.290" end="01:17:35.780" style="s2">reason I brought post-modernism because</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.670" end="01:17:37.310" style="s2">post-modernism is kind of very</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.780" end="01:17:40.340" style="s2">intellectual version of this</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.310" end="01:17:41.929" style="s2">deconstruction it&#39;s doing these really</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.340" end="01:17:43.940" style="s2">deep dives to try and understand the</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.929" end="01:17:44.989" style="s2">limitations of our stories so yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.940" end="01:17:47.390" style="s2">don&#39;t know they&#39;re maybe we could start</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.989" end="01:17:49.040" style="s2">there yeah that&#39;s good that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.390" end="01:17:50.570" style="s2">play start you know first I would push</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.040" end="01:17:53.120" style="s2">back a little bit and say that you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.570" end="01:17:55.580" style="s2">real scientists don&#39;t think that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.120" end="01:17:57.530" style="s2">anywhere close to real ground truth</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.580" end="01:17:58.760" style="s2">right you know especially the top</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.530" end="01:18:01.130" style="s2">scientists you know they know that</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.760" end="01:18:03.800" style="s2">percent that what everything we do is</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.130" end="01:18:06.469" style="s2">coarse-grained simplified and certainly</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.800" end="01:18:09.140" style="s2">wrong in the details and perhaps wrong</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.469" end="01:18:10.820" style="s2">in the big picture right it hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.140" end="01:18:13.340" style="s2">that long ago since for instance</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.820" end="01:18:15.469" style="s2">Einstein overturned Newton ISM right</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.340" end="01:18:17.510" style="s2">Newtonian view of the world was so</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.469" end="01:18:20.060" style="s2">amazingly ingrain and go back and read</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.510" end="01:18:22.909" style="s2">your can&#39;t write you can&#39;t imagine Conte</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.060" end="01:18:24.409" style="s2">without Newton right and yet Einstein</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.909" end="01:18:26.960" style="s2">could turn that completely on its head</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.409" end="01:18:29.870" style="s2">and then the even more radical craziness</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.960" end="01:18:31.820" style="s2">of quantum mechanics right so as Richard</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.870" end="01:18:33.560" style="s2">Fineman says if anyone says they</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.820" end="01:18:34.330" style="s2">understand quantum mechanics they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.560" end="01:18:36.860" style="s2">lying</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.330" end="01:18:38.750" style="s2">nobody understands quantum mechanics and</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.860" end="01:18:41.390" style="s2">that&#39;s okay and you know and I would say</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.750" end="01:18:43.250" style="s2">the top scientists you know except that</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.390" end="01:18:45.409" style="s2">on the other hand and I think this is</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.250" end="01:18:46.940" style="s2">part ways with the New Agers and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.409" end="01:18:49.550" style="s2">sure with the Buddhists you know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.940" end="01:18:52.370" style="s2">sure which is I would say there is a</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.550" end="01:18:54.409" style="s2">reality out there and that science is</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.370" end="01:18:57.230" style="s2">incrementally and iteratively and</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.409" end="01:18:58.699" style="s2">sometimes wrongly learning more and more</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.230" end="01:19:01.580" style="s2">and more and more about that real</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.699" end="01:19:04.280" style="s2">universe that&#39;s out there and that you</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.580" end="01:19:05.870" style="s2">know we can&#39;t just make shit up about</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.280" end="01:19:06.949" style="s2">the universe you know and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.870" end="01:19:09.440" style="s2">difference between science and</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.949" end="01:19:13.100" style="s2">metaphysics metaphysics is the art of</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.440" end="01:19:15.199" style="s2">making shit up right and fact I when I</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.100" end="01:19:17.300" style="s2">say metaphysics I hear the word</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.199" end="01:19:19.010" style="s2">metaphysics I reach for my pistol</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.300" end="01:19:20.949" style="s2">that&#39;s about the kind of meta Fez</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.010" end="01:19:22.880" style="s2">what I call medic metaphysical</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.949" end="01:19:25.460" style="s2">assertions for people just the SIRT</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.880" end="01:19:27.739" style="s2">things right know that Yahweh is sitting</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.460" end="01:19:29.900" style="s2">in a cloud or Zeus is throwing lightning</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.739" end="01:19:31.639" style="s2">bolts or Thor causes thunder that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.900" end="01:19:33.590" style="s2">shit somebody made up and even</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.639" end="01:19:35.570" style="s2">Aristotelian physics was frankly</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.590" end="01:19:37.670" style="s2">something somebody made up Aristotle in</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.570" end="01:19:40.789" style="s2">this case it was just bullshit he just</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.670" end="01:19:42.980" style="s2">made it up and it was easily disproved</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.789" end="01:19:45.230" style="s2">weirdly it took 2,000 years for somebody</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.980" end="01:19:47.719" style="s2">to do a half an hour experiment to</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.230" end="01:19:49.340" style="s2">disprove it because we clearly have a</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.719" end="01:19:53.000" style="s2">bias towards these metaphysical</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.340" end="01:19:55.250" style="s2">assertions and so I like to carefully</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.000" end="01:19:57.380" style="s2">piece apart that we have some things</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.250" end="01:20:01.610" style="s2">that we&#39;re learning about the universe</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.380" end="01:20:04.309" style="s2">that while not exactly true are getting</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.610" end="01:20:06.469" style="s2">truer and they are consistent and their</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.309" end="01:20:08.119" style="s2">lawful that&#39;s the important thing at</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.469" end="01:20:09.619" style="s2">least they have been so far be very</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.119" end="01:20:11.300" style="s2">interesting to prove they aren&#39;t lawful</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.619" end="01:20:14.059" style="s2">should be interesting but so far we</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.300" end="01:20:16.429" style="s2">found them to be extremely lawful you</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.059" end="01:20:18.800" style="s2">know the the laws of quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.429" end="01:20:20.900" style="s2">seem to be correct to have 14 decimal</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.800" end="01:20:22.849" style="s2">points which is pretty amazing and while</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.900" end="01:20:24.289" style="s2">the area of metaphysics you know people</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.849" end="01:20:26.090" style="s2">just make shit up all the time you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.289" end="01:20:29.210" style="s2">the anthropologists have found at least</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.090" end="01:20:31.250" style="s2">10,000 religions for instance all of</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.210" end="01:20:33.050" style="s2">which at the level of metaphysics</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.250" end="01:20:36.139" style="s2">contradict each other hmm</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.050" end="01:20:38.389" style="s2">interesting right and so I you know when</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.139" end="01:20:40.940" style="s2">I run to someone with a religious dogma</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.389" end="01:20:43.539" style="s2">I say at best the probability of being</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.940" end="01:20:46.730" style="s2">correct it&#39;s 1 in 10,000 and they go oh</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.539" end="01:20:49.340" style="s2">yeah they can&#39;t get that right I mean</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.730" end="01:20:52.099" style="s2">the the people watching the Aztec</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.340" end="01:20:54.260" style="s2">priests cut the hearts out of teenagers</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.099" end="01:20:56.329" style="s2">hold the hearts up the beating hearts up</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.260" end="01:20:58.460" style="s2">and then throwing the carcasses down the</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.329" end="01:21:00.260" style="s2">stairs so the lower priests could eat</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.460" end="01:21:02.269" style="s2">them they all thought that was great</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.260" end="01:21:04.400" style="s2">that was the good shit and the true and</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.269" end="01:21:06.949" style="s2">and and straight-and-narrow wait the</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.400" end="01:21:09.019" style="s2">reality right so we can believe all</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.949" end="01:21:10.670" style="s2">kinds of horseshit right and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.019" end="01:21:12.769" style="s2">why I think it&#39;s hugely important to</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.670" end="01:21:14.659" style="s2">draw this bright line between</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.769" end="01:21:18.530" style="s2">metaphysical speculations which are</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.659" end="01:21:20.900" style="s2">unbound and science like and some of its</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.530" end="01:21:22.250" style="s2">friends math and logic though they are</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.900" end="01:21:23.960" style="s2">different because those are both formal</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.250" end="01:21:27.619" style="s2">systems rather than empirical systems</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.960" end="01:21:29.269" style="s2">right and don&#39;t get too confused and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.619" end="01:21:31.400" style="s2">gonna give you two examples just let me</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.269" end="01:21:32.570" style="s2">get your reaction to one I won&#39;t point</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.400" end="01:21:34.100" style="s2">at the the see</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.570" end="01:21:37.070" style="s2">various meditative contemplative</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.100" end="01:21:40.520" style="s2">practice people but the new-age versions</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.070" end="01:21:43.040" style="s2">of song come back amazingly often with</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.520" end="01:21:46.340" style="s2">what they call a they merged with the</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.040" end="01:21:48.140" style="s2">universal consciousness right and I go</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.340" end="01:21:49.940" style="s2">where&#39;s the evidence for this universal</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.140" end="01:21:51.170" style="s2">consciousness you know what does it told</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.940" end="01:21:53.600" style="s2">you that you wouldn&#39;t know otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.170" end="01:21:55.220" style="s2">right and so far I&#39;ve never never seen a</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.600" end="01:21:57.290" style="s2">single proof that there is a universal</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.220" end="01:21:59.360" style="s2">consciousness but millions of people</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.290" end="01:22:02.840" style="s2">will claim that there are the other one</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.360" end="01:22:03.860" style="s2">is from the fairly rigorous not as</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.840" end="01:22:07.520" style="s2">rigorous as we&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.860" end="01:22:08.930" style="s2">DMT drug studies right we&#39;re amazingly</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.520" end="01:22:10.730" style="s2">often people come back with these</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.930" end="01:22:13.430" style="s2">similar stories of little green men and</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.730" end="01:22:16.790" style="s2">you know strange doings in some other</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.430" end="01:22:18.590" style="s2">dimension and again all right sounds</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.790" end="01:22:20.000" style="s2">like horseshit to me and yet these are</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.590" end="01:22:22.040" style="s2">the kinds of things that we see coming</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.000" end="01:22:26.900" style="s2">repeatedly out of you know these kinds</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.040" end="01:22:29.210" style="s2">of atypical mental experiences they make</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.900" end="01:22:30.860" style="s2">a quick caveat to because you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.210" end="01:22:32.900" style="s2">that I can give the Buddhist perspective</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.860" end="01:22:34.490" style="s2">here if there are any Buddhists</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.900" end="01:22:35.930" style="s2">listening there&#39;s a good chance that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.490" end="01:22:38.900" style="s2">saying some things that are very wrong</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.930" end="01:22:40.880" style="s2">or heretical and there&#39;s a million</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.900" end="01:22:42.440" style="s2">variants of Buddhism so definitely not a</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.880" end="01:22:43.880" style="s2">spokesman and I actually would call</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.440" end="01:22:45.560" style="s2">myself just kind of Buddhist you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.880" end="01:22:47.000" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned a lot about it but but</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.560" end="01:22:48.650" style="s2">never taking vows I&#39;ve been part of a</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.000" end="01:22:51.110" style="s2">formal saga or anything like that so a</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.650" end="01:22:52.730" style="s2">bit of a visitor to the space but but</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.110" end="01:22:55.160" style="s2">yeah I do I do enjoy its philosophy a</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.730" end="01:22:57.410" style="s2">lot that being said I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.160" end="01:22:58.700" style="s2">pointing to the same thing that we</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.410" end="01:23:02.570" style="s2">talked about in the beginning right is</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.700" end="01:23:06.320" style="s2">that subjective experience and objective</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.570" end="01:23:09.740" style="s2">experience our two lenses to view our</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.320" end="01:23:11.300" style="s2">world and while they are connected</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.740" end="01:23:13.460" style="s2">they&#39;re not completely separate you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.300" end="01:23:16.340" style="s2">they they influence each other on a</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.460" end="01:23:19.700" style="s2">regular basis if we get to over invested</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.340" end="01:23:21.170" style="s2">in one of them it excludes the other so</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.700" end="01:23:22.730" style="s2">you know what I&#39;m basically saying is</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.170" end="01:23:25.790" style="s2">that we should be non-dual in our</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.730" end="01:23:27.080" style="s2">subject object distinctions and you</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.790" end="01:23:29.840" style="s2">don&#39;t know enough about science and</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.080" end="01:23:31.520" style="s2">rational understanding then you&#39;ll make</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.840" end="01:23:32.840" style="s2">the mistake of thinking that the</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.520" end="01:23:35.150" style="s2">experiences that you&#39;re having are</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.840" end="01:23:36.830" style="s2">ultimately true but I also think that</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.150" end="01:23:39.650" style="s2">the the fascinating thing here is that</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.830" end="01:23:42.040" style="s2">when you view these from a highly</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.650" end="01:23:43.840" style="s2">developed rational understanding</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.040" end="01:23:46.210" style="s2">you get a bit of a metaphysics and that</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.840" end="01:23:47.770" style="s2">metaphysics is uncertainty right so the</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.210" end="01:23:50.490" style="s2">reason I said wisdom was empty is</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.770" end="01:23:52.480" style="s2">because in the in this distinction</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.490" end="01:23:54.910" style="s2">wisdom is knowing that we know nothing</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.480" end="01:23:58.300" style="s2">and when we do that if Riis us up to</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.910" end="01:24:02.640" style="s2">explore anywhere and to your point it</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.300" end="01:24:07.060" style="s2">frees us up to constantly be refining</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.640" end="01:24:09.520" style="s2">adjusting updating comparing our Maps so</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.060" end="01:24:11.680" style="s2">we become the intellectual pursuit or</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.520" end="01:24:13.920" style="s2">trying to understand our experience and</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.680" end="01:24:16.390" style="s2">some profound way is one sense just a</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.920" end="01:24:17.590" style="s2">grandiose form of cartography you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.390" end="01:24:20.170" style="s2">we&#39;re really interested in trying to</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.590" end="01:24:23.260" style="s2">figure out you know approximations that</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.170" end="01:24:25.300" style="s2">are useful to us in everyday life but</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.260" end="01:24:26.980" style="s2">the moment that we become</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.300" end="01:24:29.680" style="s2">fundamentalists and think that one of</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.980" end="01:24:32.560" style="s2">these areas is true and the other isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.680" end="01:24:35.650" style="s2">we limit ourselves to a large element of</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.560" end="01:24:37.660" style="s2">our experience and the weird thing too</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.650" end="01:24:41.530" style="s2">is that if we can look at these</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.660" end="01:24:43.270" style="s2">subjective frames that might sound like</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.530" end="01:24:46.570" style="s2">they&#39;re making metaphysical claims as</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.270" end="01:24:48.880" style="s2">purely ways of describing subjective</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.570" end="01:24:52.060" style="s2">States and not being predictive</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.880" end="01:24:55.810" style="s2">completely of objective ones it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.060" end="01:24:57.250" style="s2">more useful but I think emptiness or no</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.810" end="01:24:59.140" style="s2">thingness in the sense that if</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.250" end="01:25:00.970" style="s2">everything is moving and everything is</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.140" end="01:25:03.580" style="s2">connected and interacting with each</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.970" end="01:25:05.380" style="s2">other any distinction that we make is</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.580" end="01:25:07.150" style="s2">going to be inherently false it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.380" end="01:25:08.740" style="s2">it&#39;ll be wrong the moment we draw it</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.150" end="01:25:10.450" style="s2">because things are always changing and</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.740" end="01:25:12.520" style="s2">and you know maybe we could talk about</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.450" end="01:25:13.930" style="s2">the the scientific implications of this</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.520" end="01:25:15.700" style="s2">as were saying that some of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.930" end="01:25:17.980" style="s2">fundamental laws of physics might be in</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.700" end="01:25:19.330" style="s2">flux I don&#39;t know but I would say I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.980" end="01:25:21.490" style="s2">never had an experience that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.330" end="01:25:24.070" style="s2">impermanent so it would follow suit that</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.490" end="01:25:26.890" style="s2">maybe we could use that as a lens for a</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.070" end="01:25:27.940" style="s2">certain exploration of objective science</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.890" end="01:25:31.960" style="s2">and maybe we could learn something there</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.940" end="01:25:33.940" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s this strange polarity</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.960" end="01:25:36.460" style="s2">of being able to hold both of them in</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.940" end="01:25:39.100" style="s2">hand and navigate fluidly between the</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.460" end="01:25:41.470" style="s2">two depending on when it&#39;s most useful</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.100" end="01:25:43.060" style="s2">and useful it&#39;s key I mean it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.470" end="01:25:44.860" style="s2">favorite word I know you&#39;ve probably</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.060" end="01:25:47.290" style="s2">heard me say it a zillion times as</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.860" end="01:25:50.800" style="s2">you&#39;ve edited the podcast right and is</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.290" end="01:25:52.390" style="s2">it actually useful and whether the</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.800" end="01:25:54.940" style="s2">concept of being at one with the</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.390" end="01:25:56.350" style="s2">universal consciousness or</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.940" end="01:25:59.199" style="s2">being a conversation with little green</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.350" end="01:26:01.780" style="s2">men on a blue crystal world is actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.199" end="01:26:04.180" style="s2">useful I&#39;m not so sure but I do know</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.780" end="01:26:06.790" style="s2">that understanding quantum mechanics is</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.180" end="01:26:09.040" style="s2">how we build the disk drives that we</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.790" end="01:26:12.100" style="s2">have and you know we use general</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.040" end="01:26:14.260" style="s2">relativity and the design of GPS systems</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.100" end="01:26:15.880" style="s2">and how we send satellites on long</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.260" end="01:26:17.650" style="s2">orbits that set there so I know those</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.880" end="01:26:20.620" style="s2">things are useful yeah so I would</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.650" end="01:26:23.410" style="s2">suggest that you know use usefulness as</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.620" end="01:26:24.969" style="s2">a lens in general and I also came just</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.410" end="01:26:26.170" style="s2">well I well we were talking listening to</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.969" end="01:26:29.530" style="s2">you talk to came up with a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.170" end="01:26:32.710" style="s2">a interesting take on some of these</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.530" end="01:26:33.760" style="s2">metaphysical assertions is maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.710" end="01:26:36.310" style="s2">should think of our metaphysical</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.760" end="01:26:39.640" style="s2">assertions as the most recent book</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.310" end="01:26:42.340" style="s2">review on the most recent book written</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.640" end="01:26:47.469" style="s2">by the confabulate er yes yeah I love</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.340" end="01:26:49.480" style="s2">that I think we should wrap it up right</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.469" end="01:26:51.190" style="s2">bear it this was a great conversation I</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.480" end="01:26:51.910" style="s2">have another page of notes but I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.190" end="01:26:54.460" style="s2">we did a great job</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.910" end="01:26:56.710" style="s2">thank you very much Jared yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.460" end="01:26:58.840" style="s2">this was a this is a blast I&#39;m glad we</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.710" end="01:27:02.830" style="s2">could make some time to dig deep into</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.840" end="01:27:05.410" style="s2">these these contemplatively just confuse</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.830" end="01:27:06.610" style="s2">the hell out of each other or actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.410" end="01:27:08.170" style="s2">as usual I think I made a little</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.610" end="01:27:09.790" style="s2">progress here every time I talk to</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.170" end="01:27:12.239" style="s2">somebody about this I feel like I</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.790" end="01:27:14.739" style="s2">understand a little bit better</p>
