<p begin="00:02:27.360" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.640" end="00:02:32.319" style="s2">on what&#39;s called the first degree of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:34.640" style="s2">wisdom the primary school</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.319" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not sufficient but it&#39;s needed of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.640" end="00:02:37.920" style="s2">epicureanism with the course of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">of hypatia</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:41.280" style="s2">and we&#39;ve learned some principles and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:43.360" style="s2">some practices</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.280" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">um what&#39;s the first practice we learned</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.360" end="00:02:46.160" style="s2">we learned the practice of prioritizing</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.200" end="00:02:48.640" style="s2">pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.160" end="00:02:49.760" style="s2">and how to do that and then we learned</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.640" end="00:02:52.959" style="s2">the practice of</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.760" end="00:02:55.599" style="s2">savoring and we learned the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.959" end="00:02:57.920" style="s2">metallic and the peritolic sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.599" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">adoraxia</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.920" end="00:03:01.920" style="s2">and now we have been moving into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:03.760" style="s2">disciplining</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">the discerning and disciplining of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.760" end="00:03:07.519" style="s2">imagination so whenever moments of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:10.480" style="s2">imagination occur to us</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.519" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">especially those that terrorize us and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.480" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">that can lead us into</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.760" end="00:03:16.239" style="s2">despair um we have what&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.800" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">four-fold cure</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.239" end="00:03:19.599" style="s2">and we we&#39;ve gone through the full for</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:22.640" style="s2">the four fold</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.599" end="00:03:25.920" style="s2">cure on how to address that</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.640" end="00:03:29.280" style="s2">and where that ended uh on wednesday</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:32.920" style="s2">was that we need a practice uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.280" end="00:03:36.640" style="s2">by which we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.920" end="00:03:36.640" style="s2">encourage each other</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.200" end="00:03:43.040" style="s2">and of course i&#39;m separating that to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.360" end="00:03:46.560" style="s2">sense of it&#39;s enacted</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.040" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">it&#39;s embodied we&#39;re right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.560" end="00:03:50.799" style="s2">training courage in each other and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.040" end="00:03:52.879" style="s2">also inspiring each other</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.799" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">so the full gamut both the more ancient</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.879" end="00:03:57.360" style="s2">sense and then all the modern</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:58.480" style="s2">meanings that attaches to that attack to</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.360" end="00:04:01.040" style="s2">this word</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.480" end="00:04:02.959" style="s2">and at that at the core of this and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.040" end="00:04:06.720" style="s2">thing that was most valued</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.959" end="00:04:08.560" style="s2">by the epicureans uh was friendship</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:09.840" style="s2">um now i think friendship is an</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.560" end="00:04:12.720" style="s2">important word and but</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.840" end="00:04:13.760" style="s2">we have tended to lose the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.720" end="00:04:16.959" style="s2">friendship as</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.760" end="00:04:17.600" style="s2">a virtue and so um i&#39;m going to bring</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.959" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.600" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">an a slightly archaic word that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.560" end="00:04:23.600" style="s2">used as much</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:25.199" style="s2">to try and emphasize i don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.600" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">friendship in just the sense we mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.199" end="00:04:27.199" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:29.120" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying you treat your friends</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.199" end="00:04:32.240" style="s2">lightly i&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:33.840" style="s2">i am not saying that what i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.240" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">we need a deeper sense of what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.840" end="00:04:36.639" style="s2">epicureans were talking about when they</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:38.960" style="s2">talk about friendship</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.639" end="00:04:41.759" style="s2">so the word that&#39;s very helpful here i</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:45.440" style="s2">think is fellowship</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.759" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">this is a word for use uh so</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.440" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">in fellowship uh there is friendship</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:51.680" style="s2">but there is a friendship in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.680" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">like a community and a community that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:04:58.400" style="s2">centered upon something centered upon</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:04:59.840" style="s2">something that transcends the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.400" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">individuals that make it</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:05.280" style="s2">so uh you know christians often use this</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">word for that there should be fellowship</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.280" end="00:05:09.600" style="s2">in a congregation and i think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.000" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">little bit closer to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.600" end="00:05:15.759" style="s2">the epicurean meaning of friendship</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:19.919" style="s2">all right so we want to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.759" end="00:05:24.240" style="s2">cultivate a fellowship</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.919" end="00:05:26.720" style="s2">of encouragement now this takes us into</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.240" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">some very important work um and today</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.720" end="00:05:29.520" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be this is why i need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:30.880" style="s2">have another dharma day on monday</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.520" end="00:05:33.039" style="s2">today we&#39;re going to be talking sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.880" end="00:05:34.880" style="s2">more about the theory once we get a</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.039" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">proper framing of it i&#39;m doing it right</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.880" end="00:05:39.199" style="s2">now and then monday is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.880" end="00:05:40.320" style="s2">you know the actual specific exercises</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.479" end="00:06:32.400" style="s2">philosophical foundation is</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.479" end="00:06:34.240" style="s2">stepping out of plato&#39;s cave</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.560" end="00:06:51.840" style="s2">can use it as needed</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.319" end="00:06:54.960" style="s2">right but my job is to</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.840" end="00:06:55.759" style="s2">learn this material um test it out put</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.960" end="00:06:57.120" style="s2">it into</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.759" end="00:06:59.280" style="s2">conversation with the best sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.120" end="00:07:02.479" style="s2">cognitive science that i have learned</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.280" end="00:07:05.199" style="s2">and then transmit uh to it to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.479" end="00:07:05.599" style="s2">hopefully as helpfully as i can all</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.199" end="00:07:08.160" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.599" end="00:07:09.280" style="s2">so what the hat has this model of what</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.160" end="00:07:13.120" style="s2">he calls</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:13.120" style="s2">uh philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.479" end="00:07:23.840" style="s2">contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.319" end="00:07:23.840" style="s2">and companionship</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.680" end="00:07:30.880" style="s2">he sometimes shortens it to</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">philosophical companionships but he</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.880" end="00:07:34.240" style="s2">wants us to always remember it has these</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.560" end="00:07:37.120" style="s2">three components in it</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.240" end="00:07:39.840" style="s2">so let&#39;s talk briefly about this notion</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.120" end="00:07:43.440" style="s2">of philosophical let&#39;s draw it out</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.840" end="00:07:44.080" style="s2">okay so courage because we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.440" end="00:07:46.560" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">a fellowship for encouragement because</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">this is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:51.280" style="s2">most powerful way in which we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:54.479" style="s2">respond</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.280" end="00:07:57.919" style="s2">to fear right so</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.479" end="00:07:58.720" style="s2">courage is a virtue you have to think</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.919" end="00:08:02.160" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.720" end="00:08:03.039" style="s2">what a virtue is um we use this word</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:05.919" style="s2">when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.039" end="00:08:06.319" style="s2">virtual like virtual reality and what we</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.919" end="00:08:09.120" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:10.840" style="s2">is a shaping of possibilities so that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.120" end="00:08:13.599" style="s2">have practice for what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.840" end="00:08:14.800" style="s2">actually um a shaping of possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.599" end="00:08:15.919" style="s2">like when you&#39;re in virtual space it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.800" end="00:08:18.240" style="s2">not real space</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.919" end="00:08:19.520" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s shaping in you know a</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.240" end="00:08:22.560" style="s2">possible space</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.520" end="00:08:24.240" style="s2">a possible world hopefully to help train</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:25.919" style="s2">you for the real world now of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.240" end="00:08:27.280" style="s2">like everything else we can use it an</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.919" end="00:08:28.560" style="s2">escapist fashion</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.280" end="00:08:31.039" style="s2">but that&#39;s the original meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:34.320" style="s2">virtue virtue is a power it is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.039" end="00:08:37.519" style="s2">shaped potentiality to act rightly</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.320" end="00:08:40.959" style="s2">in the world okay so</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.519" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">so so what well</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.959" end="00:08:44.240" style="s2">the person who really unpacked this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:47.680" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.240" end="00:08:48.880" style="s2">aristotle and the notion of a virtue is</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.680" end="00:08:52.080" style="s2">a wise habit</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.880" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">you inhabit something so you practice</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.080" end="00:08:55.519" style="s2">until it is second nature if you think a</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">virtue is about</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.519" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">this is one of my problems with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">our political discourse left and right</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:04.560" style="s2">i&#39;m not taking aside here</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:06.839" style="s2">is that we have relegated unite the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.560" end="00:09:08.399" style="s2">ideas of virtue to the possession of</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.839" end="00:09:11.040" style="s2">beliefs right</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.399" end="00:09:13.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s not where aristotle for</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:17.120" style="s2">example classically located virtue</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.360" end="00:09:18.640" style="s2">virtue is located in a wise habit</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.120" end="00:09:20.640" style="s2">so you have to track you have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.640" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2">practice something and you know habit</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.640" end="00:09:24.240" style="s2">can be a skill it can be a sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.040" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">it could be a transformation of your</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.240" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">but you practice something until it</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">becomes second nature</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:32.720" style="s2">so that you inhabit it you wear it like</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:36.160" style="s2">the habit</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.720" end="00:09:39.519" style="s2">of a monk that the monk wears to change</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.160" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">their identity okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.519" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">so we&#39;re directed towards</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:50.080" style="s2">a training when we&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.720" end="00:09:51.920" style="s2">virtue so we&#39;ll come back</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.080" end="00:09:53.360" style="s2">to that but what about the other side</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.920" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">the wisdom so</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.360" end="00:09:58.000" style="s2">for aristotle there&#39;s two aspects to</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:01.360" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:03.200" style="s2">importantly sophia and francis both of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.360" end="00:10:04.959" style="s2">these words are translated</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.200" end="00:10:07.200" style="s2">both of these greek words are translated</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:07.600" style="s2">as wisdom the fact that we have one word</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.200" end="00:10:09.680" style="s2">for it</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.600" end="00:10:11.440" style="s2">really hamstrings our understanding just</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.680" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">like we have one word for love and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.440" end="00:10:15.279" style="s2">greeks have</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:16.399" style="s2">agape and eros and philia let&#39;s fight</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.279" end="00:10:20.000" style="s2">philia there</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.399" end="00:10:23.519" style="s2">right sophia we&#39;ll come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.000" end="00:10:27.200" style="s2">okay so what is this this is basically</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.519" end="00:10:28.000" style="s2">your ability to grasp to see to have</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.200" end="00:10:30.640" style="s2">insight</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.000" end="00:10:33.279" style="s2">into the principles right that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.640" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">regulating the patterns of things</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.279" end="00:10:36.560" style="s2">right so what&#39;s what&#39;s the principle</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:37.600" style="s2">that&#39;s at work uh so you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.560" end="00:10:39.680" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.600" end="00:10:41.760" style="s2">and what&#39;s the principle what&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.680" end="00:10:43.839" style="s2">relevant principle at work here</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.760" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">that&#39;s sophia it&#39;s having an insight</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.839" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">into what&#39;s the relevant principle here</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.959" end="00:10:56.399" style="s2">pronesis is yours right your sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.200" end="00:10:56.800" style="s2">what&#39;s unfolding in the process and how</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.399" end="00:10:58.959" style="s2">can i</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.800" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">intervene how can i fit myself to it and</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.959" end="00:11:03.440" style="s2">intervene</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:04.160" style="s2">in it effectively and so what you want</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.440" end="00:11:06.399" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.160" end="00:11:07.600" style="s2">is you want to bring these two together</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.399" end="00:11:09.200" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.600" end="00:11:10.320" style="s2">for those of you who&#39;ve watched some of</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.200" end="00:11:11.920" style="s2">my other work i think i&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.320" end="00:11:14.560" style="s2">it a bit in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.920" end="00:11:15.760" style="s2">in the sangha too this is the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.560" end="00:11:19.200" style="s2">getting an optimal</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.760" end="00:11:23.120" style="s2">grip on things um</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.200" end="00:11:23.120" style="s2">getting an optimal grip on the situation</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.680" end="00:11:30.320" style="s2">so optimal grip comes from perception</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.519" end="00:11:32.079" style="s2">right so what right perception isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.320" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">some static thing you do</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.079" end="00:11:36.000" style="s2">uh we&#39;ve talked about this in savoring i</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:37.519" style="s2">i i write</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.000" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">this is too close i&#39;m getting details</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.519" end="00:11:41.680" style="s2">but i can&#39;t see the gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">this is you know i can see the gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.680" end="00:11:44.959" style="s2">but i&#39;m not getting</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:46.000" style="s2">you know all of the features and what i</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.959" end="00:11:48.240" style="s2">want to do is get</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.000" end="00:11:49.120" style="s2">i want to find a spot and i want to move</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.240" end="00:11:51.839" style="s2">the thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.120" end="00:11:52.560" style="s2">so i get the best overall trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.839" end="00:11:54.880" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.560" end="00:11:56.399" style="s2">the whole the right the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.880" end="00:11:58.959" style="s2">encompassing gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.399" end="00:11:59.680" style="s2">and the specific unfolding of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.959" end="00:12:01.839" style="s2">features</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:02.880" style="s2">so i&#39;m trying to get this these two to</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.839" end="00:12:04.399" style="s2">come together and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.880" end="00:12:06.480" style="s2">you&#39;re probably saying and you would be</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.399" end="00:12:07.760" style="s2">correct this reminds me it reminds me</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.480" end="00:12:10.720" style="s2">what you talked about in the eightfold</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.760" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">path like the right-handedness of things</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.720" end="00:12:14.320" style="s2">like right understanding yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:17.920" style="s2">exactly that idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.320" end="00:12:20.240" style="s2">so right that right that so my hand</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.920" end="00:12:22.240" style="s2">right it makes use of various principles</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.240" end="00:12:24.880" style="s2">right in process</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.240" end="00:12:25.279" style="s2">in order to come to an optimal grip on</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.880" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.279" end="00:12:32.399" style="s2">so one way you can think about this then</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:36.000" style="s2">is that what you&#39;re trying to do in</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.399" end="00:12:38.959" style="s2">wisdom right is you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.000" end="00:12:40.399" style="s2">and this is one of the overall so when</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.959" end="00:12:42.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve done a lot of work on this and</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.399" end="00:12:44.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a consensus around this</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.240" end="00:12:47.760" style="s2">right is that the wisdom at least</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.160" end="00:12:47.760" style="s2">involves seeing through illusion</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.160" end="00:12:57.839" style="s2">right in order</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.320" end="00:12:57.839" style="s2">to get an optimal grip on a situation</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.320" end="00:13:05.760" style="s2">so your sense of if you can grasp</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.600" end="00:13:08.079" style="s2">the relevant principles right the more</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.760" end="00:13:10.880" style="s2">general the more powerful patterns</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.079" end="00:13:12.560" style="s2">and then see how they apply here and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.880" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2">then that&#39;s the sofia</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.560" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">and the and then seeing how they apply</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.480" end="00:13:19.120" style="s2">is the phromesis</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:22.240" style="s2">then i get i can see through illusion so</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.120" end="00:13:23.279" style="s2">i can come into optimal grip a right</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.240" end="00:13:25.600" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.279" end="00:13:27.200" style="s2">in the sense of right-handedness uh with</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.600" end="00:13:31.920" style="s2">the situation</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.200" end="00:13:35.839" style="s2">okay so what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.920" end="00:13:35.839" style="s2">well what would that mean for courage</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.079" end="00:13:43.279" style="s2">courage would mean that you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.760" end="00:13:46.639" style="s2">practiced until it is habit your</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.279" end="00:13:50.320" style="s2">right not your belief about</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.639" end="00:13:52.519" style="s2">principles but your ability to see them</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.320" end="00:13:53.920" style="s2">to realize them that&#39;s what all that</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.519" end="00:13:57.600" style="s2">maximization</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.920" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">is doing when right in in the epicurean</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.600" end="00:14:01.279" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:02.160" style="s2">we create these mnemonic packages that</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.279" end="00:14:05.920" style="s2">help us</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.160" end="00:14:09.120" style="s2">keep practicing seeing the principles</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.920" end="00:14:12.639" style="s2">in action and these widen our frame</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.120" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">sophia so i&#39;ve done that and i come into</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.639" end="00:14:16.560" style="s2">a situation</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">and fear is starting to distort like in</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:20.959" style="s2">my imagination</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:22.160" style="s2">but then the maxims remind me of</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.959" end="00:14:26.240" style="s2">important principles they</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.160" end="00:14:29.199" style="s2">maximize my frame i open up to sophia</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.240" end="00:14:31.120" style="s2">but now we&#39;re going to talk more about</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.199" end="00:14:34.480" style="s2">yet but how do i then bring this</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.120" end="00:14:36.760" style="s2">into process how do i bring this into</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.480" end="00:14:39.120" style="s2">the specific situation how do i</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.760" end="00:14:41.839" style="s2">contextualize it</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.120" end="00:14:42.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly what the virtue is</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.839" end="00:14:46.240" style="s2">you can think about</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.800" end="00:14:49.839" style="s2">every virtue as the way of how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.240" end="00:14:52.959" style="s2">wise in this particular situation so</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.839" end="00:14:55.120" style="s2">to be kind is the way to be wise in this</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.959" end="00:14:57.040" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.120" end="00:14:58.399" style="s2">to be honest is the way to be wise in</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.040" end="00:15:00.240" style="s2">this situation</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.399" end="00:15:02.079" style="s2">to be courageous is the way to be wise</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.240" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">in this situation</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.079" end="00:15:05.199" style="s2">that&#39;s the tight interconnection virtue</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.480" end="00:15:08.639" style="s2">is very much</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.199" end="00:15:11.760" style="s2">the beauty of wisdom where beauty</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.639" end="00:15:12.079" style="s2">is how you are able to realize principle</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.760" end="00:15:16.399" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.079" end="00:15:18.480" style="s2">process such that it fits you well</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.399" end="00:15:20.480" style="s2">to the situation that&#39;s what beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.480" end="00:15:22.720" style="s2">music does you</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.480" end="00:15:23.680" style="s2">get the big pattern but how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.720" end="00:15:27.120" style="s2">impregnating</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.680" end="00:15:28.880" style="s2">the unfolding process and it fits you</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.120" end="00:15:30.320" style="s2">to the unfolding of the music you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.880" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">gripped by the music and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.320" end="00:15:34.800" style="s2">optimally gripping it</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.079" end="00:15:38.480" style="s2">you&#39;re in that right relationship okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.800" end="00:15:40.800" style="s2">so virtue is the beauty of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.480" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">so that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:45.839" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:45.839" style="s2">this enacted sense making</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.199" end="00:15:50.720" style="s2">notice the musical metaphors because</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.120" end="00:15:54.880" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be very very</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">pertinent so here&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.880" end="00:15:59.519" style="s2">when we&#39;re doing this making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.199" end="00:15:59.519" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.360" end="00:16:09.040" style="s2">take seriously this and take seriously</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.480" end="00:16:12.639" style="s2">the metaphor here this is both</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.040" end="00:16:13.600" style="s2">our understanding right like the sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.639" end="00:16:17.519" style="s2">of a sentence</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.600" end="00:16:19.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s also sight and hearing</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.519" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">it&#39;s that connectedness to the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.440" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">making sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.600" end="00:16:28.959" style="s2">making sense of others</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.279" end="00:16:36.639" style="s2">and making sense with others</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.399" end="00:16:39.920" style="s2">i have arguments for all of these and i</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.639" end="00:16:43.279" style="s2">can&#39;t do them because i don&#39;t have time</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.920" end="00:16:45.279" style="s2">but the point is these are all</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.279" end="00:16:47.680" style="s2">mutually interdependent when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.279" end="00:16:49.360" style="s2">trying to make sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.680" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">we&#39;re almost always having to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.360" end="00:16:52.160" style="s2">of others you also you say sometimes i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">alone</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.160" end="00:16:55.920" style="s2">yes but you&#39;re carrying other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:57.199" style="s2">perspectives around with you when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.920" end="00:16:58.160" style="s2">trying to make sense even when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.199" end="00:17:00.480" style="s2">alone</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.160" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">and making sense is ultimately something</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.480" end="00:17:04.160" style="s2">we do together let me just give you a</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:05.839" style="s2">non-controversial example i didn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.160" end="00:17:07.760" style="s2">any of these words</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.839" end="00:17:09.760" style="s2">i didn&#39;t come up with them neither did</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.760" end="00:17:12.880" style="s2">you we make</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.760" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">english together and we keep making it</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.880" end="00:17:16.400" style="s2">together that&#39;s not the only way</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:18.640" style="s2">we make sense it&#39;s just a pertinent</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.400" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">example here</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.640" end="00:17:21.679" style="s2">this is where we&#39;re starting to get the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.319" end="00:17:23.600" style="s2">idea of why we need</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.679" end="00:17:25.039" style="s2">philosophical contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.600" end="00:17:26.880" style="s2">companionship</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.039" end="00:17:28.400" style="s2">contemplation is the making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.880" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.400" end="00:17:35.520" style="s2">right the the the companionship</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:38.000" style="s2">is both making sense of others</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.520" end="00:17:39.360" style="s2">while making sense with others</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.000" end="00:17:42.720" style="s2">philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.360" end="00:17:45.440" style="s2">companionship is about trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.720" end="00:17:46.960" style="s2">grasp the principles of this triangle</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.440" end="00:18:01.840" style="s2">and then enact it</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.960" end="00:18:01.840" style="s2">in a regular practice process okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.320" end="00:18:09.600" style="s2">so let&#39;s unpack this term philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.679" end="00:18:10.960" style="s2">contemplative companionship i already</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.600" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.960" end="00:18:16.080" style="s2">right philia sophia that&#39;s in the word</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:17.840" style="s2">philosophy so i&#39;m not talking here about</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.080" end="00:18:20.160" style="s2">academic philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.840" end="00:18:21.840" style="s2">academic philosophy is not right</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.160" end="00:18:23.600" style="s2">something you should despise</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.840" end="00:18:24.880" style="s2">um i&#39;m always suspicious of people who</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.600" end="00:18:26.640" style="s2">do so uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:28.080" style="s2">but that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.640" end="00:18:31.520" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.080" end="00:18:32.480" style="s2">this is the fellowship love of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.520" end="00:18:36.240" style="s2">now this word is</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.480" end="00:18:40.000" style="s2">often used to mean actually both sophia</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.240" end="00:18:40.000" style="s2">and phronesis together</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.960" end="00:18:47.600" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s the foolish it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:51.360" style="s2">fellowship love</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.600" end="00:18:52.960" style="s2">of wisdom and of course as i tried to</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.360" end="00:18:55.039" style="s2">show you wisdom and virtue are</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.960" end="00:18:58.640" style="s2">inherently bound up together</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.039" end="00:19:01.919" style="s2">virtue is the beauty of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.640" end="00:19:03.919" style="s2">it&#39;s what makes us love wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.919" end="00:19:05.760" style="s2">okay so look what about this word</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.919" end="00:19:06.640" style="s2">companionship well it comes from two</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.760" end="00:19:11.440" style="s2">latin words</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:14.559" style="s2">companis this means with</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.440" end="00:19:18.000" style="s2">and this means bread</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.559" end="00:19:21.440" style="s2">and you&#39;re going what yeah this means</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.000" end="00:19:23.520" style="s2">sharing bread with people having a meal</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.440" end="00:19:26.080" style="s2">with people</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.520" end="00:19:27.440" style="s2">so the basic idea here is communing</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.080" end="00:19:29.360" style="s2">together think about when you</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.440" end="00:19:31.520" style="s2">when you eat with other and so how much</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.360" end="00:19:35.120" style="s2">we want to eat with other human beings</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.520" end="00:19:38.080" style="s2">and how much rituals involve eating</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.120" end="00:19:40.480" style="s2">with other human beings sharing bread</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.080" end="00:19:43.360" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.480" end="00:19:44.320" style="s2">now what&#39;s going on there because the</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.360" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">point here is</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.320" end="00:19:48.799" style="s2">this is not just about communication</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.039" end="00:19:50.320" style="s2">this is about communing</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.799" end="00:19:51.679" style="s2">so one of the things we have to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.320" end="00:19:53.039" style="s2">right from the beginning about</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.679" end="00:19:54.240" style="s2">philosophical contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.039" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">companionships</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.240" end="00:19:58.480" style="s2">right is that this is not just about</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:01.120" style="s2">communication</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.480" end="00:20:02.080" style="s2">this is about communing it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.120" end="00:20:04.080" style="s2">communion</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.080" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">not just communication it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.080" end="00:20:08.559" style="s2">feeding each other</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">not just giving each other feedback</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.559" end="00:20:11.360" style="s2">and there&#39;s a big difference between</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:13.760" style="s2">those there&#39;s a very big difference</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.360" end="00:20:17.520" style="s2">between them</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.760" end="00:20:19.280" style="s2">so when we eat together</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.520" end="00:20:20.960" style="s2">right notice what we&#39;re doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.280" end="00:20:24.000" style="s2">it&#39;s we&#39;re we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:27.120" style="s2">enacting us we&#39;re literally mattering</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.000" end="00:20:28.640" style="s2">we&#39;re taking in matter that makes us</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.120" end="00:20:30.960" style="s2">and we&#39;re doing it with the people that</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.640" end="00:20:32.640" style="s2">matter to us</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.960" end="00:20:34.240" style="s2">and we&#39;re so we&#39;re trying to get all of</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.640" end="00:20:37.440" style="s2">that in sync</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.240" end="00:20:38.080" style="s2">resonating together we&#39;re eating a meal</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.440" end="00:20:40.559" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.080" end="00:20:41.120" style="s2">and notice we use consumption like we</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.559" end="00:20:44.159" style="s2">have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.120" end="00:20:46.480" style="s2">digest an idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.159" end="00:20:46.480" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.360" end="00:20:53.679" style="s2">all right so this is telling us oh</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.480" end="00:20:55.280" style="s2">okay so yeah i get that i get that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.679" end="00:20:57.039" style="s2">that triangle</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.280" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">you know the making sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.039" end="00:20:59.679" style="s2">making sense of others making sense with</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:02.240" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.679" end="00:21:03.200" style="s2">okay sophia is both you know the prince</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.240" end="00:21:07.280" style="s2">getting prince</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.200" end="00:21:10.320" style="s2">right practicing principle into process</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.280" end="00:21:12.000" style="s2">right i&#39;m going to be communing with</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.320" end="00:21:14.840" style="s2">other people to do that</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.000" end="00:21:16.559" style="s2">not just communicating with them feeding</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.840" end="00:21:19.919" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.559" end="00:21:22.480" style="s2">and being fed by them not just giving</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.919" end="00:21:22.480" style="s2">feedback</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.679" end="00:21:26.000" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:30.640" style="s2">so what about this word contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:31.679" style="s2">well we&#39;ve talked about it before</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.640" end="00:21:33.760" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.679" end="00:21:35.039" style="s2">it mean it has to do with you know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.760" end="00:21:35.520" style="s2">original meaning it has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.039" end="00:21:39.520" style="s2">temple</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.520" end="00:21:39.520" style="s2">it means right divination</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.280" end="00:21:45.360" style="s2">right in the sense of right</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.559" end="00:21:47.280" style="s2">you know of course and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.360" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">degenerated into people believing they</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.280" end="00:21:49.039" style="s2">can foretell the future and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:51.039" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.039" end="00:21:53.520" style="s2">but originally it meant looking for</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.039" end="00:21:57.360" style="s2">signs of the god&#39;s presence</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.520" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">right looking for signs of the god&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">presence</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.960" end="00:22:05.760" style="s2">and if we go back to the greek word that</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.360" end="00:22:07.360" style="s2">contemplation is based on fioria</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.760" end="00:22:09.600" style="s2">we get a word theory from that which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.360" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">fine but that&#39;s only half of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.600" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">right what&#39;s the original meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:16.320" style="s2">theoria well the original meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.840" end="00:22:18.400" style="s2">theoria is to go on a journey</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.320" end="00:22:20.640" style="s2">so that i will see something marvelous</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.400" end="00:22:22.799" style="s2">that will transform me</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.640" end="00:22:26.799" style="s2">so what i&#39;m doing is i&#39;m trying to give</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.799" end="00:22:29.440" style="s2">i&#39;m leaving the familiar and</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.799" end="00:22:30.080" style="s2">right the ordinary the normal think</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.440" end="00:22:32.400" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.080" end="00:22:33.440" style="s2">philosophic think about contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.400" end="00:22:35.200" style="s2">sorry think about</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.440" end="00:22:36.720" style="s2">meditative questing gotta get the right</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.200" end="00:22:39.840" style="s2">objective they&#39;re crucial here</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.720" end="00:22:41.600" style="s2">right i go on a journey i leave the</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.840" end="00:22:44.000" style="s2">familiar and the normal to see</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.600" end="00:22:45.600" style="s2">something marvelous that will transform</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.000" end="00:22:47.600" style="s2">me i want to be present</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.600" end="00:22:48.880" style="s2">for a revelation i want to see something</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.600" end="00:22:54.720" style="s2">that i haven&#39;t seen before</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.880" end="00:22:57.280" style="s2">so this is very much a vision quest</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.720" end="00:22:59.039" style="s2">like how it&#39;s used sometimes uh to</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.280" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">discuss certain practices</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.039" end="00:23:04.159" style="s2">uh from indigenous communities you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:05.039" style="s2">going on an adventure to see the advent</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.159" end="00:23:08.039" style="s2">of something</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.039" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to pick up on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.039" end="00:23:10.240" style="s2">significance of things that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.840" end="00:23:13.120" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.240" end="00:23:14.159" style="s2">significant means how it&#39;s a sign for</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.120" end="00:23:16.640" style="s2">the presence</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.159" end="00:23:19.440" style="s2">of something that has not been present</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.640" end="00:23:19.440" style="s2">to you before</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.520" end="00:23:23.679" style="s2">okay so we&#39;re trying to get away from</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.159" end="00:23:26.799" style="s2">our normal</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.679" end="00:23:28.559" style="s2">and familiar way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.799" end="00:23:29.840" style="s2">what is the normal and familiar way of</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.559" end="00:23:32.120" style="s2">thinking well</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.840" end="00:23:33.280" style="s2">it&#39;s the having of beliefs it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.120" end="00:23:35.039" style="s2">communicating</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.280" end="00:23:36.640" style="s2">and not communing because what i want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.039" end="00:23:38.240" style="s2">do is defend my beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.640" end="00:23:41.120" style="s2">or give you my beliefs or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.240" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">consume some useful beliefs from you</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.120" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">that&#39;s not communion that&#39;s not this</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.840" end="00:23:53.679" style="s2">so i want you to pick up on all of these</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.240" end="00:23:55.120" style="s2">metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.679" end="00:23:57.520" style="s2">when we&#39;re doing philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.120" end="00:23:59.279" style="s2">contemplative companionship</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.520" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">what we&#39;re basically doing is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.279" end="00:24:08.159" style="s2">doing something like a ritual meal</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.159" end="00:24:10.320" style="s2">in order to see</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.159" end="00:24:11.760" style="s2">and make present makes grasp the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.320" end="00:24:13.919" style="s2">significance of something</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.760" end="00:24:15.840" style="s2">by making it present to it not just</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.919" end="00:24:17.919" style="s2">representing it look at this word</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.840" end="00:24:20.320" style="s2">that means it&#39;s no longer present but</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.919" end="00:24:32.400" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.320" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">sensing its presence</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.400" end="00:24:36.240" style="s2">okay so what&#39;s the meal in philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:36.720" style="s2">companionship what&#39;s the meal we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.240" end="00:24:39.919" style="s2">sharing</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.720" end="00:24:42.559" style="s2">well the meal is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.919" end="00:24:42.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.320" end="00:24:48.559" style="s2">short philosophical text</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.200" end="00:24:54.559" style="s2">now it&#39;s philosophical and there&#39;s i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.679" end="00:24:56.559" style="s2">give you two</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.559" end="00:24:57.919" style="s2">on monday i&#39;ll give you uh the website</p>

<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:08.559" style="s2">not academic technical philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.760" end="00:25:09.760" style="s2">but these are philosophical texts that</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.559" end="00:25:13.600" style="s2">are designed</p>

<p begin="00:26:25.919" end="00:26:29.440" style="s2">right we will and that&#39;s the amazing</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.080" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">thing about text it can actually do that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.440" end="00:26:33.760" style="s2">for us</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:34.360" style="s2">we will be enriched in the sense of</p>

<p begin="00:26:42.880" end="00:26:46.000" style="s2">and here&#39;s where you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.559" end="00:26:47.679" style="s2">thinking but you know i&#39;m going to say</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.000" end="00:26:49.200" style="s2">one thing and bob&#39;s going to say another</p>

<p begin="00:26:51.360" end="00:26:55.440" style="s2">metaphor that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.400" end="00:26:58.640" style="s2">have uses is we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:27:06.080" end="00:27:12.480" style="s2">so your your the point here is not</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.360" end="00:27:15.200" style="s2">to agree or disagree with the text</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.480" end="00:27:16.960" style="s2">the point is to bear witness to it to</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.200" end="00:27:20.000" style="s2">try and give voice to it</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.960" end="00:27:22.320" style="s2">to try and present make present the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.000" end="00:27:25.279" style="s2">spirit of augustine or the spirit of</p>

<p begin="00:27:25.279" end="00:27:29.600" style="s2">it&#39;s like seeing the gods</p>

<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:35.200" style="s2">significance of a shared</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.760" end="00:27:38.399" style="s2">presence rather than convince others</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.200" end="00:27:41.520" style="s2">of your particular belief or opinion</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.399" end="00:27:44.080" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get away from familiar</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.520" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">opinion that we all have that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.080" end="00:27:47.039" style="s2">nothing wrong with it we need it in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:49.200" style="s2">social context but we have that very</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.039" end="00:27:50.080" style="s2">familiar normal way of communicating</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.200" end="00:27:52.000" style="s2">with each other</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.080" end="00:27:54.880" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to leave that behind in</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.000" end="00:27:57.200" style="s2">peoria and come into communing with each</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.880" end="00:27:57.200" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.000" end="00:28:04.640" style="s2">okay so what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.200" end="00:28:07.039" style="s2">well we&#39;re trying to do these three</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.640" end="00:28:09.600" style="s2">things let&#39;s bring that triangle back</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.039" end="00:28:11.200" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to in a coordinated and</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.600" end="00:28:15.039" style="s2">cooperative fashion</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.200" end="00:28:18.880" style="s2">make sense of the text not agree</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.039" end="00:28:21.919" style="s2">or disagree or offer your opinions</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.880" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">the point is what is it saying to us</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.919" end="00:28:26.159" style="s2">and not because i want to consume the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.720" end="00:28:27.760" style="s2">content</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.159" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">what i want to do is like get a family</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.760" end="00:28:34.240" style="s2">meal i want i&#39;m we&#39;re trying to invite</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:39.039" style="s2">and invoke augustine or plato</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.240" end="00:28:42.000" style="s2">or socrates or epicurus to dinner</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.039" end="00:28:42.000" style="s2">to be here with us</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.360" end="00:28:46.640" style="s2">and of course that means we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.600" end="00:28:52.080" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.640" end="00:28:54.720" style="s2">sense of others because i have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.080" end="00:28:55.279" style="s2">appreciate think of music appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.720" end="00:28:57.679" style="s2">we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.279" end="00:28:59.600" style="s2">we&#39;re in a chorus together i have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.679" end="00:29:01.039" style="s2">appreciate i have to understand and</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.600" end="00:29:02.399" style="s2">value what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.039" end="00:29:06.559" style="s2">i don&#39;t have to agree with it but that</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.399" end="00:29:06.559" style="s2">is not relevant in this context</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.279" end="00:29:11.279" style="s2">because we are making sense together we</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.039" end="00:29:13.840" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.279" end="00:29:13.840" style="s2">sensing</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.399" end="00:29:20.240" style="s2">together the meaning of the text and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.320" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">are sensing the presence</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.240" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">of the voice of the text</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.480" end="00:29:36.880" style="s2">okay so what does that mean we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.120" end="00:29:39.520" style="s2">well here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.880" end="00:29:40.080" style="s2">where your previous practices are a</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.520" end="00:29:42.559" style="s2">scaffold</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.080" end="00:29:42.559" style="s2">for this</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.000" end="00:29:47.919" style="s2">here&#39;s the text and it&#39;s like a meal and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.799" end="00:29:55.840" style="s2">what are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.919" end="00:29:55.840" style="s2">we are co-savoring it together</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.559" end="00:30:02.080" style="s2">we are trying to open it up like when</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.559" end="00:30:02.559" style="s2">you&#39;re walking and you&#39;re trying to open</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.080" end="00:30:04.240" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.559" end="00:30:06.399" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to realize as many</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.240" end="00:30:07.919" style="s2">patterns in it as it can as we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.399" end="00:30:10.080" style="s2">not because we&#39;re trying to finish it or</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.919" end="00:30:12.159" style="s2">come to a final belief we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:14.640" style="s2">listen to the musicality</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.159" end="00:30:15.520" style="s2">of its intelligibility we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.640" end="00:30:18.399" style="s2">pick up</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.520" end="00:30:20.799" style="s2">and listen together and sing together</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.399" end="00:30:22.799" style="s2">that musicality we&#39;re co-savoring</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.799" end="00:30:24.559" style="s2">that&#39;s why you&#39;ve been practicing savory</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.799" end="00:30:25.440" style="s2">we&#39;re learning how to co-savor the text</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.559" end="00:30:27.840" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.440" end="00:30:28.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s not independent it&#39;s meshed</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.840" end="00:30:33.360" style="s2">up with</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.480" end="00:30:36.960" style="s2">savoring each other&#39;s presence together</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.360" end="00:30:39.039" style="s2">so we&#39;re gonna pick up and partake in</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.960" end="00:30:40.559" style="s2">right pattern the patterning of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.039" end="00:30:41.520" style="s2">ideas of the text we&#39;re going to try and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.559" end="00:30:45.279" style="s2">pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.520" end="00:30:47.039" style="s2">the texture right the right the tempo of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.279" end="00:30:49.840" style="s2">the text the tone</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.039" end="00:30:51.200" style="s2">um the taste of it and you know we talk</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.840" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">about having a taste of music you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.200" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">trying to cultivate your</p>

<p begin="00:30:57.760" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">tension in music you&#39;re doing all of</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.720" end="00:31:04.640" style="s2">this because</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:08.559" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to sense</p>

<p begin="00:31:12.720" end="00:31:16.399" style="s2">understanding is about grasping the</p>

<p begin="00:31:16.399" end="00:31:19.919" style="s2">and you should do that learn how to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:23.600" style="s2">that very very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.919" end="00:31:26.720" style="s2">before we move to any kind of critical</p>

<p begin="00:31:27.279" end="00:31:35.919" style="s2">so we&#39;re giving voice to the text</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.240" end="00:31:35.919" style="s2">bearing witness to the presence</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.000" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">wow that&#39;s getting really sloppy</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.880" end="00:31:52.080" style="s2">and so what we&#39;re trying what what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.039" end="00:31:55.279" style="s2">getting to</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.080" end="00:31:56.320" style="s2">finally is this and that&#39;s where we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.279" end="00:31:57.760" style="s2">all end for today</p>

<p begin="00:33:32.159" end="00:33:36.799" style="s2">going to use habits into this practice</p>

<p begin="00:33:41.120" end="00:33:45.360" style="s2">we will not get any of this we will not</p>

<p begin="00:33:45.360" end="00:33:52.080" style="s2">in the practice of philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.799" end="00:33:53.919" style="s2">contemplative companionship we will not</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.080" end="00:33:55.519" style="s2">be generating a fellowship of</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.919" end="00:33:56.799" style="s2">encouragement we need all those other</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.519" end="00:33:58.960" style="s2">forms of communication</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.799" end="00:34:00.159" style="s2">and we need scientific discourse and we</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.960" end="00:34:02.799" style="s2">we need political</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.159" end="00:34:06.720" style="s2">dispute et cetera i&#39;m not denying that</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.799" end="00:34:08.320" style="s2">but we also need this you know when you</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.720" end="00:34:13.119" style="s2">need to learn how to swim</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.320" end="00:34:14.480" style="s2">it right you have to stop trying to walk</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.119" end="00:34:16.879" style="s2">because if you keep trying to walk in</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.480" end="00:34:18.639" style="s2">the water you won&#39;t swim is walking</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.879" end="00:34:21.599" style="s2">should be walking be thrown away no you</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.639" end="00:34:24.399" style="s2">need it but you have to stop walking</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.599" end="00:34:25.520" style="s2">in order to swim in order to learn how</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.399" end="00:34:28.079" style="s2">to swim</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.520" end="00:34:28.639" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s a lot and i hope it</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.079" end="00:34:31.760" style="s2">wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.639" end="00:34:33.119" style="s2">too overwhelming and we&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.760" end="00:34:34.960" style="s2">a short sit now</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.119" end="00:34:37.520" style="s2">jason&#39;s going to slightly adjust the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.960" end="00:34:40.639" style="s2">camera and then we&#39;ll have a short set</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.520" end="00:34:41.760" style="s2">and then we will go into a short q a as</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.639" end="00:34:43.599" style="s2">i keep reminding you</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.760" end="00:34:46.480" style="s2">uh monday wednesdays and fridays are</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.599" end="00:34:48.639" style="s2">longer there&#39;s a lot more to go</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.480" end="00:34:50.079" style="s2">so this was the theory very abstract and</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.639" end="00:34:51.679" style="s2">many of your things is also abstract</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.079" end="00:34:53.520" style="s2">i sort of get it but i don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.679" end="00:34:56.240" style="s2">do it i get that too</p>

<p begin="00:34:57.359" end="00:35:00.640" style="s2">into practice how do we bring the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.440" end="00:35:02.640" style="s2">principles</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.640" end="00:35:03.680" style="s2">into practice how do we bring the sophia</p>

<p begin="00:35:05.680" end="00:35:10.000" style="s2">actually start practicing it</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.200" end="00:35:11.040" style="s2">together virtually hopefully on a</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.000" end="00:35:14.000" style="s2">regular place</p>
