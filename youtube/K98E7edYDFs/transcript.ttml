<p begin="00:00:09.790" end="00:00:21.980" style="s2">the end every story begins with once</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.330" end="00:00:24.470" style="s2">upon a time and ends with the end what</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.980" end="00:00:27.050" style="s2">does that mean the end the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.470" end="00:00:30.940" style="s2">stories that mean everyone just stopped</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.050" end="00:00:34.129" style="s2">being and there is nothing else</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.940" end="00:00:36.560" style="s2">surely not they lived happily ever after</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.129" end="00:00:40.910" style="s2">that&#39;s often the end right they lived</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.560" end="00:00:43.310" style="s2">happily ever after so it&#39;s not an end</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.910" end="00:00:47.420" style="s2">right an end is not actually an end it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.310" end="00:00:51.020" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s some kind of a shift a change</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.420" end="00:00:53.630" style="s2">er a line drawn under one episode so</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.020" end="00:00:57.219" style="s2">that a new episode can begin something</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.630" end="00:01:04.189" style="s2">like that so the notion of end is really</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.219" end="00:01:11.119" style="s2">an opportunity for the space for a new</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.189" end="00:01:14.479" style="s2">beginning something like that whether</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.119" end="00:01:19.600" style="s2">these stories exist anyway in the words</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.479" end="00:01:19.600" style="s2">on a paper on the pages of the novel</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.680" end="00:01:25.890" style="s2">the end marks the end of the words but</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.820" end="00:01:29.600" style="s2">the story exists in the imagination of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.890" end="00:01:33.410" style="s2">the reader and so the story can continue</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.600" end="00:01:36.690" style="s2">into the new beginning and new adventure</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.410" end="00:01:41.640" style="s2">there&#39;s being rewritten and remembered</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.690" end="00:01:43.860" style="s2">and relived or maybe simply opened the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.640" end="00:01:47.120" style="s2">door for a new mode of functioning and a</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.860" end="00:01:47.120" style="s2">new story to begin</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.460" end="00:01:51.060" style="s2">the crossover between the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.460" end="00:01:56.960" style="s2">fictionalization</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.060" end="00:02:02.630" style="s2">of beginnings and ends and stories</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.960" end="00:02:08.569" style="s2">and that the end the six letters and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.630" end="00:02:11.709" style="s2">space hammering down its somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.569" end="00:02:15.220" style="s2">arbitrary right at the end it&#39;s it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.709" end="00:02:17.989" style="s2">yeah the because that the story is an</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.220" end="00:02:19.790" style="s2">abstract thing in the imagination of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.989" end="00:02:26.090" style="s2">author in the imagination of the reader</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.790" end="00:02:30.470" style="s2">and so the drawing to a close of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.090" end="00:02:32.840" style="s2">story is an arbitrary thing so let&#39;s try</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.470" end="00:02:37.160" style="s2">and extend this notion of endings out</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.840" end="00:02:40.160" style="s2">into the actual world what things end I</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.160" end="00:02:44.930" style="s2">mean I guess individual lives come to an</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:46.700" style="s2">end at least that&#39;s what it looks like I</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.930" end="00:02:48.860" style="s2">mean who knows there&#39;s there&#39;s no way to</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.700" end="00:02:53.239" style="s2">say that sure right but it seems as</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.860" end="00:02:55.040" style="s2">though egos at least come to an end if</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.239" end="00:02:58.330" style="s2">not the whole of our being but the ego</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.040" end="00:03:02.480" style="s2">at least comes to an end it stops its</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.330" end="00:03:04.940" style="s2">oblivion so end is nothingness right for</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.480" end="00:03:12.739" style="s2">something to end it must actually stop</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.940" end="00:03:17.799" style="s2">and become nothing the end is an</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.739" end="00:03:17.799" style="s2">absolute negation of what came before</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.310" end="00:03:26.200" style="s2">maybe an end can just be a disruption a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.209" end="00:03:26.200" style="s2">space to start something new</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.060" end="00:03:36.890" style="s2">potentially every closing of the eyes</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.260" end="00:03:41.049" style="s2">that happens automatically is the end of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.890" end="00:03:41.049" style="s2">that vision of the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.940" end="00:03:55.100" style="s2">every time I open my eyes again</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.590" end="00:03:57.680" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing something new like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.100" end="00:04:00.790" style="s2">heartbeat new beginnings with every end</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.680" end="00:04:02.849" style="s2">of the closure of the eyelids</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.790" end="00:04:02.849" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.390" end="00:04:15.420" style="s2">so why even have this notion of endings</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.049" end="00:04:19.530" style="s2">if it is in fact just the new beginning</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.420" end="00:04:24.060" style="s2">why even have this notion of endings why</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.530" end="00:04:29.340" style="s2">is it not a a new becoming or something</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.060" end="00:04:31.800" style="s2">like that it&#39;s a it&#39;s is the more this</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.340" end="00:04:37.259" style="s2">goes on the more I&#39;m actually troubled</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.800" end="00:04:39.449" style="s2">by the very concept of end itself why do</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.259" end="00:04:43.039" style="s2">we even have this concept in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.449" end="00:04:46.349" style="s2">language because it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.039" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">transformation is there is is is is</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.349" end="00:04:50.550" style="s2">actually what&#39;s going on here right is</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:54.509" style="s2">not an ending it&#39;s just a stage it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.550" end="00:04:56.070" style="s2">just a step on the road and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.509" end="00:04:58.590" style="s2">what&#39;s what starts to feel really</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.070" end="00:05:02.060" style="s2">interesting is why we even have this</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.590" end="00:05:05.729" style="s2">concept in our language if it bears no</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.060" end="00:05:16.039" style="s2">connection to what actually happens in</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.729" end="00:05:18.940" style="s2">reality death maybe marks our</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.039" end="00:05:23.580" style="s2">susceptibility to</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.940" end="00:05:26.200" style="s2">permanence of ending especially in</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.580" end="00:05:31.930" style="s2">sanitized societies where death is</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.200" end="00:05:39.280" style="s2">something so distant and yet to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.930" end="00:05:43.900" style="s2">feared I am the end in language when</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.280" end="00:05:47.800" style="s2">language is a very binary the human</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.900" end="00:05:51.910" style="s2">brain has a binary need or at least a</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.800" end="00:05:53.890" style="s2">categorical need so binary is easily</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.910" end="00:05:57.340" style="s2">accomplish that so we have beginning and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.890" end="00:06:00.100" style="s2">end but as soon as we get into</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.340" end="00:06:04.330" style="s2">complexity those binary is often break</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.100" end="00:06:07.810" style="s2">down and become symbiotic so it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.330" end="00:06:14.560" style="s2">interesting why the end is so prevalent</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.810" end="00:06:20.350" style="s2">in language mmm it occurs that the end</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.560" end="00:06:22.780" style="s2">of things makes more sense if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.350" end="00:06:25.180" style="s2">restrict yourself to the physical realm</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.780" end="00:06:27.220" style="s2">you can have the end of a road right you</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.180" end="00:06:30.220" style="s2">can have the end of a room the end of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.220" end="00:06:32.230" style="s2">room is marked by a wall or a door you</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.220" end="00:06:35.440" style="s2">know the end of the road is if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.230" end="00:06:37.810" style="s2">just no more Road right and so in in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.440" end="00:06:40.120" style="s2">physical world I think it possibly can</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.810" end="00:06:42.910" style="s2">reach it so maybe the end is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.120" end="00:06:46.450" style="s2">boundary between what is manifest and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.910" end="00:06:49.480" style="s2">what is yet to be manifest right and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.450" end="00:06:50.919" style="s2">it is it is potentially transformative</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.480" end="00:06:52.600" style="s2">because there is always more coming</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.919" end="00:06:59.750" style="s2">there is always a future about to arrive</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.600" end="00:07:01.070" style="s2">and yet yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.750" end="00:07:02.870" style="s2">there&#39;s something that you could build</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.070" end="00:07:05.300" style="s2">more Road right so it&#39;s not the end of</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.870" end="00:07:06.170" style="s2">the road in a permanent sense but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.300" end="00:07:17.750" style="s2">the end of the right it hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.170" end="00:07:21.820" style="s2">built yet which raises the idea of what</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.750" end="00:07:27.980" style="s2">about ends that happen in our minds</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.820" end="00:07:32.960" style="s2">beliefs the end ideologies that and no</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.980" end="00:07:35.440" style="s2">longer ascribe T and religions that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.960" end="00:07:35.440" style="s2">lost</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.300" end="00:07:46.320" style="s2">identities that are reforged and</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.900" end="00:07:46.320" style="s2">rebirthed so the old identity ends</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.390" end="00:07:55.790" style="s2">again there&#39;s this need in the word for</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.210" end="00:07:59.240" style="s2">end to make it a very clear-cut divide</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.790" end="00:08:03.360" style="s2">before and after whereas usually</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.240" end="00:08:08.550" style="s2">transitions are not dumps there is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.360" end="00:08:10.350" style="s2">zeitgeist that leads up to them it&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.550" end="00:08:13.140" style="s2">it feels as though all of those examples</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.350" end="00:08:16.290" style="s2">of religions and personal transformation</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.140" end="00:08:21.270" style="s2">and changes of ideology and shifts in</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.290" end="00:08:26.060" style="s2">paradigm they are transformations then</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.270" end="00:08:28.890" style="s2">they&#39;re not you know that the the new</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.060" end="00:08:31.410" style="s2">personality is built on top of the old</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.890" end="00:08:33.810" style="s2">one you know it&#39;s not a complete it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.410" end="00:08:35.669" style="s2">not like the old one has been completely</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.810" end="00:08:37.770" style="s2">pushed away and an entirely new one has</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.669" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">been inserted it has been transformed</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.770" end="00:08:41.430" style="s2">right healing has taken place</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:43.140" style="s2">transformations taking place deeper</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.430" end="00:08:46.590" style="s2">understanding has taken place more</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.140" end="00:08:48.390" style="s2">embodied sense of being in the world has</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.590" end="00:08:50.700" style="s2">taken place whatever it might be but</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.390" end="00:08:53.820" style="s2">that but it is it is a transformation</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.700" end="00:08:55.890" style="s2">under the and the memory of what was</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.820" end="00:08:57.300" style="s2">before is is still alive so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.890" end="00:08:59.670" style="s2">ended in the sense that it no longer</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.300" end="00:09:02.160" style="s2">exists in any way because there the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.670" end="00:09:04.170" style="s2">access to the feeling of it the access</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.160" end="00:09:14.390" style="s2">to the memory of it is is still there so</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.170" end="00:09:20.130" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not lost to there</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.390" end="00:09:26.670" style="s2">decisiveness of those words and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.130" end="00:09:29.610" style="s2">new attitude a new mode of function so</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.670" end="00:09:34.530" style="s2">if the end is easier to understand in</p>
