<p begin="00:00:00.320" end="00:00:07.839" style="s2">so it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.160" end="00:00:09.840" style="s2">it would be a good thing to</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.839" end="00:00:11.920" style="s2">you know ask you to introduce the notion</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.840" end="00:00:16.160" style="s2">of sivium</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.920" end="00:00:17.440" style="s2">to the kind of interested party that</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.160" end="00:00:21.359" style="s2">might not have heard you discuss it</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.440" end="00:00:23.279" style="s2">before but it&#39;s distinctly aware that</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.359" end="00:00:25.519" style="s2">we need to build differently things are</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.279" end="00:00:28.480" style="s2">changing</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.519" end="00:00:30.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s the kind of person that likes</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.480" end="00:00:31.439" style="s2">to consider themselves well i&#39;m ready</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.720" end="00:00:33.120" style="s2">for change</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.439" end="00:00:35.120" style="s2">you know and i&#39;m willing to and actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.120" end="00:00:38.800" style="s2">i have the means to participate</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.120" end="00:00:40.719" style="s2">in some form i&#39;m willing to</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.800" end="00:00:42.879" style="s2">put in the time to understand i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.719" end="00:00:47.440" style="s2">interested in coming into</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.879" end="00:00:47.440" style="s2">quality interaction interesting</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.600" end="00:00:53.600" style="s2">please so the way i</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.360" end="00:00:54.640" style="s2">i think i maybe will begin is something</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.600" end="00:00:58.320" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.640" end="00:00:59.440" style="s2">at the level of design um perhaps even</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.320" end="00:01:01.359" style="s2">just a bit of a critique</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.440" end="00:01:03.680" style="s2">so we&#39;ve we&#39;ve endeavored we meaning</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.359" end="00:01:05.760" style="s2">humanity have endeavored</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.680" end="00:01:07.600" style="s2">uh of course many times to reinvent the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.760" end="00:01:10.080" style="s2">way that we congregate whether we live</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.600" end="00:01:10.080" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.320" end="00:01:14.159" style="s2">and in the past several centuries have</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.320" end="00:01:14.560" style="s2">done so in ways that are endeavoring to</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.159" end="00:01:16.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.560" end="00:01:17.840" style="s2">to do it in a way that is i would say</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.240" end="00:01:21.680" style="s2">conscious or intentional right</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.840" end="00:01:24.799" style="s2">thoughtful um as opposed to merely</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.680" end="00:01:26.000" style="s2">uh functional which is been the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.799" end="00:01:27.840" style="s2">was the order of the day for a long</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.000" end="00:01:31.520" style="s2">period of time</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.840" end="00:01:31.520" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.600" end="00:01:34.799" style="s2">what i would say is different about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.960" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">notion of civilian is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.799" end="00:01:38.960" style="s2">the the design intent came from the very</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:42.560" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.960" end="00:01:44.720" style="s2">with a proposition that the problem that</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.560" end="00:01:46.960" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.720" end="00:01:47.840" style="s2">is let me just begin by saying rather</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.960" end="00:01:49.600" style="s2">deep</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.840" end="00:01:51.520" style="s2">um and it&#39;s maybe the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.600" end="00:01:53.280" style="s2">civilization itself</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.520" end="00:01:54.960" style="s2">so we&#39;re not just trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.280" end="00:01:55.280" style="s2">how to create sort of a nice place to</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.960" end="00:01:57.280" style="s2">live</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.280" end="00:01:59.280" style="s2">for example or even a place that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.280" end="00:02:02.240" style="s2">ecologically sound</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:04.000" style="s2">because there&#39;s a an awareness of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.240" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">implications and complications</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.000" end="00:02:08.560" style="s2">of the total set of things that we do</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:12.239" style="s2">under the heading of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.560" end="00:02:14.640" style="s2">that need to be considered and that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.239" end="00:02:15.760" style="s2">uh you know the the the effort or the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.640" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">best intentions</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.760" end="00:02:21.120" style="s2">um will tend to be unraveled or</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:22.959" style="s2">uh will fail or sometimes even create</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.120" end="00:02:24.319" style="s2">negative consequences</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.959" end="00:02:25.520" style="s2">in a very micro case if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.319" end="00:02:26.400" style="s2">actually think about the global case as</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.520" end="00:02:28.480" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.400" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s maybe in the very beginning is</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.480" end="00:02:33.599" style="s2">there a way to put your arms around it</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">where the the strength of your design is</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.599" end="00:02:37.519" style="s2">adequate to something that actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">shifts the underlying basis</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.519" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">of the the deeper problem which i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:42.560" style="s2">just write i call the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:44.080" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:45.410" style="s2">another language i will call the problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.080" end="00:02:46.959" style="s2">of game a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.410" end="00:02:50.480" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.959" end="00:02:52.640" style="s2">and therefore is at least in principle</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.480" end="00:02:54.160" style="s2">able able to address that set of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.640" end="00:02:55.519" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.160" end="00:02:58.239" style="s2">effectively and create something which</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.519" end="00:02:58.239" style="s2">is enduring</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.720" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">now it&#39;s really interesting that in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.879" end="00:03:03.440" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:05.680" style="s2">six months i&#39;ve been exposed to the work</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.440" end="00:03:06.879" style="s2">of one of your uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.680" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">somebody who lives near you i think</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.879" end="00:03:11.519" style="s2">actually tyson yonkoporta</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:12.800" style="s2">because he coming from a rather</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.519" end="00:03:14.159" style="s2">different direction</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.800" end="00:03:15.920" style="s2">ended up coming to some very similar</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.159" end="00:03:18.959" style="s2">conclusions and i might be using some of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.920" end="00:03:21.200" style="s2">his ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.959" end="00:03:22.080" style="s2">so the first is the proposition that in</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.200" end="00:03:24.239" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.080" end="00:03:26.000" style="s2">in many ways the problem of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.239" end="00:03:27.920" style="s2">is also the problem of city</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.000" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">that it may in fact be appropriate to</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.920" end="00:03:34.239" style="s2">say that all civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:36.720" style="s2">are merely the sort of actuation</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.239" end="00:03:38.560" style="s2">adjunct of cities so whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.720" end="00:03:39.760" style="s2">talking about roman empire</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.560" end="00:03:41.200" style="s2">or you&#39;re talking about the british</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.760" end="00:03:42.159" style="s2">empire or talking about the american</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.200" end="00:03:44.159" style="s2">empire</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.159" end="00:03:46.159" style="s2">um or i suppose you go backwards and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.159" end="00:03:49.200" style="s2">talk about the city states of greece</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.159" end="00:03:52.000" style="s2">in each case the extended territory</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.200" end="00:03:52.959" style="s2">as significant as it was may in fact be</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.000" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">properly seen</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.959" end="00:03:56.239" style="s2">as being something like the circulatory</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.560" end="00:03:59.200" style="s2">system um</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.239" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">of the city which was at the the essence</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.200" end="00:04:01.519" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">and in the network of cities by the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.519" end="00:04:04.640" style="s2">and this is based from my point of view</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:07.360" style="s2">largely on the work of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.640" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">jeffrey west and louis betancourt which</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.360" end="00:04:13.439" style="s2">popularized in the book scale</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">so that&#39;s a very very interesting notion</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.439" end="00:04:17.600" style="s2">and the next question would be okay why</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:19.600" style="s2">and more specifically what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.600" end="00:04:22.720" style="s2">changes would be the adequate changes</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.600" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">to to shift that and here again</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.720" end="00:04:26.800" style="s2">uh tyson i think is the nail on the head</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:29.040" style="s2">when he makes a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.800" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">between what he calls growth and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.040" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">increase</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:37.199" style="s2">so here the notion is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">again western betancourt they noticed</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.199" end="00:04:41.199" style="s2">that cities have a unique</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.880" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">scaling characteristic i wish to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.199" end="00:04:45.120" style="s2">that as a city</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:47.360" style="s2">grows certain metrics uh like for</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.120" end="00:04:50.080" style="s2">example wealth per capita</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.360" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">grow in a very unusual way generally</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.080" end="00:04:54.160" style="s2">speaking in nature</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:55.600" style="s2">what we see is that when an organism and</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.160" end="00:04:58.160" style="s2">that might include say like an ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.600" end="00:05:00.000" style="s2">like a forest or a part of what we might</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.160" end="00:05:03.520" style="s2">consider an organism like a cell</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.000" end="00:05:07.840" style="s2">as as the as the organism grows uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.520" end="00:05:11.039" style="s2">most of the relevant characteristics um</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.840" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">grow on what&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.039" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">sublinear scaling so what this means is</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:17.919" style="s2">for example if i take a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:18.880" style="s2">mouse and i look at the rate of</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.919" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">metabolism</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.880" end="00:05:23.199" style="s2">per unit mass meaning how much energy is</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.199" end="00:05:26.479" style="s2">cycling through the organism</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.199" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">for the total mass in grams if i</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.479" end="00:05:30.160" style="s2">increase the mass the actual metabolism</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:33.120" style="s2">only increases</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.160" end="00:05:34.240" style="s2">at about 85 percent so if i double the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.120" end="00:05:35.919" style="s2">mass</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.240" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">instead of the metabolism doubling it</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.919" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">only increases by 85 percent</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:41.520" style="s2">which is to say that there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:43.680" style="s2">efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.520" end="00:05:47.759" style="s2">built in and also certain limitations to</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.680" end="00:05:47.759" style="s2">scale built in to biological organisms</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.840" end="00:05:51.120" style="s2">and this is common across all living</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.520" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">organisms and in fact common across</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.120" end="00:05:54.240" style="s2">human organisms as well like</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:55.440" style="s2">corporations have a similar scaling</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.240" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">factor if i double the number of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.440" end="00:05:59.440" style="s2">employees in a company</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.560" end="00:06:00.639" style="s2">i actually don&#39;t double the uh revenue</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.440" end="00:06:03.039" style="s2">per employee i actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.639" end="00:06:04.639" style="s2">tend to it tends to increase i&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.039" end="00:06:06.880" style="s2">decrease per employee</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.639" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">but cities behave differently uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.880" end="00:06:09.440" style="s2">bettencourt</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.680" end="00:06:11.039" style="s2">and uh west discovered that they</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.440" end="00:06:11.919" style="s2">actually increased super linear which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.039" end="00:06:14.960" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.919" end="00:06:17.199" style="s2">if i double the size of the city</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.960" end="00:06:19.199" style="s2">and by the way in some sense hold</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.199" end="00:06:22.479" style="s2">everything else constant</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.199" end="00:06:25.600" style="s2">i will actually get a uh 115</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.479" end="00:06:29.120" style="s2">increase of the wealth per capita</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.600" end="00:06:31.039" style="s2">or in income per capita if you prefer</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.120" end="00:06:33.039" style="s2">now that&#39;s actually a super super</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.039" end="00:06:35.440" style="s2">powerful discovery</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.039" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">um and one of the characteristics so now</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.440" end="00:06:40.000" style="s2">i&#39;m kind of going off on my own</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:41.520" style="s2">um uh what&#39;s that called i&#39;m walking my</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.000" end="00:06:44.160" style="s2">own plank now</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.520" end="00:06:44.800" style="s2">so what what i would propose is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.160" end="00:06:46.479" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.800" end="00:06:49.120" style="s2">creates that makes the city a certain</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.479" end="00:06:52.000" style="s2">kind of a growth attractor</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.120" end="00:06:53.360" style="s2">what the city has been trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.000" end="00:06:54.800" style="s2">throughout history since we discovered</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.360" end="00:06:56.639" style="s2">the construct of the city</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.800" end="00:06:59.759" style="s2">has been to grow to put as many people</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.639" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">as possible in the city as it can get</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.759" end="00:07:04.240" style="s2">and sort of every problem context</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:05.840" style="s2">of cities and therefore every problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.240" end="00:07:07.199" style="s2">context of civilizations that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.840" end="00:07:09.280" style="s2">attached to them</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.199" end="00:07:12.560" style="s2">has to do with the constraints on that</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:14.479" style="s2">ability so for example if i put</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.560" end="00:07:15.599" style="s2">say a million people in a city i have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.479" end="00:07:16.880" style="s2">feed a million people</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.599" end="00:07:19.280" style="s2">and if the only way that i can feed</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.880" end="00:07:21.440" style="s2">people is by hauling uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.280" end="00:07:23.440" style="s2">wheat in uh on people&#39;s shoulders and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.440" end="00:07:24.800" style="s2">bags i can&#39;t pull that off very easily</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.440" end="00:07:27.199" style="s2">that&#39;s hard to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.800" end="00:07:28.639" style="s2">more or less impossible so i have to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.199" end="00:07:30.639" style="s2">things like invent roads</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">or invent barges right so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:35.039" style="s2">ratio a relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.880" end="00:07:36.720" style="s2">on the one hand the physical constraints</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.039" end="00:07:37.520" style="s2">that are associated with squeezing human</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.720" end="00:07:39.599" style="s2">bodies into</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.520" end="00:07:41.440" style="s2">physical space in terms of largely</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.599" end="00:07:44.080" style="s2">energy coming in and waste going out</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.440" end="00:07:45.440" style="s2">but also what they need to do other</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:46.879" style="s2">things like meet other people and move</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.440" end="00:07:48.000" style="s2">around in the space transportation and</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.879" end="00:07:50.080" style="s2">whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.000" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">the technological capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.080" end="00:07:54.479" style="s2">environment that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.840" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">um and then the the limitations to scale</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.479" end="00:07:56.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">are possible right so effectively every</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.960" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">city is is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:02.080" style="s2">to solve that problem and what again</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:05.919" style="s2">what west tibetan court</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.080" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">found was that there was a a a moment</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.919" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">where the city would tend to</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:10.879" style="s2">grow up to the limits of the existing</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:13.919" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.879" end="00:08:16.560" style="s2">but remember because as cities</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.919" end="00:08:17.840" style="s2">grow the actual certain characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.560" end="00:08:18.319" style="s2">increase super linearly well one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.840" end="00:08:19.759" style="s2">those in</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.319" end="00:08:21.680" style="s2">those characteristics is actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.759" end="00:08:23.919" style="s2">innovation so</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.680" end="00:08:24.720" style="s2">as the cities would grow in uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.919" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.720" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">the innovation of that particular city</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:29.280" style="s2">and therefore that civilization would</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:30.639" style="s2">actually tend to also go</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.280" end="00:08:32.320" style="s2">super linearly so you get these</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.639" end="00:08:33.599" style="s2">explosions of innovation</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.320" end="00:08:35.599" style="s2">which would tend to cluster around</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.599" end="00:08:36.800" style="s2">constraints to growth um and so you</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.599" end="00:08:38.240" style="s2">would tend to get these step functions</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.800" end="00:08:39.440" style="s2">where they would actually pulse and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.240" end="00:08:40.560" style="s2">of course you get things that were much</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.440" end="00:08:42.959" style="s2">much larger</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.560" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">than had previously existed in the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.959" end="00:08:45.519" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:46.800" style="s2">around them you know like the the first</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.519" end="00:08:49.839" style="s2">cities you know er and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.800" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">and cod and places like that until</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.839" end="00:08:52.880" style="s2">eventually they do peter out</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:55.600" style="s2">and something happens which limits their</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.880" end="00:08:59.360" style="s2">capacity to grow whoops i lost you</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.600" end="00:08:59.360" style="s2">okay yeah keep going i&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.760" end="00:09:06.240" style="s2">so this this this um</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.880" end="00:09:09.440" style="s2">this sort of mammon desire to</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.240" end="00:09:12.160" style="s2">to grow at all costs and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.440" end="00:09:13.120" style="s2">kind of the imperial organization of all</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.160" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.120" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">and to some extent all time as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:19.440" style="s2">subsidiary function to feed the growth</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:20.800" style="s2">of the city</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.440" end="00:09:23.920" style="s2">is a really interesting way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.800" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">about what&#39;s the problem of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.920" end="00:09:27.519" style="s2">everything ultimately becomes a feed</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.480" end="00:09:30.880" style="s2">stock</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.519" end="00:09:33.519" style="s2">every small town exists largely</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.880" end="00:09:35.680" style="s2">as a consequence of its context in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.519" end="00:09:36.240" style="s2">relationship to the capacity of it to</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.680" end="00:09:38.480" style="s2">serve</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.240" end="00:09:39.519" style="s2">as a way of feeding the growth of the of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.480" end="00:09:41.120" style="s2">the city</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.519" end="00:09:42.160" style="s2">all the way up the chain to the largest</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.120" end="00:09:44.480" style="s2">cities and ultimately i guess</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.160" end="00:09:50.240" style="s2">megalopolises and conservations that</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.480" end="00:09:52.320" style="s2">are now dominate our landscape okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.240" end="00:09:53.680" style="s2">so then and then what tyson does is he</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.320" end="00:09:55.519" style="s2">he presents an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.680" end="00:09:57.200" style="s2">and and he specifically presents an</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.519" end="00:10:00.399" style="s2">alternative that was real</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.200" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">in the context of the uh indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.399" end="00:10:07.040" style="s2">uh human groups which he calls</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:08.480" style="s2">increase and i i love his metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.040" end="00:10:12.160" style="s2">actually he says okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.480" end="00:10:14.000" style="s2">if i want to uh increase or or</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.160" end="00:10:16.240" style="s2">improve let&#39;s just go with a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.000" end="00:10:18.959" style="s2">metric uh iq</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:20.560" style="s2">in a human um broadly speaking there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.959" end="00:10:23.600" style="s2">two things i might do</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.560" end="00:10:25.200" style="s2">i could grow the number of neurons i</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.600" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">could just make it a larger brain it can</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.200" end="00:10:27.440" style="s2">take a brain that weighs</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:29.519" style="s2">10 kilograms and make it a brain that</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.440" end="00:10:33.920" style="s2">weighs 15 kilograms</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.519" end="00:10:35.920" style="s2">um or i could increase the quality</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.920" end="00:10:37.040" style="s2">of the brain i could increase the not</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.920" end="00:10:39.839" style="s2">just the number of</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.040" end="00:10:41.680" style="s2">of neural connections uh the synapses</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.839" end="00:10:43.120" style="s2">inside but also the quality which ones</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.680" end="00:10:44.839" style="s2">specifically are networking with which</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.120" end="00:10:47.519" style="s2">ones are the network</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.839" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">topology um and</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.519" end="00:10:50.399" style="s2">what i love about that metaphor is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:51.440" style="s2">it&#39;s real right human beings actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.399" end="00:10:53.360" style="s2">ran into a limit</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.440" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">on how rapidly or how big we could get</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.360" end="00:10:57.519" style="s2">our brains because of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:10:58.880" style="s2">birth canal and so we ran into that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.519" end="00:11:00.800" style="s2">limit we were</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.880" end="00:11:02.560" style="s2">evolution was forced to find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.800" end="00:11:06.079" style="s2">continue to increase our</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.560" end="00:11:08.880" style="s2">our cognitive capacities by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.079" end="00:11:08.880" style="s2">increase meaning</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.279" end="00:11:12.320" style="s2">if you think about development these</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.640" end="00:11:13.519" style="s2">processes of development the brain will</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.320" end="00:11:14.320" style="s2">actually create a huge number of</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.519" end="00:11:16.000" style="s2">connections</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.320" end="00:11:18.640" style="s2">then prune the hell of them then you</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.000" end="00:11:22.399" style="s2">know increase again all focusing on not</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.640" end="00:11:24.240" style="s2">more neurons but on better connections</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.399" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">okay well that&#39;s nice that that&#39;s a move</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.240" end="00:11:27.279" style="s2">right so the move is to say okay we need</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:29.920" style="s2">to find a way to move away from</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.279" end="00:11:32.000" style="s2">growth as a mandate and move towards</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.920" end="00:11:35.200" style="s2">increases a mandate</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.000" end="00:11:37.760" style="s2">so that&#39;s one key premise of sibium</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.200" end="00:11:39.279" style="s2">right first creep premise is we need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.760" end="00:11:40.560" style="s2">find a way to move away from the city</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.279" end="00:11:42.320" style="s2">and all the characteristics that make</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.560" end="00:11:43.600" style="s2">the city of the city</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.320" end="00:11:45.680" style="s2">and the second is our one of those</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.600" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">characteristics is this uh notion of</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.680" end="00:11:47.920" style="s2">growth and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:49.920" style="s2">thing that is the right thing is</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.920" end="00:11:50.880" style="s2">increase quality quality of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.920" end="00:11:53.200" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.880" end="00:11:54.160" style="s2">specifically and you can think about</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.200" end="00:11:56.639" style="s2">that quite practically</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.160" end="00:11:57.440" style="s2">and if i&#39;m moving into a city from a</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.639" end="00:11:58.639" style="s2">small town</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.440" end="00:12:01.519" style="s2">and i&#39;m moving into a city of say a</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.639" end="00:12:03.279" style="s2">million people how big is melbourne</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.519" end="00:12:04.560" style="s2">i think about three million ish give or</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.279" end="00:12:06.720" style="s2">take a million</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.560" end="00:12:08.639" style="s2">so i&#39;m moving from a town of about 100 a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.720" end="00:12:10.560" style="s2">small city of 150 000</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.639" end="00:12:12.079" style="s2">and i moved to melbourne part of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.560" end="00:12:15.200" style="s2">point part of the attraction</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:17.920" style="s2">is there&#39;s just a much larger potential</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.200" end="00:12:19.519" style="s2">of relationships there&#39;s the likelihood</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.920" end="00:12:20.720" style="s2">that i will be able to find people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.519" end="00:12:22.399" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.720" end="00:12:24.160" style="s2">high quality relationships for me they</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.399" end="00:12:26.880" style="s2">have similar tastes or</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.160" end="00:12:27.519" style="s2">interests or whatever it&#39;s just a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.880" end="00:12:30.560" style="s2">larger</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.519" end="00:12:34.320" style="s2">by this case two orders of magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.560" end="00:12:35.920" style="s2">um okay that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.320" end="00:12:36.959" style="s2">but it also has real problem which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.920" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">well there&#39;s three million</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.959" end="00:12:39.760" style="s2">people and the reality is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:41.279" style="s2">only ever going to meet a small fraction</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.760" end="00:12:42.639" style="s2">of them and only ever</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.279" end="00:12:45.440" style="s2">going to be in relationship with an even</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.639" end="00:12:47.360" style="s2">smaller fraction so beyond a certain</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.440" end="00:12:50.720" style="s2">small number which is around 150</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.360" end="00:12:51.600" style="s2">000 people or so the bigger problem is</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.720" end="00:12:53.920" style="s2">actually search</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.600" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not math right you don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.920" end="00:12:57.360" style="s2">need to think about like the internet</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:12:58.800" style="s2">the internet is vast i don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.360" end="00:13:00.720" style="s2">have a bigger internet what i need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.800" end="00:13:02.000" style="s2">have is a better way of finding the one</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.720" end="00:13:05.279" style="s2">the aspects of the internet that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.000" end="00:13:06.639" style="s2">relevant to me and by the way now</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.279" end="00:13:08.399" style="s2">so that&#39;s another piece right we start</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.639" end="00:13:09.200" style="s2">thinking about increase or something</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.399" end="00:13:11.279" style="s2">about quality</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.200" end="00:13:12.320" style="s2">and we start thinking about oh okay well</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.279" end="00:13:15.279" style="s2">the move is to say</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.320" end="00:13:16.639" style="s2">how do i move away from just adding more</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.279" end="00:13:18.399" style="s2">nodes to the graph</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.639" end="00:13:20.399" style="s2">and move towards getting better and</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.399" end="00:13:23.519" style="s2">better and better at finding</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.399" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">the right relationships okay when i look</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.519" end="00:13:25.440" style="s2">at the right relationships it seems</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:28.880" style="s2">there&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.440" end="00:13:32.320" style="s2">primary characteristics uh one</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.880" end="00:13:34.320" style="s2">is who so</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.320" end="00:13:35.600" style="s2">that&#39;s the easiest right like right now</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.320" end="00:13:38.160" style="s2">who should i be talking to you right now</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.600" end="00:13:41.199" style="s2">or should i be talking to someone else</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.160" end="00:13:42.800" style="s2">um the second is what right as we began</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.199" end="00:13:44.399" style="s2">the conversation there&#39;s a very large</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.800" end="00:13:46.800" style="s2">number of possible things that we could</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.399" end="00:13:48.480" style="s2">have in our relationship and being able</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.800" end="00:13:51.199" style="s2">to orient on that what quickly</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.480" end="00:13:52.079" style="s2">and well is a is a thing and then in</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.199" end="00:13:54.399" style="s2">some sense how</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.079" end="00:13:55.199" style="s2">and and how largely has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.399" end="00:13:57.279" style="s2">skillfulness</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.199" end="00:13:58.560" style="s2">on both of our parts to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.279" end="00:14:01.760" style="s2">relationship how</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.560" end="00:14:04.079" style="s2">deeply fully uh how intimately um</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.760" end="00:14:05.839" style="s2">how sustainably how resiliently how</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.079" end="00:14:07.760" style="s2">anti-fragile can we actually make the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.839" end="00:14:10.880" style="s2">relationship itself</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.760" end="00:14:14.560" style="s2">um in some sense that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.880" end="00:14:16.399" style="s2">right so then let me make another move</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.560" end="00:14:18.639" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s probably well i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.399" end="00:14:19.760" style="s2">stop for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.639" end="00:14:21.040" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna break that promise i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.760" end="00:14:22.639" style="s2">things are pouring in from the back of</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.040" end="00:14:25.120" style="s2">my head right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.639" end="00:14:26.639" style="s2">um so the next move is uh is an insight</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.120" end="00:14:28.560" style="s2">that that i had recently</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.639" end="00:14:29.760" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s right so i&#39;ll put it</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.560" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">out there i&#39;ve already put it in a video</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.760" end="00:14:33.040" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:35.279" style="s2">i&#39;ll put it here as well um one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.040" end="00:14:37.920" style="s2">things that has been</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.279" end="00:14:40.000" style="s2">constraining the possibility of ciphium</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.920" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">up until very recently</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.000" end="00:14:49.040" style="s2">is the the obligate</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">binding of the virtual with the physical</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.040" end="00:14:53.440" style="s2">so when i look at that that super linear</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.000" end="00:14:55.040" style="s2">scaling</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.440" end="00:14:56.320" style="s2">and i look at it very closely this</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.040" end="00:14:59.120" style="s2">notion of trying to squeeze as many</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.320" end="00:15:01.360" style="s2">bodies into the same space as possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.120" end="00:15:02.800" style="s2">what i notice is that the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.360" end="00:15:06.480" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.800" end="00:15:09.120" style="s2">looking to be connected is not bodies</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.480" end="00:15:10.720" style="s2">it&#39;s minds the real thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.120" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">actually driving</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:15.279" style="s2">growth is mines more mines metcalfe&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:17.760" style="s2">law specifically</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.279" end="00:15:19.279" style="s2">uh it&#39;s communication is the governing</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.760" end="00:15:20.880" style="s2">protocol and the reason why cities are</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.279" end="00:15:22.160" style="s2">cities is because up until very recently</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.880" end="00:15:24.639" style="s2">the only way we could communicate was to</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.160" end="00:15:26.800" style="s2">be in person</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.639" end="00:15:28.480" style="s2">and even still relatively until like i</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.800" end="00:15:30.560" style="s2">guess we had kobit</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.480" end="00:15:32.320" style="s2">um the bandwidth of communication right</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.560" end="00:15:32.639" style="s2">interpersonal and body communication</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.320" end="00:15:35.120" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.639" end="00:15:36.320" style="s2">dwarfed radically dwarfed the bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.120" end="00:15:38.399" style="s2">of telecommunication</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.320" end="00:15:39.360" style="s2">but take the clock back 250 years and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.399" end="00:15:40.639" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.360" end="00:15:42.000" style="s2">obvious that if you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.639" end="00:15:42.480" style="s2">communicate with other people you had to</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.000" end="00:15:46.240" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.480" end="00:15:48.800" style="s2">in the same room more or less um</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.240" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">so if communication between minds is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.800" end="00:15:52.800" style="s2">thing that wants to</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.839" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">increase that sorry wants to grow to all</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.800" end="00:15:57.920" style="s2">right it wants to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:59.920" style="s2">everyone at least in potential um</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:16:02.160" style="s2">okay i get it and so the city has been</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.920" end="00:16:04.880" style="s2">in kind of like dragging bodies along</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.160" end="00:16:06.399" style="s2">trying to get minds into connection and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.880" end="00:16:08.480" style="s2">having to deal with the fact these minds</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.399" end="00:16:10.399" style="s2">are connected to bodies but nowadays</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.480" end="00:16:12.639" style="s2">this is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.399" end="00:16:13.759" style="s2">i don&#39;t think a primary constraint as we</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.639" end="00:16:14.880" style="s2">see in this call</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.759" end="00:16:16.240" style="s2">you and i are not in the same room and</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.880" end="00:16:17.120" style="s2">yet we&#39;re having a conversation we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.240" end="00:16:19.279" style="s2">communicating</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.120" end="00:16:20.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s not bad right it&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.279" end="00:16:22.800" style="s2">the same as being in the same room but</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.560" end="00:16:24.079" style="s2">it&#39;s not bad and i</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.800" end="00:16:25.440" style="s2">suspect on the one hand we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.079" end="00:16:26.079" style="s2">better at it because we&#39;ve been forced</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.440" end="00:16:28.160" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.079" end="00:16:29.519" style="s2">by curfew and whatnot and on the other</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.160" end="00:16:31.759" style="s2">hand i think we can continue to get</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.519" end="00:16:34.800" style="s2">better at it with things like</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.759" end="00:16:36.720" style="s2">photorealistic immersive vr for example</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.800" end="00:16:38.959" style="s2">creating possibilities of increasing</p>

<p begin="00:16:38.959" end="00:16:41.839" style="s2">i&#39;m going to put a flag there by the way</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.399" end="00:16:42.240" style="s2">because that of course can be a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.839" end="00:16:44.320" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.240" end="00:16:45.600" style="s2">but we&#39;re now walking the razor&#39;s edge</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.320" end="00:16:46.720" style="s2">between terrible things and awesome</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.600" end="00:16:48.480" style="s2">things i don&#39;t think there&#39;s a way for</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.720" end="00:16:50.560" style="s2">us to step forward without having</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.480" end="00:16:52.639" style="s2">both sides of the razor&#39;s edge in every</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.560" end="00:16:55.839" style="s2">step</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.639" end="00:16:58.399" style="s2">so what we can do now is we can decouple</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.839" end="00:16:59.839" style="s2">the virtual from the physical and we can</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.399" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">render into the virtual what is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.839" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">virtual</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">and now of course be liberated to render</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:06.319" style="s2">into the physical what is physical</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:08.160" style="s2">and rediscover in the physical what</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.319" end="00:17:11.679" style="s2">tyson&#39;s been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.160" end="00:17:14.319" style="s2">the the more natural humane human scale</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.679" end="00:17:15.520" style="s2">ways of life that are in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.319" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.520" end="00:17:20.559" style="s2">having really high quality face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:22.959" style="s2">interactions at the dunbar level</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.559" end="00:17:25.520" style="s2">with other human beings frankly who we</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.959" end="00:17:29.200" style="s2">may spend large amounts of time with</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.520" end="00:17:31.280" style="s2">a real deep woven community</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.200" end="00:17:33.120" style="s2">and by the way with nature really</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.280" end="00:17:35.919" style="s2">descaling the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.120" end="00:17:36.480" style="s2">uh these massively densified locations</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.919" end="00:17:39.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">separate us from nature and finding ways</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.200" end="00:17:41.440" style="s2">to live lightly with nature and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:42.160" style="s2">going to flag that as well this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.440" end="00:17:43.440" style="s2">non-trivial</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.160" end="00:17:45.520" style="s2">in fact if we want we can double click</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.440" end="00:17:48.880" style="s2">on it because it&#39;s a it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.520" end="00:17:50.400" style="s2">point of contention to be frank</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.880" end="00:17:52.000" style="s2">but then you&#39;ve got a really powerful</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.400" end="00:17:55.200" style="s2">new combo right</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.000" end="00:17:56.400" style="s2">a situation where there&#39;s a virtual and</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.200" end="00:17:57.760" style="s2">the virtual civilian</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.400" end="00:17:59.200" style="s2">is everything right so think of it as</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.760" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">the thing beyond facebook and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.200" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">radically better</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:03.200" style="s2">i designed from the very beginning to</p>

<p begin="00:18:03.200" end="00:18:07.679" style="s2">but where everyone all minds at least</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.600" end="00:18:10.320" style="s2">all those who choose to be there</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.679" end="00:18:11.440" style="s2">can be so it truly is a global community</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.320" end="00:18:12.799" style="s2">of minds</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.440" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">and that&#39;s it once you&#39;ve hit that there</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.799" end="00:18:16.799" style="s2">is no more to go right all minds at</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:18.640" style="s2">least in principle have the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.799" end="00:18:21.280" style="s2">of being in connection with each other</p>
