<p begin="00:00:32.730" end="00:00:39.660" style="s2">been postponed for the SpaceX Dragon</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.530" end="00:00:41.100" style="s2">launch that just took place I must say I</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.660" end="00:00:43.559" style="s2">had forgotten that it was taking place</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.100" end="00:00:44.309" style="s2">because we had rioting here in Portland</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.559" end="00:00:48.239" style="s2">last night</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.309" end="00:00:50.879" style="s2">Zach and I went down to see the damage</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.239" end="00:00:52.710" style="s2">ourselves this morning and by the time I</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.879" end="00:00:54.870" style="s2">got back it had slipped my mind that</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.710" end="00:00:57.739" style="s2">they were going to launch but in</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.870" end="00:01:01.649" style="s2">catching up on that launch I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.739" end="00:01:05.840" style="s2">reminded that this moment in history has</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.649" end="00:01:09.840" style="s2">many odd echoes to approximately the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.840" end="00:01:13.170" style="s2">year of Heather and my birth we were</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:15.710" style="s2">both born in 1969 that is of course the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.170" end="00:01:19.439" style="s2">year that men first landed on the moon</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.710" end="00:01:22.979" style="s2">it is also the year of the Summer of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.439" end="00:01:26.369" style="s2">Love and the juxtaposition</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.979" end="00:01:28.170" style="s2">I think suggests a great many things</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.369" end="00:01:30.509" style="s2">that are worth investigating</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.170" end="00:01:32.790" style="s2">there was a tremendous amount of unrest</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.509" end="00:01:35.729" style="s2">at that time surrounding the Vietnam War</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.790" end="00:01:38.280" style="s2">among other things there was obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.729" end="00:01:40.740" style="s2">great deal of racial tension there was</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.280" end="00:01:42.780" style="s2">hopefulness that arose out of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.740" end="00:01:48.390" style="s2">ability of human beings to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.780" end="00:01:50.810" style="s2">moon and back safely and I also realized</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.390" end="00:01:55.049" style="s2">moments before going on the air that</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.810" end="00:01:57.049" style="s2">1968 was the year of the Hong Kong flu a</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.049" end="00:01:59.909" style="s2">serious flu pandemic so there were many</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.049" end="00:02:02.159" style="s2">echoes of our current situation back</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.909" end="00:02:05.009" style="s2">then and I will say on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:08.099" style="s2">that&#39;s hopeful because we got through</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.009" end="00:02:10.649" style="s2">that on the other hand I think this time</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.099" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">we might be in quite a bit deeper there</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.649" end="00:02:13.590" style="s2">are things that haunt our landscape that</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:17.940" style="s2">did not</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.590" end="00:02:20.819" style="s2">exist in 1968 and 1969 we were not all</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.940" end="00:02:22.980" style="s2">in the sway of algorithms that we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.819" end="00:02:25.260" style="s2">check and that have unknown influence</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.980" end="00:02:29.310" style="s2">over our thinking and the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.260" end="00:02:33.390" style="s2">interact and I am quite concerned that</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.310" end="00:02:35.430" style="s2">even given similar ingredients that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.390" end="00:02:39.690" style="s2">are in a great deal more danger this</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.430" end="00:02:42.989" style="s2">time around our election looming also</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.690" end="00:02:47.790" style="s2">adds a a certain amount of pressure to</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.989" end="00:02:49.860" style="s2">the mix that could end very badly so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.790" end="00:02:52.440" style="s2">had several things I wanted to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.860" end="00:02:53.849" style="s2">today to be honest they interact in so</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.440" end="00:02:56.599" style="s2">many different ways that I&#39;m not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.849" end="00:03:00.360" style="s2">sure where to begin</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.599" end="00:03:03.150" style="s2">obviously the riots that have followed</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.360" end="00:03:05.640" style="s2">the death of George Floyd which happened</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.150" end="00:03:09.180" style="s2">very dramatically on videotape which</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.640" end="00:03:10.879" style="s2">presumably everyone has seen those riots</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.180" end="00:03:17.420" style="s2">now having spread across the country</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.879" end="00:03:20.579" style="s2">including here to Portland are a major</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.420" end="00:03:23.190" style="s2">phenomenon what kind of phenomenon they</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.579" end="00:03:25.350" style="s2">are is I think up for debate and in some</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.190" end="00:03:27.870" style="s2">sense the feeling I am getting having</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.350" end="00:03:30.299" style="s2">seen the damage today and seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.870" end="00:03:31.470" style="s2">has come across my Twitter feed tells me</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.299" end="00:03:34.019" style="s2">that they may actually be several</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.470" end="00:03:35.220" style="s2">different phenomena interacting I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.019" end="00:03:38.340" style="s2">think they&#39;re going to interact in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.220" end="00:03:39.930" style="s2">positive way and I&#39;m hoping that we by</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.340" end="00:03:42.780" style="s2">thinking carefully about what we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.930" end="00:03:47.430" style="s2">seeing can disentangle the threads in</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.780" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">time to save ourselves from a noisy</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.430" end="00:03:53.730" style="s2">nightmare alright so let us talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:57.269" style="s2">what has taken place</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.730" end="00:04:00.989" style="s2">George Floyd has been apparently killed</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.269" end="00:04:03.750" style="s2">on videotape by a white police officer</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.989" end="00:04:05.730" style="s2">George Floyd of course was black he was</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.750" end="00:04:07.950" style="s2">killed by a white police officer who</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.730" end="00:04:11.760" style="s2">kneeled on his neck for more than eight</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.950" end="00:04:16.229" style="s2">minutes says he said he couldn&#39;t breathe</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.760" end="00:04:18.599" style="s2">and then apparently stopped breathing</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.229" end="00:04:21.780" style="s2">that on the one hand seems to be a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.599" end="00:04:23.760" style="s2">simple story I think it is transparent</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.780" end="00:04:26.139" style="s2">to anybody who looked at the video that</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.760" end="00:04:29.229" style="s2">something very wrong</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.139" end="00:04:31.689" style="s2">in that moment on the other hand it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.229" end="00:04:34.240" style="s2">very difficult to know what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.689" end="00:04:37.539" style="s2">occurred and one of the concerns that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.240" end="00:04:40.689" style="s2">have is that these protests which have</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.539" end="00:04:43.419" style="s2">now morphed into riots are effectively</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.689" end="00:04:46.210" style="s2">predicated on the fact that we know what</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.419" end="00:04:48.430" style="s2">the story was and if it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.210" end="00:04:49.689" style="s2">we don&#39;t know exactly what the story was</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.430" end="00:04:50.819" style="s2">and there are lots of ways that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.689" end="00:04:56.860" style="s2">could be true</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.819" end="00:04:59.500" style="s2">then we have been moved far down a road</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.860" end="00:05:00.879" style="s2">under some kind of false pretenses now</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.500" end="00:05:02.379" style="s2">again I&#39;m not saying that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.879" end="00:05:05.289" style="s2">case it could be that that video is</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.379" end="00:05:07.509" style="s2">exactly what it appears to be that this</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.289" end="00:05:09.729" style="s2">is a cop who had a race problem and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.509" end="00:05:11.650" style="s2">that race problem resulted in his</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.729" end="00:05:13.629" style="s2">complete indifference to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.650" end="00:05:15.490" style="s2">he was suffocating a man to death who</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.629" end="00:05:18.009" style="s2">died in front of many witnesses and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.490" end="00:05:25.330" style="s2">other cops and the other cops did</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.009" end="00:05:30.339" style="s2">nothing but we also live in America and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.330" end="00:05:32.710" style="s2">in America this cop is do a fair trial</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.339" end="00:05:35.110" style="s2">in fact if his punishment is to mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.710" end="00:05:39.129" style="s2">anything it has to follow a fair trial</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.110" end="00:05:41.589" style="s2">and the the way that this has unfolded</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.129" end="00:05:43.509" style="s2">does raise a question about how any fair</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.589" end="00:05:45.460" style="s2">trial could possibly happen because at</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.509" end="00:05:49.810" style="s2">some level the violence that has</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.460" end="00:05:52.990" style="s2">unfolded already will be reinvigorated</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.810" end="00:05:55.479" style="s2">if any result other than a full</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.990" end="00:05:58.330" style="s2">conviction on the maximum charges occurs</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.479" end="00:06:00.009" style="s2">but and in fact the protesters have</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.330" end="00:06:02.080" style="s2">demanded that the charges that have been</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.009" end="00:06:04.180" style="s2">leveled which as I understand it are</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.080" end="00:06:07.810" style="s2">third-degree murder and manslaughter are</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.180" end="00:06:09.759" style="s2">not sufficient on the other hand in</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.810" end="00:06:11.229" style="s2">order to convict him of something like</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.759" end="00:06:13.210" style="s2">first-degree murder you would have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.229" end="00:06:16.500" style="s2">show something like intent and as</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.210" end="00:06:19.719" style="s2">terrible as what is on those videos is</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.500" end="00:06:24.430" style="s2">the definition of intent as the law sees</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.719" end="00:06:26.919" style="s2">it is narrowly defined and did he intend</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.430" end="00:06:31.240" style="s2">to kill George Floyd hard to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.919" end="00:06:35.050" style="s2">that he did on camera so we are headed</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.240" end="00:06:38.110" style="s2">for a very tense situation as he is</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.050" end="00:06:39.169" style="s2">tried and either convicted of a crime</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.110" end="00:06:41.629" style="s2">many do not</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.169" end="00:06:45.860" style="s2">regard as sufficient for what they saw</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.629" end="00:06:48.590" style="s2">on that tape or he is exonerated for</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.860" end="00:06:50.449" style="s2">some reason that we don&#39;t yet know now</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.590" end="00:06:51.710" style="s2">it could be that the exoneration is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.449" end="00:06:53.719" style="s2">miscarriage of justice</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.710" end="00:06:57.139" style="s2">I believe we saw that in the Rodney King</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.719" end="00:06:59.719" style="s2">case many years ago many of you will be</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.139" end="00:07:02.509" style="s2">too young to remember that but it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.719" end="00:07:07.909" style="s2">quite a parallel situation where Rodney</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.509" end="00:07:11.629" style="s2">King who I believe had tried to evade</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.909" end="00:07:15.050" style="s2">police when he was finally stopped was</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.629" end="00:07:17.599" style="s2">beaten on videotape and at the time</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.050" end="00:07:20.389" style="s2">video cameras were sufficiently rare</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.599" end="00:07:24.710" style="s2">that the world was shocked by by what it</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.389" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">saw as I recall the the argument was</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.710" end="00:07:28.999" style="s2">levelled that he that the officers could</p>

<p begin="00:07:28.999" end="00:07:33.620" style="s2">where this had taken place the trial was</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.949" end="00:07:36.289" style="s2">moved I think to Simi Valley and Simi</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.620" end="00:07:38.749" style="s2">Valley was a place where they found a</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.289" end="00:07:41.839" style="s2">sympathetic jury and despite the fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.749" end="00:07:45.139" style="s2">that these cops had seemed seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.839" end="00:07:47.990" style="s2">needlessly brutalized Rodney King</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.139" end="00:07:51.919" style="s2">they were exonerated and that resulted</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.990" end="00:07:54.800" style="s2">in riots so we&#39;ve seen this pattern</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.919" end="00:07:58.580" style="s2">before we are now in a highly charged</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.800" end="00:08:02.270" style="s2">situation where a system whose greatest</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.580" end="00:08:03.830" style="s2">strength is that it does demand that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.270" end="00:08:07.159" style="s2">be proven guilty beyond a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.830" end="00:08:11.330" style="s2">doubt in a court of law in front of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.159" end="00:08:14.270" style="s2">jury of your peers that that that very</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.330" end="00:08:16.669" style="s2">important accomplishment that is handed</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.270" end="00:08:19.550" style="s2">to us in the Constitution is now very</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.669" end="00:08:21.649" style="s2">difficult to deploy in the context of of</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.550" end="00:08:26.820" style="s2">George Floyd and and George Floyd&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.649" end="00:08:28.260" style="s2">death and this officer all right so</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.820" end="00:08:31.789" style="s2">I just want to point out a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.260" end="00:08:34.320" style="s2">ways in which this could become</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.789" end="00:08:38.250" style="s2">difficult to manage in a in a court</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.320" end="00:08:40.530" style="s2">setting what if this officer is just a</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.250" end="00:08:44.940" style="s2">terrible person but that this wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.530" end="00:08:47.880" style="s2">racially motivated and he you know has a</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.940" end="00:08:50.480" style="s2">history of brutalizing people okay maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.880" end="00:08:53.940" style="s2">that plays into it and maybe it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.480" end="00:08:55.500" style="s2">what if as there is some indication I</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.940" end="00:08:59.880" style="s2">believe in the medical examiner&#39;s report</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.500" end="00:09:01.950" style="s2">what if George Floyd was having trouble</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.880" end="00:09:04.260" style="s2">breathing before he ever hit the ground</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.950" end="00:09:06.420" style="s2">and what the officer did certainly made</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.260" end="00:09:07.980" style="s2">things worse but was not the cause of</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.420" end="00:09:09.360" style="s2">his death for example what if he had had</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.980" end="00:09:11.220" style="s2">a heart attack</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.360" end="00:09:13.950" style="s2">ended up on the ground the officer put</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.220" end="00:09:16.680" style="s2">his knee on the the neck of George Floyd</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.950" end="00:09:18.930" style="s2">and George Floyd died I think needlessly</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.680" end="00:09:20.910" style="s2">because certainly the officers should</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.930" end="00:09:22.170" style="s2">have gotten him help at that point but</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.910" end="00:09:25.430" style="s2">nonetheless these are the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.170" end="00:09:28.590" style="s2">things that could complicate a trial</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.430" end="00:09:31.500" style="s2">okay now let&#39;s move on for a second from</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.590" end="00:09:34.110" style="s2">the question of whether or not a fair</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.500" end="00:09:36.450" style="s2">trial is conceivable in this case for</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.110" end="00:09:38.070" style="s2">that officer and as much as I saw a</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.450" end="00:09:40.800" style="s2">brutal officer on that tape who I</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.070" end="00:09:42.480" style="s2">believe was engaged in a very serious</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.800" end="00:09:45.570" style="s2">crime which demands very serious</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.480" end="00:09:47.280" style="s2">punishment I know that a trial is</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.570" end="00:09:53.310" style="s2">necessary in order to figure out the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.280" end="00:09:56.670" style="s2">facts of of the scenario okay we now</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.310" end="00:09:58.620" style="s2">face spreading unrest and violence and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.670" end="00:10:01.290" style="s2">as I said Zack and I went down to</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.620" end="00:10:02.820" style="s2">downtown Portland and looked at some of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.290" end="00:10:05.820" style="s2">the damage firsthand and I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.820" end="00:10:11.070" style="s2">probably it makes sense to show you some</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.820" end="00:10:24.000" style="s2">of what we saw so let&#39;s see Zack how do</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.070" end="00:10:25.200" style="s2">we do this I can&#39;t yeah but why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.000" end="00:10:31.020" style="s2">you just start and go and go through</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.200" end="00:10:38.740" style="s2">stuff all right so here you see a</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.020" end="00:10:42.190" style="s2">picture of ACAB spray-painted over the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.740" end="00:10:44.410" style="s2">sign at the corner on the Ninth Circuit</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.190" end="00:10:47.200" style="s2">building in downtown Portland</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.410" end="00:10:50.470" style="s2">the Ninth Circuit being a Federal Court</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.200" end="00:10:52.300" style="s2">of Appeals so I must say looking at this</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.470" end="00:10:55.540" style="s2">spray-paint here all cops are bastards</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.300" end="00:10:59.080" style="s2">that&#39;s what a CA B means I find it a</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.540" end="00:11:01.450" style="s2">preposterous phrase certainly some cops</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.080" end="00:11:03.550" style="s2">are bastards I&#39;ve run into them but all</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.450" end="00:11:04.320" style="s2">cops being bastards seems incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.550" end="00:11:08.050" style="s2">improbable</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.320" end="00:11:10.779" style="s2">and the claim itself seems deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.050" end="00:11:14.380" style="s2">designed to inflame cops to bring out</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.779" end="00:11:16.890" style="s2">the worst in them in order to reinforce</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.380" end="00:11:20.380" style="s2">the belief that there is no Humanity in</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.890" end="00:11:23.320" style="s2">them I know that this sentiment was</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.380" end="00:11:26.140" style="s2">deployed at Evergreen and that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.320" end="00:11:28.570" style="s2">true there after the Evergreen riots</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.140" end="00:11:31.000" style="s2">broke out I got to know Stacy Brown the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.570" end="00:11:33.550" style="s2">Chief of Police there who I found</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.000" end="00:11:34.810" style="s2">completely humane and rational and</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.550" end="00:11:37.330" style="s2">decent to the core</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.810" end="00:11:39.010" style="s2">so all cops are bastards can&#39;t possibly</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.330" end="00:11:41.589" style="s2">be right and here it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.010" end="00:11:43.630" style="s2">spray-painted on a federal court of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.589" end="00:11:46.630" style="s2">appeals and I had the question to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.630" end="00:11:49.270" style="s2">people who did this spray-painting do</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.630" end="00:11:51.370" style="s2">they have any idea what the court of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.270" end="00:11:53.649" style="s2">appeals represents do they have any idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.370" end="00:11:55.990" style="s2">what role it plays in protecting them</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.649" end="00:11:58.990" style="s2">from tyranny I have the sense that they</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.990" end="00:12:02.890" style="s2">they surely do not and yet and yet here</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.990" end="00:12:06.010" style="s2">it is all right let&#39;s move on one all</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.890" end="00:12:08.470" style="s2">right here&#39;s a car that had been burned</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.010" end="00:12:10.720" style="s2">out of course there is no indication</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.470" end="00:12:12.730" style="s2">about whether there was some sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.720" end="00:12:15.279" style="s2">gripe against the owner of this car but</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.730" end="00:12:17.709" style="s2">I have to say that the violence and</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.279" end="00:12:21.279" style="s2">damage that we saw in evidence</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.709" end="00:12:23.980" style="s2">downtown suggested not an entirely</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.279" end="00:12:27.279" style="s2">random pattern as you&#39;ll see but a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.980" end="00:12:28.690" style="s2">highly random pattern so this will just</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.279" end="00:12:31.990" style="s2">have been a car that was parked in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.690" end="00:12:35.110" style="s2">wrong place at the wrong time and burned</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.990" end="00:12:37.740" style="s2">out for I don&#39;t know to demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.110" end="00:12:42.480" style="s2">someone&#39;s power or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.740" end="00:12:46.420" style="s2">all right move on one okay here we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.480" end="00:12:48.760" style="s2">the Apple Store this is just right</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.420" end="00:12:49.950" style="s2">adjacent to the circuit to the Ninth</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.760" end="00:12:54.860" style="s2">Circuit Court there</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.950" end="00:13:01.500" style="s2">and spray-painted here is cops hate us</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.860" end="00:13:03.390" style="s2">now I don&#39;t know who us is in this bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.500" end="00:13:06.480" style="s2">of graffiti I don&#39;t know whether that</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.390" end="00:13:08.850" style="s2">was intended to mean the anarchists who</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.480" end="00:13:10.730" style="s2">I believe if did most of the damage here</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.850" end="00:13:11.940" style="s2">or if it&#39;s supposed to mean something</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.730" end="00:13:14.700" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.940" end="00:13:16.350" style="s2">but I will say as you will see an other</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.700" end="00:13:19.770" style="s2">graffiti that is documented in these</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.350" end="00:13:20.760" style="s2">pictures the cops have been thoroughly</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.770" end="00:13:23.490" style="s2">provoked</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.760" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">now is there a long history of bad</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.490" end="00:13:31.110" style="s2">policing in America is there a reason</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:33.090" style="s2">for for suspicion that bad policing may</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.110" end="00:13:34.290" style="s2">have something to do with episodes like</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.090" end="00:13:37.140" style="s2">the one that took place with George</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.290" end="00:13:41.190" style="s2">Floyd or habitual bad policing sure</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.140" end="00:13:44.060" style="s2">there is but to turn the cops into a</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.190" end="00:13:49.230" style="s2">monolithic phenomenon and to declare</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.060" end="00:13:51.840" style="s2">their hatred for us is so childish and</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.230" end="00:13:54.480" style="s2">so dangerous that it is hard to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.840" end="00:13:57.840" style="s2">that the people who did it could mistake</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.480" end="00:14:02.370" style="s2">it for the solution to any problem okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.840" end="00:14:05.550" style="s2">move on all right here we have the Apple</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.370" end="00:14:08.670" style="s2">Store and the Apple Store looks like</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.550" end="00:14:12.540" style="s2">Apple stores in many cities its glass</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.670" end="00:14:15.030" style="s2">all the way around and almost all of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.540" end="00:14:19.650" style="s2">panes had clearly been attacked with</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.030" end="00:14:23.580" style="s2">heavy objects now this will begin to</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.650" end="00:14:25.020" style="s2">show the pattern the attacks to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.580" end="00:14:26.160" style="s2">extent that they were not random and</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.020" end="00:14:29.420" style="s2">there were certainly some that looked</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.160" end="00:14:33.000" style="s2">random included a great many attacks on</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.420" end="00:14:35.250" style="s2">stores that sell high priced items and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.000" end="00:14:37.620" style="s2">there were occasionally bits of graffiti</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.250" end="00:14:40.260" style="s2">I think meant to rationalize this</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.620" end="00:14:42.690" style="s2">complaining about slave labor that goes</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.260" end="00:14:45.000" style="s2">into the production of these Apple</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.690" end="00:14:50.100" style="s2">products for example on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.000" end="00:14:52.020" style="s2">the impression that we were certainly</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.100" end="00:14:55.980" style="s2">left with looking at this was that at</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.020" end="00:15:00.480" style="s2">some level the breakdown in order was</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.980" end="00:15:01.900" style="s2">being used as an excuse to loot high</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.480" end="00:15:04.000" style="s2">quality</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.900" end="00:15:07.180" style="s2">the stores that sell high quality goods</p>

<p begin="00:15:07.180" end="00:15:14.110" style="s2">in their day life are regular citizens</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.830" end="00:15:16.630" style="s2">who covet things whether or not they</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.110" end="00:15:18.670" style="s2">should and then at the point that they</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.630" end="00:15:21.070" style="s2">have an excuse like the death of George</p>

<p begin="00:15:28.120" end="00:15:32.140" style="s2">most of the windows look like they held</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.770" end="00:15:34.390" style="s2">I guess they would have to be high</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.140" end="00:15:38.590" style="s2">quality windows to not be routinely</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.390" end="00:15:41.950" style="s2">broken by petty criminals but but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.590" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">it was quite dramatic and the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.950" end="00:15:49.390" style="s2">was quite evident all right move on all</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:51.010" style="s2">right now this photo is one of two I</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.390" end="00:15:55.120" style="s2">don&#39;t know if they&#39;re in sequence here</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.010" end="00:15:57.160" style="s2">or not this photo is of a trash can near</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.120" end="00:16:00.360" style="s2">one of the important parks in downtown</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.160" end="00:16:05.100" style="s2">Portland and the trash can has been</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.360" end="00:16:07.180" style="s2">burned and looking at this and the other</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.100" end="00:16:10.480" style="s2">picture which will come up here at some</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.180" end="00:16:12.450" style="s2">point yeah if you know where it is okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.480" end="00:16:17.230" style="s2">here&#39;s the other one this is a trash can</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.450" end="00:16:18.670" style="s2">with a sign that somebody has made out</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.230" end="00:16:20.470" style="s2">of cardboard and put on it and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.670" end="00:16:22.510" style="s2">taken the trash out of it and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.470" end="00:16:25.470" style="s2">strewn it all around in the same Park</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.510" end="00:16:31.510" style="s2">there is a porta potti that has been</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.470" end="00:16:33.880" style="s2">destroyed and a shrine for George Floyd</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.510" end="00:16:36.670" style="s2">but in any case the attack on the trash</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.880" end="00:16:41.400" style="s2">cans I think it&#39;s particularly telling</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.670" end="00:16:45.250" style="s2">because everybody benefits from the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.400" end="00:16:47.710" style="s2">proper functioning of municipal trash</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.250" end="00:16:49.600" style="s2">cans and trash collection service that</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.710" end="00:16:52.420" style="s2">picks these things up just the same way</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.600" end="00:16:55.180" style="s2">everybody benefits from a city in which</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.420" end="00:16:58.090" style="s2">you can walk down almost any street and</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.180" end="00:17:01.690" style="s2">not worry about random violence or theft</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.090" end="00:17:03.370" style="s2">you know the policing and the trash when</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.690" end="00:17:08.080" style="s2">they work correctly are nearly invisible</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.370" end="00:17:10.570" style="s2">and they make life vastly better for us</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.080" end="00:17:14.230" style="s2">and it has struck me since I began</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.570" end="00:17:15.800" style="s2">encountering anarchists years ago</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.230" end="00:17:18.410" style="s2">actually during the Aki</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.800" end="00:17:22.720" style="s2">by protests we&#39;re anarchists took over</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.410" end="00:17:25.580" style="s2">the movement that the anarchists have no</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.720" end="00:17:27.530" style="s2">concept of what actually makes their</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.580" end="00:17:30.290" style="s2">lives possible they have a fairy tale</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.530" end="00:17:31.610" style="s2">notion about what things are unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.290" end="00:17:35.950" style="s2">and what things they could do better</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.610" end="00:17:38.270" style="s2">themselves and attacking trash cans and</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.950" end="00:17:41.060" style="s2">dragging the trash out into the street</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.270" end="00:17:45.920" style="s2">is exactly the kind of confusion that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.060" end="00:17:48.620" style="s2">see at Evergreen the anarchists famously</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.920" end="00:17:50.930" style="s2">wanted to eliminate the police from</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.620" end="00:17:54.290" style="s2">campus and they wanted what they called</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.930" end="00:17:57.110" style="s2">community patrols and inside of hours of</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.290" end="00:18:00.250" style="s2">starting their community patrols after</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.110" end="00:18:03.770" style="s2">Jorge bridges stood the police down</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.250" end="00:18:08.510" style="s2">people were being intimidated and</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.770" end="00:18:11.060" style="s2">brutalized by bat wielding students</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.510" end="00:18:13.460" style="s2">that&#39;s what community patrols broke down</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.060" end="00:18:17.110" style="s2">into the lack of a system like the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.460" end="00:18:20.930" style="s2">courts the lack of policing that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.110" end="00:18:22.880" style="s2">properly set in motion these things have</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.930" end="00:18:25.160" style="s2">almost immediate consequences on</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.880" end="00:18:27.530" style="s2">civilization that the people who see</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.160" end="00:18:30.950" style="s2">only the problems with them do not</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.530" end="00:18:32.900" style="s2">anticipate so did the people who took</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.950" end="00:18:35.630" style="s2">the trash out of this trashcan or burned</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.900" end="00:18:38.080" style="s2">the one across the street or crushed the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.630" end="00:18:40.310" style="s2">Porta Potty thereby depriving people</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.080" end="00:18:43.130" style="s2">including homeless people of some place</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.310" end="00:18:47.240" style="s2">to use the toilet do they think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.130" end="00:18:49.100" style="s2">they have improved the city I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.240" end="00:18:51.410" style="s2">imagine that they do and yet they behave</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.100" end="00:18:56.150" style="s2">with this kind of arrogance all right</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.410" end="00:18:58.370" style="s2">move on here another instance that shows</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.150" end="00:19:00.950" style="s2">the pattern what store there was no</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.370" end="00:19:03.440" style="s2">other store on this block that had been</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.950" end="00:19:05.090" style="s2">attacked what store was attacked the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.440" end="00:19:08.030" style="s2">Sprint store why the Sprint store</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.090" end="00:19:10.880" style="s2">presumably because it had phones and all</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.030" end="00:19:12.860" style="s2">of these anarchists are also users of</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.880" end="00:19:16.130" style="s2">cell phones that might desire a little</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.860" end="00:19:19.730" style="s2">upgrade so this is really tarnishing any</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.130" end="00:19:22.530" style="s2">legitimate complaint they might have go</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.730" end="00:19:25.080" style="s2">on all right</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.530" end="00:19:29.670" style="s2">now here again you can see one of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.080" end="00:19:33.300" style="s2">problems with the the protests that have</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.670" end="00:19:34.710" style="s2">become riots this is a picture of some</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.300" end="00:19:38.040" style="s2">graffiti and it was really all over</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.710" end="00:19:41.030" style="s2">downtown and it says rest in power big</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.040" end="00:19:44.190" style="s2">Floyd and then you see the anarchist a</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.030" end="00:19:46.320" style="s2">now I don&#39;t know of any evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.190" end="00:19:48.660" style="s2">says the George Floyd had any sympathies</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.320" end="00:19:55.190" style="s2">with anarchists I find it hard to</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.660" end="00:19:58.980" style="s2">imagine and the attempt to graft</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.190" end="00:20:02.040" style="s2">anarchism on to his death in order to</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.980" end="00:20:03.780" style="s2">justify some movement that as anybody</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.040" end="00:20:05.550" style="s2">who lives in Portland knows is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.780" end="00:20:08.730" style="s2">constantly bubbling under the surface</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.550" end="00:20:10.620" style="s2">looking for a fight right suddenly they</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.730" end="00:20:14.640" style="s2">have something that they can claim is</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.620" end="00:20:17.330" style="s2">motivating them and it is really just a</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.640" end="00:20:22.710" style="s2">rationalization as far as I can tell all</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.330" end="00:20:26.190" style="s2">right ok I can&#39;t breathe that as a quote</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.710" end="00:20:29.370" style="s2">from George Floyd and this says fuck</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.190" end="00:20:32.520" style="s2">pigs oink oink right again a deliberate</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.370" end="00:20:35.400" style="s2">provocation of the cops now there were</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.520" end="00:20:38.010" style="s2">police all over downtown today and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.400" end="00:20:39.840" style="s2">took the opportunity to go talk to a set</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.010" end="00:20:41.760" style="s2">I just saw some standing on the corner</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.840" end="00:20:43.080" style="s2">and Zack and I went up to him asked him</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.760" end="00:20:45.840" style="s2">if they had any thoughts and they were</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.080" end="00:20:50.460" style="s2">initially very reluctant to say anything</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.840" end="00:20:52.140" style="s2">and you know I appealed to their being</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.460" end="00:20:54.510" style="s2">citizens of Portland and we being</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.140" end="00:20:57.690" style="s2">citizens of Portland and I just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.510" end="00:21:01.230" style="s2">to hear what they have to say and one</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.690" end="00:21:05.220" style="s2">cop said well you know this is troubling</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.230" end="00:21:08.220" style="s2">because he said I speaking of himself I</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.220" end="00:21:10.410" style="s2">have nothing in common with the cop who</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.220" end="00:21:11.730" style="s2">did this to George Floyd he says the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.410" end="00:21:13.980" style="s2">only things I have in common with them</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.730" end="00:21:19.490" style="s2">are that I&#39;m white and I&#39;m a cop and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.980" end="00:21:23.040" style="s2">don&#39;t understand why it is that this</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.490" end="00:21:24.750" style="s2">attack on all police has to happen in</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.040" end="00:21:26.850" style="s2">response to this event he says I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.750" end="00:21:29.520" style="s2">sickened to by what I saw</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.850" end="00:21:33.290" style="s2">so that is completely inconsistent of</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.520" end="00:21:35.420" style="s2">course with the all cops are bastards</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.290" end="00:21:38.380" style="s2">belief system but the all cops are</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.420" end="00:21:41.690" style="s2">bastards belief system is really just a</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.380" end="00:21:43.580" style="s2">simplifying assumption that allows those</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.690" end="00:21:45.110" style="s2">who are engaged in it not to have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.580" end="00:21:49.960" style="s2">worry too much about who&#39;s on the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.110" end="00:21:53.300" style="s2">other side of their violence okay go on</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.960" end="00:21:55.310" style="s2">okay here we&#39;ve got a video I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.300" end="00:21:58.460" style="s2">quiet so you can hear this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.310" end="00:22:00.830" style="s2">this is the building Heather and I have</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.460" end="00:22:02.990" style="s2">worked in this is the bank on the bottom</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.510" end="00:22:32.330" style="s2">audio here but look that guy said as he</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.690" end="00:22:34.429" style="s2">walked by was proudly that he had</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.330" end="00:22:37.640" style="s2">participated he said he had helped to</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.429" end="00:22:39.260" style="s2">tear apart the bank there now I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.640" end="00:22:41.750" style="s2">have any great love of chase chases one</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.260" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">of the banks that we use and I have my</p>

<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:49.670" style="s2">guy walking around in broad daylight</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.040" end="00:22:51.799" style="s2">proud to have destroyed this institution</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.670" end="00:22:53.900" style="s2">now what does he think is going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.799" end="00:22:55.700" style="s2">happen to the costs that they inflicted</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.900" end="00:22:58.250" style="s2">on Chase that&#39;s going to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.700" end="00:23:00.710" style="s2">chase customers and just like everything</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.250" end="00:23:02.169" style="s2">else it will be dealt with did they</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.710" end="00:23:04.940" style="s2">really think they solved a problem I</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.169" end="00:23:11.870" style="s2">can&#39;t imagine how they would and yet</p>

<p begin="00:24:13.460" end="00:24:17.270" style="s2">noticed that the tweet below this one</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.110" end="00:24:19.910" style="s2">says that he has actually been called</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.270" end="00:24:23.240" style="s2">back to the city that he had left to go</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.910" end="00:24:25.480" style="s2">attend to his dying mother</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.240" end="00:24:28.730" style="s2">and in light of the fact that he is</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.480" end="00:24:31.100" style="s2">facing that terrible crisis I&#39;m inclined</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.730" end="00:24:33.140" style="s2">to give him a pass I do however want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.100" end="00:24:36.260" style="s2">point out that if Ted wheeler has</p>

<p begin="00:24:44.659" end="00:24:51.080" style="s2">I hope the lesson sticks and mayor</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.220" end="00:24:52.700" style="s2">wheeler I I&#39;m sorry to hear about your</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.080" end="00:24:54.739" style="s2">mom that&#39;s a it&#39;s a terrible thing to</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.700" end="00:24:56.629" style="s2">face and I think all decent people</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.739" end="00:24:58.159" style="s2">understand that no matter whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.629" end="00:25:03.499" style="s2">supporters of yours or not that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.159" end="00:25:06.259" style="s2">going through something serious yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.499" end="00:25:10.639" style="s2">alright so now we have we have some</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.259" end="00:25:14.539" style="s2">other video business here but I&#39;ll want</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.639" end="00:25:17.419" style="s2">to take mayor wheelers tweet down okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.539" end="00:25:22.129" style="s2">so what I want to connect this to is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.419" end="00:25:24.169" style="s2">really we have two movements in motion</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.129" end="00:25:27.349" style="s2">at the same time and they are</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.169" end="00:25:29.869" style="s2">interacting in some kind of what I would</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.349" end="00:25:32.090" style="s2">say is a dangerous way now in the past</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.869" end="00:25:34.789" style="s2">I&#39;ve said some things about black lives</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.090" end="00:25:38.149" style="s2">matter black lives matter is a movement</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.789" end="00:25:40.970" style="s2">that I would like to be able to support</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.149" end="00:25:44.179" style="s2">because I support the concept black</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.970" end="00:25:46.580" style="s2">lives are undervalued I believe any</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.179" end="00:25:48.499" style="s2">decent person who evaluated the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.580" end="00:25:50.869" style="s2">would recognize that black lives are</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.499" end="00:25:54.409" style="s2">undervalued in the US and that results</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.869" end="00:25:57.679" style="s2">in many things including violence</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.409" end="00:26:00.649" style="s2">sometimes by police on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.679" end="00:26:03.590" style="s2">the black lives matter movement is not</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.649" end="00:26:04.970" style="s2">simply about that point it&#39;s about many</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.590" end="00:26:08.389" style="s2">other points some of which I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.970" end="00:26:10.519" style="s2">support and so the the compromised</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.389" end="00:26:12.109" style="s2">nature of black lives matter means that</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.519" end="00:26:13.999" style="s2">I have to stay at arm&#39;s length from it</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.109" end="00:26:17.359" style="s2">even if I don&#39;t feel naturally that</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.999" end="00:26:19.399" style="s2">that&#39;s where I should be the that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.359" end="00:26:21.919" style="s2">that&#39;s one tension inside the the black</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.399" end="00:26:23.629" style="s2">lives matter movement but then we have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.919" end="00:26:27.139" style="s2">second tension and the second tension</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.629" end="00:26:29.779" style="s2">has to do with the anarchists the</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.139" end="00:26:33.590" style="s2">so-called anti-fascists who are</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.779" end="00:26:37.789" style="s2">basically utilizing the unrest that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.590" end="00:26:40.609" style="s2">that exists as a result of this video of</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.789" end="00:26:43.940" style="s2">George Floyd&#39;s death for their own</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.609" end="00:26:47.029" style="s2">purposes and the point here is that they</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.940" end="00:26:49.249" style="s2">are in fact jeopardizing the very thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.029" end="00:26:50.930" style="s2">they claim to be attempting to advance</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.249" end="00:26:52.250" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.930" end="00:26:54.380" style="s2">aiming to be very upset about what</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.250" end="00:26:59.630" style="s2">happened to George Floyd but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.380" end="00:27:02.080" style="s2">time they are engaged in random violence</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.630" end="00:27:04.100" style="s2">and looting and those two things</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.080" end="00:27:05.980" style="s2">undercut the claim that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.100" end="00:27:10.910" style="s2">movement that is motivated by</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.980" end="00:27:12.230" style="s2">frustration at a broken system so you</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.910" end="00:27:20.660" style="s2">want to show the first of those videos</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.230" end="00:27:22.460" style="s2">act yeah that&#39;s the reality of what we</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.660" end="00:27:24.500" style="s2">did and we&#39;re right now all right</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.460" end="00:27:26.300" style="s2">like I said to all my white brothers and</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.500" end="00:27:28.430" style="s2">sisters we appreciate y&#39;all being out</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.300" end="00:27:31.390" style="s2">here and supporting us hey this is not</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.430" end="00:27:34.280" style="s2">y&#39;all space my ass is not jokes pants</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.390" end="00:27:39.200" style="s2">period we don&#39;t need this bullshit right</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.280" end="00:27:40.910" style="s2">here because what our reality is when</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.200" end="00:27:42.470" style="s2">this shit is all said and done when we</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.910" end="00:27:45.860" style="s2">wake up we still gonna be black in</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.470" end="00:27:47.330" style="s2">America you know that&#39;s not nothing</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.860" end="00:27:49.960" style="s2">against none of y&#39;all that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.330" end="00:27:53.240" style="s2">this is that&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying but</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.960" end="00:27:54.860" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to allow y&#39;all to go up</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.240" end="00:27:58.480" style="s2">there and start causing chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.860" end="00:27:58.480" style="s2">confusion it&#39;s just not gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.270" end="00:28:07.330" style="s2">okay so I wasn&#39;t able to hear the video</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.610" end="00:28:10.660" style="s2">with you but a memory serves you had a</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.330" end="00:28:16.050" style="s2">black guy respectfully but pointedly</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.660" end="00:28:16.050" style="s2">telling white folks who were engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.080" end="00:28:21.490" style="s2">violent and destructive rioting that</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.570" end="00:28:24.760" style="s2">they were doing the black community no</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.490" end="00:28:26.470" style="s2">favors that at the end of the day the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.760" end="00:28:28.300" style="s2">black people have to go back to being</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.470" end="00:28:30.670" style="s2">black at the white people get to go home</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.300" end="00:28:32.440" style="s2">to do something else and so the fusion</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.670" end="00:28:35.230" style="s2">between these two movements is</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.440" end="00:28:40.360" style="s2">understood inside at least many parts of</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.230" end="00:28:42.880" style="s2">the the the race the race based part of</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.360" end="00:28:45.550" style="s2">the movement understood to be dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.880" end="00:28:47.820" style="s2">and destructive can we show the other</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.550" end="00:28:47.820" style="s2">video</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.669" end="00:29:15.889" style="s2">engaged in violence black woman just</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.620" end="00:29:17.659" style="s2">pleading with them to stop yes partly</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.889" end="00:29:19.370" style="s2">because I&#39;ve seen the same dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.659" end="00:29:21.620" style="s2">unfold up close those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.370" end="00:29:25.490" style="s2">listened in to our last livestream about</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.620" end="00:29:27.830" style="s2">the Evergreen meltdown and how that went</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.490" end="00:29:31.909" style="s2">for Heather and for me we&#39;ll remember</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.830" end="00:29:34.909" style="s2">the discussion of of Odette who was our</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.909" end="00:29:40.129" style="s2">good friend and our student who was</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.909" end="00:29:41.750" style="s2">challenged by by rioters at Evergreen as</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.129" end="00:29:43.909" style="s2">some kind of a traitor for studying</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.750" end="00:29:47.690" style="s2">science and for not seeing things the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.909" end="00:29:49.610" style="s2">way they did in any case these tensions</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.690" end="00:29:52.850" style="s2">are important and those of us who are</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.610" end="00:29:54.440" style="s2">outside of these protests and riots need</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.850" end="00:29:56.179" style="s2">to remember that we&#39;re not looking at</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.440" end="00:29:58.700" style="s2">one thing we&#39;re looking at several</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.179" end="00:30:01.370" style="s2">things and that these things are being</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.700" end="00:30:03.740" style="s2">distorted by the lens through which we</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.370" end="00:30:06.799" style="s2">are looking at them I guess I would also</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.740" end="00:30:09.139" style="s2">point to the very interesting fact of</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.799" end="00:30:13.190" style="s2">the two places CNN shows up prominently</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.139" end="00:30:17.450" style="s2">in this story one of them a CNN reporter</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.190" end="00:30:19.220" style="s2">arrested while reporting from a place</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.450" end="00:30:22.850" style="s2">that he had been told to stand by police</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.220" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">on camera quite dramatic that was in</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.850" end="00:30:29.000" style="s2">Minneapolis in Atlanta the CNN</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.480" end="00:30:31.190" style="s2">headquarters were of course attacked by</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.000" end="00:30:33.860" style="s2">protesters which is nothing if not</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.190" end="00:30:38.600" style="s2">ironic because CNN has bent over</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.860" end="00:30:42.080" style="s2">backwards to coddle this perspective as</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.600" end="00:30:43.429" style="s2">foolish as it is so the and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.080" end="00:30:46.159" style="s2">saying that the whole perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.429" end="00:30:48.440" style="s2">foolish but CNN has bent over backwards</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.159" end="00:30:50.629" style="s2">to coddle all of these perspectives that</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.440" end="00:30:55.250" style="s2">have been fused together into something</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.629" end="00:30:57.470" style="s2">incoherent and what what was the upshot</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.250" end="00:30:59.659" style="s2">or what was the outgrowth of they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.470" end="00:31:01.820" style="s2">spending all of that time trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.659" end="00:31:04.970" style="s2">reason we&#39;re in many cases there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.820" end="00:31:08.900" style="s2">any is they got targeted because</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.970" end="00:31:10.700" style="s2">doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t pay any attention to who</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.900" end="00:31:15.710" style="s2">has done its bidding frankly it just</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.700" end="00:31:22.160" style="s2">comes for everybody alright so this</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.710" end="00:31:26.020" style="s2">leads me to the following the following</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.160" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">point we&#39;re in very serious trouble</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.020" end="00:31:33.200" style="s2">America has a very serious race problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:36.680" style="s2">we have not fully dealt with it we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.200" end="00:31:38.810" style="s2">done a lot but as with many or actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.680" end="00:31:41.540" style="s2">all complex problems this is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.810" end="00:31:43.940" style="s2">diminishing returns issue where the easy</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.540" end="00:31:46.370" style="s2">stuff has all been done and what we are</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.940" end="00:31:48.500" style="s2">left with are all the difficult things</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.370" end="00:31:51.950" style="s2">the things that are hard to spot that</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.500" end="00:31:53.810" style="s2">are a bit subtle that require us to</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.950" end="00:31:55.520" style="s2">think outside the box in order to</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.810" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">discover what solution might actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.520" end="00:32:01.070" style="s2">function and because of that I believe</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:05.270" style="s2">there is natural frustration and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.070" end="00:32:08.330" style="s2">natural frustration is pent up and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.270" end="00:32:11.930" style="s2">believe that people in especially the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.330" end="00:32:15.290" style="s2">black community have reason to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.930" end="00:32:19.850" style="s2">impatient and they have reason to notice</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.290" end="00:32:21.680" style="s2">that year after year patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.850" end="00:32:25.940" style="s2">systemic systemically</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.680" end="00:32:28.580" style="s2">shut them out of opportunity remain and</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.940" end="00:32:33.490" style="s2">what they get is a lot of lip service</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.580" end="00:32:36.170" style="s2">from especially the Democratic Party so</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.490" end="00:32:38.420" style="s2">what I want to do is I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.170" end="00:32:40.790" style="s2">about how it is that we are going to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.420" end="00:32:43.220" style="s2">out of this predicament without</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.790" end="00:32:45.290" style="s2">descending into at the very least</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.220" end="00:32:47.540" style="s2">madness and I believe we are already</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.290" end="00:32:51.410" style="s2">effectively on a slippery slope to</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.540" end="00:32:54.560" style="s2">madness in light of the Cova 19 pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.410" end="00:32:57.740" style="s2">in light of the election year that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.560" end="00:33:00.530" style="s2">are in it seems likely that what will</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.740" end="00:33:02.660" style="s2">happen is more heat and more pressure</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.530" end="00:33:05.000" style="s2">will be added to the situation and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.660" end="00:33:07.150" style="s2">is going to result in an increased</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.000" end="00:33:10.540" style="s2">likelihood of it boiling over in some</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.150" end="00:33:13.460" style="s2">even more spectacular and dangerous way</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.540" end="00:33:16.700" style="s2">so as a patriotic American I want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.460" end="00:33:18.320" style="s2">find a way out of that predicament what</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.700" end="00:33:20.899" style="s2">I would like to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.320" end="00:33:24.649" style="s2">is proposed something that might allow</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.899" end="00:33:27.649" style="s2">us to well not to put too fine a point</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.649" end="00:33:30.590" style="s2">on it to rescue the Republic from a</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.649" end="00:33:34.490" style="s2">trajectory that seems certain to tear it</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.590" end="00:33:37.880" style="s2">apart but first we have to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.490" end="00:33:41.840" style="s2">what the predicament really is so we</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.880" end="00:33:46.639" style="s2">have a president who engages in behavior</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.840" end="00:33:51.789" style="s2">that is nothing if not stunning a couple</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.639" end="00:33:56.320" style="s2">days ago he tweeted and he quoted</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.789" end="00:33:58.519" style="s2">essentially a threat of shooting</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.320" end="00:34:00.889" style="s2">basically the quote was something to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.519" end="00:34:02.419" style="s2">effect of when the looting starts the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.889" end="00:34:09.010" style="s2">shooting starts and this is apparently a</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.419" end="00:34:12.200" style="s2">quote from the 60s 1968 I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.010" end="00:34:15.679" style="s2">could not help but be a dog whistle to</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.200" end="00:34:19.760" style="s2">certain parts of his base Twitter rather</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.679" end="00:34:21.889" style="s2">absurdly decided to label the tweet as</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.760" end="00:34:24.649" style="s2">troubling but needing to stay up in</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.889" end="00:34:25.700" style="s2">order for you know for the greater good</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.649" end="00:34:29.690" style="s2">or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.700" end="00:34:32.960" style="s2">now the fact is the man is the President</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.690" end="00:34:36.200" style="s2">of the United States irrespective of</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.960" end="00:34:39.500" style="s2">what he says no matter how vile no</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.200" end="00:34:41.839" style="s2">matter how dangerous we need access to</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.500" end="00:34:44.510" style="s2">it we need access to it if for no other</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.839" end="00:34:47.450" style="s2">reason than to know how dangerous it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.510" end="00:34:48.710" style="s2">so the idea that Twitter is debating</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.450" end="00:34:50.629" style="s2">whether or not to protect us from</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.710" end="00:34:53.149" style="s2">something the president said is absurd</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.629" end="00:34:55.220" style="s2">on its face Twitter should step out of</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.149" end="00:34:57.349" style="s2">the way they should treat us as adults</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.220" end="00:34:59.720" style="s2">and they should allow us to see what is</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.349" end="00:35:02.390" style="s2">being said we can then discuss what its</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.720" end="00:35:05.510" style="s2">meaning is but whether we get to hear</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.390" end="00:35:11.359" style="s2">what was said of course we do any other</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.510" end="00:35:14.900" style="s2">choice makes no sense whatsoever okay so</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.359" end="00:35:18.890" style="s2">I want to present a model and a</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.900" end="00:35:21.319" style="s2">principle that are the basis for what I</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.890" end="00:35:26.030" style="s2">see as a plan that could get us out of</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.319" end="00:35:30.230" style="s2">our predicament so the model is this for</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.030" end="00:35:32.210" style="s2">almost my entire life I was born in 1969</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.230" end="00:35:36.380" style="s2">for almost my entire</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.210" end="00:35:41.560" style="s2">life the two-party system has functioned</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.380" end="00:35:44.240" style="s2">like a influence-peddling racket and</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.560" end="00:35:46.640" style="s2">there are two parties in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.240" end="00:35:48.260" style="s2">influence-peddling racket you have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.640" end="00:35:50.690" style="s2">Democratic Party and you have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.260" end="00:35:52.970" style="s2">Republican Party both of whom have their</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.690" end="00:35:55.270" style="s2">version of it now I think the Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.970" end="00:36:00.609" style="s2">Party&#39;s version went from a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.270" end="00:36:03.230" style="s2">light influence peddling to absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.609" end="00:36:06.290" style="s2">all-encompassing influence peddling at</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.230" end="00:36:08.180" style="s2">about the time that Bill Clinton was</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.290" end="00:36:11.089" style="s2">elected the first time Bill Clinton&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.180" end="00:36:13.070" style="s2">first administration marked the point at</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.089" end="00:36:15.890" style="s2">which the Democratic Party abandoned</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.070" end="00:36:18.770" style="s2">working people and decided instead to</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.890" end="00:36:21.410" style="s2">peddle its influence to wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.770" end="00:36:24.890" style="s2">interests that did not have the public</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.410" end="00:36:27.550" style="s2">interests at heart so that created a</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.890" end="00:36:31.609" style="s2">structure in which these two teams</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.550" end="00:36:34.400" style="s2">effectively battled for a larger</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.609" end="00:36:36.710" style="s2">fraction of the influence-peddling pie</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.400" end="00:36:39.290" style="s2">but basically the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.710" end="00:36:42.410" style="s2">functioned to exclude the interests of</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.290" end="00:36:44.750" style="s2">common people we were shut out we were</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.410" end="00:36:47.810" style="s2">constantly being sold out by one or the</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.750" end="00:36:51.880" style="s2">other party and each party paid lip</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.810" end="00:36:56.330" style="s2">service to to the two working people but</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.880" end="00:36:59.080" style="s2">you know inexplicably policy never</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.330" end="00:37:04.420" style="s2">worked substantially in our favor</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.080" end="00:37:08.810" style="s2">so what happened in 2016 was effectively</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.420" end="00:37:13.190" style="s2">Trump staged an insurgency that</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.810" end="00:37:16.430" style="s2">insurgency was too many people hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.190" end="00:37:22.780" style="s2">because it did represent a challenge to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.430" end="00:37:27.560" style="s2">the influence peddlers who had treated</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.780" end="00:37:31.910" style="s2">public policy as their own private bank</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.560" end="00:37:35.240" style="s2">account and this is quite understandable</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.910" end="00:37:38.359" style="s2">you can imagine living in a town in</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.240" end="00:37:41.599" style="s2">which rival crime families exist if some</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.359" end="00:37:44.720" style="s2">new syndicate showed up and challenged</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.599" end="00:37:45.920" style="s2">them you would at first be relieved to</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.720" end="00:37:47.900" style="s2">see some</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.920" end="00:37:50.660" style="s2">fighting back against the people that</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.900" end="00:37:54.319" style="s2">had you under their thumb but in Trump&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.660" end="00:37:59.180" style="s2">case he effectively functions as a third</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.319" end="00:38:02.089" style="s2">crime family and at this point the red</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.180" end="00:38:04.730" style="s2">crime family has made an uneasy peace</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.089" end="00:38:05.900" style="s2">with him so they&#39;ve now joined their</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.730" end="00:38:07.640" style="s2">interest that doesn&#39;t mean that they</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.900" end="00:38:10.970" style="s2">were permanently joined but for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.640" end="00:38:13.599" style="s2">moment they have joined together and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.970" end="00:38:16.369" style="s2">blue crime family is very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:19.670" style="s2">restoring the order that used to exist</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.369" end="00:38:21.500" style="s2">it wants nothing more than to eliminate</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.670" end="00:38:23.839" style="s2">Trump and many people have understood</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.500" end="00:38:26.329" style="s2">eliminating Trump to be the solution to</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.839" end="00:38:28.069" style="s2">some problem but of course it isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.329" end="00:38:31.640" style="s2">solution to some problem if it returns</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.069" end="00:38:33.349" style="s2">us to a state in which the red crime</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.640" end="00:38:35.990" style="s2">family and the blue crime family</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.349" end="00:38:39.230" style="s2">continue to peddle influence and sell us</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.990" end="00:38:41.450" style="s2">out that system is what created the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.230" end="00:38:45.020" style="s2">vulnerability that we currently have it</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.450" end="00:38:47.809" style="s2">actually created the frustration that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.020" end="00:38:53.150" style="s2">currently manifesting itself in the form</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.809" end="00:38:56.510" style="s2">of riots across the country so what I</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.150" end="00:38:59.510" style="s2">want to propose is that we start by</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.510" end="00:39:01.190" style="s2">looking at fellow Americans people we</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.510" end="00:39:03.230" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily understand because</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.190" end="00:39:07.339" style="s2">they are choosing to vote in some way</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.230" end="00:39:13.549" style="s2">that we find unconscionable and my point</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.339" end="00:39:16.460" style="s2">to to you is that it is unacceptable to</p>

<p begin="00:40:11.180" end="00:40:14.570" style="s2">what we&#39;ve seen again this year there</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.800" end="00:40:16.730" style="s2">were interesting candidates in the</p>

<p begin="00:40:16.730" end="00:40:23.870" style="s2">by the end and now what we are left with</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.640" end="00:40:28.220" style="s2">apparently is a competition between</p>

<p begin="00:41:02.750" end="00:41:09.920" style="s2">we to do that&#39;s really the question I</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.800" end="00:41:13.900" style="s2">want to propose a way out of this mess</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.920" end="00:41:17.390" style="s2">and I will just tell you at the get-go</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.900" end="00:41:20.870" style="s2">anything that someone proposes to escape</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.390" end="00:41:25.820" style="s2">the hegemony of the duopoly to escape</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.870" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">the the election as we see it shaping up</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.820" end="00:41:31.100" style="s2">is going to sound far-fetched but I</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:32.990" style="s2">would ask you if the answer is this</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.100" end="00:41:34.400" style="s2">seems far-fetched so I&#39;m just going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.990" end="00:41:36.770" style="s2">choose from the menu that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.400" end="00:41:39.470" style="s2">given then where are we going to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.770" end="00:41:40.790" style="s2">after the election where will we be four</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.470" end="00:41:42.350" style="s2">years from now will there be an</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.790" end="00:41:47.180" style="s2">opportunity then or will it just be</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.350" end="00:41:49.720" style="s2">another absurd set of choices okay so</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.180" end="00:41:49.720" style="s2">deep breath</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.660" end="00:41:58.140" style="s2">here&#39;s the proposal the proposal is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.900" end="00:41:59.490" style="s2">we draft two people now these people</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.140" end="00:42:03.750" style="s2">have to have certain characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.490" end="00:42:07.200" style="s2">they need to be Patriots they need to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.750" end="00:42:10.920" style="s2">courageous they need to be highly</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.200" end="00:42:11.490" style="s2">capable now if we can find two such</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.920" end="00:42:14.069" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.490" end="00:42:17.250" style="s2">it would be ideal if they came from</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.069" end="00:42:20.309" style="s2">different sides of the usual political</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.250" end="00:42:22.710" style="s2">divide that is to say it would be great</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.309" end="00:42:26.010" style="s2">to have somebody from the center-right</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.710" end="00:42:28.190" style="s2">and somebody from the center-left we</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.010" end="00:42:32.640" style="s2">would draft them and they would agree to</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.190" end="00:42:35.670" style="s2">rule as a team actually govern as a team</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.640" end="00:42:39.030" style="s2">is a better choice of words so they</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.670" end="00:42:41.099" style="s2">would agree to govern as a team and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.030" end="00:42:42.720" style="s2">choice of who would run at the top of</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.099" end="00:42:46.289" style="s2">the ticket would be made arbitrarily</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.720" end="00:42:48.809" style="s2">they&#39;d flip a coin and we&#39;d see who was</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.289" end="00:42:51.180" style="s2">going to run in the top spot and who was</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.809" end="00:42:54.089" style="s2">going to be vice-president but with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.180" end="00:42:56.549" style="s2">acknowledgement that in all matters they</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.089" end="00:43:00.150" style="s2">would attempt to rule to govern by</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.549" end="00:43:02.220" style="s2">consensus and that only in circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.150" end="00:43:05.039" style="s2">where they could not reach agreement or</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.220" end="00:43:06.779" style="s2">where a decision had to be made quickly</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.039" end="00:43:09.480" style="s2">like in some sort of a military</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.779" end="00:43:15.960" style="s2">confrontation would the person at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.480" end="00:43:20.010" style="s2">top of the ticket have the final say so</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.960" end="00:43:21.990" style="s2">this team then after four years would</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.010" end="00:43:23.549" style="s2">reverse roles whoever had run at the top</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.990" end="00:43:25.319" style="s2">of the ticket in the first election</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.549" end="00:43:27.180" style="s2">would run for the vice presidential spot</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.319" end="00:43:30.690" style="s2">and the former vice president would run</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.180" end="00:43:34.529" style="s2">for the presidential spot and this would</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.690" end="00:43:37.170" style="s2">continue until either some other ticket</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.529" end="00:43:39.720" style="s2">was voted into office or one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.170" end="00:43:42.319" style="s2">parties had been in the presidential</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.720" end="00:43:44.730" style="s2">role twice and therefore had become</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.319" end="00:43:47.069" style="s2">ineligible as a vice presidential</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.730" end="00:43:48.510" style="s2">candidate at which point they would be</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.069" end="00:43:54.779" style="s2">replaced by somebody else who was</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.510" end="00:43:57.270" style="s2">suitable now this plan solves a number</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.779" end="00:44:01.019" style="s2">of different problems most importantly</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.270" end="00:44:05.049" style="s2">it escapes the hegemony of the parties</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.019" end="00:44:08.440" style="s2">it would put highly competent Patriots</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.049" end="00:44:14.019" style="s2">in the position of ruling or governing</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.440" end="00:44:17.289" style="s2">in the American people&#39;s interest in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.019" end="00:44:20.109" style="s2">in a transparent way it does not require</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.289" end="00:44:22.329" style="s2">us to alter anything about the</p>

<p begin="00:44:22.329" end="00:44:27.819" style="s2">order to make it work now of course it</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.059" end="00:44:30.190" style="s2">has obstacles primary among them is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.819" end="00:44:32.890" style="s2">question of who the individuals were</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.190" end="00:44:36.309" style="s2">chosen would be now I&#39;ve done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.890" end="00:44:39.190" style="s2">thinking about that question and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.309" end="00:44:42.309" style="s2">concluded that the person who is best</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.190" end="00:44:45.309" style="s2">suited for the role on the center-right</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.309" end="00:45:02.829" style="s2">is fairly clear and I would suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.309" end="00:45:06.190" style="s2">it would be Admiral William McRaven hey</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.829" end="00:45:09.099" style="s2">folks apparently I am once again live I</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.190" end="00:45:12.670" style="s2">think you will all agree the timing of</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.099" end="00:45:15.249" style="s2">that failure was uncanny I&#39;m gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.670" end="00:45:18.460" style="s2">not to think too hard about the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.249" end="00:45:20.920" style="s2">of why our system suddenly collapsed at</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.460" end="00:45:30.400" style="s2">that moment and just simply pick up</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.920" end="00:45:33.369" style="s2">where I was that has asked me to convey</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.400" end="00:45:36.460" style="s2">that because we have been forced to</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.369" end="00:45:38.799" style="s2">resort to a backup system we know that</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.460" end="00:45:41.680" style="s2">the sound is not quite as high-quality</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.799" end="00:45:43.719" style="s2">as we would like we are recording</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.680" end="00:45:46.630" style="s2">locally and we may be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.719" end="00:45:47.950" style="s2">something about the quality afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.630" end="00:45:49.660" style="s2">most important from my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.950" end="00:45:53.680" style="s2">though is that we pick up the thread we</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.660" end="00:45:56.859" style="s2">were on and continue forward so that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.680" end="00:45:59.829" style="s2">guys have the full idea I believe the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.859" end="00:46:01.630" style="s2">last thing you heard me say was that in</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.829" end="00:46:04.930" style="s2">the center-right position I would</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.630" end="00:46:07.809" style="s2">advocate Admiral William McRaven current</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.930" end="00:46:10.719" style="s2">Chancellor of the University of Texas he</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.809" end="00:46:14.229" style="s2">is obviously a courageous person he is</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.719" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">obviously highly competent and clearly a</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.229" end="00:46:18.510" style="s2">patriot</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:21.300" style="s2">so I do not believe there is any strong</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.510" end="00:46:24.320" style="s2">reason that we would need to find some</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.300" end="00:46:26.760" style="s2">different candidate where he willing on</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.320" end="00:46:29.220" style="s2">the left it&#39;s a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.760" end="00:46:32.760" style="s2">difficult there are some people I really</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.220" end="00:46:34.710" style="s2">like for that spot in each case there is</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.760" end="00:46:38.370" style="s2">something that makes them just shy of</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.710" end="00:46:40.770" style="s2">perfect in the end I have concluded that</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.370" end="00:46:44.760" style="s2">the best person for the role is probably</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.770" end="00:46:48.780" style="s2">Andrew yang in Andrew Yang&#39;s case he has</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.760" end="00:46:50.670" style="s2">demonstrated that he is capable of</p>

<p begin="00:46:50.670" end="00:46:55.980" style="s2">demonstrated that he&#39;s courageous and</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.000" end="00:46:58.140" style="s2">all-in when it comes to mounting a</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.980" end="00:47:00.720" style="s2">campaign and I&#39;m sure he would do the</p>

<p begin="00:47:00.720" end="00:47:06.780" style="s2">I&#39;ve proposed the downsides as I see it</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.320" end="00:47:09.150" style="s2">with Andrew are that in the aftermath of</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.780" end="00:47:13.220" style="s2">his being in my opinion pushed out of</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.150" end="00:47:17.160" style="s2">the Democratic race he embraced Biden</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.220" end="00:47:20.970" style="s2">and he went over to CNN who had treated</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.160" end="00:47:22.470" style="s2">him so badly during the primary that</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.970" end="00:47:25.860" style="s2">said I don&#39;t see either of those as</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.470" end="00:47:29.130" style="s2">fatal problems and I would certainly</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.860" end="00:47:33.780" style="s2">trust him to do an excellent job were he</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.130" end="00:47:37.350" style="s2">elected okay so now you have the</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.780" end="00:47:40.080" style="s2">outlines of the plan what problems does</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.350" end="00:47:43.050" style="s2">it solve well in one fell swoop it would</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.080" end="00:47:44.940" style="s2">remove the power of the parties over the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.050" end="00:47:47.280" style="s2">presidency and it would put the</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.940" end="00:47:50.760" style="s2">presidency in the hands of people with</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.280" end="00:47:54.450" style="s2">excellent leadership capacity excellent</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.760" end="00:47:59.150" style="s2">insight and most importantly people who</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.450" end="00:48:03.300" style="s2">hold the public interest in high regard</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.150" end="00:48:06.300" style="s2">all right so that&#39;s the plan now I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.300" end="00:48:08.760" style="s2">probably the best thing to do is for me</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.300" end="00:48:13.200" style="s2">to take a brief break and then to return</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.760" end="00:48:15.420" style="s2">and we can do our question-and-answer</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.200" end="00:48:18.600" style="s2">session I will start with the questions</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.420" end="00:48:20.040" style="s2">that came in on the initial stream and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.600" end="00:48:23.970" style="s2">believe we have now switched to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.040" end="00:48:25.260" style="s2">second stream and your Oh Zack tells me</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.970" end="00:48:25.780" style="s2">we&#39;re still in the first stream all</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.260" end="00:48:29.190" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.780" end="00:48:33.490" style="s2">well this uncanny collapse of our system</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.190" end="00:48:35.470" style="s2">in mid discussion has left me a little</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.490" end="00:48:39.250" style="s2">bit confused about where we are</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.470" end="00:48:42.250" style="s2">technologically but nonetheless I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.250" end="00:48:46.500" style="s2">it makes sense at this point for me to</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.250" end="00:48:46.500" style="s2">take a five minute break and then return</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.980" end="00:48:51.340" style="s2">sorry folks so that is telling me that</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.210" end="00:48:54.010" style="s2">we need 15 minutes in order to make this</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.340" end="00:48:56.230" style="s2">work so I will take 15 minutes and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.010" end="00:49:01.440" style="s2">will return to answer super chat</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.230" end="00:49:01.440" style="s2">questions all right signing off for now</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.050" end="00:49:09.110" style="s2">you</p>
