<p begin="00:21:35.679" end="00:21:39.600" style="s2">and basically we&#39;re looking at the idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.559" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">of sowistism</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.600" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">as training in aspirational</p>

<p begin="00:21:47.360" end="00:21:53.440" style="s2">rationality again is not just about</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.480" end="00:21:55.280" style="s2">the use of logic within argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.440" end="00:21:58.320" style="s2">it&#39;s much more comprehensive than that</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.280" end="00:22:00.799" style="s2">it has to do with the comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.320" end="00:22:01.360" style="s2">endeavor to systematically become aware</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.799" end="00:22:03.840" style="s2">of</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.840" end="00:22:07.760" style="s2">help us</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.480" end="00:22:09.840" style="s2">aspire to become more virtuous where we</p>

<p begin="00:22:10.559" end="00:22:14.240" style="s2">virtue is how we are wise in any</p>

<p begin="00:22:14.240" end="00:22:20.960" style="s2">situation the idea here is is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.760" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">that is something that&#39;s going to awaken</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.960" end="00:22:23.760" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:25.200" style="s2">to the process of co-identification</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.760" end="00:22:27.280" style="s2">which is at the center</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:28.400" style="s2">of stoicism and alleviate moodle</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.280" end="00:22:31.840" style="s2">confusion</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.400" end="00:22:36.080" style="s2">and it is also going to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.840" end="00:22:39.120" style="s2">the process by which we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.080" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">bring about the changes in our cognition</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:44.080" style="s2">that are needed to ameliorate the ways</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:48.480" style="s2">we suffer</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.080" end="00:22:51.760" style="s2">from how we miss set our heart on things</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.480" end="00:22:53.840" style="s2">so this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.760" end="00:22:56.159" style="s2">aspirational rationality is what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.840" end="00:22:58.720" style="s2">been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.159" end="00:22:58.720" style="s2">throughout</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.880" end="00:23:07.840" style="s2">and we reviewed some of the core ideas</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:08.960" style="s2">of stoicism and some of the preliminary</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.840" end="00:23:10.559" style="s2">well not preliminary</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.960" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">basic practices there that&#39;s a better</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.559" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">way of putting it and we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.320" end="00:23:17.440" style="s2">how there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:19.360" style="s2">basically three aspects to it now</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.440" end="00:23:21.520" style="s2">traditionally it&#39;s called the logic the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.360" end="00:23:25.360" style="s2">ethics and the physics</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.520" end="00:23:27.280" style="s2">but i like to call it the psychologic</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.360" end="00:23:28.799" style="s2">because again it&#39;s not just about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.280" end="00:23:32.159" style="s2">logical control</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.799" end="00:23:33.520" style="s2">of argumentation it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.159" end="00:23:35.919" style="s2">reflective control</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.520" end="00:23:36.799" style="s2">of attention in fact control isn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.919" end="00:23:38.640" style="s2">the right word</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.799" end="00:23:40.159" style="s2">i like hedo&#39;s work the reflective</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.640" end="00:23:41.600" style="s2">disciplining of attention</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.159" end="00:23:43.360" style="s2">the disciplining of ascent the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.600" end="00:23:44.559" style="s2">disciplining of action</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.360" end="00:23:46.960" style="s2">so these are the things we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.559" end="00:23:50.320" style="s2">disciplining and then along the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.960" end="00:23:52.640" style="s2">we will discipline uh argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.320" end="00:23:53.520" style="s2">we talked about this last time about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.640" end="00:23:56.960" style="s2">idea of</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.520" end="00:24:00.720" style="s2">crisis that&#39;s okay um into</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.960" end="00:24:02.880" style="s2">the process of epilege</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.720" end="00:24:05.520" style="s2">so we&#39;re we&#39;re trying to bring in</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.880" end="00:24:08.640" style="s2">judgment a critical change</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.520" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">uh remember that that this means</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.640" end="00:24:13.039" style="s2">um the destabilization but also</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.120" end="00:24:15.440" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.039" end="00:24:17.200" style="s2">so all the meanings if you can combine</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.440" end="00:24:20.240" style="s2">our our current meanings</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.200" end="00:24:21.760" style="s2">of crisis and judgment and opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.240" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s actually being carried in</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.760" end="00:24:25.120" style="s2">this word</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.480" end="00:24:26.159" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to introduce this into</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.120" end="00:24:27.919" style="s2">the epilega</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.159" end="00:24:29.360" style="s2">so remember we get these impressions and</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.919" end="00:24:31.120" style="s2">we have no control over them they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.360" end="00:24:33.200" style="s2">just part of the nature</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.120" end="00:24:34.320" style="s2">and the outcome of the machinery of our</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.200" end="00:24:36.880" style="s2">perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.320" end="00:24:37.679" style="s2">uh processing or uncogni or unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.880" end="00:24:39.760" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.679" end="00:24:40.799" style="s2">and it just gives us impressions but</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.760" end="00:24:42.799" style="s2">what we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.799" end="00:24:46.640" style="s2">intervene on what we can introduce</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.799" end="00:24:49.200" style="s2">crisis in the ancient sense into is</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.640" end="00:24:51.120" style="s2">all of the epileegan all of the ways in</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.200" end="00:24:52.320" style="s2">which we&#39;re doing something analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.120" end="00:24:54.400" style="s2">talking to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.320" end="00:24:56.240" style="s2">remember what antisthenes said that what</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.400" end="00:24:58.000" style="s2">socrates what he learned from socrates</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.240" end="00:24:58.640" style="s2">was how to more appropriately talk to</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.000" end="00:25:00.320" style="s2">himself</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.640" end="00:25:02.559" style="s2">this was the stoic interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.320" end="00:25:03.760" style="s2">this you internalize socrates which is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.559" end="00:25:05.520" style="s2">perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.760" end="00:25:07.200" style="s2">and participatory transformation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.520" end="00:25:10.080" style="s2">something aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.200" end="00:25:11.039" style="s2">in order to learn how to properly become</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.080" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">aware of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.039" end="00:25:17.840" style="s2">and manage this and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:18.559" style="s2">the point about this of course is to get</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.840" end="00:25:21.679" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.559" end="00:25:22.159" style="s2">the possibility of a poke uh which i</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.679" end="00:25:24.159" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.159" end="00:25:25.760" style="s2">is also a central practice within</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.159" end="00:25:29.120" style="s2">phenomenology coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.760" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">his role he uses that term explicitly by</p>

<p begin="00:25:29.840" end="00:25:34.240" style="s2">and i recommended don id&#39;s book on</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.159" end="00:25:36.080" style="s2">experimental phenomenology to give you</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.240" end="00:25:37.600" style="s2">uh if you want to deepen your</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.080" end="00:25:39.279" style="s2">understanding and practice of this this</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.600" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">is the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.279" end="00:25:43.440" style="s2">bracketing the impressions and what</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:46.880" style="s2">we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.440" end="00:25:48.159" style="s2">holding um we&#39;re withholding of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.880" end="00:25:51.360" style="s2">immediate ascent</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.159" end="00:25:53.200" style="s2">and assertion so</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.360" end="00:25:55.039" style="s2">this comes up right there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.200" end="00:25:55.520" style="s2">impression and there&#39;s a part of me that</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.039" end="00:25:57.919" style="s2">starts</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.520" end="00:25:59.600" style="s2">talking to myself and saying ah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.919" end="00:26:02.320" style="s2">marker it&#39;s a good marker</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.600" end="00:26:03.440" style="s2">so right so uh and then so there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.320" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">assertion here</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:07.600" style="s2">a mental assertion and i ascend to it</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.600" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">and i right and all of this is happening</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.600" end="00:26:11.279" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:12.559" style="s2">in a confused fashion in that all of</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.279" end="00:26:14.400" style="s2">that is happening</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.559" end="00:26:16.400" style="s2">automatically it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.400" end="00:26:17.200" style="s2">unconsciously and it&#39;s getting fused to</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.400" end="00:26:18.640" style="s2">the impression</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.200" end="00:26:20.720" style="s2">and i&#39;m treating them all as one and</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.640" end="00:26:22.720" style="s2">what i want to do is defuse this</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.720" end="00:26:24.240" style="s2">and when i want to break break it apart</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.720" end="00:26:27.679" style="s2">well is it really uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.240" end="00:26:30.559" style="s2">marker and should i think of it as good</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.679" end="00:26:32.159" style="s2">and and of course what you want to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.559" end="00:26:33.039" style="s2">initially you might have to coach</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.159" end="00:26:35.440" style="s2">yourself with that</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.039" end="00:26:36.559" style="s2">inner speech but the point is not the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.440" end="00:26:38.960" style="s2">inner speaking</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.559" end="00:26:40.559" style="s2">the point is ultimately to introduce</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.960" end="00:26:43.600" style="s2">this into it the point is to get</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.559" end="00:26:47.360" style="s2">the skill and ultimately the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.600" end="00:26:50.720" style="s2">virtue of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.360" end="00:26:54.640" style="s2">make sure that you are coming</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.720" end="00:26:56.400" style="s2">to the best possible assertion</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:26:58.480" style="s2">to which you can give the most</p>

<p begin="00:27:10.880" end="00:27:17.520" style="s2">present and then we represent</p>

<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:24.880" style="s2">to representation that we want to</p>

<p begin="00:27:30.320" end="00:27:38.559" style="s2">so that we can engage in pocket</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.159" end="00:27:38.559" style="s2">and so we&#39;ve been talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.320" end="00:27:47.120" style="s2">and we then moved into</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:49.120" style="s2">the beginning of the talk around the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.120" end="00:27:50.799" style="s2">discussion about the stoics meant</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.120" end="00:27:52.880" style="s2">about physics or what i want to call</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.799" end="00:27:54.799" style="s2">psychophysics because again and again</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.880" end="00:27:57.919" style="s2">and again i want to emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.799" end="00:27:58.880" style="s2">it&#39;s about how we are making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.919" end="00:28:02.080" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.880" end="00:28:03.120" style="s2">so it&#39;s unlike modern physics um where</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.080" end="00:28:05.919" style="s2">we&#39;re just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.120" end="00:28:07.120" style="s2">right concentrate on the sense made</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.919" end="00:28:09.760" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get the best</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.120" end="00:28:10.399" style="s2">possible interpretation of the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.760" end="00:28:12.399" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.399" end="00:28:13.840" style="s2">all right so that process is always</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.399" end="00:28:15.760" style="s2">going on either</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.840" end="00:28:17.919" style="s2">explicitly in scientific physics or</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.760" end="00:28:20.799" style="s2">implicitly as we move around the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.919" end="00:28:22.399" style="s2">but what the stoics want us to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.799" end="00:28:23.760" style="s2">is we want we want to learn the best</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.399" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">science we can here</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.760" end="00:28:28.240" style="s2">but we want to pay attention to the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:29.919" style="s2">we have internalized that</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.240" end="00:28:31.520" style="s2">and to what degree we have internalized</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.919" end="00:28:34.720" style="s2">it well in our</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.520" end="00:28:38.080" style="s2">interpretive judgments so this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.720" end="00:28:40.720" style="s2">typically known as this is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:41.679" style="s2">training of desire this is and what that</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.720" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">means is</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.679" end="00:28:47.120" style="s2">right the the the the sets of</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:48.159" style="s2">wants and needs and drives and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.120" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">motivations</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.159" end="00:28:52.799" style="s2">that emerge from how we deem the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:54.960" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.799" end="00:28:56.080" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of things there that</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.960" end="00:28:58.480" style="s2">we&#39;re engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.080" end="00:28:59.200" style="s2">in order to train desire uh we talked</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.480" end="00:29:02.000" style="s2">last time</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.200" end="00:29:03.200" style="s2">about uh what i was taught to call</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.000" end="00:29:05.200" style="s2">objective seeing</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.200" end="00:29:06.399" style="s2">what mclennan calls physical description</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.200" end="00:29:09.039" style="s2">which rosario calls</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.399" end="00:29:11.120" style="s2">uh no bizarre calls physical description</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.039" end="00:29:15.840" style="s2">but cloning calls neutral description</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.120" end="00:29:15.840" style="s2">and so the idea here is when i am</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:19.760" style="s2">confronting some situation uh what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.039" end="00:29:22.640" style="s2">typically</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.760" end="00:29:24.720" style="s2">happening is i&#39;m investing it or to use</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.640" end="00:29:28.000" style="s2">more modern language i&#39;m projecting</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.720" end="00:29:31.360" style="s2">into it um all kinds of meanings</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.000" end="00:29:33.039" style="s2">and values that insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.360" end="00:29:35.600" style="s2">i&#39;m desiring the object now remember</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.039" end="00:29:38.320" style="s2">desire is is meant here broadly means</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.600" end="00:29:40.399" style="s2">uh both how i&#39;m desiring the object but</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.320" end="00:29:41.120" style="s2">i may also be desiring the removal of</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.399" end="00:29:43.039" style="s2">the object</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.120" end="00:29:44.960" style="s2">because it could be something painful or</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.039" end="00:29:48.320" style="s2">unpleasant or unwanted</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.960" end="00:29:49.279" style="s2">or disagreeable etc so what i&#39;m doing in</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.320" end="00:29:51.440" style="s2">the psychophysics</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.279" end="00:29:52.320" style="s2">and especially with the uh objective</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.440" end="00:29:56.000" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.320" end="00:29:59.520" style="s2">is i&#39;m trying now to withdraw projection</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.000" end="00:30:01.200" style="s2">so in the epoche right in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.520" end="00:30:04.240" style="s2">in the psychologic i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.200" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">withhold ascent and assertion</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.240" end="00:30:08.159" style="s2">in the psychophysics i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:10.880" style="s2">withdraw projection</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.159" end="00:30:12.320" style="s2">and so what is the most prominent kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.880" end="00:30:14.080" style="s2">of projection</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.320" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">that we need to step back and withdraw</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.080" end="00:30:18.240" style="s2">from and this comes from</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:19.679" style="s2">again the stoic idea part of it of</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.240" end="00:30:22.159" style="s2">course is modal confusion</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.679" end="00:30:23.200" style="s2">and those are broad themes but one of</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.159" end="00:30:26.080" style="s2">the things i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.200" end="00:30:26.640" style="s2">talked about most was we want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.080" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">withdraw</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.640" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">narrative projection</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.440" end="00:30:39.679" style="s2">so narrative projection is right</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.559" end="00:30:42.720" style="s2">to see a story unfolding and a story is</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.679" end="00:30:46.080" style="s2">always a way of interpreting a situation</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.720" end="00:30:46.080" style="s2">according to desire</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:51.279" style="s2">and so one of the things for example how</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.480" end="00:30:53.360" style="s2">i try to practice this</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.279" end="00:30:55.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s a challenging practice for</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:56.640" style="s2">me but it&#39;s a very good practice</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.200" end="00:30:59.039" style="s2">i&#39;ll be in a situation and will</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.640" end="00:31:00.640" style="s2">something will happen and i&#39;ll get angry</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.039" end="00:31:02.799" style="s2">and i&#39;ll realize you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.640" end="00:31:04.559" style="s2">uh you know i can&#39;t move this i hate</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.799" end="00:31:06.720" style="s2">doing this i start to tweak</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.559" end="00:31:08.960" style="s2">as if there&#39;s a story here as if this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.720" end="00:31:11.440" style="s2">an agent as this is it</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.960" end="00:31:12.799" style="s2">as if it has motives and what i do is i</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.440" end="00:31:14.640" style="s2">step back</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.799" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">and i say wait there&#39;s no story going on</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.640" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">here there&#39;s no agent</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.720" end="00:31:22.159" style="s2">going on here all there is is my desire</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.840" end="00:31:22.960" style="s2">for a certain outcome so i would draw</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.159" end="00:31:26.559" style="s2">the projection</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.960" end="00:31:27.200" style="s2">i&#39;d leave i i let the art we say this</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.559" end="00:31:28.720" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.200" end="00:31:30.640" style="s2">and this heidegger took this from</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.720" end="00:31:32.720" style="s2">meister eckhart the laser knight</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.640" end="00:31:34.240" style="s2">i let this is i&#39;m trying to get you to</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.720" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">understand this very deeply i hope i</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.240" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">hope i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:41.120" style="s2">being successful i let the objects</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.080" end="00:31:43.919" style="s2">be as they in are they</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.120" end="00:31:45.600" style="s2">as they those objects are in themselves</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.919" end="00:31:49.600" style="s2">that&#39;s the physics i let them</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.600" end="00:31:51.919" style="s2">be in my practice with objective seeing</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.600" end="00:31:53.919" style="s2">right or physical description or neutral</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.919" end="00:31:54.240" style="s2">description i can bring that in and say</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.919" end="00:31:56.799" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.240" end="00:31:57.600" style="s2">all it is here&#39;s a you know a certain</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.799" end="00:31:59.760" style="s2">amount of matter</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.600" end="00:32:01.919" style="s2">taking up this and that helps me</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.760" end="00:32:04.159" style="s2">withdraw narrative projections</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.919" end="00:32:05.120" style="s2">and we we like narrative a lot and in</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.159" end="00:32:06.799" style="s2">fact when people</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.120" end="00:32:08.720" style="s2">often when i first present this to</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:11.519" style="s2">people they get upset and they say well</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.720" end="00:32:13.519" style="s2">no but uh like narrative is narrative</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.519" end="00:32:16.640" style="s2">and narrative and myth and story and</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.519" end="00:32:18.480" style="s2">all of that is important and as many of</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.640" end="00:32:21.919" style="s2">you know i talk about that at length</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.480" end="00:32:24.000" style="s2">but what the stoics remind us is</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.919" end="00:32:24.960" style="s2">something that i hope has become clear</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.000" end="00:32:27.600" style="s2">through a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.960" end="00:32:28.480" style="s2">what we&#39;ve been learning the processes</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.600" end="00:32:31.600" style="s2">that make us</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.480" end="00:32:35.120" style="s2">adaptive are the very processes</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.600" end="00:32:37.919" style="s2">that subject us to self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.120" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">narrative is adaptive it helps us to</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.919" end="00:32:42.399" style="s2">extend</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:45.039" style="s2">our sense of time and identity</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.399" end="00:32:45.760" style="s2">so that we can engage in long-term</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.039" end="00:32:47.440" style="s2">planning</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.760" end="00:32:49.120" style="s2">and we can better understand human</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.440" end="00:32:51.440" style="s2">motives in situations</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.120" end="00:32:52.320" style="s2">and we can better uh pick up on people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.440" end="00:32:55.600" style="s2">character</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.320" end="00:32:56.880" style="s2">this is all valuable stuff totally</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.600" end="00:32:59.279" style="s2">valuable</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.880" end="00:33:00.720" style="s2">but again the central lesson that which</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.279" end="00:33:03.440" style="s2">makes us adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.720" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">is also that which is right the source</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.440" end="00:33:07.840" style="s2">of our self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:10.480" style="s2">and so a lot of the time we are engaging</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.840" end="00:33:12.320" style="s2">in narrative projection</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.480" end="00:33:14.320" style="s2">and so what we want to do is we want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.320" end="00:33:17.519" style="s2">stop and withdraw that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.320" end="00:33:18.799" style="s2">let things be fuseus</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.519" end="00:33:20.720" style="s2">that&#39;s where we get the word physics</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.799" end="00:33:22.159" style="s2">who&#39;s this means how things spring out</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.720" end="00:33:23.519" style="s2">of themselves how they grow</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.159" end="00:33:26.640" style="s2">of themselves how they are</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.519" end="00:33:30.320" style="s2">self-organized independently</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.640" end="00:33:33.600" style="s2">of me and that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.320" end="00:33:35.120" style="s2">uh precisely because as i said we even</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.600" end="00:33:38.320" style="s2">create entire</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.120" end="00:33:41.760" style="s2">popular culture forms of entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.320" end="00:33:42.399" style="s2">that try and tell us that narrative is</p>

<p begin="00:33:49.919" end="00:33:53.519" style="s2">to make sure that the lovers find each</p>

<p begin="00:33:53.519" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">and that the the obstacles overcome and</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.760" end="00:34:00.640" style="s2">that is all</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:01.039" style="s2">it&#39;s all wishful that&#39;s not we</p>

<p begin="00:34:01.039" end="00:34:04.799" style="s2">at some level but we say well it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.360" end="00:34:06.640" style="s2">entertainment the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.799" end="00:34:07.919" style="s2">parts of your brain don&#39;t distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.640" end="00:34:10.320" style="s2">between entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.919" end="00:34:11.119" style="s2">and real perception it is hard for you</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.320" end="00:34:13.359" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.119" end="00:34:15.280" style="s2">if i do the following for you ask you to</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.359" end="00:34:16.480" style="s2">you&#39;re in a room ask you imagine doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.280" end="00:34:17.839" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.480" end="00:34:19.359" style="s2">and then i asked you four weeks later</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.839" end="00:34:21.040" style="s2">did you do that something or did you</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.359" end="00:34:23.040" style="s2">only imagine doing it you won&#39;t be able</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.040" end="00:34:26.399" style="s2">to tell the difference</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.040" end="00:34:29.839" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s very very important</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.399" end="00:34:32.240" style="s2">to try and as much as possible practice</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.839" end="00:34:34.079" style="s2">the psychophysics the objective scene</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.240" end="00:34:36.560" style="s2">helps us to do this of withdrawing</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.079" end="00:34:39.599" style="s2">projection</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.560" end="00:34:41.520" style="s2">we also uh did the view from above</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.599" end="00:34:43.359" style="s2">and the view from above gets you to</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.520" end="00:34:44.320" style="s2">withdraw from the first person</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.359" end="00:34:46.639" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.320" end="00:34:48.639" style="s2">so you&#39;re withholding right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.639" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">withholding ascent and assertion</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.639" end="00:34:52.159" style="s2">in this psychologic and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:53.440" style="s2">psychophysics one thing you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.159" end="00:34:55.359" style="s2">you withdrawing</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.440" end="00:34:57.280" style="s2">right you&#39;re withdrawing projections and</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.359" end="00:35:00.640" style="s2">another one is you withdrawing from</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.280" end="00:35:01.440" style="s2">the first person perspective in the view</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.640" end="00:35:04.160" style="s2">from above</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.440" end="00:35:06.079" style="s2">because that affords you taking a more</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.160" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">comprehensive perspective</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.079" end="00:35:09.440" style="s2">so that you can do something analogous</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:13.440" style="s2">to internalizing</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.440" end="00:35:14.960" style="s2">the sage so</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.440" end="00:35:17.119" style="s2">there are other practices for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.960" end="00:35:19.599" style="s2">psychophysics one that is recommended</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.119" end="00:35:20.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear how you do it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.599" end="00:35:22.480" style="s2">analogous to some of the buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.880" end="00:35:24.960" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.480" end="00:35:25.520" style="s2">you periodically reflect and remind</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.960" end="00:35:28.240" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.520" end="00:35:30.000" style="s2">on how interconnected everything is how</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.240" end="00:35:32.880" style="s2">interconnected everything is</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.000" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">and then aligned with that the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.880" end="00:35:37.760" style="s2">again very similar to the buddhists</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:40.079" style="s2">uh had us constantly remember</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.760" end="00:35:42.480" style="s2">how impermanent everything is and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.079" end="00:35:45.119" style="s2">idea is these two things are actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.480" end="00:35:46.320" style="s2">um uh different sides of the same coin</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.119" end="00:35:48.160" style="s2">we like the first one everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.320" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">interconnected oh that&#39;s fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.160" end="00:35:51.839" style="s2">but the thing the fact that everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.680" end="00:35:54.480" style="s2">interconnected means that every</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.839" end="00:35:57.119" style="s2">nothing is completely self-sustaining</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.480" end="00:35:59.040" style="s2">everything is down to everything else</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.119" end="00:36:00.400" style="s2">and therefore everything is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.040" end="00:36:03.040" style="s2">impermanent</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.400" end="00:36:03.599" style="s2">so the stoics have a very challenging</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.040" end="00:36:08.960" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.599" end="00:36:08.960" style="s2">associated with this pre-meditation</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.000" end="00:36:13.440" style="s2">and what&#39;s pre-meditation pre-meditation</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.480" end="00:36:15.440" style="s2">is the act</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.440" end="00:36:17.200" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like it&#39;s analogous in its</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.440" end="00:36:18.880" style="s2">application not in its content</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.200" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">to how you apply the five training</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.880" end="00:36:22.800" style="s2">precepts the five training precepts</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:25.040" style="s2">are ways of trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.800" end="00:36:26.960" style="s2">opportunities for applying mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.040" end="00:36:28.640" style="s2">and realizing wisdom uh in</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.960" end="00:36:31.839" style="s2">pre-meditation what you do</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:34.320" style="s2">is you practice again this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.839" end="00:36:35.680" style="s2">the way you&#39;re talking to yourself dear</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.320" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">logos with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.680" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">you practice reminding yourself of</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:45.440" style="s2">the fatality of all things fatality</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.079" end="00:36:47.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean just mortal right</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.440" end="00:36:49.040" style="s2">it means that everything is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.920" end="00:36:52.160" style="s2">finite</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.040" end="00:36:56.560" style="s2">subject to failure and subject</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.160" end="00:36:58.880" style="s2">to impermanence in a way that is beyond</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.560" end="00:37:00.960" style="s2">your control beyond my control beyond</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.880" end="00:37:03.839" style="s2">our control</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.960" end="00:37:05.920" style="s2">and so the stoics have some very they um</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.839" end="00:37:06.880" style="s2">have some very challenging practices</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.920" end="00:37:08.880" style="s2">around this</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.880" end="00:37:10.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s recommended by buzari and i i</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.880" end="00:37:11.520" style="s2">agree with this you don&#39;t start with</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.400" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">pre-meditation</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.520" end="00:37:14.800" style="s2">you do this after you&#39;ve been doing all</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:18.560" style="s2">the other practices</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.800" end="00:37:20.960" style="s2">but when you kiss your beloved</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.560" end="00:37:23.119" style="s2">good night say to yourself i&#39;m kissing</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.960" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">immortal</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.119" end="00:37:28.160" style="s2">i&#39;m kissing a mortal</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.240" end="00:37:30.400" style="s2">when you see one of your cherished</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.160" end="00:37:33.119" style="s2">objects here&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.400" end="00:37:35.359" style="s2">i really really uh you know like these</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.119" end="00:37:36.960" style="s2">shoes</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.359" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">this is a thing that will pass away</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.960" end="00:37:41.200" style="s2">these shoes that i like so much will</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:41.200" style="s2">pass away</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.760" end="00:37:46.000" style="s2">see the idea is to stop and remind</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.800" end="00:37:48.240" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.000" end="00:37:50.079" style="s2">that everything everything you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.240" end="00:37:52.640" style="s2">encountering even</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.079" end="00:37:54.960" style="s2">even the most beloved of things are</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.640" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">impermanent in fact your love</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t render them permanent</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.440" end="00:38:06.480" style="s2">we want to believe it does</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.800" end="00:38:09.599" style="s2">we really do we have myths around that</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.480" end="00:38:14.000" style="s2">like that somehow love gives us</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.599" end="00:38:16.839" style="s2">an access to the permanence of things</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.000" end="00:38:18.640" style="s2">but the stoics challenge that and they</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.839" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">say all that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.640" end="00:38:23.599" style="s2">ultimately permanent and eternal it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:24.560" style="s2">the logos of the universe that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.599" end="00:38:28.079" style="s2">there and now</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.560" end="00:38:31.280" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re god it&#39;s that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.079" end="00:38:32.640" style="s2">ongoing patterning of reality that makes</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.280" end="00:38:35.839" style="s2">it intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.640" end="00:38:37.839" style="s2">for us and makes it a possible arena</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.839" end="00:38:39.200" style="s2">in which we can cultivate wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.839" end="00:38:42.320" style="s2">virtue that</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.200" end="00:38:44.720" style="s2">for the stoics the logos</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.320" end="00:38:45.599" style="s2">that which gathers together and orders</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.720" end="00:38:49.520" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.599" end="00:38:53.040" style="s2">so that our logos via logos</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.520" end="00:38:55.119" style="s2">is possible that is what is eternal for</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.040" end="00:38:57.119" style="s2">the stoics everything else</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.119" end="00:38:58.240" style="s2">is constantly arising and passing away</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.119" end="00:39:01.119" style="s2">and in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.240" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">it is very similar to buddhism and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.119" end="00:39:04.560" style="s2">the doctrine of impermanence and</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:08.079" style="s2">non-open and many people have noted</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.560" end="00:39:11.839" style="s2">that and so the the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.079" end="00:39:13.040" style="s2">try to get you to the point here is not</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.839" end="00:39:15.119" style="s2">to crush your love</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.040" end="00:39:16.640" style="s2">that&#39;s that it&#39;s almost it is that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.119" end="00:39:18.640" style="s2">mistake remember in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.640" end="00:39:19.839" style="s2">in buddhism in the middle path right</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.640" end="00:39:21.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.839" end="00:39:23.200" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get in between</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.040" end="00:39:26.160" style="s2">self-indulgence and self-denial</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.200" end="00:39:28.240" style="s2">the point here is not to deny your love</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.160" end="00:39:30.480" style="s2">it&#39;s to realize your love</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.240" end="00:39:31.280" style="s2">it is to realize that you are loving</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.480" end="00:39:33.359" style="s2">immortal</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.280" end="00:39:35.440" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean you should stop loving</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.359" end="00:39:38.320" style="s2">it means you should pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.440" end="00:39:40.320" style="s2">how you are loving and what you what</p>

<p begin="00:45:31.200" end="00:45:34.880" style="s2">very helpful this is your second nature</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.920" end="00:45:38.240" style="s2">so that it becomes</p>

<p begin="00:45:47.280" end="00:45:52.079" style="s2">is thought to be the experience of joy</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.480" end="00:45:54.079" style="s2">i do think though that there are</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.079" end="00:45:55.760" style="s2">significant differences between taoism</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.079" end="00:45:58.400" style="s2">we&#39;re trying not to try</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.760" end="00:45:59.280" style="s2">is i think the central thing and</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.400" end="00:46:01.359" style="s2">stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.280" end="00:46:02.880" style="s2">which has a much more deliberative</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.359" end="00:46:05.599" style="s2">top-down aspect</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.880" end="00:46:06.640" style="s2">i i recommend and this is what i found</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.599" end="00:46:09.599" style="s2">in my own</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.640" end="00:46:10.640" style="s2">uh practice that the eastern traditions</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.599" end="00:46:12.800" style="s2">tend to be more</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.640" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">emphasized bottom-up and that&#39;s why they</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.800" end="00:46:16.160" style="s2">emphasize the spontaneous emergence and</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:18.800" style="s2">the trying not to try</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.160" end="00:46:20.720" style="s2">you see that i think at the core of</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.800" end="00:46:22.960" style="s2">buddhism and taoism</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.720" end="00:46:24.800" style="s2">the western traditions are much more uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.960" end="00:46:26.400" style="s2">top down and deliberative and</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.800" end="00:46:28.480" style="s2">they&#39;re much more disciplined in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.400" end="00:46:29.680" style="s2">sense of the discipline originally means</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.480" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">following it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.680" end="00:46:33.520" style="s2">punishing it means following and</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.599" end="00:46:35.280" style="s2">learning it doesn&#39;t mean punishing</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.520" end="00:46:37.359" style="s2">they&#39;re disciplining their top down</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.280" end="00:46:39.119" style="s2">discipline and given what i know as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.359" end="00:46:41.359" style="s2">cognitive scientist i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.119" end="00:46:43.200" style="s2">it&#39;s very clear you need both the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.359" end="00:46:44.480" style="s2">up buddhist and daoist strategies that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.200" end="00:46:46.880" style="s2">why i&#39;ve been teaching them to you</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.480" end="00:46:47.520" style="s2">but you need the top down epicurean</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.880" end="00:46:48.880" style="s2">stoic</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.520" end="00:46:50.400" style="s2">and neoplatonic strategies the</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.880" end="00:46:51.359" style="s2">interesting thing about the neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.400" end="00:46:53.920" style="s2">as we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.359" end="00:46:56.079" style="s2">is that what it basically does is it</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.920" end="00:46:58.880" style="s2">sort of takes the top down</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.079" end="00:46:59.680" style="s2">um to its limit so that it flips and</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.880" end="00:47:02.240" style="s2">inverts to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.680" end="00:47:02.720" style="s2">completely bottom up and there in many</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.240" end="00:47:04.800" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.720" end="00:47:06.000" style="s2">many people have noted this you know dt</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.800" end="00:47:07.680" style="s2">suzuki and others</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.000" end="00:47:11.839" style="s2">uh the deep similarities between</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.680" end="00:47:11.839" style="s2">neoplatonism and buddhism for example</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.240" end="00:47:16.960" style="s2">vita perez is asking what is the name of</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.119" end="00:47:18.000" style="s2">the stoic meditation authors he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.960" end="00:47:21.119" style="s2">referred to</p>

<p begin="00:47:32.800" end="00:47:35.359" style="s2">out that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.400" end="00:47:42.480" style="s2">um there&#39;s a question from the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.680" end="00:47:44.000" style="s2">tricer or the tricker uh i find it odd</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.480" end="00:47:46.079" style="s2">that we are digging most of the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.000" end="00:47:48.319" style="s2">from ancient creeks and since</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.079" end="00:47:50.480" style="s2">there was no one who was a new age plato</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.319" end="00:47:52.640" style="s2">or aristotle or any other one</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.480" end="00:47:53.760" style="s2">am i ignorant in this i&#39;m not quite</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.640" end="00:47:55.200" style="s2">understanding the question let me read</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.760" end="00:47:57.119" style="s2">it again i find that we&#39;re digging most</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:47:59.760" style="s2">of the wisdom from the ancient greeks</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.119" end="00:48:01.680" style="s2">and since then there was no one who was</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.760" end="00:48:04.800" style="s2">who was a new age plato</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.680" end="00:48:05.359" style="s2">or aristolees or anyone am i ignorant to</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.800" end="00:48:10.559" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.359" end="00:48:13.680" style="s2">um so i i i understand your question now</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.559" end="00:48:17.200" style="s2">the this has to do with a very long</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.680" end="00:48:20.200" style="s2">um historical argument about why</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.200" end="00:48:22.960" style="s2">philosophy as philosophia the</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.200" end="00:48:23.599" style="s2">aspirational and communitarian love for</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:25.440" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.599" end="00:48:26.720" style="s2">that we are practicing right here right</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.440" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">now why</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.720" end="00:48:30.160" style="s2">that fell into advance and why</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:32.839" style="s2">philosophy instead</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.160" end="00:48:35.280" style="s2">until very recently became this very</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.839" end="00:48:37.680" style="s2">technical uh conceptual analysis</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.280" end="00:48:39.440" style="s2">in order to address epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.680" end="00:48:42.559" style="s2">concerns around skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.440" end="00:48:45.520" style="s2">or the nature of science i i i i</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.559" end="00:48:46.960" style="s2">have got degrees in academic philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.520" end="00:48:47.599" style="s2">i think it gives me a valuable set of</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.960" end="00:48:49.599" style="s2">skills</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.599" end="00:48:50.960" style="s2">but what academic philosophy until very</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.599" end="00:48:52.960" style="s2">recently didn&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.960" end="00:48:55.200" style="s2">even though it&#39;s in the name of the term</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.960" end="00:48:56.800" style="s2">was wisdom and how to cultivate wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.200" end="00:48:58.720" style="s2">so it was the work of people like pierre</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.800" end="00:48:59.200" style="s2">hadou who you&#39;ve heard me recommend a</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.720" end="00:49:01.440" style="s2">lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.200" end="00:49:02.400" style="s2">who have brought back what is ancient</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.440" end="00:49:04.079" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.400" end="00:49:05.920" style="s2">and what is it like to practice</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.079" end="00:49:07.680" style="s2">philosophy as a way of life</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.920" end="00:49:09.440" style="s2">rather than an academic purely</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.680" end="00:49:12.640" style="s2">conceptual technical</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.440" end="00:49:14.640" style="s2">uh set of skills uh within uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.640" end="00:49:18.640" style="s2">some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.640" end="00:49:22.160" style="s2">academic institution and and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.640" end="00:49:25.359" style="s2">there have been philosophers who have</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.160" end="00:49:28.640" style="s2">uh brought recently or have brought</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.359" end="00:49:32.160" style="s2">back um the topic of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.640" end="00:49:33.680" style="s2">um and have started to uh re-understand</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.160" end="00:49:35.839" style="s2">philosophy more as a practice i</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.680" end="00:49:38.319" style="s2">mentioned the phenomenological tradition</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.839" end="00:49:40.160" style="s2">coming out of his role and this way of</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.319" end="00:49:41.920" style="s2">training attention and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.160" end="00:49:44.079" style="s2">and don id&#39;s book experimental</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.920" end="00:49:47.280" style="s2">phenomenology and then that tradition</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.079" end="00:49:50.960" style="s2">went into people like heidegger um and</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.280" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">what you get there is this tremendous um</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.960" end="00:49:55.200" style="s2">post height of you get a reflection on a</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.960" end="00:49:56.240" style="s2">lot of people trying to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.200" end="00:49:59.359" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.240" end="00:50:03.200" style="s2">um in a heideggerian vein that will</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.359" end="00:50:04.319" style="s2">allow us to recapture um a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.200" end="00:50:06.640" style="s2">ancient philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.319" end="00:50:08.240" style="s2">is so my good friend and colleague guy</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.640" end="00:50:09.119" style="s2">sandstock has created the circling</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.240" end="00:50:11.599" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.119" end="00:50:13.200" style="s2">as a way of doing that within what what</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.599" end="00:50:15.119" style="s2">is still properly called academic</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.200" end="00:50:18.240" style="s2">philosophy there has been the return</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.119" end="00:50:18.880" style="s2">to the discussion about the cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.240" end="00:50:20.960" style="s2">of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.880" end="00:50:23.040" style="s2">it&#39;s also been taken up very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.960" end="00:50:24.800" style="s2">now within psychology and within</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.040" end="00:50:26.079" style="s2">cognitive science and within that</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.800" end="00:50:27.760" style="s2">there are a lot of people doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.079" end="00:50:28.640" style="s2">excellent work both in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.760" end="00:50:31.119" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.640" end="00:50:33.280" style="s2">the sophia and the practice the</p>

<p begin="00:50:33.280" end="00:50:36.960" style="s2">so i hope that answers your question if</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.800" end="00:50:38.000" style="s2">you want that more long-term historical</p>

<p begin="00:51:00.480" end="00:51:05.839" style="s2">and and leave it into the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.839" end="00:51:07.599" style="s2">worldview and that&#39;s spinoza so you</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.839" end="00:51:09.280" style="s2">might want to take a look at spinoza as</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.599" end="00:51:12.240" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.280" end="00:51:14.720" style="s2">so mark lefebre do you have a list of</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.240" end="00:51:16.240" style="s2">sources for practices in suggested order</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.720" end="00:51:17.920" style="s2">how would i go about building that</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.240" end="00:51:19.680" style="s2">needing this for the ecology of practice</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.920" end="00:51:22.880" style="s2">schematization</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.680" end="00:51:24.480" style="s2">so um i that&#39;s something i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.880" end="00:51:27.280" style="s2">working on periodically i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.480" end="00:51:27.760" style="s2">i&#39;ve been in partnership with people um</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.280" end="00:51:29.359" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.760" end="00:51:30.960" style="s2">what happened is that those various</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.359" end="00:51:31.760" style="s2">partnerships have been fragmented and</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.960" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">frayed</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.760" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">uh largely because of covet um</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.000" end="00:51:43.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not stopping in here</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.520" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">mine&#39;s also stopped</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.599" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">it&#39;s back sorry for that interruption um</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.280" end="00:52:03.520" style="s2">mark what i was saying is i i you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:04.960" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna do as much good work as i can</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.520" end="00:52:07.839" style="s2">in a top-down fashion but</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.960" end="00:52:08.319" style="s2">i&#39;m also hoping to get a lot of feedback</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.839" end="00:52:10.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.319" end="00:52:12.640" style="s2">you know existential experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.720" end="00:52:14.160" style="s2">within the discord server community</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.640" end="00:52:15.760" style="s2">about how things are fitting together</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.160" end="00:52:18.880" style="s2">and how pieces fit together</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.760" end="00:52:21.280" style="s2">hopefully with with really good and</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.880" end="00:52:22.559" style="s2">cooperative philia within distributed</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.280" end="00:52:25.599" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.559" end="00:52:27.680" style="s2">we can come up with a very good answer</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.599" end="00:52:29.119" style="s2">to that very central question</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.680" end="00:52:30.480" style="s2">like i said i&#39;m doing some work on it</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.119" end="00:52:30.720" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be some publication on</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.480" end="00:52:33.280" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.720" end="00:52:35.200" style="s2">soon um but there&#39;s more that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.280" end="00:52:37.599" style="s2">much more that needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.200" end="00:52:38.400" style="s2">i also recommend we take a look um as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.599" end="00:52:41.839" style="s2">community at</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.400" end="00:52:44.319" style="s2">zac stein&#39;s really important work on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.839" end="00:52:45.680" style="s2">needed transformation in education uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.319" end="00:52:46.000" style="s2">it&#39;s called education and the time</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.680" end="00:52:47.599" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:49.440" style="s2">two worlds and some of the videos the</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.599" end="00:52:52.000" style="s2">discussions i&#39;ve had with zach</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.440" end="00:52:54.960" style="s2">especially as curated by andrew sweeney</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.000" end="00:52:57.920" style="s2">might be valuable in that project</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.960" end="00:52:58.800" style="s2">okay so um we have a question from</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.920" end="00:53:01.119" style="s2">random name</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.800" end="00:53:02.960" style="s2">what specific parts of spinoza do you</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.119" end="00:53:04.960" style="s2">recommend also have you looked into the</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.960" end="00:53:08.559" style="s2">use of peptides or</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.960" end="00:53:10.400" style="s2">cognitive enhancer um so i recommend the</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.559" end="00:53:11.680" style="s2">ethics</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.400" end="00:53:13.440" style="s2">actually i recommend getting the</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.680" end="00:53:15.520" style="s2">completed works i recommend</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.440" end="00:53:16.559" style="s2">going through the ethics reading a</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.520" end="00:53:18.559" style="s2">proposition</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.559" end="00:53:19.839" style="s2">and a proof on a daily basis i&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.559" end="00:53:22.160" style="s2">that a couple of times</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.839" end="00:53:23.680" style="s2">um there&#39;s a couple of there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.160" end="00:53:26.000" style="s2">of excellent books</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.680" end="00:53:27.440" style="s2">uh on i&#39;m actually going to go off</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.000" end="00:53:28.160" style="s2">camera for a sec because i want to get</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.440" end="00:53:30.720" style="s2">those books</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.160" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">i hadn&#39;t prepared this so please just</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.720" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">give me a second</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.359" end="00:54:03.359" style="s2">sorry for that but here&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.680" end="00:54:05.359" style="s2">excellent books on</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.359" end="00:54:07.280" style="s2">so read the ethics and then you there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.359" end="00:54:10.559" style="s2">the book called the spirit of spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.280" end="00:54:13.839" style="s2">healing the mind by neil grossman</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.559" end="00:54:13.839" style="s2">i&#39;ll just pull that up for a minute</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.520" end="00:54:23.119" style="s2">and then this is interesting especially</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.440" end="00:54:24.800" style="s2">when we talked about the pre-meditation</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.119" end="00:54:26.160" style="s2">today but</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.800" end="00:54:28.000" style="s2">you have to get into spinoza to</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.160" end="00:54:29.280" style="s2">understand how he&#39;s actually arguing for</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.000" end="00:54:31.599" style="s2">a form of stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.280" end="00:54:32.960" style="s2">and neoplatonism but then the next book</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.599" end="00:54:36.000" style="s2">is think least of death</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.960" end="00:54:36.839" style="s2">spinoza on how to live and how to die by</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.000" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">steve</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.839" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">nadler</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.640" end="00:54:44.400" style="s2">then i recommend for the primary text</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.960" end="00:54:46.000" style="s2">get the complete spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.400" end="00:54:47.680" style="s2">you could read the improvement of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.000" end="00:54:49.280" style="s2">understanding you could read the short</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.680" end="00:54:49.760" style="s2">treatise which is an excellent place to</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.280" end="00:54:51.680" style="s2">begin</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.760" end="00:54:53.200" style="s2">much more sort of spiritually written uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.680" end="00:54:53.680" style="s2">than some of his latest works and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.200" end="00:54:56.480" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.680" end="00:54:57.119" style="s2">uh but the main thing to get into is the</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.480" end="00:55:00.319" style="s2">ethics</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.119" end="00:55:02.480" style="s2">and read that um like read it</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.319" end="00:55:03.119" style="s2">religiously read a proposition and a</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.480" end="00:55:04.960" style="s2">proof</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.119" end="00:55:06.559" style="s2">reflect on it think about it through the</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.960" end="00:55:07.920" style="s2">day and then build and build and build</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.559" end="00:55:10.960" style="s2">and then try</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.920" end="00:55:13.280" style="s2">periodically to to see the whole</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.960" end="00:55:14.000" style="s2">in each proposition and then see how all</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.280" end="00:55:15.680" style="s2">the prophecies</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.000" end="00:55:17.119" style="s2">would fit together to make the whole and</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:19.040" style="s2">that will give you what spinoza called</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.119" end="00:55:21.680" style="s2">sciencia intuitiva you&#39;ll see the hole</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.040" end="00:55:23.280" style="s2">in the part and the parts in the hole</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.680" end="00:55:25.520" style="s2">and then that that suddenly becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.280" end="00:55:27.920" style="s2">lens by which you see the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.520" end="00:55:28.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s a powerful transformation</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.920" end="00:55:30.319" style="s2">that the inter</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.720" end="00:55:31.760" style="s2">the interaction with spinoza can afford</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.319" end="00:55:33.359" style="s2">spinoza is</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.760" end="00:55:35.680" style="s2">one of one of the philosophers that i</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.359" end="00:55:38.720" style="s2">deeply love</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.680" end="00:55:39.760" style="s2">because he represents uh one of the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.720" end="00:55:42.319" style="s2">epitome</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.760" end="00:55:43.920" style="s2">for me of an individual trying to bridge</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.319" end="00:55:47.119" style="s2">between spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.920" end="00:55:50.319" style="s2">and science and do it in a profound um</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.119" end="00:55:52.000" style="s2">way that is not just something you read</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.319" end="00:55:53.760" style="s2">about but as you read spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.000" end="00:55:56.480" style="s2">the act of reading spinoza is like</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.760" end="00:55:57.520" style="s2">lectio divina it is a spiritual exercise</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.480" end="00:55:58.720" style="s2">that is not only</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.520" end="00:56:00.799" style="s2">transforming your belief but</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.720" end="00:56:02.000" style="s2">transforming your very ways of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.799" end="00:56:03.599" style="s2">and ultimately your state of</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.000" end="00:56:04.559" style="s2">consciousness your very ways of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.599" end="00:56:06.480" style="s2">and being</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.559" end="00:56:08.000" style="s2">the only other person that i found that</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.480" end="00:56:11.119" style="s2">is like that</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.000" end="00:56:14.160" style="s2">is platinus so</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.119" end="00:56:16.640" style="s2">i think that&#39;s everything for today um</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.160" end="00:56:18.880" style="s2">so remember uh we&#39;re going to do the</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.640" end="00:56:22.160" style="s2">stoic meditations next saturday</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.880" end="00:56:24.400" style="s2">saturday sega uh 10 a.m eastern but</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.160" end="00:56:26.400" style="s2">i i would advise you to start reading</p>

<p begin="00:56:26.400" end="00:56:31.280" style="s2">as we start to prepare for</p>

<p begin="00:56:31.280" end="00:56:35.359" style="s2">neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.240" end="00:56:36.640" style="s2">and you&#39;re going to find it uh both more</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.359" end="00:56:38.640" style="s2">exciting</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.640" end="00:56:40.480" style="s2">and also more challenging than both</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.640" end="00:56:41.599" style="s2">stoicism and epicureanism at least</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.480" end="00:56:43.760" style="s2">that&#39;s what i predict</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.599" end="00:56:45.359" style="s2">so thank you all very much for your time</p>

<p begin="00:56:52.880" end="00:56:56.079" style="s2">is a little less jarring than the weird</p>
