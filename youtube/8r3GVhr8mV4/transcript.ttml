<p begin="00:02:15.990" end="00:02:21.000" style="s2">together we have our virtual assignment</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.300" end="00:02:27.140" style="s2">and let&#39;s remember that as we said okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.000" end="00:02:27.140" style="s2">well begin what I say begin begin</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.960" end="00:02:54.020" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.289" end="00:17:36.470" style="s2">slowly begin to come out of your</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.220" end="00:17:38.149" style="s2">practice trying as best you can to</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.470" end="00:17:40.100" style="s2">integrate what you cultivated in your</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.149" end="00:17:42.799" style="s2">practice with your everyday</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.100" end="00:17:51.649" style="s2">consciousness and cognition coming out</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.799" end="00:17:53.480" style="s2">of your sit is part of the practice so</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.649" end="00:17:58.190" style="s2">we have some time for a couple questions</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.480" end="00:18:01.159" style="s2">here on from our health it&#39;s good to see</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.190" end="00:18:02.809" style="s2">you and mark is there an alternative set</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.159" end="00:18:04.759" style="s2">of familiar questions for meta these</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.809" end="00:18:09.080" style="s2">specific types of people are problematic</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.759" end="00:18:11.029" style="s2">for me it&#39;s hard to know how to answer</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.080" end="00:18:12.139" style="s2">that question mark without knowing a</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.029" end="00:18:13.070" style="s2">little bit more about in what way</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.139" end="00:18:14.330" style="s2">they&#39;re problematic</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.070" end="00:18:17.539" style="s2">they&#39;re problematic because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.330" end="00:18:19.720" style="s2">bringing up all kinds of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.539" end="00:18:22.190" style="s2">powerful emotions and associations</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.720" end="00:18:25.249" style="s2">working with maybe just one of those in</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.190" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">meta until that starts to on its own</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.249" end="00:18:31.850" style="s2">dissipate a bit and you can start to get</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.600" end="00:18:34.850" style="s2">back from being locked into a particular</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.850" end="00:18:37.519" style="s2">emotional frame with them might be what</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.850" end="00:18:40.249" style="s2">you want to pursue if it&#39;s problematic</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.519" end="00:18:42.519" style="s2">for reasons perhaps of trauma or other</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.249" end="00:18:49.039" style="s2">things that I don&#39;t want to pry into</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.519" end="00:18:53.480" style="s2">then you might want to just do Metta try</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.039" end="00:18:56.659" style="s2">doing Metta towards yourself initially</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.480" end="00:19:00.350" style="s2">and then just try doing Metta towards</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.659" end="00:19:02.450" style="s2">all beings first of all people and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.350" end="00:19:05.570" style="s2">perhaps all living beings may be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.450" end="00:19:09.080" style="s2">reorientation into a more primordial on</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.570" end="00:19:13.159" style="s2">stance with what help again it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.080" end="00:19:15.409" style="s2">give you specific things as I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.159" end="00:19:17.450" style="s2">quite clear on how these people are</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.409" end="00:19:21.259" style="s2">problematic to you so those are two</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.450" end="00:19:22.909" style="s2">things so both of my speculations might</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.259" end="00:19:24.559" style="s2">be incorrect and I apologize if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.909" end="00:19:27.139" style="s2">the case but if there&#39;s the deep</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.559" end="00:19:29.269" style="s2">emotional issue then find one person I</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.139" end="00:19:31.759" style="s2">just do met it with them stay with them</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.269" end="00:19:34.100" style="s2">and realized that what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.759" end="00:19:36.529" style="s2">do as much as possible is let that</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.100" end="00:19:38.899" style="s2">powder a noose in a bit so you can start</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.529" end="00:19:40.190" style="s2">to unlock from the particular emotional</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.899" end="00:19:43.250" style="s2">situation member</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.190" end="00:19:47.210" style="s2">is not this is not you trying to become</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.250" end="00:19:49.909" style="s2">contrite or forgive this is just trying</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.210" end="00:19:52.669" style="s2">to unlock unlock a pattern that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.909" end="00:19:56.090" style="s2">might be locked into if it&#39;s more that</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.669" end="00:19:58.940" style="s2">there&#39;s issues here sort of perhaps from</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.090" end="00:20:00.649" style="s2">trauma or other things like that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.940" end="00:20:02.990" style="s2">therefore it&#39;s not the right time to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.649" end="00:20:05.509" style="s2">this I get that like I said maybe just</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.990" end="00:20:08.870" style="s2">towards all people and then towards all</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.509" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">living beings start with yourself than</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.870" end="00:20:12.500" style="s2">all people</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:14.539" style="s2">so skip specific people for now but you</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.500" end="00:20:16.730" style="s2">still try to get that expansive openness</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.539" end="00:20:22.279" style="s2">and that trying to unlock the move the</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.730" end="00:20:25.580" style="s2">reciprocal morna&#39;s now from Philip 86</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.279" end="00:20:27.230" style="s2">myt this is the 100th question so thank</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.580" end="00:20:29.299" style="s2">you Philip this is the 100th question</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.230" end="00:20:31.549" style="s2">already we&#39;re already at 100 questions</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.299" end="00:20:33.799" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s amazing keep it up guys keep</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.549" end="00:20:35.899" style="s2">up these great questions routing is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.799" end="00:20:37.639" style="s2">new technique and becomes intensely</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.899" end="00:20:39.980" style="s2">distracted just at the back channel</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.639" end="00:20:41.960" style="s2">consistently why is there a location</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.980" end="00:20:45.259" style="s2">specific trigger for the default mode</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.960" end="00:20:46.879" style="s2">network leading to storytelling so those</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.259" end="00:20:51.740" style="s2">of you who don&#39;t know Philip is invoking</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.879" end="00:20:54.470" style="s2">a very prevalent theory glute Theory</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.740" end="00:20:57.080" style="s2">from a neuroscience that we have to two</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.470" end="00:20:58.850" style="s2">kinds of attentional networks we have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.080" end="00:21:00.200" style="s2">task focused network as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.850" end="00:21:02.419" style="s2">which is what we use when we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.200" end="00:21:03.980" style="s2">to concentrate on a task and then we</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.419" end="00:21:06.830" style="s2">have to default in the mode Network when</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.980" end="00:21:08.870" style="s2">we look inside and that tends to get us</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.830" end="00:21:10.460" style="s2">into mental time travel and mind</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.870" end="00:21:13.129" style="s2">watering and what we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.460" end="00:21:14.870" style="s2">actually in meditation is Co activate</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.129" end="00:21:16.700" style="s2">because they&#39;re usually one is odd and</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.870" end="00:21:17.960" style="s2">shutting the other off because that chol</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.700" end="00:21:21.590" style="s2">activation is actually the most</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.960" end="00:21:23.509" style="s2">conducive for transformative insight so</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.590" end="00:21:26.049" style="s2">it sounds like for Philip when he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.509" end="00:21:28.190" style="s2">doing the back route he&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.049" end="00:21:30.169" style="s2">triggered so there&#39;s a practical</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.190" end="00:21:33.340" style="s2">question here I recommend that if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.169" end="00:21:36.830" style="s2">the case Philip see if you can go just</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.340" end="00:21:38.509" style="s2">maybe just do the center route just</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.830" end="00:21:40.159" style="s2">instead of doing front and then Center</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.509" end="00:21:42.049" style="s2">with leaving the back just do the center</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.159" end="00:21:43.850" style="s2">with a sense that it&#39;s sort of reaching</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.049" end="00:21:46.220" style="s2">gently into the front of the back and</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.850" end="00:21:48.200" style="s2">just go through the center route why</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.220" end="00:21:50.269" style="s2">particular areas trigger the default</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.200" end="00:21:51.669" style="s2">mode Network I don&#39;t know I mean I I</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.269" end="00:21:53.090" style="s2">don&#39;t think of what you&#39;re finding</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.669" end="00:21:55.190" style="s2">generalizes it</p>

<p begin="00:24:33.139" end="00:24:37.279" style="s2">learning and so if you&#39;re giving that</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.029" end="00:24:38.710" style="s2">survive right again that&#39;s because parts</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.279" end="00:24:41.059" style="s2">of the brain are talking to each other</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.710" end="00:24:43.220" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is a realization that</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.059" end="00:24:44.480" style="s2">there&#39;s an opportunity for learning here</p>

<p begin="00:24:51.379" end="00:24:54.980" style="s2">and parts of your brain don&#39;t get caught</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.690" end="00:24:56.840" style="s2">up in it that don&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.980" end="00:24:58.429" style="s2">definitely don&#39;t start framing it as</p>

<p begin="00:24:58.429" end="00:25:04.759" style="s2">your practice that is mentis is there a</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.440" end="00:25:07.730" style="s2">version of meditation that would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.759" end="00:25:10.970" style="s2">appropriate for children so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.730" end="00:25:15.369" style="s2">book meditating with children I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.970" end="00:25:20.059" style="s2">cautious about this because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.369" end="00:25:22.669" style="s2">know we don&#39;t have good research about</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.059" end="00:25:26.059" style="s2">the relationship between meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.669" end="00:25:27.590" style="s2">small children like children before the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.059" end="00:25:31.989" style="s2">age of formal operations like children</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.590" end="00:25:31.989" style="s2">younger than let&#39;s say you know 11 or 12</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.619" end="00:25:39.409" style="s2">so I&#39;m hesitant about this getting them</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.309" end="00:25:42.679" style="s2">to do the soft vigilance practice on</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.409" end="00:25:45.440" style="s2">things getting them to simply count</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.679" end="00:25:49.309" style="s2">their breaths and a little bit stablize</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.440" end="00:25:50.960" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s appropriate thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.309" end="00:25:52.399" style="s2">you can check out the book meditating</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.960" end="00:25:54.489" style="s2">for children it has some good</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.399" end="00:25:57.799" style="s2">recommendations you also want a much</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.489" end="00:25:58.389" style="s2">shorter term of practice but please</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.799" end="00:26:01.220" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.389" end="00:26:02.570" style="s2">don&#39;t push it very hard and don&#39;t try</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.220" end="00:26:05.059" style="s2">and get into the depths of the practice</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.570" end="00:26:06.649" style="s2">because we&#39;re very unclear from a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.059" end="00:26:08.600" style="s2">scientific perspective about how</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.649" end="00:26:11.090" style="s2">meditation or mindfulness we know they</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.600" end="00:26:13.759" style="s2">have important changes on the plasticity</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.090" end="00:26:16.220" style="s2">of the brain it really it literally</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.759" end="00:26:18.889" style="s2">changes the wiring of the brain and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.220" end="00:26:19.700" style="s2">the way that interacts with the course</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.889" end="00:26:22.610" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.700" end="00:26:24.790" style="s2">early development we don&#39;t know so me</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.610" end="00:26:28.250" style="s2">just I would suggest keeping it very</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.790" end="00:26:30.110" style="s2">very simple soft vigilance exercises</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.250" end="00:26:33.230" style="s2">with the kids counting their breaths</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.110" end="00:26:37.310" style="s2">keeping it short just something basic</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.230" end="00:26:39.230" style="s2">like that mark again when Rudy we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.310" end="00:26:40.550" style="s2">flow then we have flow at the next level</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.230" end="00:26:43.030" style="s2">are these actually the same or if</p>

<p begin="00:26:43.030" end="00:26:49.550" style="s2">they&#39;re there they&#39;re pretty much the</p>
