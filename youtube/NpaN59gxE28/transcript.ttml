<p begin="00:01:34.020" end="00:01:38.640" style="s2">had like I had no concept of what was</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.299" end="00:01:41.100" style="s2">possible like I had never done you need</p>

<p begin="00:01:41.100" end="00:01:46.729" style="s2">group process work like I was just very</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.470" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">much an automatic mood was my life and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.729" end="00:01:51.780" style="s2">it was amazing after our first event we</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:53.610" style="s2">spent hours sort of debriefing it and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.780" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">immediately changed our language changed</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.610" end="00:01:58.649" style="s2">the way we were relating to each other</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:02:00.990" style="s2">and we just started burning through you</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.649" end="00:02:03.360" style="s2">know like our first stuff you know like</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.990" end="00:02:05.759" style="s2">our material yeah I&#39;m just getting more</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.360" end="00:02:07.110" style="s2">intimate and more you know clothes and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.759" end="00:02:08.940" style="s2">like getting down to the heart of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.110" end="00:02:10.619" style="s2">real truth what was underneath you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.940" end="00:02:14.230" style="s2">all our behaviors all our surface</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.619" end="00:02:17.920" style="s2">behaviors right so I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.230" end="00:02:21.430" style="s2">the magic of that experience and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.920" end="00:02:24.610" style="s2">being on this rocket ship together had</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.430" end="00:02:26.110" style="s2">us like do all the events and then then</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.610" end="00:02:29.050" style="s2">the retraining is being offered so we</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.110" end="00:02:31.239" style="s2">took the trainings I&#39;m just really so</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.050" end="00:02:34.450" style="s2">believing in what this could do for us</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.239" end="00:02:37.180" style="s2">so um so yeah we took over the Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.450" end="00:02:40.380" style="s2">community about four and a half five</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.180" end="00:02:43.930" style="s2">years ago and started building it out</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.380" end="00:02:46.380" style="s2">adding more events and more facilitators</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.930" end="00:02:48.190" style="s2">and training them so that&#39;s sort of how</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.380" end="00:02:50.230" style="s2">that&#39;s been going</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.190" end="00:02:52.180" style="s2">but I mean all this work you know this</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.230" end="00:02:54.849" style="s2">authentic relating work is really falls</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.180" end="00:02:56.829" style="s2">under sort of an umbrella of relational</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.849" end="00:02:59.079" style="s2">leadership or more maybe more</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.829" end="00:03:02.950" style="s2">immaculately relational self leadership</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.079" end="00:03:04.599" style="s2">and then how do we bring ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.950" end="00:03:06.220" style="s2">how do we take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.599" end="00:03:10.090" style="s2">ourselves in relationship with other</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.220" end="00:03:12.549" style="s2">people and the frame for this is around</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.090" end="00:03:16.750" style="s2">authenticity and the way we hold</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.549" end="00:03:18.700" style="s2">authenticity is it&#39;s um it&#39;s more where</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.750" end="00:03:21.400" style="s2">our outward expression more accurately</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.700" end="00:03:23.739" style="s2">reflects our inner experience and this</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.400" end="00:03:26.410" style="s2">is a little bit different than say like</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.739" end="00:03:28.359" style="s2">a radical honesty practice we just share</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.410" end="00:03:30.160" style="s2">everything that comes in your mind right</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.359" end="00:03:31.930" style="s2">here this is sort of in service of</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.160" end="00:03:34.780" style="s2">something right so you know for example</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.930" end="00:03:37.329" style="s2">if I was upset with you and I I decided</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.780" end="00:03:39.700" style="s2">you were some excluded name you know in</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.329" end="00:03:41.430" style="s2">Frederica honesty I might just say that</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.700" end="00:03:44.500" style="s2">thing a little bigger</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.430" end="00:03:46.150" style="s2">and I think of relating I also might say</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.500" end="00:03:48.100" style="s2">that thing but probably more accurately</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.150" end="00:03:50.530" style="s2">it&#39;s just like you know like I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.100" end="00:03:52.930" style="s2">when like feeling really angry with you</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.530" end="00:03:54.370" style="s2">you know and then when we get really</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.930" end="00:03:55.989" style="s2">good at it we might notice something</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.370" end="00:03:58.230" style="s2">that&#39;s underneath it like and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.989" end="00:04:00.489" style="s2">because I&#39;m feeling a bit hurt that</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.230" end="00:04:02.650" style="s2">about that thing that you said you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.489" end="00:04:05.590" style="s2">so we start to sort of own our</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.650" end="00:04:07.930" style="s2">experience not make you responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.590" end="00:04:10.419" style="s2">make other people responsible for we</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.930" end="00:04:13.180" style="s2">sort of like take it back and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.419" end="00:04:16.060" style="s2">own it it&#39;s almost like a subtle shadow</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.180" end="00:04:18.190" style="s2">integration and that motion of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.060" end="00:04:21.729" style="s2">taking it back from you identifying the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.190" end="00:04:25.960" style="s2">right right yeah so that&#39;s um that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.729" end="00:04:27.440" style="s2">sort of the you know the basis for me or</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.960" end="00:04:31.460" style="s2">the way I fold authentically</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:34.250" style="s2">and can be sort of looked at as um as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.460" end="00:04:35.420" style="s2">way of being like a way to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.250" end="00:04:37.910" style="s2">world you know live through this</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.420" end="00:04:38.990" style="s2">relational self leadership but then</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.910" end="00:04:40.730" style="s2">there&#39;s things that are known as</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.990" end="00:04:42.380" style="s2">authentic relating practice which you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.730" end="00:04:45.530" style="s2">experienced and sort of the warm-ups</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.380" end="00:04:47.090" style="s2">that we do yes yes yeah and we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.530" end="00:04:49.250" style="s2">liken those to like going to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.090" end="00:04:51.380" style="s2">emotional workout gym you know so when</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.250" end="00:04:53.930" style="s2">you go to the normal gym you know you go</p>

<p begin="00:04:56.300" end="00:05:01.550" style="s2">and an authentic relating practice we</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.420" end="00:05:03.770" style="s2">might work on our empathy we might work</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.550" end="00:05:08.270" style="s2">on our listening skills you might work</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.770" end="00:05:10.970" style="s2">on noticing like bringing language to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.270" end="00:05:13.180" style="s2">our emotions and so that&#39;s so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.970" end="00:05:15.410" style="s2">pathetically can practice and encircling</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.180" end="00:05:17.540" style="s2">which I know you&#39;re familiar with but</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.410" end="00:05:20.240" style="s2">you know it&#39;s this we call it an</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.540" end="00:05:22.460" style="s2">intersubjective meditation practice it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.240" end="00:05:24.800" style="s2">like a group practice there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.460" end="00:05:28.010" style="s2">formats of it and slight variations to</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.800" end="00:05:29.330" style="s2">it but this also fall I consider this</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.010" end="00:05:31.250" style="s2">falling under authentic relating</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.330" end="00:05:33.710" style="s2">practice to me it&#39;s like the marathon</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.250" end="00:05:35.510" style="s2">you know we go to the gym so that we can</p>

<p begin="00:05:43.970" end="00:05:50.240" style="s2">last seven years and then I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.700" end="00:05:52.010" style="s2">about six months ago or so after</p>

<p begin="00:06:33.020" end="00:06:38.960" style="s2">around the emergence of some idea where</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.380" end="00:06:40.820" style="s2">as something that to me was a bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.960" end="00:06:42.440" style="s2">transcendent of circle</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.820" end="00:06:44.210" style="s2">right right they&#39;ll love circling I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:06:44.210" end="00:06:49.490" style="s2">circling I think it&#39;s critical and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.570" end="00:06:52.250" style="s2">intention that we bring encircling</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.490" end="00:06:55.460" style="s2">to really like be with you in your world</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.250" end="00:06:58.310" style="s2">as beautiful as it is is transformative</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.460" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">of a practice as it can be it also has</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.310" end="00:07:04.310" style="s2">some limitations and you know by trade</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:05.990" style="s2">I&#39;m a problem-solver you know before I</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.310" end="00:07:09.560" style="s2">got into this I wrote software I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.990" end="00:07:11.960" style="s2">software engineer right so my brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.560" end="00:07:14.180" style="s2">actually works really well for you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.960" end="00:07:15.740" style="s2">solving problems and and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.180" end="00:07:17.750" style="s2">bringing in this frame of sense making</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.740" end="00:07:19.220" style="s2">while I&#39;m like feeling really integrated</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.750" end="00:07:21.260" style="s2">with the circle I&#39;m like oh what can we</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.220" end="00:07:23.060" style="s2">do with this right right at the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.260" end="00:07:25.580" style="s2">time I&#39;m thinking about this I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.060" end="00:07:26.900" style="s2">sitting in one of your q and A&#39;s and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.580" end="00:07:30.800" style="s2">say oh what if we take circling like</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.900" end="00:07:32.570" style="s2">drop a problem into it okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.800" end="00:07:34.580" style="s2">talking about very similar things here</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.570" end="00:07:36.770" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s when I had contacted you</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.580" end="00:07:39.380" style="s2">said I can&#39;t answer to think about you</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.770" end="00:07:40.970" style="s2">know running a project to try to blend</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.380" end="00:07:42.740" style="s2">the first second and third person</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.970" end="00:07:44.690" style="s2">perspectives into a more whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.740" end="00:07:46.790" style="s2">discussion right right right</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.690" end="00:07:50.120" style="s2">because in my sense was circling we</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.790" end="00:07:51.860" style="s2">focused primarily on the eye and week we</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.120" end="00:07:53.270" style="s2">had a very first and second person we</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.860" end="00:07:55.460" style="s2">don&#39;t talk about a lot of content there</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.270" end="00:07:57.050" style="s2">I&#39;ve known people in this community for</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.460" end="00:07:58.790" style="s2">five years I have no idea to what they</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.050" end="00:08:02.330" style="s2">do for a job you know like that is not</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.790" end="00:08:05.450" style="s2">the way that we actually interact um but</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.330" end="00:08:09.530" style="s2">when it comes to like the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.450" end="00:08:11.090" style="s2">problems I&#39;m like oh my god I just see</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.530" end="00:08:13.460" style="s2">problems everywhere that&#39;s just my</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.090" end="00:08:16.190" style="s2">organization really it&#39;s a bit of a pain</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.460" end="00:08:22.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s a bit of a department too</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.190" end="00:08:24.050" style="s2">so you know pre Kovan pre-pandemic the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.040" end="00:08:26.060" style="s2">biggest pain that I was experiencing in</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.050" end="00:08:28.490" style="s2">my circles is sort of like ideological</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.060" end="00:08:30.860" style="s2">possession and polarities you know right</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.490" end="00:08:32.990" style="s2">like they&#39;re happening in society and</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.860" end="00:08:38.890" style="s2">just as clashing and it&#39;s just like wow</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.990" end="00:08:38.890" style="s2">why can&#39;t you know mmm this this sucks</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.070" end="00:08:44.390" style="s2">so uncomfortable and terrible and I I</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.780" end="00:08:47.120" style="s2">can from one side see it as like</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.390" end="00:08:48.770" style="s2">necessarily developmental stage for</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.120" end="00:08:51.650" style="s2">people to go through for society to go</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.770" end="00:08:54.450" style="s2">through and it&#39;s like surely we can do</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.650" end="00:08:58.550" style="s2">this better so that was sort of the fie</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.450" end="00:09:00.570" style="s2">that is sort of lit me up and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.550" end="00:09:02.630" style="s2">experimenting with trying to find a</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.570" end="00:09:07.529" style="s2">different way to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.630" end="00:09:10.380" style="s2">around polarities what sense happened</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.529" end="00:09:12.510" style="s2">since the pandemic has come is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.380" end="00:09:14.490" style="s2">that didn&#39;t feel so salient anymore I</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.510" end="00:09:16.680" style="s2">was like okay I mean that&#39;s still out</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.490" end="00:09:18.740" style="s2">there but I want to have a different</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.680" end="00:09:21.000" style="s2">kind of conversation and I want to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.740" end="00:09:25.079" style="s2">much more of a collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.000" end="00:09:27.180" style="s2">style conversation and that&#39;s been the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.079" end="00:09:30.570" style="s2">last few rounds if the experiment have</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.180" end="00:09:33.180" style="s2">really been not so much about the way in</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.570" end="00:09:36.300" style="s2">which we are saying but trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.180" end="00:09:39.510" style="s2">our relationship to the pandemic into</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.300" end="00:09:42.990" style="s2">coherence in the hopes that it might</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.510" end="00:09:45.540" style="s2">start to reveal some really strong</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.990" end="00:09:47.310" style="s2">insight or even internal motivation and</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.540" end="00:09:49.350" style="s2">to turn around and start moving into</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.310" end="00:09:53.459" style="s2">action right that&#39;s sort of been the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.350" end="00:09:54.779" style="s2">trajectory of it for me so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.459" end="00:09:58.500" style="s2">there wow that was great</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.779" end="00:10:00.000" style="s2">no no no don&#39;t apologize that that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.500" end="00:10:02.640" style="s2">I didn&#39;t interrupt it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.000" end="00:10:09.570" style="s2">unfolding really really was very smooth</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.640" end="00:10:13.290" style="s2">intelligibility so that obviously means</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.570" end="00:10:14.940" style="s2">that there&#39;s some ways in which you put</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.290" end="00:10:16.410" style="s2">your finger on a couple points but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.940" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">want you to go back and just unpack if</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.410" end="00:10:21.300" style="s2">you would please a little bit more about</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:26.519" style="s2">you know why is circling inadequate for</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.300" end="00:10:29.790" style="s2">the things you&#39;re pursuing here no and</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.519" end="00:10:31.829" style="s2">yeah and I will of course the caveat the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.790" end="00:10:33.240" style="s2">acknowledgement you love circling it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.829" end="00:10:35.339" style="s2">part of your way of life I get that</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.240" end="00:10:36.899" style="s2">that&#39;s not what I&#39;m asking I&#39;m asking</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.339" end="00:10:39.470" style="s2">you for the I&#39;m asking you for critique</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.899" end="00:10:44.220" style="s2">not just criticism yeah yeah for sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.470" end="00:10:46.140" style="s2">yeah so I think my perception of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.220" end="00:10:48.540" style="s2">circling although I might practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.140" end="00:10:49.829" style="s2">circling a little bit different than</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.540" end="00:10:52.829" style="s2">I&#39;ve always had a bit of an allowance</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.829" end="00:10:55.529" style="s2">but there&#39;s a tendency within circling</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.829" end="00:10:58.560" style="s2">of this sort of intention to to go</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.529" end="00:11:04.890" style="s2">really inward get into do a subjective</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.560" end="00:11:07.890" style="s2">and to explore the subjective and while</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.890" end="00:11:10.589" style="s2">I think our subjective relationship</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.890" end="00:11:13.769" style="s2">with whatever the third person problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.589" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">is per se is extremely important we</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.769" end="00:11:17.459" style="s2">don&#39;t tend to actually look at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.839" end="00:11:20.700" style="s2">problem the problem tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.459" end="00:11:25.260" style="s2">something like oh I&#39;m really hard on</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.700" end="00:11:27.829" style="s2">myself or I feel a lot of fear about</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.260" end="00:11:31.860" style="s2">being alone during the pandemic right</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.829" end="00:11:34.500" style="s2">and that you know might be you know an</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.860" end="00:11:36.269" style="s2">exploration of you know well you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.500" end="00:11:37.680" style="s2">what does that fear work where does it</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.269" end="00:11:40.260" style="s2">live in your body what does that feel</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.680" end="00:11:42.899" style="s2">like all very helpful and important</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.260" end="00:11:44.970" style="s2">explorations right but I think you sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.899" end="00:11:46.680" style="s2">of said something about this before -</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.970" end="00:11:48.600" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of like ok but now - now what</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.680" end="00:11:50.910" style="s2">do you do with that you know like where</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.600" end="00:11:54.180" style="s2">do you go from there so I think it</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.910" end="00:11:56.579" style="s2">affords great personal insight and and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.180" end="00:12:01.170" style="s2">see it as a fantastic personal growth</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.579" end="00:12:05.430" style="s2">tool but as I considered this this sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.170" end="00:12:07.470" style="s2">of this shift out or I&#39;ve been seeing it</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.430" end="00:12:11.480" style="s2">as a bit more of a I think you&#39;d call it</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.470" end="00:12:14.399" style="s2">in a Gaga you know sort of arise is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.480" end="00:12:18.089" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s still there we still had</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.399" end="00:12:20.820" style="s2">some some degree of insight into into</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.089" end="00:12:24.810" style="s2">our subjective but it also like seems to</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.820" end="00:12:28.589" style="s2">like bring something forward into the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.810" end="00:12:33.449" style="s2">space that men others can sort of play</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.589" end="00:12:36.089" style="s2">with and then form their relationships</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.449" end="00:12:37.649" style="s2">to it you know and we can sometimes do</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.089" end="00:12:40.350" style="s2">that and circling but again it comes</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.649" end="00:12:42.779" style="s2">right back to the individual and the eye</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.350" end="00:12:45.510" style="s2">and the subjective like oh it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.779" end="00:12:47.760" style="s2">bit different for me and again very</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.510" end="00:12:51.360" style="s2">important distinctions but we just tend</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.760" end="00:12:54.060" style="s2">to devalue the it the the thing we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.360" end="00:12:56.730" style="s2">come in with a problem we might talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.060" end="00:12:59.910" style="s2">about how we relate to the problem but</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.730" end="00:13:03.120" style="s2">we don&#39;t it doesn&#39;t afford much wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.910" end="00:13:08.250" style="s2">self wisdom sure but like collective</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.120" end="00:13:11.430" style="s2">wisdom and right bless certain yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.250" end="00:13:14.220" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which if you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.430" end="00:13:18.209" style="s2">this resonates you know that certainly</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.220" end="00:13:20.670" style="s2">the sort of really activates actualizes</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.209" end="00:13:21.750" style="s2">you know collective intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.670" end="00:13:24.570" style="s2">even puts it into this</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.750" end="00:13:26.460" style="s2">you know dynamic flow and and and people</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.570" end="00:13:28.980" style="s2">do note that they note that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.460" end="00:13:30.900" style="s2">we often get into you know - people will</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.980" end="00:13:33.900" style="s2">resonate and they&#39;ll do that subjective</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.900" end="00:13:36.330" style="s2">exploration facilitating each other but</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.900" end="00:13:37.890" style="s2">we we&#39;ve noted in circling that but</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.330" end="00:13:40.140" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.890" end="00:13:42.600" style="s2">the circle sort of weaves these things</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.140" end="00:13:46.290" style="s2">together and does can sometimes disclose</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.600" end="00:13:48.770" style="s2">something beyond the individual right so</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.290" end="00:13:51.690" style="s2">and when I and I remember there was one</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.770" end="00:13:53.310" style="s2">thing we were did where it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.690" end="00:13:55.200" style="s2">an introduction that you and I had at</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.310" end="00:13:57.960" style="s2">the end of a circling where the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.200" end="00:14:00.360" style="s2">shift in the locus of intimacy was off</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.960" end="00:14:02.610" style="s2">you and I being intimate with each other</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.360" end="00:14:04.190" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t that wasn&#39;t abandoned but</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.610" end="00:14:06.870" style="s2">that was back rounded and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.190" end="00:14:08.700" style="s2">platformed an intimacy with the process</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.870" end="00:14:11.850" style="s2">of intelligibility itself with the sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.700" end="00:14:15.930" style="s2">making process itself and so and that to</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.850" end="00:14:17.130" style="s2">me was a bit of a felt shift and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.930" end="00:14:20.250" style="s2">there&#39;s a possibility that once we</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.130" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2">activate it and actualize it we could we</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.250" end="00:14:25.410" style="s2">could couple to it we could we could we</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:27.210" style="s2">could like sail on the wave of intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.410" end="00:14:30.450" style="s2">if you don&#39;t owe me some metaphors here</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.210" end="00:14:32.640" style="s2">Jordan halls metaphor right with a kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.450" end="00:14:35.070" style="s2">of direction and orientation like so</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.640" end="00:14:37.110" style="s2">that you know like you said we could we</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.070" end="00:14:41.790" style="s2">could drop a problem in or we can drop a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.110" end="00:14:44.280" style="s2">mystery in microwave and and again not</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.790" end="00:14:47.150" style="s2">to foreclose that we&#39;re getting looking</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.280" end="00:14:49.650" style="s2">for an answer I think of it more as</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.150" end="00:14:51.540" style="s2">could we activate collective</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.650" end="00:14:54.060" style="s2">intelligence and shape it into</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.540" end="00:14:57.570" style="s2">collective wisdom so that we get into</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.060" end="00:14:59.400" style="s2">right relationship with reality and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.570" end="00:15:01.470" style="s2">problem just like circling brings us</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.400" end="00:15:03.900" style="s2">into right relationship with each other</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.470" end="00:15:05.490" style="s2">people are invoking that language a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.900" end="00:15:08.339" style="s2">I feel so connected and it&#39;s so good and</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.490" end="00:15:10.950" style="s2">it&#39;s so right right it hasn&#39;t finished</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.339" end="00:15:12.870" style="s2">our relationship we don&#39;t go well you</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.950" end="00:15:17.130" style="s2">know Taylor that was it that now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.870" end="00:15:19.200" style="s2">done right right so instead we&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.130" end="00:15:21.210" style="s2">into right relationship but we can that</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.200" end="00:15:22.560" style="s2">what we there are things there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.210" end="00:15:24.240" style="s2">things and I&#39;m using this term as</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.560" end="00:15:25.200" style="s2">neutrally as possible there are things</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.240" end="00:15:27.930" style="s2">we have to come into right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.200" end="00:15:30.060" style="s2">other than with ourselves and just each</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.930" end="00:15:32.339" style="s2">other we have to come into relationship</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.060" end="00:15:34.740" style="s2">with ways of being with patterns in our</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.339" end="00:15:35.560" style="s2">culture with the unfolding of reality</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.740" end="00:15:38.620" style="s2">itself and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.560" end="00:15:41.050" style="s2">Cobin crisis makes that deeply apparent</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.620" end="00:15:44.680" style="s2">to us is that does that land with you oh</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.050" end="00:15:47.320" style="s2">yeah totally totally I almost see it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.680" end="00:15:49.510" style="s2">like the the circling part of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.320" end="00:15:52.930" style="s2">process that you and I are exploring</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.510" end="00:15:55.720" style="s2">like um sets us up not so much to</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.930" end="00:15:57.610" style="s2">achieve this end goal but it sets us up</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.720" end="00:16:00.390" style="s2">in such a way in which it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.610" end="00:16:03.310" style="s2">that something could actually manage</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.390" end="00:16:05.620" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like without that intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.310" end="00:16:08.230" style="s2">you know there there isn&#39;t a trust I</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.620" end="00:16:11.200" style="s2">might not be willing to try out a new</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.230" end="00:16:13.930" style="s2">idea or you know bounce that off because</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.200" end="00:16:16.000" style="s2">you know all maybe normally I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.930" end="00:16:17.920" style="s2">who you are you&#39;re going to judge me but</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.000" end="00:16:19.390" style="s2">here it&#39;s like over relationship from</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.920" end="00:16:22.170" style="s2">work we&#39;re getting each other and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.390" end="00:16:26.290" style="s2">reciprocally sort of building this thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.170" end="00:16:28.810" style="s2">it affords yet for it some a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.290" end="00:16:30.850" style="s2">trust and therefore I think freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.810" end="00:16:33.700" style="s2">exploration is probably the way I would</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.850" end="00:16:38.050" style="s2">I would look at it hmm</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.700" end="00:16:41.500" style="s2">so that then so to quite sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.050" end="00:16:43.839" style="s2">two-part question and let me let me give</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.500" end="00:16:45.339" style="s2">some context realization for it you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.839" end="00:16:48.040" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve been doing stuff with and</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.339" end="00:16:49.780" style="s2">you mentioned it with guy and Chris you</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.040" end="00:16:52.450" style="s2">know guy send Star Christmas with Pietro</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.780" end="00:16:55.140" style="s2">Jordan Hall and other people about you</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.450" end="00:16:58.780" style="s2">know trying to bring philosophy ax into</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.140" end="00:17:01.570" style="s2">into circling guy calls it circling 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.780" end="00:17:03.670" style="s2">but people are now sort of adopting the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.570" end="00:17:06.069" style="s2">term that Chris and I of the deal logos</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.670" end="00:17:09.100" style="s2">because we&#39;re all so harkening back to</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.069" end="00:17:12.130" style="s2">sort of the Socratic platonic template</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.100" end="00:17:15.540" style="s2">of these kinds of open-ended discussions</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.130" end="00:17:19.240" style="s2">right and that in which people are</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.540" end="00:17:21.780" style="s2">getting they&#39;re accessing collective</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.240" end="00:17:24.939" style="s2">intelligence but they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.780" end="00:17:27.010" style="s2">participate it such that it is turned</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.939" end="00:17:29.050" style="s2">towards getting into deeper and more</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.010" end="00:17:31.720" style="s2">comprehensive right relationships to</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.050" end="00:17:36.850" style="s2">being to others to important social</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.720" end="00:17:39.970" style="s2">ideals like justice and so the two-part</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.850" end="00:17:41.770" style="s2">question is what is it specifically</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.970" end="00:17:43.480" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do in your experiments</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.770" end="00:17:44.920" style="s2">we&#39;re talking like lay it out and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.480" end="00:17:46.480" style="s2">the progression what are you finding</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.920" end="00:17:48.580" style="s2">what have you learned</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.480" end="00:17:49.570" style="s2">I mean I mean a good experiment should</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.580" end="00:17:51.759" style="s2">always show</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.570" end="00:17:53.169" style="s2">was challenge you it should be well some</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.759" end="00:17:54.399" style="s2">of the predictions came it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.169" end="00:17:55.779" style="s2">experiment if you say some of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.399" end="00:17:57.789" style="s2">predictions came true and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.779" end="00:17:59.139" style="s2">didn&#39;t and the ones that didn&#39;t give me</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.789" end="00:18:03.789" style="s2">a better way of interpreting the ones</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.139" end="00:18:06.519" style="s2">that did so that and then so your your</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.789" end="00:18:08.109" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing and then how because</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.519" end="00:18:09.700" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve talked about it how is it</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.109" end="00:18:12.609" style="s2">convergent with and how can it be put</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.700" end="00:18:15.549" style="s2">into conversation sorry for the pun with</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.609" end="00:18:17.649" style="s2">the sort of the dialectic dialogic to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.549" end="00:18:21.129" style="s2">a dialogue owes project that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.649" end="00:18:23.889" style="s2">involved in hmm yeah is that okay he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.129" end="00:18:27.279" style="s2">questioner was that too much uh I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.889" end="00:18:32.950" style="s2">I get it okay correct me if I&#39;m if I go</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.279" end="00:18:34.179" style="s2">off into the weeds or something so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.950" end="00:18:36.549" style="s2">the first the first couple of rounds</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.179" end="00:18:39.039" style="s2">around it I had like it&#39;s focused on</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.549" end="00:18:41.349" style="s2">people taking a side and putting four</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.039" end="00:18:43.330" style="s2">people into a conversation a facilitated</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.349" end="00:18:45.159" style="s2">conversation and then I had people on</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.330" end="00:18:47.859" style="s2">the outside observing that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.159" end="00:18:49.629" style="s2">and there were a few reasons for doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.859" end="00:18:52.570" style="s2">that but I wanted some people just in an</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.629" end="00:18:54.059" style="s2">observational third-person role to</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.570" end="00:18:56.679" style="s2">create a bit of an arm&#39;s length distance</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.059" end="00:19:00.580" style="s2">to when we started actually talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.679" end="00:19:03.639" style="s2">about the content and what I found in</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.580" end="00:19:05.950" style="s2">that was rather I mean there could be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.639" end="00:19:08.259" style="s2">few reasons of why it it sort of worked</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.950" end="00:19:10.359" style="s2">and sort of didn&#39;t work so we picked a</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.259" end="00:19:13.059" style="s2">topic and this topic was about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.359" end="00:19:14.109" style="s2">change of lyrics around the baby it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.059" end="00:19:15.820" style="s2">cold outside</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.109" end="00:19:18.249" style="s2">it was miss time because it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.820" end="00:19:20.080" style="s2">about right for the time and there were</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.249" end="00:19:21.399" style="s2">people who said like that was ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.080" end="00:19:22.840" style="s2">they shouldn&#39;t change the lyrics and</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.399" end="00:19:24.399" style="s2">keep like we tried to pick something a</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.840" end="00:19:28.109" style="s2">little on the safe and just to try out</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.399" end="00:19:31.779" style="s2">the structure first like really and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.109" end="00:19:34.059" style="s2">you know what happened was you know for</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.779" end="00:19:34.450" style="s2">me as a facilitator I started off into</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.059" end="00:19:36.639" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.450" end="00:19:38.349" style="s2">I started off from the third person and</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.639" end="00:19:40.139" style="s2">just sort of like checking in with</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.349" end="00:19:42.399" style="s2">everybody to see what their position was</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.139" end="00:19:45.789" style="s2">and get shared reality about that</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.399" end="00:19:47.619" style="s2">position fortunately what happened is</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.789" end="00:19:49.450" style="s2">the the people in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.619" end="00:19:51.399" style="s2">actually found their own points of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.450" end="00:19:53.970" style="s2">meeting and started to come a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.399" end="00:19:56.919" style="s2">more into an eye are we around this idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.970" end="00:19:58.769" style="s2">so we could sense the potential that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.919" end="00:20:02.570" style="s2">something about it didn&#39;t feel as</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.769" end="00:20:05.420" style="s2">intimate or se as potent as say</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.570" end="00:20:08.240" style="s2">if we circled around really one with a</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.420" end="00:20:10.340" style="s2">circling intention and then the next</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.240" end="00:20:11.810" style="s2">time I did it you know we really</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.340" end="00:20:14.570" style="s2">struggled again like it was something</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.810" end="00:20:15.980" style="s2">about maybe it was the sample group you</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.570" end="00:20:18.950" style="s2">know taking people who are familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.980" end="00:20:21.470" style="s2">owning their experiences and you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.950" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">really not projecting and and being able</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.470" end="00:20:26.330" style="s2">to see complexity and not actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.360" end="00:20:28.850" style="s2">really take a full-on you know hard</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.330" end="00:20:30.680" style="s2">stance on a particular position that</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.850" end="00:20:33.830" style="s2">seemed to be really difficult just to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.680" end="00:20:36.260" style="s2">tease out the polarity to even do the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.830" end="00:20:39.050" style="s2">experiment so in some ways with that a</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.260" end="00:20:41.930" style="s2">bit fizzled it made it really sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.050" end="00:20:44.780" style="s2">this walky discussion and like well how</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.930" end="00:20:46.760" style="s2">are we gonna like come to some meeting</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.780" end="00:20:48.500" style="s2">point of understanding somewhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.760" end="00:20:50.780" style="s2">middle of shared reality around these</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.500" end="00:20:55.130" style="s2">issues just it just wasn&#39;t really not</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.780" end="00:20:57.740" style="s2">happening so then I tried a couple more</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.130" end="00:21:00.500" style="s2">rounds but you know this was now into</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.740" end="00:21:02.330" style="s2">the pandemic and I was noticing the way</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.500" end="00:21:04.430" style="s2">people were relating to this particular</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.330" end="00:21:06.590" style="s2">issue I was trying to have other</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.430" end="00:21:08.240" style="s2">discussions about the pandemic and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.590" end="00:21:11.570" style="s2">noticed every time I would try to talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.240" end="00:21:13.760" style="s2">about the it of the pandemic it was so</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.570" end="00:21:15.500" style="s2">hard to come into any kind of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.760" end="00:21:18.410" style="s2">because everybody had their unique</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.500" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">personal impact of how they were being</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.410" end="00:21:24.440" style="s2">impacted by the pandemic it was only</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:26.690" style="s2">until we could actually address and have</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.440" end="00:21:29.000" style="s2">them bring their voices forward and feel</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.690" end="00:21:32.060" style="s2">heard and seen and how they&#39;re impacted</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.000" end="00:21:33.590" style="s2">did they seem open or even capable of</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.060" end="00:21:37.280" style="s2">starting to take in some of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.590" end="00:21:39.500" style="s2">objective aspects of it so that was like</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.280" end="00:21:41.900" style="s2">okay I definitely need to come with you</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.500" end="00:21:45.890" style="s2">know was the first-person perspective</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.900" end="00:21:48.380" style="s2">first so that was very important to sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.890" end="00:21:51.050" style="s2">of learn but even in that particular one</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.380" end="00:21:53.840" style="s2">there were a number of gaps in capacity</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.050" end="00:21:55.640" style="s2">in terms of relational capacity so there</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.840" end="00:21:57.470" style="s2">was actually some pretty big gaps in how</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.640" end="00:21:59.720" style="s2">people were relating to each other and</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.470" end="00:22:01.760" style="s2">then to have like six people and about</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.720" end="00:22:04.550" style="s2">an hour and like to try to get everybody</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.760" end="00:22:09.770" style="s2">to sort of meet and it just wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.550" end="00:22:12.740" style="s2">working so it further revealed to me how</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.770" end="00:22:14.640" style="s2">important capacity is or at least some</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.740" end="00:22:17.970" style="s2">sort of pedagogical</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.640" end="00:22:19.440" style="s2">lead up to a contact setting in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.970" end="00:22:22.020" style="s2">actually being able to do this really</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.440" end="00:22:25.380" style="s2">well so you know you had mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.020" end="00:22:26.730" style="s2">one that one situation with you and I at</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.380" end="00:22:28.170" style="s2">the end of circling where we said like</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.730" end="00:22:30.000" style="s2">oh let&#39;s experiment with this and when</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.170" end="00:22:32.549" style="s2">you feel like we&#39;re at the point let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.000" end="00:22:35.340" style="s2">see zoom zoom out and then zoom in and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.549" end="00:22:38.520" style="s2">zoom out you know and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.340" end="00:22:40.020" style="s2">worked so easily because of one you and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.520" end="00:22:42.059" style="s2">I already had whatever the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.020" end="00:22:44.670" style="s2">was there was already that intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.059" end="00:22:47.120" style="s2">already started encircling but then</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.670" end="00:22:49.410" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain capacity of me to like</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.120" end="00:22:51.390" style="s2">like I don&#39;t have any belonging needs</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.410" end="00:22:52.770" style="s2">with you or with the group</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.390" end="00:22:54.690" style="s2">I&#39;m not afraid that you&#39;re gonna judge</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.770" end="00:22:56.520" style="s2">me I don&#39;t have this other thread that I</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.690" end="00:23:00.630" style="s2">asked it so it allows me to open up and</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.520" end="00:23:01.760" style="s2">surrender to the the the symbolism that</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.630" end="00:23:04.919" style="s2">was happening in that particular</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.760" end="00:23:07.590" style="s2">exploration so on I&#39;m noticing these</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.919" end="00:23:11.190" style="s2">sort of these bits and pieces of wood</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.590" end="00:23:13.590" style="s2">are the ingredients for success and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.190" end="00:23:17.250" style="s2">how does even you know I hold a large</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.590" end="00:23:21.030" style="s2">developmental lens when I&#39;m working with</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.250" end="00:23:23.190" style="s2">people and it&#39;s like we&#39;re like what can</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.030" end="00:23:26.040" style="s2">we reasonably expect or how can we</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.190" end="00:23:28.590" style="s2">configure this such that it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.040" end="00:23:30.929" style="s2">accessible I think I watch you and guy</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.590" end="00:23:33.570" style="s2">and and Jordan do it the Ilocos</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.929" end="00:23:34.650" style="s2">conversation and it&#39;s like yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.570" end="00:23:37.320" style="s2">that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.650" end="00:23:40.740" style="s2">I would not would not be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.320" end="00:23:42.600" style="s2">had that conversation with with the mix</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.740" end="00:23:45.000" style="s2">a group that I have and there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.600" end="00:23:46.799" style="s2">various reasons for that so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.000" end="00:23:51.240" style="s2">starting to sort of notice like how can</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.799" end="00:23:54.030" style="s2">we bring this this relational leadership</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.240" end="00:23:56.400" style="s2">style of conversation in which we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.030" end="00:23:58.200" style="s2">actually work on a problem in a way</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.400" end="00:24:01.530" style="s2">that&#39;s accessible to people that</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.200" end="00:24:02.790" style="s2">provides like a leg up towards I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.530" end="00:24:07.410" style="s2">you know more of a deal logos</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.790" end="00:24:09.360" style="s2">conversation yeah so that&#39;s kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.410" end="00:24:11.850" style="s2">I&#39;ve been noticing in a real general</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.360" end="00:24:15.059" style="s2">sense and trying to move towards that so</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.850" end="00:24:17.790" style="s2">I&#39;m imagining future ones might be you</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.059" end="00:24:20.700" style="s2">know you might start to pick out a</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.790" end="00:24:22.830" style="s2">specific invite group and set a specific</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.700" end="00:24:24.840" style="s2">type of context of for people who I</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.830" end="00:24:26.780" style="s2">think could really open their</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.840" end="00:24:29.410" style="s2">perspectives in a very full</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.780" end="00:24:31.730" style="s2">chuckle sort of theoretical perspective</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.410" end="00:24:35.510" style="s2">and then see what happens from that</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.730" end="00:24:38.720" style="s2">using the same tools I would say or the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.510" end="00:24:41.000" style="s2">same intention of you know let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.720" end="00:24:43.040" style="s2">connect let&#39;s you know solve whatever</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.000" end="00:24:46.460" style="s2">interpersonal thing to get the flow</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.040" end="00:24:50.360" style="s2">going and then let&#39;s notice where are</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.460" end="00:24:54.110" style="s2">the moments where we have it&#39;s the word</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.360" end="00:24:55.850" style="s2">salience or sort of a cohesion around</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.110" end="00:24:57.830" style="s2">something and then it&#39;s like okay now we</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.850" end="00:25:03.200" style="s2">can pop out and now we can start to</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.830" end="00:25:06.290" style="s2">sense make on it yeah yeah yeah so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.200" end="00:25:08.930" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to reverse engineer that - I</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.290" end="00:25:11.570" style="s2">think you some documents around that so</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.930" end="00:25:13.700" style="s2">so there&#39;s that and that&#39;s you know and</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.570" end="00:25:15.170" style="s2">it&#39;s very much a work in progress so a</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.700" end="00:25:18.920" style="s2">couple things come to mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.170" end="00:25:21.370" style="s2">one one one is you know Peter and I are</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.920" end="00:25:24.260" style="s2">talking about this you know sort of a a</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.370" end="00:25:26.570" style="s2">progressive program of pedagogy like you</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.260" end="00:25:28.400" style="s2">may be like you know maybe just art</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.570" end="00:25:30.560" style="s2">we&#39;re just you know social noting and</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.400" end="00:25:33.140" style="s2">then perhaps move into something like</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.560" end="00:25:35.510" style="s2">empathy circling because Edwin argues</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.140" end="00:25:37.340" style="s2">it&#39;s a great gateway practice right for</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.510" end="00:25:39.470" style="s2">moving people from adversarial</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.340" end="00:25:40.880" style="s2">winner-take-all into weight we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.470" end="00:25:43.250" style="s2">actually make stuff together</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.880" end="00:25:45.080" style="s2">we can write we can we can get into</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.250" end="00:25:46.910" style="s2">right relationship with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.080" end="00:25:49.190" style="s2">that that&#39;s much more important than</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.910" end="00:25:51.620" style="s2">having the right view right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.190" end="00:25:55.040" style="s2">right and then and then maybe taking it</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.620" end="00:25:57.170" style="s2">into circling and then I&#39;ve been tried</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.040" end="00:25:59.630" style="s2">what would you do to like you said to</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.170" end="00:26:02.420" style="s2">notice the moments where you people are</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.630" end="00:26:04.580" style="s2">sensing the hand of the logos and you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.420" end="00:26:07.820" style="s2">get that zoom in zoom out thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.580" end="00:26:10.670" style="s2">happening yeah so I think part of what</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.820" end="00:26:11.480" style="s2">I&#39;m saying is and I you did you did</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.670" end="00:26:14.270" style="s2">bring a pedagogy</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.480" end="00:26:16.490" style="s2">it sounds like ways in which we can try</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.270" end="00:26:18.890" style="s2">and do the bridging and the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.490" end="00:26:20.990" style="s2">affordance is if we have that</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.890" end="00:26:22.580" style="s2">pedagogical program and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.990" end="00:26:24.020" style="s2">like when I&#39;m teaching the meditation</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.580" end="00:26:25.940" style="s2">course I don&#39;t teach people progr at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.020" end="00:26:28.250" style="s2">beginning yeah you you have this</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.940" end="00:26:30.800" style="s2">progressive build up of skills and</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.250" end="00:26:32.420" style="s2">practices that scaffold people in so</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.800" end="00:26:36.260" style="s2">that would be sort of the bottom up but</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.420" end="00:26:37.850" style="s2">I also think um and you know and Kristin</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.260" end="00:26:39.799" style="s2">I was talking about this and I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.850" end="00:26:44.210" style="s2">I want to get your feedback on it that</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.799" end="00:26:47.179" style="s2">that should be complemented with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.210" end="00:26:49.669" style="s2">of sorry this is I know I&#39;m struggling</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.179" end="00:26:51.710" style="s2">for an adjective here I want to say the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.669" end="00:26:52.250" style="s2">sort of high level and that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.710" end="00:26:55.010" style="s2">elitist</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.250" end="00:26:58.280" style="s2">so I&#39;m trying not to so high level via</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.010" end="00:27:02.480" style="s2">logos that were you know and and also</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.280" end="00:27:05.950" style="s2">ask people to they don&#39;t get it but</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.480" end="00:27:08.450" style="s2">imitate it hey play with it pretend</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.950" end="00:27:11.330" style="s2">right because that&#39;s what kids do that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.450" end="00:27:15.559" style="s2">what kids do until they pretend until</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.330" end="00:27:18.620" style="s2">they can comprehend right and so the</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.559" end="00:27:20.000" style="s2">idea of getting a practice where we say</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.620" end="00:27:21.289" style="s2">look we&#39;re gonna show you this and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.000" end="00:27:22.520" style="s2">obviously not at the beginning but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.289" end="00:27:24.679" style="s2">say people are starting to move into</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.520" end="00:27:26.330" style="s2">this pedagogical program you say well</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.679" end="00:27:28.100" style="s2">let&#39;s watch some of these and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.330" end="00:27:29.780" style="s2">gonna be able to do that that&#39;s fine and</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.100" end="00:27:31.970" style="s2">don&#39;t worry let&#39;s get into serious play</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.780" end="00:27:33.710" style="s2">trying to imitate it try to imitate it</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.970" end="00:27:35.270" style="s2">as much as you get and I&#39;m not holding</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.710" end="00:27:38.690" style="s2">myself out as something I&#39;m just saying</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.270" end="00:27:39.919" style="s2">imitate imitate the deal logos or</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.690" end="00:27:41.450" style="s2">wherever we can find it</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.919" end="00:27:42.770" style="s2">I mean cuz that&#39;s what that&#39;s why soccer</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.450" end="00:27:45.679" style="s2">that&#39;s why Plato wrote the dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.770" end="00:27:47.150" style="s2">right initially we sort of came it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.679" end="00:27:49.190" style="s2">I&#39;m saying maybe we could have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.150" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">simultaneous strategy where we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.190" end="00:27:52.970" style="s2">this you know pedagogical program where</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:56.150" style="s2">we have sequences of practices that</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.970" end="00:27:58.400" style="s2">scaffold people in bridge them in build</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.150" end="00:28:01.789" style="s2">their capacity but also give them a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.400" end="00:28:04.970" style="s2">of role modeling and write and say okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.789" end="00:28:06.799" style="s2">just just imitate this play pretend what</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.970" end="00:28:08.690" style="s2">you know play and pretend and imitate</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.799" end="00:28:10.730" style="s2">play and pretend and imitate but this</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.690" end="00:28:11.780" style="s2">because this is how kids also you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.730" end="00:28:14.030" style="s2">this is how they go through</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.780" end="00:28:15.830" style="s2">developmental stages and I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.030" end="00:28:18.350" style="s2">if you know if we got a pedagogical</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.830" end="00:28:21.260" style="s2">program of practices and then we had</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.350" end="00:28:22.760" style="s2">sort of ritualized imitation series play</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.260" end="00:28:24.740" style="s2">you go into a church that&#39;s how they</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.760" end="00:28:26.929" style="s2">scaffold people into Christianity and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.740" end="00:28:28.760" style="s2">don&#39;t mean I don&#39;t mean any insult you</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.929" end="00:28:30.289" style="s2">take them through a catechism you build</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.760" end="00:28:32.480" style="s2">them up but you also do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.289" end="00:28:34.340" style="s2">imitating of Christ you do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.480" end="00:28:36.679" style="s2">imitating of Christ and imitating</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.340" end="00:28:38.510" style="s2">appalled and right and imitating of Mose</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.679" end="00:28:40.309" style="s2">you do all that you do both those</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.510" end="00:28:45.169" style="s2">together so what do you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.309" end="00:28:47.150" style="s2">is a proposal yeah yeah I mean what I</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.169" end="00:28:49.130" style="s2">noticed in the last round when I ran it</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.150" end="00:28:51.140" style="s2">is there was a moment where I felt like</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.130" end="00:28:51.590" style="s2">I was in contact with the lowest and</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.140" end="00:28:54.350" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.590" end="00:28:57.529" style="s2">is the thing so I brought it forward as</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.350" end="00:29:00.200" style="s2">an invitation nobody took it up so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.529" end="00:29:01.309" style="s2">wait and I&#39;m like you know they said</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.200" end="00:29:02.809" style="s2">whatever they want to say I brought it</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.309" end="00:29:05.090" style="s2">back in as an invitation you know sir</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.809" end="00:29:06.590" style="s2">like what is it about this thing that</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.090" end="00:29:07.940" style="s2">has like you want to do this and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.590" end="00:29:10.100" style="s2">want to do this and I want to do this</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.940" end="00:29:12.350" style="s2">what is it and they just didn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.100" end="00:29:14.779" style="s2">quite know what to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.350" end="00:29:18.440" style="s2">invitation right which you know is more</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.779" end="00:29:21.169" style="s2">on me than on them but I know at the end</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.440" end="00:29:23.029" style="s2">of that I felt like we really got</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.169" end="00:29:24.409" style="s2">somewhere like at the end of it like</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.029" end="00:29:26.179" style="s2">everybody was like no I really enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.409" end="00:29:30.140" style="s2">that I want to do this again let&#39;s do a</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.179" end="00:29:32.240" style="s2">series of these and so in you know for</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.140" end="00:29:34.220" style="s2">me the thing that I trust the most is</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.240" end="00:29:36.020" style="s2">like what was my intention and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.220" end="00:29:38.600" style="s2">what&#39;s the felt experience I have at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.020" end="00:29:40.640" style="s2">end of it do I feel like you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.600" end="00:29:42.649" style="s2">moving towards that intention or am i</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.640" end="00:29:46.159" style="s2">moving away from it and I think to a</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.649" end="00:29:47.899" style="s2">certain degree you know just having that</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.159" end="00:29:52.029" style="s2">discussion even though we didn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.899" end="00:29:54.799" style="s2">know go into some sort of you know huge</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.029" end="00:29:58.220" style="s2">relevance realization around you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.799" end="00:29:59.840" style="s2">why we have a tendency to give the</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.220" end="00:30:01.309" style="s2">perfect device to other people but not</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.840" end="00:30:03.529" style="s2">to not take it on herself</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.309" end="00:30:05.000" style="s2">good you know which was the piece I</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.529" end="00:30:08.059" style="s2">think all and you&#39;re going to that it</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.000" end="00:30:10.669" style="s2">stays that oh but I think just the idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.059" end="00:30:12.770" style="s2">that we can have that conversation start</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.669" end="00:30:15.710" style="s2">bringing in that third person was a very</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.770" end="00:30:17.870" style="s2">different type of conversation that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.710" end="00:30:20.510" style="s2">ever had with that group of people and</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.870" end="00:30:22.340" style="s2">it and I canvassed them I asked them and</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.510" end="00:30:24.200" style="s2">it was very different than any other</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.340" end="00:30:26.809" style="s2">conversation that they had to so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.200" end="00:30:29.330" style="s2">almost like we&#39;re hinting at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.809" end="00:30:32.899" style="s2">potential the more and more in which we</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.330" end="00:30:35.870" style="s2">sort of exercise this so I I think even</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.899" end="00:30:38.000" style="s2">just sort of the role-playing idea or</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.870" end="00:30:40.700" style="s2">sort of the imitation idea I think would</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.000" end="00:30:43.429" style="s2">also serve that in very much the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.700" end="00:30:45.500" style="s2">way it creates a comfort with the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.429" end="00:30:47.779" style="s2">intention in the container of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.500" end="00:30:49.220" style="s2">here to do and maybe I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.779" end="00:30:50.899" style="s2">quite you know I&#39;ll need the training</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.220" end="00:30:53.630" style="s2">wheels and then I&#39;ll take the training I</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.899" end="00:30:55.309" style="s2">might fall over but you know I get an</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.630" end="00:30:57.500" style="s2">idea of what it is that we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.309" end="00:30:59.360" style="s2">because I&#39;ve seen somebody ride a bike</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.500" end="00:31:01.490" style="s2">before I&#39;ve never seen somebody ride a</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.360" end="00:31:02.750" style="s2">bike before I might look at the bike and</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.490" end="00:31:04.010" style="s2">not know what in the heck I&#39;m supposed</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.750" end="00:31:05.029" style="s2">to do with that exactly that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.010" end="00:31:08.689" style="s2">beautiful analogy</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.029" end="00:31:10.909" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s all I say I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.689" end="00:31:14.119" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a great idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.909" end="00:31:16.969" style="s2">and I appreciate you bringing it forward</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.119" end="00:31:18.279" style="s2">because it gives us an idea okay I know</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.969" end="00:31:22.369" style="s2">what I&#39;m gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.279" end="00:31:24.619" style="s2">well I mean and this is also something I</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.369" end="00:31:26.569" style="s2">guess I&#39;m trying to argue for in an</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.619" end="00:31:29.079" style="s2">exemplified you know I keep going back</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.569" end="00:31:33.259" style="s2">to this template of dialectic and</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.079" end="00:31:35.059" style="s2">Socrates and Plato and it keeps it keeps</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.259" end="00:31:37.969" style="s2">being a fount of intelligibility it</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.059" end="00:31:39.289" style="s2">keeps giving me because and there&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.969" end="00:31:41.179" style="s2">you actually see because you actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.289" end="00:31:42.859" style="s2">see it in the dialogues that people like</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.179" end="00:31:44.209" style="s2">even the operatic dialogues the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.859" end="00:31:45.199" style="s2">dialogues where you know they bring up</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.209" end="00:31:46.789" style="s2">some problem and they don&#39;t get a</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.199" end="00:31:48.799" style="s2">solution and it&#39;s it looked at</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.789" end="00:31:50.689" style="s2">argumentatively it was like well well</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.799" end="00:31:52.939" style="s2">that was useless no we didn&#39;t figure out</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.689" end="00:31:54.709" style="s2">what you know what courage is but it</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.939" end="00:31:56.629" style="s2">like but if you pay attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.709" end="00:31:59.659" style="s2">dialogues what happens is people get</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.629" end="00:32:03.969" style="s2">educated right in a particular way they</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.659" end="00:32:07.249" style="s2">they they they stop Trump they they say</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.969" end="00:32:09.709" style="s2">they stop following the authority of</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.249" end="00:32:11.239" style="s2">obvious Ness well you know just long</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.709" end="00:32:14.389" style="s2">it&#39;s X right</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.239" end="00:32:16.189" style="s2">or you know the authority of you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.389" end="00:32:19.159" style="s2">sort of formal definitions well I read</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.189" end="00:32:22.159" style="s2">that this is it right and and then what</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.159" end="00:32:24.739" style="s2">happens right is as people get into that</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.159" end="00:32:28.669" style="s2">and they instead get into the right</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.739" end="00:32:32.059" style="s2">relationship with the logos what you see</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.669" end="00:32:34.599" style="s2">is the people who like the people that</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.059" end="00:32:37.249" style="s2">Socrates were was dialoguing with</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.599" end="00:32:41.599" style="s2">they&#39;ll say things like well I want my</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.249" end="00:32:43.429" style="s2">son&#39;s to hang around you hmm I want my</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.599" end="00:32:45.109" style="s2">children to hang around you so although</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.429" end="00:32:49.009" style="s2">you could also so although we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.109" end="00:32:52.219" style="s2">come up with a definition of courage you</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.009" end="00:32:53.479" style="s2">exemplified it you exemplified it you</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.219" end="00:32:55.279" style="s2">know in a powerful way</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.479" end="00:32:57.679" style="s2">you made it sort of beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.279" end="00:32:59.959" style="s2">accessible to me and I want my son&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.679" end="00:33:01.819" style="s2">stay around you because I think if they</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.959" end="00:33:04.699" style="s2">could imitate you long enough then they</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.819" end="00:33:06.049" style="s2">would get rights they at least get that</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.699" end="00:33:07.729" style="s2">inkling you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.049" end="00:33:10.009" style="s2">and then that inkling gets linked to</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.729" end="00:33:11.659" style="s2">them to imitation now of course they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.009" end="00:33:13.729" style="s2">adults and so they have their egos and</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.659" end="00:33:15.739" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna imitate but they want</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.729" end="00:33:17.329" style="s2">their kids their sons and this this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.739" end="00:33:18.779" style="s2">very important in ancient Athens they</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.329" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">want their sons to start to</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.779" end="00:33:24.940" style="s2">Socrates and I so I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:26.409" style="s2">developmentally that modeling of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.940" end="00:33:28.269" style="s2">relationship between inkling and</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.409" end="00:33:32.289" style="s2">imitation is actually a very natural one</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.269" end="00:33:34.899" style="s2">for us yeah and I think what I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.289" end="00:33:36.369" style="s2">hoping I got I don&#39;t know ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.899" end="00:33:37.779" style="s2">what we&#39;ll end up doing this</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.369" end="00:33:40.059" style="s2">conversation if we just have the</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.779" end="00:33:42.070" style="s2">conversation or if we find out like</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.059" end="00:33:45.340" style="s2">actually people might actually want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.070" end="00:33:47.590" style="s2">watch this conversation too and I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.340" end="00:33:49.720" style="s2">that&#39;s why I had the observe and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.590" end="00:33:50.980" style="s2">a role two&#39;s I&#39;m still trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.720" end="00:33:52.869" style="s2">out how to bring that back and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.980" end="00:33:54.820" style="s2">taken it out but something about it I</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.869" end="00:33:56.590" style="s2">know feels right to me there&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.820" end="00:33:58.210" style="s2">there&#39;s something I think really</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.590" end="00:34:00.929" style="s2">valuable and having people in that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.210" end="00:34:04.450" style="s2">third-person role yeah Tom</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.929" end="00:34:12.899" style="s2">my sense is is that through wasn&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.450" end="00:34:15.309" style="s2">say through lose the thread now what was</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.899" end="00:34:19.530" style="s2">the last thing I said was sort of Inc</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.309" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">inkling into imitation yeah yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.530" end="00:34:24.069" style="s2">note I know it&#39;s still on the threat of</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.000" end="00:34:26.500" style="s2">imitation well the one thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.069" end="00:34:29.049" style="s2">would say is when we when we train</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.500" end="00:34:31.210" style="s2">people encircling before they know how</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.049" end="00:34:33.609" style="s2">to be circle before we have given them</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.210" end="00:34:35.559" style="s2">all the tools and I mean it&#39;s a highly</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.609" end="00:34:37.359" style="s2">experienced real practice so really your</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.559" end="00:34:40.210" style="s2">training is not done after we give you</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.359" end="00:34:44.020" style="s2">you know the pedagogy anyways like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.210" end="00:34:46.030" style="s2">gonna have to they do circling but at</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.020" end="00:34:48.250" style="s2">first we won&#39;t call it circling we call</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.030" end="00:34:51.970" style="s2">it something else so that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.250" end="00:34:54.159" style="s2">pressure is there you know so we bring</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.970" end="00:34:55.929" style="s2">in an element of circling and then we</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.159" end="00:34:57.700" style="s2">start to say okay now we&#39;re gonna do it</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.929" end="00:35:00.369" style="s2">this way you&#39;re just gonna circle me</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.700" end="00:35:02.559" style="s2">like you know of course you know so we</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.369" end="00:35:04.540" style="s2">start to sort of pad this out and grow</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.559" end="00:35:07.780" style="s2">it so that they&#39;re technically always</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.540" end="00:35:11.559" style="s2">have been circling but you know before</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.780" end="00:35:14.290" style="s2">they have all the knowledge one may need</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.559" end="00:35:16.270" style="s2">to tickle that structure so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.290" end="00:35:18.190" style="s2">you know is already a thing that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.270" end="00:35:19.869" style="s2">place you&#39;re at least how I train people</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.190" end="00:35:21.880" style="s2">in circling I&#39;m and I&#39;m pretty sure</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.869" end="00:35:24.730" style="s2">others would too I don&#39;t think I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.880" end="00:35:26.589" style="s2">everybody&#39;s doing training circles so I</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.730" end="00:35:28.450" style="s2">think that&#39;s very much a part of it you</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.589" end="00:35:30.549" style="s2">know when you get the feedback which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.450" end="00:35:31.840" style="s2">kind of what I was hoping to use the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.549" end="00:35:35.410" style="s2">observational GRU</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.840" end="00:35:37.900" style="s2">or actually use this container also as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.410" end="00:35:41.260" style="s2">training tool in of itself as a teaching</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.900" end="00:35:43.750" style="s2">tool so there&#39;s the there&#39;s the insight</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.260" end="00:35:45.880" style="s2">that it can afford and there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.750" end="00:35:50.880" style="s2">practice of doing it and not being</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.880" end="00:35:50.880" style="s2">successful as a teaching tool as well</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.210" end="00:35:56.110" style="s2">yeah so I see what you&#39;re saying though</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.340" end="00:35:58.660" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which the people in</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.110" end="00:36:00.070" style="s2">the third person perspective maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.660" end="00:36:02.470" style="s2">was the connection you were you were you</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.070" end="00:36:05.140" style="s2">were feeling towards and they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.470" end="00:36:07.810" style="s2">from like you know participating in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.140" end="00:36:09.580" style="s2">insight and the flow to seeing it as</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.810" end="00:36:11.230" style="s2">something and when it works they are</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.580" end="00:36:14.050" style="s2">getting something that they may want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.230" end="00:36:15.550" style="s2">imitate they may want to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.050" end="00:36:18.460" style="s2">it was that part of the intent of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.550" end="00:36:21.220" style="s2">of having the group out there well I</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.460" end="00:36:23.530" style="s2">certainly have gotten that when we would</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.220" end="00:36:25.570" style="s2">go to take feedback from the third</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.530" end="00:36:27.940" style="s2">everybody would start bringing in their</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.570" end="00:36:30.010" style="s2">first persist objective sort of opinion</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.940" end="00:36:32.170" style="s2">about the topic so I could really see</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.010" end="00:36:34.060" style="s2">people you know who were in the third</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.170" end="00:36:35.080" style="s2">person role really wanted to be a part</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.060" end="00:36:38.100" style="s2">of that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.080" end="00:36:40.180" style="s2">and that sort of validates the idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.100" end="00:36:43.300" style="s2">right I think this was the thing I was</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.180" end="00:36:46.720" style="s2">gonna say that maybe we can present this</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.300" end="00:36:49.680" style="s2">as something that you know so you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.720" end="00:36:52.660" style="s2">these fantastic conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.680" end="00:36:54.100" style="s2">Jordan Hall maybe your your</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.660" end="00:36:57.850" style="s2">conversations with him art of an</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.100" end="00:36:59.770" style="s2">accurate analogy here or a frame maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.850" end="00:37:02.620" style="s2">take like a rebel wisdom one where David</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.770" end="00:37:05.290" style="s2">Fuller&#39;s interviewing Jordan Hall or</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.620" end="00:37:07.090" style="s2">yourself about something it&#39;s this sort</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.290" end="00:37:09.880" style="s2">of discussion that&#39;s sort of in one</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.090" end="00:37:12.550" style="s2">direction to the expert yeah you guys do</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.880" end="00:37:15.910" style="s2">it beautifully but not everybody&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.550" end="00:37:18.700" style="s2">expert so how do we bring people into</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.910" end="00:37:19.930" style="s2">having a conversation like like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.700" end="00:37:21.850" style="s2">saying like it&#39;s not going to be this</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.930" end="00:37:23.050" style="s2">but maybe we&#39;re imitating me what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.850" end="00:37:26.290" style="s2">building starting to build the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.050" end="00:37:29.440" style="s2">through actually enacting the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.290" end="00:37:30.610" style="s2">practice such that maybe it doesn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.440" end="00:37:33.040" style="s2">like a bridge too far</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.610" end="00:37:35.440" style="s2">oh well maybe I I&#39;ll actually share my</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.040" end="00:37:37.180" style="s2">opinion this time oh actually now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.440" end="00:37:38.200" style="s2">gonna stand for my opinion this time</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.180" end="00:37:41.050" style="s2">well actually I&#39;m gonna go do some</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.200" end="00:37:42.820" style="s2">research on you know like um we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.050" end="00:37:44.930" style="s2">giving them an opportunity that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.820" end="00:37:47.390" style="s2">they feel like a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.930" end="00:37:51.050" style="s2">- I can do that as well rather than</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.390" end="00:37:53.180" style="s2">watching you know beautiful and really</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.050" end="00:37:55.760" style="s2">inspiring for me to our conversations</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.180" end="00:37:57.829" style="s2">but it&#39;s just like they don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:38:00.920" style="s2">bridge like how do I get to a place of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.829" end="00:38:03.020" style="s2">philosophy I write how do I do that well</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.920" end="00:38:05.540" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s a practice here that</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.020" end="00:38:08.390" style="s2">starts to crank that engine a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.540" end="00:38:11.059" style="s2">that&#39;s good that&#39;s good I&#39;m hoping for</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.390" end="00:38:12.500" style="s2">no no that&#39;s good I like that so the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.059" end="00:38:15.619" style="s2">thing that came to mind was a</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.500" end="00:38:21.290" style="s2">pedagogical model of apprenticeship hmm</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.619" end="00:38:23.690" style="s2">right and that and then yeah and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.290" end="00:38:26.450" style="s2">don&#39;t you don&#39;t expose the apprentice to</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.690" end="00:38:28.760" style="s2">to the master work at the beginning if</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.450" end="00:38:34.520" style="s2">you that&#39;s what master piece comes from</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.760" end="00:38:37.660" style="s2">this that&#39;s right right you you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.520" end="00:38:40.010" style="s2">expose them to perhaps masterpiece</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.660" end="00:38:41.690" style="s2">conversations or well you don&#39;t forbid</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.010" end="00:38:44.180" style="s2">them of course but maybe it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.690" end="00:38:47.990" style="s2">said maybe what you need is you you need</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.180" end="00:38:51.380" style="s2">sort of you need role models that are</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.990" end="00:38:53.390" style="s2">also sort of timed quit that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.380" end="00:38:55.430" style="s2">critical transition periods within the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.390" end="00:38:58.069" style="s2">pedagogical program so when you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.430" end="00:38:59.839" style="s2">when you&#39;re in this one here&#39;s a role</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.069" end="00:39:02.299" style="s2">model that you can imitate for what to</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.839" end="00:39:04.549" style="s2">do here and then when people move you go</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.299" end="00:39:06.380" style="s2">oh here&#39;s a role model for what you do</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.549" end="00:39:08.750" style="s2">here and then yeah here&#39;s a role model</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.380" end="00:39:10.910" style="s2">for what you do there and then both the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.750" end="00:39:12.380" style="s2">bottom up we could do the enacting you</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.910" end="00:39:14.059" style="s2">could also be doing the imitating and</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.380" end="00:39:15.589" style="s2">that you could scaffold people up and</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.059" end="00:39:17.780" style="s2">then when they get and then you say okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.589" end="00:39:21.170" style="s2">now here and you present something like</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.780" end="00:39:23.630" style="s2">that yeah totally yes yeah and that</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.170" end="00:39:25.670" style="s2">totally fits with my intention and why I</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.630" end="00:39:28.130" style="s2">was holding this particular frame for it</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.670" end="00:39:31.040" style="s2">rather than you know this you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.130" end="00:39:33.530" style="s2">philosophy ax or like still the logos is</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.040" end="00:39:35.930" style="s2">available in our conversations but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.530" end="00:39:38.180" style="s2">we&#39;re not having a philosophical or very</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.930" end="00:39:41.480" style="s2">broad sort of conceptual sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.180" end="00:39:43.609" style="s2">discussion but I believe that the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.480" end="00:39:45.079" style="s2">thing that we&#39;re doing the the motions</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.609" end="00:39:47.359" style="s2">that we&#39;re doing the zooming in is you</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.079" end="00:39:49.460" style="s2">know the integrating of these three</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.359" end="00:39:52.250" style="s2">perspectives those are happening in both</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.460" end="00:39:54.859" style="s2">of our explorations yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.250" end="00:39:56.510" style="s2">good that&#39;s really good yeah well they</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.859" end="00:39:57.920" style="s2">I&#39;m glad I&#39;m recording this because this</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.510" end="00:39:58.340" style="s2">is going to be very valuable for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.920" end="00:40:03.110" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.340" end="00:40:05.390" style="s2">doing so like I guess are you going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.110" end="00:40:08.080" style="s2">continue the experimentation or is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.390" end="00:40:12.230" style="s2">is the is kovat really putting a dent in</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.080" end="00:40:16.670" style="s2">in in trying to keep things going no no</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.230" end="00:40:18.500" style="s2">I&#39;m actually we&#39;ve done more fortunately</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.670" end="00:40:21.230" style="s2">because of online it&#39;s a little bit in</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.500" end="00:40:23.300" style="s2">plus people aren&#39;t as busy I guess yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.230" end="00:40:25.610" style="s2">so there are people are a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.300" end="00:40:27.680" style="s2">more available but also because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.610" end="00:40:30.040" style="s2">shifted some of the experiment down to</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.680" end="00:40:32.210" style="s2">smaller groups I you know I had over</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.040" end="00:40:34.790" style="s2">complexified it I think I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.210" end="00:40:36.320" style="s2">like track way too many things in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.790" end="00:40:37.880" style="s2">first couple rounds I&#39;m like okay I need</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.320" end="00:40:39.830" style="s2">to like distill this down into the</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.880" end="00:40:41.360" style="s2">basics and then bring something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.830" end="00:40:42.740" style="s2">always how experimental design goes</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.360" end="00:40:45.950" style="s2">that&#39;s always our experimental design</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.740" end="00:40:47.360" style="s2">yeah I feel so much better here I</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.950" end="00:40:52.780" style="s2">thought it was like why am i over</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.360" end="00:40:55.160" style="s2">complicating this so no actually I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.780" end="00:40:58.880" style="s2">actually thinking about doing a series</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.160" end="00:41:01.730" style="s2">that is massively influenced by the</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.880" end="00:41:03.770" style="s2">experiment and not actually connecting</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.730" end="00:41:05.900" style="s2">this series to the experiment but sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.770" end="00:41:09.500" style="s2">of having maybe one of these entry level</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.900" end="00:41:12.050" style="s2">style of discussions that starts to</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.500" end="00:41:15.860" style="s2">bring in that first or second layer of</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.050" end="00:41:17.810" style="s2">complexity and then if we can sort of if</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.860" end="00:41:19.640" style="s2">that&#39;s working really well then bring in</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.810" end="00:41:21.380" style="s2">you know bringing the added complexity</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.640" end="00:41:24.350" style="s2">and then maybe we&#39;ll do one more app or</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.380" end="00:41:27.110" style="s2">actually like zooming it like way out</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.350" end="00:41:28.760" style="s2">and moving maybe into some idea of sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.110" end="00:41:31.310" style="s2">of a philosophy or like really</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.760" end="00:41:33.500" style="s2">conceptual thinking once we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.310" end="00:41:38.450" style="s2">built up this relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.500" end="00:41:40.520" style="s2">practice so that&#39;s my loose plan for the</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.450" end="00:41:42.050" style="s2">next couple of weeks is to to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.520" end="00:41:46.490" style="s2">start a series of these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.050" end="00:41:49.850" style="s2">that I think will will fit more into the</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.490" end="00:41:53.930" style="s2">intention of the experiment that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.850" end="00:41:56.930" style="s2">that&#39;s cool so yeah there was a couple</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.930" end="00:42:02.050" style="s2">things that came up when you were you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.930" end="00:42:02.050" style="s2">mentioning that so</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.920" end="00:42:17.050" style="s2">what what what do you think about this</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.460" end="00:42:20.300" style="s2">Pratt like you knew I was gonna ask this</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.050" end="00:42:22.100" style="s2">this practice and I don&#39;t mean just</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.300" end="00:42:24.710" style="s2">circling I mean the whole pedagogical</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.100" end="00:42:27.260" style="s2">apprenticeship from you know from maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.710" end="00:42:31.670" style="s2">you know social noting up to full-blown</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.260" end="00:42:35.270" style="s2">deal logos right and and the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.670" end="00:42:37.940" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s exemplifying a way of</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.270" end="00:42:39.710" style="s2">being not just a way of thinking that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.940" end="00:42:46.340" style="s2">part of what&#39;s behind the whole notion</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.710" end="00:42:49.700" style="s2">of authentic relating how is that what</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.340" end="00:42:52.070" style="s2">so what I want to use what I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.700" end="00:42:54.050" style="s2">something like what relationship does it</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.070" end="00:42:56.060" style="s2">have in affording a response to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.050" end="00:42:59.000" style="s2">meeting crisis and what relationship</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.060" end="00:43:01.130" style="s2">does it have with with responding</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.000" end="00:43:03.500" style="s2">affording a response to the way the co</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.130" end="00:43:13.910" style="s2">vid crisis is really exacerbating the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.500" end="00:43:15.650" style="s2">meeting crisis yeah so I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.910" end="00:43:17.600" style="s2">excited and I&#39;m like oh my god there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.650" end="00:43:21.410" style="s2">so many like entry points into this</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.600" end="00:43:24.200" style="s2">discussion what I would say because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.410" end="00:43:25.580" style="s2">holding that developmental lens and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.200" end="00:43:29.300" style="s2">just can&#39;t seem to let it go it just</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.580" end="00:43:31.010" style="s2">seems to work so well for me and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.300" end="00:43:33.110" style="s2">how I perceive and make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.010" end="00:43:37.160" style="s2">world and and relationships with other</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.110" end="00:43:39.740" style="s2">people and what I really see is is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.160" end="00:43:41.900" style="s2">you know if we look at the crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.740" end="00:43:44.300" style="s2">meaning is you know I&#39;ve sort of held to</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.900" end="00:43:48.080" style="s2">this frame that you know we don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.300" end="00:43:50.560" style="s2">don&#39;t have this institution or this to</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.080" end="00:43:53.540" style="s2">turn around and give our power away to</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.560" end="00:43:55.220" style="s2">or to enter into community with like I</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.540" end="00:43:57.110" style="s2">used to be the church writer or a</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.220" end="00:43:59.270" style="s2">particular faith or religion and as that</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.110" end="00:44:03.380" style="s2">sort of starts to die off in a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.270" end="00:44:06.080" style="s2">post truth world it&#39;s like what what is</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.380" end="00:44:09.350" style="s2">the thing that is greater than our egos</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.080" end="00:44:11.210" style="s2">greater than ourselves that we want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.350" end="00:44:16.540" style="s2">give ourselves to like that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.210" end="00:44:19.970" style="s2">like a biological matter is mattering</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.540" end="00:44:22.340" style="s2">exactly yeah belong to something bigger</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.970" end="00:44:24.170" style="s2">than ourselves and we need to make we</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.340" end="00:44:26.270" style="s2">need to feel like we&#39;re connected to it</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.170" end="00:44:29.180" style="s2">in a way that matters to it yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.270" end="00:44:31.520" style="s2">yeah exactly and and I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.180" end="00:44:34.430" style="s2">through authentic relating the thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.520" end="00:44:38.540" style="s2">that matters is the quote unquote other</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.430" end="00:44:41.990" style="s2">which is in very very many ways also</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.540" end="00:44:43.910" style="s2">ourselves right so I sort of hold a</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.990" end="00:44:46.760" style="s2">particular frame that you know yes God</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.910" end="00:44:50.240" style="s2">exists but it is exists within here</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.760" end="00:44:52.700" style="s2">within my perception within my relevance</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.240" end="00:44:55.160" style="s2">realization within my salience landscape</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.700" end="00:44:58.490" style="s2">you know that&#39;s what&#39;s there and can I</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.160" end="00:45:02.180" style="s2">can I open transcend my ego and allow</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.490" end="00:45:04.610" style="s2">that information into guide so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.180" end="00:45:07.700" style="s2">sort of my spiritual orientation if we</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.610" end="00:45:09.650" style="s2">were to call it right and I think my</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.700" end="00:45:11.960" style="s2">experience like I didn&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.650" end="00:45:13.940" style="s2">before authentic relating so it was</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.960" end="00:45:16.640" style="s2">through my experience inauthentic</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.940" end="00:45:18.710" style="s2">relating of you know I went into</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.640" end="00:45:21.170" style="s2">authentic relating as a misanthrope and</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.710" end="00:45:23.270" style="s2">like people I really didn&#39;t like people</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.170" end="00:45:27.080" style="s2">like I blamed everybody else for</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.270" end="00:45:28.490" style="s2">everything that was wrong everywhere you</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.080" end="00:45:32.570" style="s2">know I feel like I&#39;ve got the capacity I</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.490" end="00:45:35.720" style="s2">could love anybody and that came through</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.570" end="00:45:38.690" style="s2">these practices of sort of being with</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.720" end="00:45:41.000" style="s2">people in their world and noticing how</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.690" end="00:45:43.400" style="s2">I&#39;m impacted and then how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.000" end="00:45:46.100" style="s2">impacted by my sharing of it like it</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.400" end="00:45:48.410" style="s2">created something richer in my</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.100" end="00:45:50.690" style="s2">experience than it experienced anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.410" end="00:45:53.090" style="s2">else so it felt like it was something</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.690" end="00:45:55.280" style="s2">much greater than like oh there is</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.090" end="00:45:57.680" style="s2">something here that I can&#39;t create on my</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.280" end="00:46:01.640" style="s2">own I could sit here and meditate I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.680" end="00:46:03.290" style="s2">not gonna get this same experience that</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.640" end="00:46:05.810" style="s2">I&#39;m having in relationship with you or a</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.290" end="00:46:08.360" style="s2">relationship with a group so that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.810" end="00:46:10.790" style="s2">know just you know the enormity of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.360" end="00:46:13.730" style="s2">and then how it brought value back into</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.790" end="00:46:15.770" style="s2">my own perception of who I am and my own</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.730" end="00:46:17.240" style="s2">identity and what I was able to learn</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.770" end="00:46:18.890" style="s2">about myself just through the</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.240" end="00:46:21.800" style="s2">reflections that would come back through</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.890" end="00:46:24.080" style="s2">this like to me and it created a shared</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.800" end="00:46:27.250" style="s2">context for me and my wife like it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.080" end="00:46:29.260" style="s2">so many ways it&#39;s become my world</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.250" end="00:46:31.660" style="s2">and it I&#39;d never thought about mission</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.260" end="00:46:33.430" style="s2">and purpose until about a year into</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.660" end="00:46:35.980" style="s2">doing this I you know there was a</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.430" end="00:46:38.620" style="s2">weekend immersion so it&#39;s like really</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.980" end="00:46:41.680" style="s2">intense like two three days of like just</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.620" end="00:46:45.160" style="s2">you know dinner in her work and you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.680" end="00:46:48.100" style="s2">looking in and relating and I just I got</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.160" end="00:46:53.860" style="s2">I got so scared I got so scared because</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.100" end="00:46:56.440" style="s2">I thought oh wow for me to do this thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.860" end="00:46:59.380" style="s2">that I now feel called to do it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.440" end="00:47:01.840" style="s2">like blow up my entire life like my life</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.380" end="00:47:05.110" style="s2">is going to change in this moment so I</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.840" end="00:47:06.820" style="s2">just wanted to note and this is not you</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.110" end="00:47:09.160" style="s2">know me this is not in any way an insult</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.820" end="00:47:11.320" style="s2">I want to know a religious your language</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.160" end="00:47:13.570" style="s2">is becoming feeling call they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.320" end="00:47:17.110" style="s2">connected you&#39;re speaking of the logos</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.570" end="00:47:20.530" style="s2">that you know this you know like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.110" end="00:47:22.060" style="s2">sacred to you it&#39;s transformative right</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.530" end="00:47:24.940" style="s2">it puts you into right relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.060" end="00:47:29.020" style="s2">yourself with other people I mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.940" end="00:47:31.690" style="s2">so I sense if in we haven&#39;t talked too</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.020" end="00:47:33.370" style="s2">much about you past together personally</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.690" end="00:47:34.840" style="s2">but I sense that not only did you go</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.370" end="00:47:38.260" style="s2">from being a misanthrope to being</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.840" end="00:47:40.810" style="s2">philanthropic it sounds like you also</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.260" end="00:47:43.990" style="s2">went from kind of a secular or</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.810" end="00:47:46.570" style="s2">non-religious stance to a more spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.990" end="00:47:48.100" style="s2">or religious in the sense of enacting</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.570" end="00:47:49.630" style="s2">religio in the way we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.100" end="00:47:51.670" style="s2">here is that also something that</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.630" end="00:47:53.770" style="s2">happened yeah totally yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.670" end="00:47:56.710" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s the way in which it is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.770" end="00:47:59.290" style="s2">deep response to the meaning crisis I</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.710" end="00:48:00.700" style="s2">mean it&#39;ll allow me and I if you feel</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.290" end="00:48:02.650" style="s2">this as an imposition challenge me right</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.700" end="00:48:03.930" style="s2">away but it seems to me this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.650" end="00:48:06.670" style="s2">like what I&#39;m trying to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.930" end="00:48:09.130" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion we are</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.670" end="00:48:10.720" style="s2">activating and enacting the logos we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.130" end="00:48:13.150" style="s2">feeling called about it we&#39;re in faith</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.720" end="00:48:14.440" style="s2">to it we&#39;re just a dynamically coupled</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.150" end="00:48:16.510" style="s2">it&#39;s putting us in the right</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.440" end="00:48:18.490" style="s2">relationship with ourselves with being</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.510" end="00:48:20.710" style="s2">with each other it&#39;s leading us to</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.490" end="00:48:23.410" style="s2">aspire it&#39;s giving us mission all this</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.710" end="00:48:29.410" style="s2">kind of stuff yeah you&#39;re not being</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.410" end="00:48:33.220" style="s2">bound to particular you know Dogma dog</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.410" end="00:48:36.610" style="s2">my set of propositions that Dogma that</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.220" end="00:48:38.980" style="s2">emerges is purely reflective practical</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.610" end="00:48:41.319" style="s2">its pragmatic dogma it&#39;s well the things</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.980" end="00:48:45.309" style="s2">that are most are reliably in very</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.319" end="00:48:47.769" style="s2">that afford us getting into this flow</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.309" end="00:48:50.259" style="s2">that seems to me and I&#39;ve noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.769" end="00:48:52.059" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s I mean in the circling and</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.259" end="00:48:55.630" style="s2">reading about it that this spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.059" end="00:48:58.059" style="s2">emergence of you know of spiritual and</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.630" end="00:49:02.049" style="s2">religious language that seems to be like</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.059" end="00:49:04.059" style="s2">a common feature in the Indies in the in</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.049" end="00:49:06.039" style="s2">in circling events and things like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.059" end="00:49:07.749" style="s2">seen well I&#39;ve seen it in person and</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.039" end="00:49:09.400" style="s2">I&#39;ve read about it and it just happened</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.749" end="00:49:13.900" style="s2">here between you and I when you were</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.400" end="00:49:15.789" style="s2">relating oh it&#39;s so go ahead go ahead I</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.900" end="00:49:18.579" style="s2">think it&#39;s fair to say that my my</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.789" end="00:49:21.309" style="s2">language in general around any of these</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.579" end="00:49:24.190" style="s2">newer experiences is very limited</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.309" end="00:49:25.690" style="s2">because I really didn&#39;t have you know a</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.190" end="00:49:28.239" style="s2">religious background I really didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.690" end="00:49:29.920" style="s2">have like this is a whole new world you</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.239" end="00:49:32.079" style="s2">know like we make a joke it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.920" end="00:49:34.569" style="s2">seeing the matrix right right I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.079" end="00:49:36.699" style="s2">that my pill and now you can&#39;t unsee</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.569" end="00:49:38.949" style="s2">everything that you can now see yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.699" end="00:49:41.289" style="s2">through that it&#39;s like I don&#39;t have I</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.949" end="00:49:43.930" style="s2">don&#39;t have your education and your mass</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.289" end="00:49:45.759" style="s2">vocabulary too so for me it&#39;s like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.930" end="00:49:47.410" style="s2">picking up and if this is the way in</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.759" end="00:49:49.180" style="s2">which I&#39;m imitating you know the people</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.410" end="00:49:50.799" style="s2">who taught me or who are mentoring me in</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.180" end="00:49:52.420" style="s2">it it&#39;s like these are this is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.799" end="00:49:55.089" style="s2">language that they&#39;re using and I make</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.420" end="00:49:57.880" style="s2">meaning using those words right so when</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.089" end="00:49:59.680" style="s2">I read like your papers I have to like I</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.880" end="00:50:01.930" style="s2">have to translate them on cuz I&#39;m I know</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.680" end="00:50:04.089" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying like oh this is you</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.930" end="00:50:06.160" style="s2">know this is this thing in my world or</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.089" end="00:50:07.660" style="s2">you know in my language exactly we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.160" end="00:50:10.900" style="s2">time with the same thing but it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.660" end="00:50:13.239" style="s2">language is different so I don&#39;t I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.900" end="00:50:15.569" style="s2">that&#39;s more I&#39;m not quite sure where</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.239" end="00:50:19.269" style="s2">that comes from I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.569" end="00:50:21.309" style="s2">that I can identify that it&#39;s some part</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.269" end="00:50:23.949" style="s2">of me that wants to identify with that</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.309" end="00:50:26.440" style="s2">idea of spirituality or religion but</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.949" end="00:50:28.779" style="s2">there is this perspective that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.440" end="00:50:29.650" style="s2">experiencing things that are bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.779" end="00:50:32.380" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.650" end="00:50:35.140" style="s2">greater than my ego and in that space it</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.380" end="00:50:36.699" style="s2">seems to me most of the you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.140" end="00:50:39.759" style="s2">academic circles most of that language</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.699" end="00:50:42.039" style="s2">is religious language yeah yeah very</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.759" end="00:50:45.130" style="s2">much you all you did it you explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.039" end="00:50:47.859" style="s2">did invoke God in your description and</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.130" end="00:50:49.539" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.859" end="00:50:51.219" style="s2">the subtle tone a&#39;ti of being connected</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.539" end="00:50:53.529" style="s2">to something larger than yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.219" end="00:50:55.109" style="s2">that calls you you also talk to that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.529" end="00:50:57.299" style="s2">feel called by it</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.109" end="00:50:59.519" style="s2">it like it&#39;s it seducing you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.299" end="00:51:01.739" style="s2">drawing you forth it&#39;s ecstatic it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.519" end="00:51:03.089" style="s2">know strong you beyond yourself right</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.739" end="00:51:05.640" style="s2">and so there&#39;s something deeply</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.089" end="00:51:08.130" style="s2">aspirational a transformative about it -</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.640" end="00:51:13.410" style="s2">totally and so I think that&#39;s right I</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.130" end="00:51:18.299" style="s2">think I think that the way in which the</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.410" end="00:51:22.049" style="s2">the practice practice is exemplify a way</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.299" end="00:51:23.910" style="s2">of being is the way in which this</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.049" end="00:51:25.170" style="s2">responds to the meeting crisis I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.910" end="00:51:27.029" style="s2">think it&#39;s going to produce a set of</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.170" end="00:51:28.710" style="s2">propositions where everybody goes oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.029" end="00:51:33.779" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.710" end="00:51:36.599" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it will either but but my</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.779" end="00:51:40.499" style="s2">sense is what it is or what it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.599" end="00:51:43.079" style="s2">service of is a transition through to</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.499" end="00:51:44.999" style="s2">the next stage of development yeah for</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.079" end="00:51:48.059" style="s2">me I see it&#39;s helping you know hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.999" end="00:51:49.470" style="s2">helping Society like I&#39;m bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.059" end="00:51:52.529" style="s2">complexity the work that I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.470" end="00:51:55.079" style="s2">brings in complexity to most people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.529" end="00:51:58.170" style="s2">lives and awareness of themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.079" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">relationship um you know like most</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.170" end="00:52:02.910" style="s2">people don&#39;t consider construct like</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:04.769" style="s2">they&#39;re not even remotely construct</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.910" end="00:52:06.839" style="s2">aware most people can&#39;t even take their</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.769" end="00:52:09.779" style="s2">own perspective right they can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.839" end="00:52:11.940" style="s2">art they don&#39;t even know what that is so</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.779" end="00:52:13.650" style="s2">I&#39;m trying you know again through the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.940" end="00:52:15.269" style="s2">the developmental Theory lens I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.650" end="00:52:17.549" style="s2">to bring in this complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.269" end="00:52:19.289" style="s2">something that really matters to people</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.549" end="00:52:21.660" style="s2">in that tends to be their relationships</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.289" end="00:52:23.160" style="s2">right know the studies all say you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.660" end="00:52:24.809" style="s2">what was the most important thing before</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.160" end="00:52:27.329" style="s2">you get to is your relationships like it</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.809" end="00:52:29.249" style="s2">just seems to be the closest thing to</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.329" end="00:52:32.460" style="s2">objective reality we can put our finger</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.249" end="00:52:35.279" style="s2">on and therefore to to bring sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.460" end="00:52:37.589" style="s2">this this mode of development or moving</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.279" end="00:52:41.910" style="s2">through to grease the wheels to add the</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.589" end="00:52:44.509" style="s2">complexity to create the you know is</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.910" end="00:52:48.049" style="s2">that one of the one of my teachers says</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.509" end="00:52:52.470" style="s2">you know change happens either through</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.049" end="00:52:54.869" style="s2">and by accident or through discourse and</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.470" end="00:52:57.630" style="s2">it&#39;s like these practices make us more</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.869" end="00:52:59.369" style="s2">accident-prone Mac setting up these</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.630" end="00:53:02.160" style="s2">containers like give us an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.369" end="00:53:04.130" style="s2">to clash I think you have a you have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.160" end="00:53:06.350" style="s2">map that you brought I remember</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.130" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s sort of a thing like it you</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.350" end="00:53:09.200" style="s2">know and then you can zoom out from it</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.760" end="00:53:11.960" style="s2">and you can look at it again and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.200" end="00:53:13.610" style="s2">you break the frame right yeah you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.960" end="00:53:16.100" style="s2">zoom out and look at the frame you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.610" end="00:53:18.020" style="s2">and so to me that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.100" end="00:53:22.340" style="s2">through authentic relating through</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.020" end="00:53:24.410" style="s2">circling and so I see it as like in</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.340" end="00:53:28.760" style="s2">service of sort of bringing us through</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.410" end="00:53:31.130" style="s2">to the next development to level and</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.760" end="00:53:33.740" style="s2">sort of pragmatically but also in terms</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.130" end="00:53:36.890" style="s2">of meaning is just it&#39;s been so deeply</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.740" end="00:53:40.250" style="s2">satisfying like like I don&#39;t need a</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.890" end="00:53:42.260" style="s2">thing out there it&#39;s not a car car</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.250" end="00:53:44.690" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make me satisfied a new coat</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.260" end="00:53:47.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make me satisfied in the way in</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.690" end="00:53:51.950" style="s2">which coming into deep connection with</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.600" end="00:53:58.460" style="s2">myself and with others like it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.950" end="00:54:00.320" style="s2">that meaning it&#39;s just exactly yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.460" end="00:54:02.690" style="s2">then you know in terms of the Kovach</p>

<p begin="00:54:17.510" end="00:54:22.220" style="s2">possibility there&#39;s potential yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.390" end="00:54:25.100" style="s2">Clarence exactly yeah we were on that</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.220" end="00:54:26.780" style="s2">call talking about that and for me it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:54:31.700" end="00:54:34.910" style="s2">of like I&#39;ve got like this energy but I</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.410" end="00:54:37.580" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to do with it they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.910" end="00:54:40.220" style="s2">know how you bring it into action yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.580" end="00:54:42.470" style="s2">so I&#39;m hoping that we can having a</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.220" end="00:54:45.260" style="s2">collective intelligence conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.470" end="00:54:49.430" style="s2">we&#39;ll find a threat of coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.260" end="00:54:52.070" style="s2">that that will build and grow into some</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.430" end="00:54:53.840" style="s2">sort of you know sub meaning or micro</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.070" end="00:54:55.490" style="s2">meaning or is in alignment with their</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.840" end="00:54:57.260" style="s2">own individual meeting even if they</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.490" end="00:54:59.390" style="s2">can&#39;t identify that meaning it&#39;ll light</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.260" end="00:55:01.970" style="s2">something up and then below goes and</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.390" end="00:55:04.670" style="s2">then bring that into action and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.970" end="00:55:06.170" style="s2">hoping that that is what these</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.670" end="00:55:08.780" style="s2">conversations you know you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.170" end="00:55:10.460" style="s2">about the campfire right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.780" end="00:55:11.930" style="s2">that&#39;s what I want to do I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.460" end="00:55:14.390" style="s2">be a little bit more intentional rather</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.930" end="00:55:17.660" style="s2">than casually talk very much very much</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.390" end="00:55:20.630" style="s2">yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.660" end="00:55:24.339" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s a sense in which you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.630" end="00:55:27.019" style="s2">we&#39;re trying we&#39;re trying to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.339" end="00:55:28.250" style="s2">what is it Neurath wrath you know that</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.019" end="00:55:29.509" style="s2">you&#39;re on a raft and you&#39;re rebuilding</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.250" end="00:55:32.480" style="s2">it as you&#39;re as you&#39;re as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.509" end="00:55:36.380" style="s2">floating on it and I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.480" end="00:55:38.930" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to from within the culture</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.380" end="00:55:40.789" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to rebuild it this is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.930" end="00:55:45.259" style="s2">slogan I have about stealing the culture</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.789" end="00:55:49.430" style="s2">right you know you know if we can make</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.259" end="00:55:51.019" style="s2">ways of life and ways of being with</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.430" end="00:55:54.349" style="s2">ourselves and with each other and with</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.019" end="00:55:55.849" style="s2">the world like that do that what you</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.349" end="00:55:58.880" style="s2">just described that sort of that</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.849" end="00:56:01.130" style="s2">expanding field of coherence I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.880" end="00:56:03.019" style="s2">think we could we could do what you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.130" end="00:56:05.150" style="s2">what religions like Christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.019" end="00:56:08.299" style="s2">Buddhism did it didn&#39;t go in and say you</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.150" end="00:56:10.250" style="s2">know I think at times they did but</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.299" end="00:56:12.069" style="s2">mostly what they did is they went in and</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.250" end="00:56:16.190" style="s2">they gave people these new ways of</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.069" end="00:56:18.079" style="s2">talking and being and seeing and growing</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.190" end="00:56:21.680" style="s2">right and and then what happens is it</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.079" end="00:56:26.839" style="s2">you know and a new culture emerges from</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.680" end="00:56:31.970" style="s2">and I think that is there&#39;s a potential</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.839" end="00:56:34.430" style="s2">for that now with the Kairos were in one</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.970" end="00:56:36.650" style="s2">of the things you can see and you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.430" end="00:56:40.009" style="s2">even ask people is was what are you</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.650" end="00:56:42.799" style="s2">reflecting on now like that you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.009" end="00:56:44.720" style="s2">reflecting on before all right like what</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.799" end="00:56:47.329" style="s2">is what is coming to mind more what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.720" end="00:56:51.500" style="s2">oppressing what&#39;s demanding and and and</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.329" end="00:56:53.329" style="s2">and God has this wonderful phrase and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.500" end="00:56:55.869" style="s2">like playing with it riffing on it I</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.329" end="00:56:58.700" style="s2">think well you know coming to terms</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.869" end="00:57:02.329" style="s2">which has both the sense of you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.700" end="00:57:05.329" style="s2">coming to words articulation but also</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.329" end="00:57:08.390" style="s2">confronting and you know you know not</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.329" end="00:57:11.210" style="s2">trying to avoid any more thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.390" end="00:57:13.549" style="s2">so a way I&#39;ve been thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.210" end="00:57:17.089" style="s2">asking people is what&#39;s coming to terms</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.549" end="00:57:20.630" style="s2">for you right now yeah I like that and</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.089" end="00:57:22.640" style="s2">and again and and of course this will</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.630" end="00:57:25.369" style="s2">and so there&#39;s there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.640" end="00:57:27.410" style="s2">the because we are out of normality and</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.369" end="00:57:29.779" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to go back to more the</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.410" end="00:57:31.040" style="s2">even Trudeau said were in this is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.779" end="00:57:36.530" style="s2">new normal right</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.040" end="00:57:40.330" style="s2">oh right because we&#39;re out of it we I</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.530" end="00:57:43.760" style="s2">think we are now willing to reflect upon</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.330" end="00:57:45.500" style="s2">meaning and intelligibility I get your</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.760" end="00:57:48.080" style="s2">point we&#39;re not gonna many people can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.500" end="00:57:51.050" style="s2">reflect on with great expertise and that</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.080" end="00:57:53.480" style="s2">is not a criticism of them yeah oh right</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.050" end="00:57:56.930" style="s2">and it shouldn&#39;t be taken like in in any</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.480" end="00:58:00.380" style="s2">way as that but there&#39;s at least a</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.930" end="00:58:02.660" style="s2">stance of reflection that is now I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.380" end="00:58:06.920" style="s2">becoming more pervasive that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.660" end="00:58:09.830" style="s2">there a couple months ago yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.920" end="00:58:11.510" style="s2">totally I mean not even I think to a</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.830" end="00:58:13.160" style="s2">certain extent for some people I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.510" end="00:58:15.200" style="s2">it was available maybe a couple you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.160" end="00:58:16.550" style="s2">a few weeks ago but for a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.200" end="00:58:18.200" style="s2">it didn&#39;t seem like it was quite</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.550" end="00:58:20.450" style="s2">available for them yet because there is</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.200" end="00:58:23.690" style="s2">still no excuse me the whole situation</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.450" end="00:58:26.810" style="s2">was so novel to them yeah it just had</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.690" end="00:58:28.430" style="s2">you know and now as you you know my my</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.810" end="00:58:30.470" style="s2">experience is you know as the novel</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.430" end="00:58:31.940" style="s2">becomes integrated it becomes sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.470" end="00:58:34.580" style="s2">your background or it becomes you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.940" end="00:58:36.950" style="s2">the water you&#39;re swimming in now you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.580" end="00:58:39.440" style="s2">actually afford to to look at something</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.950" end="00:58:41.780" style="s2">else yeah you know like other things</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.440" end="00:58:44.210" style="s2">become salient to you now that you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.780" end="00:58:46.970" style="s2">you&#39;ve the low-grade anxiety of you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.210" end="00:58:49.400" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna happen you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.970" end="00:58:52.369" style="s2">that&#39;s still there but I mean your your</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.400" end="00:58:53.780" style="s2">new normal is now more of a normal</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.369" end="00:58:55.430" style="s2">you&#39;re not referring to it every day as</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.780" end="00:58:58.670" style="s2">if you&#39;re normal it&#39;s just you know okay</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.430" end="00:59:01.850" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to work and I mean and not</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.670" end="00:59:03.020" style="s2">not to in any way diminish you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.850" end="00:59:04.910" style="s2">they&#39;re people who are suffering</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.020" end="00:59:07.880" style="s2">biologically they&#39;re suffering</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.910" end="00:59:10.340" style="s2">economically and and that is important</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.880" end="00:59:15.170" style="s2">that is very important it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.340" end="00:59:18.740" style="s2">important but I also think that for the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.170" end="00:59:21.140" style="s2">for the people for whom the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.740" end="00:59:22.540" style="s2">the survival urgency is dropping they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.140" end="00:59:25.580" style="s2">now facing like I said they&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.540" end="00:59:27.890" style="s2">meaning disruption normalcy disruption</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.580" end="00:59:29.900" style="s2">and they&#39;re in a marathon now the sprint</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.890" end="00:59:32.990" style="s2">of urgency is now giving way to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.900" end="00:59:35.000" style="s2">marathon of endurance and and that</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.990" end="00:59:36.770" style="s2">causes a different kind of problem</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.000" end="00:59:41.210" style="s2">formulation a different way of relating</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.770" end="00:59:43.790" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s what I mean where</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.210" end="00:59:44.869" style="s2">people are coming into as a well Who am</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.790" end="00:59:48.349" style="s2">I now</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.869" end="00:59:49.460" style="s2">what am I supposed to do and we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.349" end="00:59:51.499" style="s2">trying to fill that with sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.460" end="00:59:54.170" style="s2">entertainment but it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.499" end="00:59:57.469" style="s2">doing a very good job right and it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.170" end="01:00:01.069" style="s2">like well you know the Netflix is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.469" end="01:00:02.359" style="s2">run out and you know all these shows</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.069" end="01:00:04.759" style="s2">that are now being done from people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.359" end="01:00:06.289" style="s2">homes rather than an in the studio is</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.759" end="01:00:09.339" style="s2">that sort of funny and novel for a while</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.289" end="01:00:12.380" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s getting kind of stale now</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.339" end="01:00:16.759" style="s2">what do i do what do I do</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.380" end="01:00:21.109" style="s2">terms yeah exactly exactly exactly yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.759" end="01:00:24.589" style="s2">no I completely agree and you know I</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.109" end="01:00:26.329" style="s2">feel I feel I do feel privileged to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.589" end="01:00:28.219" style="s2">able to actually consider this and have</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.329" end="01:00:30.650" style="s2">these conversations very much in</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.219" end="01:00:32.989" style="s2">survival mode and I get that so many</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.650" end="01:00:34.700" style="s2">people are in survival mode and I you</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.989" end="01:00:36.769" style="s2">know I have no expectation that you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.700" end="01:00:38.509" style="s2">anybody can necessarily do that in that</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.769" end="01:00:39.920" style="s2">place I mean it&#39;s for a reason why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.509" end="01:00:42.079" style="s2">not running training courses right now</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.920" end="01:00:44.599" style="s2">it&#39;s just like it&#39;s this is not the</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.079" end="01:00:46.130" style="s2">place for that kind of learning this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.599" end="01:00:47.680" style="s2">a different kind of a learning that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.130" end="01:00:51.380" style="s2">going to be happening here</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.680" end="01:00:52.839" style="s2">so yeah they say you know don&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.380" end="01:00:56.119" style="s2">preach to somebody when they need a coat</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.839" end="01:01:00.349" style="s2">exactly right that&#39;s not the thing you</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.119" end="01:01:02.210" style="s2">know so I there&#39;s one more thing I</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.349" end="01:01:03.979" style="s2">wanted to bring up and then I&#39;ll turn it</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.210" end="01:01:07.519" style="s2">back you can answer that and then also</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.979" end="01:01:10.660" style="s2">turn it back towards like giving you a</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.519" end="01:01:12.799" style="s2">summative response to our conversation I</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.660" end="01:01:14.660" style="s2">had a wonderful conversation with Tim</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.799" end="01:01:17.359" style="s2">Madeline and Nora Bateson and Nora</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.660" end="01:01:19.940" style="s2">Bateson and I with the collective we</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.359" end="01:01:21.019" style="s2">very much want to talk again I bring</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.940" end="01:01:22.729" style="s2">this up because you brought up the issue</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.019" end="01:01:26.420" style="s2">about introducing complexity and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.729" end="01:01:28.309" style="s2">her thing the warm data is you know most</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.420" end="01:01:30.739" style="s2">of our problems are complex problems in</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.309" end="01:01:32.239" style="s2">which we are immersed we can&#39;t help we</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.739" end="01:01:34.549" style="s2">can&#39;t sort of remove ourselves from them</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.239" end="01:01:36.529" style="s2">and get the cold hard facts and of</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.549" end="01:01:38.479" style="s2">course the co good thing right is very</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.529" end="01:01:40.460" style="s2">much that kind of immersive complexity</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.479" end="01:01:42.170" style="s2">right and you need the warm data and she</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.460" end="01:01:45.170" style="s2">talks about that it&#39;s very important but</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.170" end="01:01:46.940" style="s2">she&#39;s developed you know a distributed a</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.170" end="01:01:49.190" style="s2">distributed cognition cycle technology</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.940" end="01:01:51.380" style="s2">and she and I talked about it quite at</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.190" end="01:01:53.299" style="s2">length and I noticed that it was</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.380" end="01:01:56.089" style="s2">happening even in other meetups that</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.299" end="01:01:57.109" style="s2">like in peter lindbergh stoah is you get</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.089" end="01:01:58.420" style="s2">together as a group and then you break</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.109" end="01:02:00.640" style="s2">up into small groups and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.420" end="01:02:02.470" style="s2">return and when guy was taking us</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.640" end="01:02:04.030" style="s2">through that we do that that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.470" end="01:02:05.619" style="s2">the dictates of the medium right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.030" end="01:02:07.480" style="s2">also part of the dictates of human</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.619" end="01:02:11.740" style="s2">conversation but Norris had this</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.480" end="01:02:15.130" style="s2">brilliant insight where what she does is</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.740" end="01:02:16.809" style="s2">and and for me I don&#39;t know she I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.130" end="01:02:18.849" style="s2">think she&#39;d dislike this and we really</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.809" end="01:02:21.010" style="s2">really really hit it off so I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.849" end="01:02:24.700" style="s2">she&#39;d at least find a soccer bug I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.010" end="01:02:27.460" style="s2">she started a way of getting a virtual</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.700" end="01:02:29.710" style="s2">Socrates into this because what she does</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.460" end="01:02:31.210" style="s2">right is she</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.710" end="01:02:32.799" style="s2">people going to the groups and then they</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.210" end="01:02:35.140" style="s2">stay in groups for a while and then one</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.799" end="01:02:36.369" style="s2">person moves between the groups and</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.140" end="01:02:39.190" style="s2">people can move between the</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.369" end="01:02:42.280" style="s2">conversations and what happens is they</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.190" end="01:02:44.619" style="s2">come in and they introduce the other</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.280" end="01:02:46.450" style="s2">groups perspective and that&#39;s disruptive</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.619" end="01:02:47.950" style="s2">and then things get read and then what</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.450" end="01:02:49.329" style="s2">you have is this dynamic small world</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.950" end="01:02:51.880" style="s2">networks in which all the groups are</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.329" end="01:02:54.520" style="s2">doing this distributed restructuring of</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.880" end="01:02:57.790" style="s2">each other and then they come back into</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.520" end="01:02:59.290" style="s2">the group and people have this there</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.790" end="01:03:01.599" style="s2">they&#39;re there they have this much more</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.290" end="01:03:03.549" style="s2">comprehensive perspective that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.599" end="01:03:05.680" style="s2">trying to bring in and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.549" end="01:03:09.400" style="s2">also something that we need to consider</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.680" end="01:03:11.640" style="s2">as a you know as as one of these</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.400" end="01:03:14.109" style="s2">bridging practices that helps to get so</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.640" end="01:03:17.200" style="s2">rather than waiting for Socrates to show</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.109" end="01:03:19.630" style="s2">up or hoping that everybody is in an axe</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.200" end="01:03:22.690" style="s2">Artie I thought that&#39;s really neat</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.630" end="01:03:25.720" style="s2">because what&#39;s happened is you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.690" end="01:03:28.109" style="s2">basically distributed Socrates and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.720" end="01:03:31.180" style="s2">happening dynamically and bottom-up and</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.109" end="01:03:34.740" style="s2">and so I just wanted to hold that out to</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.180" end="01:03:38.319" style="s2">you as a really interesting you know a</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.740" end="01:03:39.760" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean an insult by this to</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.319" end="01:03:41.470" style="s2">you Nora but it&#39;s just really</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.760" end="01:03:43.930" style="s2">interesting you know tweaking and</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.470" end="01:03:46.329" style="s2">restructuring of this machinery that</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.930" end="01:03:48.220" style="s2">actually affords again another way in</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.329" end="01:03:51.010" style="s2">which we could sort of get people in</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.220" end="01:03:54.760" style="s2">transition we can start to get them to</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.010" end="01:03:56.020" style="s2">exemplify a much more complex system so</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.760" end="01:03:59.740" style="s2">I thought that was actually really kind</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.020" end="01:04:01.299" style="s2">of brilliant hmm yeah yeah I know I like</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.740" end="01:04:03.369" style="s2">guys were talking about I noticed I got</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.299" end="01:04:05.260" style="s2">you know pretty pretty lit up and</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.369" end="01:04:06.760" style="s2">started smiling a lot there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.260" end="01:04:07.990" style="s2">and I think part of that&#39;s also you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.760" end="01:04:09.910" style="s2">the motion that you&#39;re bringing to it</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.990" end="01:04:11.340" style="s2">but it&#39;s also like yes you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.910" end="01:04:14.280" style="s2">about complexity</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.340" end="01:04:18.000" style="s2">and I really enjoy that and I also</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.280" end="01:04:20.190" style="s2">noticed so boy seen as you were talking</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.000" end="01:04:21.960" style="s2">about I wasn&#39;t even so much holding the</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.190" end="01:04:25.040" style="s2">frame of complexity I was holding it as</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.960" end="01:04:28.140" style="s2">like like a real practical exercise in</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.040" end="01:04:31.740" style="s2">sort of for for the project or you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.140" end="01:04:33.720" style="s2">for this you know this conversation that</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.740" end="01:04:35.400" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to have like how do you do</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.720" end="01:04:38.160" style="s2">this in a large group how do you have a</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.400" end="01:04:39.510" style="s2">large group conversation you know like</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.160" end="01:04:41.880" style="s2">you know Peter on the stove</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.510" end="01:04:43.320" style="s2">you know got like anywhere from 30 to 70</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.880" end="01:04:45.510" style="s2">people coming on there you know you</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.320" end="01:04:46.950" style="s2">can&#39;t have a conversation where</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.510" end="01:04:48.810" style="s2">everybody&#39;s voice comes into the big</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.950" end="01:04:52.860" style="s2">group with three to seven people but</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.810" end="01:04:55.950" style="s2">with 30 to 70 people you have a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.860" end="01:04:58.140" style="s2">cognition available yeah but if only</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.950" end="01:04:59.940" style="s2">five people are talking a lot of it gets</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.140" end="01:05:02.010" style="s2">wasted the collective intelligence will</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.940" end="01:05:03.690" style="s2">get wasted and it might afford some</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.010" end="01:05:05.160" style="s2">insight for those individuals and that&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.690" end="01:05:08.460" style="s2">be great for them but you know it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.160" end="01:05:11.250" style="s2">group one missing out on it so just even</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.460" end="01:05:14.820" style="s2">that that idea of like as being like a</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.250" end="01:05:16.320" style="s2">stage to sort of like yeah determine</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.820" end="01:05:19.470" style="s2">what is the thing that we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.320" end="01:05:23.760" style="s2">going to discuss like almost canvassing</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.470" end="01:05:25.800" style="s2">the collective around a broader topic it</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.760" end="01:05:29.400" style="s2">it seems to me will come to a more</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.800" end="01:05:31.260" style="s2">coherent and focused area then you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.400" end="01:05:33.660" style="s2">almost like instead of us doing the move</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.260" end="01:05:36.450" style="s2">when we&#39;re in you know sort of in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.660" end="01:05:38.640" style="s2">eye we circling and then waiting for</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.450" end="01:05:40.740" style="s2">that moment to come in small group it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.640" end="01:05:43.830" style="s2">like oh can we bring in like a general</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.740" end="01:05:46.590" style="s2">topic split everybody out have everybody</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.830" end="01:05:48.630" style="s2">sort of in fact one another with with an</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.590" end="01:05:50.580" style="s2">idea to see maybe something shifts in</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.630" end="01:05:52.530" style="s2">that group or maybe they just dismiss it</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.580" end="01:05:55.560" style="s2">and then we come back in and see like</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.530" end="01:05:58.050" style="s2">okay so what&#39;s here for us now what</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.560" end="01:06:00.450" style="s2">would like where are we now and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.050" end="01:06:01.770" style="s2">that place allows us to turn around and</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.450" end="01:06:03.270" style="s2">say okay this is the thing and then you</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.770" end="01:06:04.890" style="s2">know if you&#39;ve got a big group you can</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.270" end="01:06:06.360" style="s2">either have that conversation because</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.890" end="01:06:08.310" style="s2">you don&#39;t need all the voices in anymore</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.360" end="01:06:09.660" style="s2">because you have some coherence or II</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.310" end="01:06:12.480" style="s2">then you can break out and have that</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.660" end="01:06:13.980" style="s2">specific conversation yeah so I noticed</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.480" end="01:06:16.920" style="s2">I was getting really excited about that</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.980" end="01:06:19.440" style="s2">and and also I think that&#39;s a training</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.920" end="01:06:21.690" style="s2">tool for complexity yeah it is I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.440" end="01:06:23.370" style="s2">it&#39;s also like a part warm-up as well</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.690" end="01:06:24.030" style="s2">like that can be the warm-up to to turn</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.370" end="01:06:26.400" style="s2">on in your life</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.030" end="01:06:27.720" style="s2">more complexity of perspective and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.400" end="01:06:28.800" style="s2">interesting because the person the</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.720" end="01:06:30.270" style="s2">people that are moving between the</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.800" end="01:06:32.160" style="s2">groups and everybody will at some point</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.270" end="01:06:33.570" style="s2">perhaps or maybe not they might just</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.160" end="01:06:36.390" style="s2">stay but those people are really</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.570" end="01:06:39.450" style="s2">embodying right they&#39;re not only they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.390" end="01:06:41.310" style="s2">not only gonna be bringing ideas right</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.450" end="01:06:44.340" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna be bringing timing and</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.310" end="01:06:46.290" style="s2">pacing and perspective and a way of</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.340" end="01:06:48.960" style="s2">inhabiting your body right and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.290" end="01:06:51.420" style="s2">salience there all kinds of stuff is</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.960" end="01:06:52.890" style="s2">gonna be carried between the subgroups</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.420" end="01:06:54.360" style="s2">and and they&#39;re gonna start resonating</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.890" end="01:06:56.130" style="s2">with each other in this really</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.360" end="01:06:57.960" style="s2">interesting that&#39;s what she calls it a</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.130" end="01:07:01.620" style="s2">warm data lab which i think is a really</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.960" end="01:07:04.290" style="s2">cool idea um so like I said I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.620" end="01:07:08.960" style="s2">what&#39;s emerging is like I said is this</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.290" end="01:07:12.570" style="s2">very sophisticated pedagogical program</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.960" end="01:07:15.180" style="s2">practices with some sort of with an</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.570" end="01:07:21.420" style="s2">apprenticeship model with some you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.180" end="01:07:23.370" style="s2">scaled imitation going on and where we</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.420" end="01:07:27.330" style="s2">try to get people first to really</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.370" end="01:07:29.520" style="s2">exemplify something and then get them to</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.330" end="01:07:32.280" style="s2">reflect on it which so these are things</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.520" end="01:07:35.190" style="s2">that are coming out so Taylor I wanted</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.280" end="01:07:37.620" style="s2">to give you a chance to whatever you</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.190" end="01:07:40.170" style="s2">would like to say that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.620" end="01:07:40.890" style="s2">summative or on your mind as we sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.170" end="01:07:44.010" style="s2">bring this to a close</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.890" end="01:07:45.900" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah just thank you appreciate it</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.010" end="01:07:47.700" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like this was the</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.900" end="01:07:50.160" style="s2">discussion that I think you and I were</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.700" end="01:07:52.650" style="s2">going to have anyways yeah yeah and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.160" end="01:07:54.330" style="s2">hopefully it&#39;s valuable for others who</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.650" end="01:07:56.600" style="s2">are also playing in this field or maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.330" end="01:07:58.890" style="s2">feel inspired to play in this field too</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.600" end="01:08:00.570" style="s2">because you know I think it was when</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.890" end="01:08:01.830" style="s2">David Fuller was visiting Tron and we</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.570" end="01:08:05.180" style="s2">said something about like we need to</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.830" end="01:08:07.680" style="s2">fail and fail faster so I&#39;m I&#39;m all for</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.180" end="01:08:09.330" style="s2">for throwing more irons into the fire</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.680" end="01:08:11.910" style="s2">and the same of people are coming up</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.330" end="01:08:13.680" style="s2">with and hopefully we can you know this</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.910" end="01:08:16.260" style="s2">can start to come more into the field</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.680" end="01:08:18.630" style="s2">because it was me hearing you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.260" end="01:08:20.640" style="s2">schmuck Dan burger and wheel over here</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.630" end="01:08:21.960" style="s2">and then you and Jordan Hall over here</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.640" end="01:08:23.549" style="s2">and it&#39;s just like and then I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.960" end="01:08:25.440" style="s2">my you know like there was a distributed</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.549" end="01:08:27.480" style="s2">cognition happening just through you</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.440" end="01:08:29.549" style="s2">know two videos yeah yeah it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.480" end="01:08:31.140" style="s2">if we can add a little bit more into</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.549" end="01:08:32.819" style="s2">that you know other people trying</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.140" end="01:08:36.660" style="s2">experimenting with cycle technologies</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.819" end="01:08:37.410" style="s2">you know with sort of this intention to</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.660" end="01:08:40.320" style="s2">move</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.410" end="01:08:43.110" style="s2">Ward&#39;s you know philosophy a-- you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.320" end="01:08:45.779" style="s2">to or to enact the logos through you</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.110" end="01:08:47.000" style="s2">know through this sort of reciprocal</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.779" end="01:08:49.710" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.000" end="01:08:52.640" style="s2">engagement within a group or around a</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.710" end="01:08:55.980" style="s2">problem i&#39;m pretty excited about it</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.640" end="01:08:57.690" style="s2">again I hold that frame like you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.980" end="01:08:59.250" style="s2">and this frame primarily comes from</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.690" end="01:09:01.830" style="s2">integral theory but it&#39;s this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.250" end="01:09:03.930" style="s2">complexity is the lubricant that helps</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.830" end="01:09:07.440" style="s2">us move through to the next stage yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.930" end="01:09:09.480" style="s2">I&#39;m all for ways of making things more</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.440" end="01:09:12.510" style="s2">complex but I want to try to find a way</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.480" end="01:09:14.520" style="s2">to make them accessible to you know in</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.510" end="01:09:17.220" style="s2">and have a practice it&#39;s only available</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.520" end="01:09:19.350" style="s2">for people who&#39;ve done your circling</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.220" end="01:09:21.270" style="s2">training and everything else so I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.350" end="01:09:22.920" style="s2">much on board and you know want to stay</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.270" end="01:09:25.800" style="s2">in dialogue with you both sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.920" end="01:09:28.860" style="s2">pedagogy like a how do we how do we do</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.800" end="01:09:32.660" style="s2">this and how do we do it quickly</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.860" end="01:09:36.570" style="s2">you know quickly and safely yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.660" end="01:09:38.610" style="s2">yeah it has to be quick it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.570" end="01:09:41.160" style="s2">safe it has to be scalable but it also</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.610" end="01:09:44.660" style="s2">has to be rigorous so this all of these</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.160" end="01:09:47.340" style="s2">is is the challenge we&#39;re facing yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.660" end="01:09:48.570" style="s2">well it&#39;s just been wonderful to see you</p>

<p begin="01:09:51.110" end="01:09:55.350" style="s2">though I&#39;ve just enjoyed being in your</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.280" end="01:09:57.600" style="s2">presence but I really I really this</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.350" end="01:09:59.760" style="s2">really caught fire between us too as we</p>
