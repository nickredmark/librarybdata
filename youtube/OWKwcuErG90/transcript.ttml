<p begin="00:00:00.060" end="00:00:09.150" style="s2">cool we&#39;re just talking about we started</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.879" end="00:00:10.800" style="s2">talking about John&#39;s practices and I and</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.150" end="00:00:13.620" style="s2">I just committed to doing a meditation</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.800" end="00:00:17.010" style="s2">like an extra hour of meditation each</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.620" end="00:00:20.460" style="s2">each morning and so we started going</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.010" end="00:00:22.890" style="s2">asking him about his practices yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.460" end="00:00:25.619" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting because I&#39;m I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.890" end="00:00:29.250" style="s2">thinking in parallel too because of</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.619" end="00:00:31.740" style="s2">getting requests about this parallel to</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.250" end="00:00:32.730" style="s2">the after Socrates series I&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.740" end="00:00:35.059" style="s2">few of these doing some more</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.730" end="00:00:39.930" style="s2">instructional videos on meditation</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.059" end="00:00:42.570" style="s2">contemplation Praja practice some stuff</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.930" end="00:00:46.739" style="s2">probably uh maybe a little bit on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.570" end="00:00:48.930" style="s2">cheek on the each one tai chi also some</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.739" end="00:00:50.910" style="s2">maybe also and so Alexia Davina and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.930" end="00:00:56.070" style="s2">journaling practices what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.910" end="00:00:57.870" style="s2">mentioning to you so I haven&#39;t taken it</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.070" end="00:01:00.180" style="s2">up I&#39;ve got the resources and I bought</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.870" end="00:01:01.920" style="s2">it I want to try and take up sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.180" end="00:01:04.199" style="s2">sacred geometry practice trying to work</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.920" end="00:01:06.150" style="s2">through Euclid&#39;s elements and doing the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.199" end="00:01:07.799" style="s2">geometry because I&#39;m trying in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.150" end="00:01:09.540" style="s2">ecology of practice idea I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.799" end="00:01:12.030" style="s2">find not only the checks and balances</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.540" end="00:01:13.799" style="s2">kind of idea the opponent processing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.030" end="00:01:16.259" style="s2">also trying to find any finding find</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.799" end="00:01:18.990" style="s2">mediating practices like this is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.259" end="00:01:20.970" style="s2">mediate between kinds of knowing so</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.990" end="00:01:25.409" style="s2">they&#39;re thinking about the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.970" end="00:01:26.700" style="s2">geometry is I think it it mediates</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.409" end="00:01:30.450" style="s2">between the perspectival and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.700" end="00:01:31.530" style="s2">propositional on a certain way yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.450" end="00:01:33.060" style="s2">a bit of the procedural because you</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.530" end="00:01:34.350" style="s2">actually construct the figures when</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.060" end="00:01:37.920" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do some of the proofs</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.350" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">and stuff like that and I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.920" end="00:01:43.290" style="s2">an ancillary practice for dialectic so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:44.790" style="s2">want to I&#39;m trying to do that I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.290" end="00:01:46.770" style="s2">might become part of my personal</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.790" end="00:01:48.329" style="s2">practice but I&#39;m doing it because I want</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.770" end="00:01:51.210" style="s2">to sort of enhance the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.329" end="00:01:54.180" style="s2">observation around dialectic right step</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.210" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">starting that up soon so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.180" end="00:01:59.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of practices I do that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:02:00.630" style="s2">are my ongoing noctis&#39;s and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.040" end="00:02:03.210" style="s2">practices I take up as sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.630" end="00:02:05.490" style="s2">participative observer to try and get</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.210" end="00:02:07.079" style="s2">material and understanding for some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.490" end="00:02:09.149" style="s2">the work I&#39;m doing I mean I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.079" end="00:02:11.720" style="s2">interested about what what</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.149" end="00:02:15.569" style="s2">what you find with the sacred geometry</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.720" end="00:02:17.220" style="s2">which um which book are you reading by</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.569" end="00:02:32.640" style="s2">the way yeah hang on I&#39;ll go get it</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.220" end="00:02:35.700" style="s2">yeah I think I think this is the book</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.640" end="00:02:38.159" style="s2">you mentioned to me it&#39;s this one okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.700" end="00:02:39.870" style="s2">oh no no no I got I got an older one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.159" end="00:02:44.629" style="s2">that sacred geometry for artists and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.870" end="00:02:47.389" style="s2">dreamers oh cool okay very cool yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.629" end="00:02:50.970" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna try and do this and I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.389" end="00:02:53.939" style="s2">Euclid&#39;s elements the greek-english big</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.970" end="00:03:00.150" style="s2">version and so that&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.939" end="00:03:03.780" style="s2">and do yeah see because I I have a set I</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.150" end="00:03:05.340" style="s2">mean I have a sense that that because</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.780" end="00:03:06.720" style="s2">the that&#39;s the only way Greeks the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.340" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">Greeks did math is they own that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.720" end="00:03:10.280" style="s2">only did it in geometry they didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:14.819" style="s2">anything like algebra or what we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.280" end="00:03:16.889" style="s2">calculus of course so I want to see if</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.819" end="00:03:18.780" style="s2">that particular way of developing sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.889" end="00:03:20.760" style="s2">of rigorous inferential propositional</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.780" end="00:03:24.569" style="s2">thinking in connection with you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.760" end="00:03:26.840" style="s2">constructing figures and thinking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.569" end="00:03:31.230" style="s2">sort of a spatial perspective of fashion</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.840" end="00:03:33.299" style="s2">yeah I want I want to see I have I have</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.230" end="00:03:35.370" style="s2">some intuitions that it interacts with</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.299" end="00:03:37.349" style="s2">the kind of cognitive flexibility in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.370" end="00:03:39.359" style="s2">perspective of movement and the theory a</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.349" end="00:03:42.209" style="s2">theory or the thing that&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.359" end="00:03:43.919" style="s2">in dialectical practice yeah so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.209" end="00:03:45.930" style="s2">know yet it&#39;s something I want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.919" end="00:03:50.849" style="s2">explore I haven&#39;t I haven&#39;t been able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.930" end="00:03:53.459" style="s2">find any academic work on that I&#39;ll keep</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.849" end="00:03:56.400" style="s2">looking mm-hmm I would imagine it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.459" end="00:04:01.379" style="s2">open because I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.400" end="00:04:03.629" style="s2">scouring the internet for or things</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.379" end="00:04:06.900" style="s2">about what the Platonic Academy actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.629" end="00:04:10.049" style="s2">practiced yeah it is not a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.900" end="00:04:12.269" style="s2">there&#39;s not a whole lot out there and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.049" end="00:04:14.419" style="s2">I&#39;ve got bits and pieces one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.269" end="00:04:16.919" style="s2">things I&#39;d like to do is to try and also</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.419" end="00:04:19.200" style="s2">read through the Platonic dialogues in</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.919" end="00:04:20.639" style="s2">the in the neo platonic order so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.200" end="00:04:22.590" style="s2">neoplatonist got an order in which</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.639" end="00:04:24.360" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to read the dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.590" end="00:04:25.920" style="s2">again to try and get some of that what</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.360" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about the four of us</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.920" end="00:04:31.080" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that that sort of meta</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:32.669" style="s2">dialogue since you know the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.080" end="00:04:34.560" style="s2">that unfolds between the dialogues the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.669" end="00:04:37.650" style="s2">via logos that unfolds between all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.560" end="00:04:39.060" style="s2">individual dialogues and so if they have</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.650" end="00:04:41.639" style="s2">a tradition of how you&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.060" end="00:04:43.620" style="s2">read through the dialogues that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.639" end="00:04:45.240" style="s2">supposed to be not it&#39;s not like our</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.620" end="00:04:47.910" style="s2">modern obsession with their historical</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.240" end="00:04:49.230" style="s2">lineage of the dialogues but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.910" end="00:04:51.389" style="s2">developmental one what&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.230" end="00:04:55.290" style="s2">ordering pedagogical transformative</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.389" end="00:04:56.850" style="s2">ordering of the dialogues so I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.290" end="00:04:59.640" style="s2">try and do that as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.850" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">see if my will see if my time and my</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.640" end="00:05:03.780" style="s2">resources and my energy match my</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:05.940" style="s2">ambitions that&#39;s always that&#39;s always an</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.780" end="00:05:07.950" style="s2">issue well Chris Chris and I were</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.940" end="00:05:11.130" style="s2">talking about getting together and just</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.950" end="00:05:13.169" style="s2">reading reading through the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.130" end="00:05:15.510" style="s2">dialogues and actually I had this</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.169" end="00:05:18.930" style="s2">thought about it&#39;d be interesting for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.510" end="00:05:20.610" style="s2">like say there&#39;s you know I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.930" end="00:05:23.760" style="s2">how many interlocked earth but have as</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.610" end="00:05:26.100" style="s2">many people you know just have a they</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.760" end="00:05:28.530" style="s2">take a character and in there just</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.100" end="00:05:31.260" style="s2">taking your phone and going on a walk</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.530" end="00:05:33.600" style="s2">and doing it like on a walk with yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.260" end="00:05:36.090" style="s2">yeah somehow and you kind of sit down</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.600" end="00:05:37.530" style="s2">and you just I just thought that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.090" end="00:05:38.910" style="s2">would be really interesting with you</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.530" end="00:05:42.090" style="s2">know that sounds like a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.910" end="00:05:44.490" style="s2">idea yeah that&#39;s a good idea I know that</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.090" end="00:05:46.710" style="s2">Jonathan Miller at one point filmed a</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.490" end="00:05:48.990" style="s2">few of the dialogues he actually turned</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.710" end="00:05:50.610" style="s2">them into little plays and actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.990" end="00:05:52.050" style="s2">filmed them yeah I have been able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.610" end="00:05:53.490" style="s2">track those down maybe they&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.050" end="00:05:56.610" style="s2">YouTube somewhere I should look again</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.490" end="00:05:58.229" style="s2">yeah see see as we get further and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.610" end="00:06:00.390" style="s2">further into the age of YouTube more and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.229" end="00:06:02.190" style="s2">more things are findable on it that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.390" end="00:06:02.430" style="s2">used to be very very difficult to track</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.190" end="00:06:07.770" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.430" end="00:06:09.900" style="s2">Oh totally the the yeah I&#39;m my sense the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.770" end="00:06:13.500" style="s2">reading that I&#39;ve done in the book that</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.900" end="00:06:16.850" style="s2">I have on sacred geometry it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.500" end="00:06:19.830" style="s2">interesting I&#39;ve always been bad at math</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.850" end="00:06:22.410" style="s2">mm-hmm way today I was like wow if I</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.830" end="00:06:24.090" style="s2">were to read this book right and doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.410" end="00:06:26.850" style="s2">math I think math would have occurred a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.090" end="00:06:28.770" style="s2">lot differently I think it does and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.850" end="00:06:29.960" style="s2">gives you a sense and this is also why</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.770" end="00:06:32.599" style="s2">I&#39;m very interested in it because</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.960" end="00:06:36.690" style="s2">Neoplatonism is also deeply affected by</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.599" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">a revival of Pythagorean by</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.690" end="00:06:41.970" style="s2">deeply and Pythagoras is this weird</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:43.319" style="s2">figure right because he&#39;s both he&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.970" end="00:06:47.250" style="s2">one since he&#39;s shamanic but he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.319" end="00:06:49.949" style="s2">this mathematical I guess genius or</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.250" end="00:06:54.240" style="s2">something right and so I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.949" end="00:06:55.319" style="s2">also in because when you say when you</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.240" end="00:06:56.729" style="s2">know when you read text and you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.319" end="00:06:58.139" style="s2">it&#39;s all made out of numbers we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.729" end="00:07:00.690" style="s2">go like what what does that doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.139" end="00:07:02.039" style="s2">any sense cuz we think of numbers right</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.690" end="00:07:03.150" style="s2">if we don&#39;t think of the numerals if we</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.039" end="00:07:05.370" style="s2">actually think of numbers we just think</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.150" end="00:07:08.659" style="s2">of them as abstract sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.370" end="00:07:11.159" style="s2">things yeah but when you do when all</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.659" end="00:07:13.139" style="s2">when all of math is geometry numbers</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.159" end="00:07:15.599" style="s2">actually have a shape they take up space</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.139" end="00:07:17.729" style="s2">in certain ways right and they they have</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.599" end="00:07:20.639" style="s2">these sort of synesthetic almost thin</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.729" end="00:07:25.169" style="s2">aesthetic qualities to them that get</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.639" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">connoted into the the number and and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.169" end="00:07:28.440" style="s2">know there&#39;s evidence that when people</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:33.449" style="s2">are engaged in mindfulness practices</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.440" end="00:07:36.060" style="s2">that it tends to enhance synesthesia so</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.449" end="00:07:38.819" style="s2">again I know I&#39;m I don&#39;t know but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.060" end="00:07:41.400" style="s2">wanted to explore this well give a sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.819" end="00:07:44.849" style="s2">of that Pythagorean understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.400" end="00:07:46.620" style="s2">number that was so important right and</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.849" end="00:07:49.560" style="s2">then and then what does that do you</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.620" end="00:07:53.789" style="s2">again for the practice of dialectic what</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.560" end="00:07:57.180" style="s2">does that mean because if you can if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.789" end="00:07:58.500" style="s2">can get like it feels like what you do</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.180" end="00:08:00.300" style="s2">with a mnemonic when you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.500" end="00:08:02.279" style="s2">remember abstract information and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.300" end="00:08:04.199" style="s2">create these images to remember them</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.279" end="00:08:06.120" style="s2">like will it act like a mnemonic</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.199" end="00:08:08.370" style="s2">enhancer when you have sort of sacred</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.120" end="00:08:09.960" style="s2">geometry I don&#39;t know I think these are</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.370" end="00:08:14.430" style="s2">a lot of things I want to sort of see I</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.960" end="00:08:16.379" style="s2">want to explore my sense in reading it I</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.430" end="00:08:20.610" style="s2">want to do the practices to undo this</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.379" end="00:08:23.759" style="s2">and just get a I that&#39;s my that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.610" end="00:08:26.039" style="s2">my interest as well is is get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.759" end="00:08:30.259" style="s2">cuz I do get this sense in some</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.039" end="00:08:35.130" style="s2">intuitive way that I don&#39;t know how but</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.259" end="00:08:37.349" style="s2">the whatever it is that you exercise you</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.130" end="00:08:39.659" style="s2">know it&#39;s like holding multiple</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.349" end="00:08:44.750" style="s2">dimensions at once and got like a song</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.659" end="00:08:48.600" style="s2">back and forth and that whole movement</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.750" end="00:08:50.160" style="s2">heals a lot like what it&#39;s I&#39;m imagining</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.600" end="00:08:52.860" style="s2">it&#39;ll feel a lot like</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.160" end="00:08:57.389" style="s2">what it is to kind of be in a circling</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.860" end="00:08:59.579" style="s2">group right yeah room and people in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.389" end="00:09:01.470" style="s2">in the circling practices well so what</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.579" end="00:09:05.250" style="s2">I&#39;ve observed is they often fall into</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.470" end="00:09:06.839" style="s2">sort of geometrical languages at some</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.250" end="00:09:10.889" style="s2">point they&#39;ll talk about intersections</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.839" end="00:09:13.649" style="s2">and like you know the few points and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.889" end="00:09:14.850" style="s2">know perspectives and and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.649" end="00:09:16.649" style="s2">and what they&#39;ll do is they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.850" end="00:09:18.720" style="s2">spatialize it as I&#39;m doing with gesture</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.649" end="00:09:21.750" style="s2">yeah and they&#39;ll be all this gesturing</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.720" end="00:09:24.060" style="s2">that&#39;s going on I think of geometry is</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.750" end="00:09:27.079" style="s2">something like that again it&#39;s picking</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.060" end="00:09:32.310" style="s2">up on that place between gesture and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.079" end="00:09:34.019" style="s2">proposition as well because of course</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.310" end="00:09:36.720" style="s2">very often what we&#39;re doing when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.019" end="00:09:38.819" style="s2">gesturing is we&#39;re doing is geometrical</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.720" end="00:09:41.699" style="s2">like we&#39;re doing specialization but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.819" end="00:09:43.740" style="s2">not just space we&#39;re often figuring and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.699" end="00:09:46.550" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to figure and we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.740" end="00:09:50.579" style="s2">to manipulate the figure as a way of no</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.550" end="00:09:52.470" style="s2">exploring intelligibility and so again</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.579" end="00:09:54.360" style="s2">this is this this is something I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.470" end="00:10:00.689" style="s2">interested in because I want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.360" end="00:10:04.259" style="s2">understand like I said you know what</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.689" end="00:10:07.589" style="s2">what could we use that could help us</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.259" end="00:10:12.540" style="s2">sort of reverse-engineer these often</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.589" end="00:10:13.980" style="s2">really cryptic maddeningly cryptic and</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.540" end="00:10:16.079" style="s2">exciting statements that are made about</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.980" end="00:10:17.699" style="s2">dialectic when you read about it cuz</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.079" end="00:10:19.529" style="s2">they talk about it is the greatest of</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.699" end="00:10:21.509" style="s2">the sciences and you know and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.529" end="00:10:23.279" style="s2">this and there&#39;s all this really like in</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.509" end="00:10:26.189" style="s2">this world and it&#39;s frustrating it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.279" end="00:10:28.529" style="s2">indirect and I think that&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.189" end="00:10:31.019" style="s2">they&#39;re being coy or there&#39;s there being</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.529" end="00:10:33.209" style="s2">you know esoteric the pejorative sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.019" end="00:10:37.709" style="s2">of the word I think that dialectic was</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.209" end="00:10:39.480" style="s2">so pervasive and it&#39;s so permeated right</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.709" end="00:10:42.029" style="s2">it was so close to them like you often</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.480" end="00:10:45.509" style="s2">talk about the nearness that like they</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.029" end="00:10:47.579" style="s2">can&#39;t get outside of it enough to talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.509" end="00:10:52.019" style="s2">about it to somebody that&#39;s outside of</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.579" end="00:10:54.240" style="s2">it the way we are and so because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.019" end="00:10:56.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot sort of like in like</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.240" end="00:10:59.160" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s lots of talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.610" end="00:11:00.660" style="s2">about it but there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.160" end="00:11:01.920" style="s2">well this is how you do it all right</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.660" end="00:11:03.840" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s nothing there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.920" end="00:11:06.210" style="s2">that comes close to that</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.840" end="00:11:09.270" style="s2">and so trying to reverse engineer as</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.210" end="00:11:09.840" style="s2">best as we plausibly can I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.270" end="00:11:11.670" style="s2">all we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.840" end="00:11:14.250" style="s2">oh yeah part of that&#39;s what I&#39;m probably</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.670" end="00:11:16.980" style="s2">interested in because in the end guy I</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.250" end="00:11:19.230" style="s2">mean I mean I am interested in it</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.980" end="00:11:20.700" style="s2">historically but in the end my interest</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.230" end="00:11:24.810" style="s2">is more as a cognitive scientist I want</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.700" end="00:11:26.670" style="s2">to try and craft some kind of useless</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.810" end="00:11:30.180" style="s2">useful not useless</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.670" end="00:11:32.430" style="s2">Oh what is love useful bridge between</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.180" end="00:11:37.040" style="s2">whatever that was something that could</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.430" end="00:11:39.690" style="s2">act as a template for us now yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.040" end="00:11:42.240" style="s2">trying to craft you know something</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.690" end="00:11:43.680" style="s2">analogous yeah Jordan what Jordan calls</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.240" end="00:11:46.620" style="s2">the meta psycho technology what you</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.680" end="00:11:48.180" style="s2">sometimes call circling 2.0 you guys</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.620" end="00:11:50.310" style="s2">have different names for convergent</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.180" end="00:11:51.930" style="s2">things that&#39;s what I&#39;m at that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.310" end="00:11:56.250" style="s2">project I&#39;m ultimately more interested</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.930" end="00:11:58.430" style="s2">in so I mean I&#39;ll try my best to be as</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.250" end="00:12:01.740" style="s2">historically accurate but I have no</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.430" end="00:12:04.140" style="s2">illusions that are gonna get that close</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.740" end="00:12:05.640" style="s2">to the like you know a confident</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.140" end="00:12:08.070" style="s2">historical claim because the evidence is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.640" end="00:12:11.280" style="s2">just too underdetermined it&#39;s just 200</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.070" end="00:12:12.330" style="s2">determined yeah and that that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.280" end="00:12:14.310" style="s2">the things I think would be really</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.330" end="00:12:16.020" style="s2">interesting for us at some point is to</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.310" end="00:12:18.780" style="s2">is to look at like take one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.020" end="00:12:21.990" style="s2">dialogue wishes that we&#39;re doing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.780" end="00:12:24.150" style="s2">and watch it together I would like to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.990" end="00:12:26.910" style="s2">that yeah I think it&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.150" end="00:12:28.050" style="s2">idea I I want to do that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.910" end="00:12:30.030" style="s2">figure out how to do that with software</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.050" end="00:12:32.339" style="s2">I want to do that as part of the series</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.030" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">I want to take snippets of where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.339" end="00:12:36.600" style="s2">doing things so like pivotal moments and</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:39.300" style="s2">use that and say look what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.600" end="00:12:42.150" style="s2">here look what&#39;s happening here well I</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.300" end="00:12:45.870" style="s2">think I think having one of those a</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.150" end="00:12:49.320" style="s2">meadow one the problem with us is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.870" end="00:12:58.920" style="s2">we&#39;ll get into another I see that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.320" end="00:13:01.110" style="s2">just we&#39;ll just start another but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.920" end="00:13:04.200" style="s2">that&#39;ll be valuable too but trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.110" end="00:13:06.150" style="s2">yeah I would like I would that would be</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.200" end="00:13:09.060" style="s2">good but I&#39;d like a little bit and what</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.150" end="00:13:12.180" style="s2">I want to say a little bit cooler one</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.060" end="00:13:14.520" style="s2">where we&#39;re more analytic and you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.180" end="00:13:17.110" style="s2">more meta and we&#39;re looking back and</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.520" end="00:13:21.149" style="s2">trying to note this and note that and</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.110" end="00:13:23.860" style="s2">try to craft some vocabulary or and also</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.149" end="00:13:25.269" style="s2">try to apply some of the vocabulary that</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.860" end="00:13:28.000" style="s2">Chris and I have been working very hard</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.269" end="00:13:32.140" style="s2">to hammer out and say look this here</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.000" end="00:13:36.310" style="s2">this dimension here not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.140" end="00:13:37.089" style="s2">foreclose on anything but to again try</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.310" end="00:13:38.920" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.089" end="00:13:43.000" style="s2">well facilitate the project I said to</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.920" end="00:13:45.370" style="s2">you I want to try and help facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.000" end="00:13:46.570" style="s2">this shift and that a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.370" end="00:13:49.420" style="s2">putting their finger on about how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.570" end="00:13:51.399" style="s2">trying to shift out of just theory into</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.420" end="00:13:54.850" style="s2">some kind of trip you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.399" end="00:13:57.579" style="s2">transformative practice a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.850" end="00:13:59.829" style="s2">are talking about that right now yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.579" end="00:14:06.940" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what I would really like</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.829" end="00:14:08.860" style="s2">to address yeah so okay maybe we should</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.940" end="00:14:10.390" style="s2">we should do both we should have the we</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.860" end="00:14:12.730" style="s2">should have one of the ones where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.390" end="00:14:15.760" style="s2">just riffing like just all of us on it</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.730" end="00:14:20.320" style="s2">and maybe a one where we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.760" end="00:14:22.060" style="s2">something more analytic theoretic is</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.320" end="00:14:24.760" style="s2">that those would both be valuable</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.060" end="00:14:26.440" style="s2">uh-huh anyway so that that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.760" end="00:14:30.040" style="s2">I think that might be a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.440" end="00:14:33.130" style="s2">proceeding because one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.040" end="00:14:39.070" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it in I think it will take</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.130" end="00:14:43.390" style="s2">some restraint on our part but like you</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.070" end="00:14:44.920" style="s2">know cuz watching them and like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.390" end="00:14:46.930" style="s2">watched them and tried to look at some</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.920" end="00:14:48.550" style="s2">of the patterns and stuff and it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.930" end="00:14:51.310" style="s2">interesting because and this I think is</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.550" end="00:14:55.930" style="s2">telling of what it is right is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.310" end="00:14:57.640" style="s2">really difficult to not get pulled in to</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.930" end="00:14:58.480" style="s2">the conversation like like you are in</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.640" end="00:15:00.940" style="s2">the cinema</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.480" end="00:15:02.260" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s why it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.940" end="00:15:06.250" style="s2">that&#39;s why I was expressing that concern</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.260" end="00:15:07.959" style="s2">yeah to you and I know many people say</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.250" end="00:15:09.699" style="s2">that I was watching a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.959" end="00:15:13.199" style="s2">discussion between Andrew Sweeney and</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.699" end="00:15:17.800" style="s2">Christopher master Pietro and Andrew was</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.199" end="00:15:20.140" style="s2">pointing out how he gets a sense and</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.800" end="00:15:23.170" style="s2">that same thing he what he you drawn in</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.140" end="00:15:25.800" style="s2">he says that there&#39;s a lot of he said he</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.170" end="00:15:28.180" style="s2">could feel joy there&#39;s a lot of joy in</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.800" end="00:15:29.860" style="s2">in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.180" end="00:15:34.029" style="s2">as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.860" end="00:15:38.950" style="s2">you know at the serial processing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.029" end="00:15:44.290" style="s2">and yes and I think that&#39;s what many</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.950" end="00:15:45.850" style="s2">people are commenting on it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.290" end="00:15:47.470" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m hesitating because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.850" end="00:15:49.600" style="s2">such an insufficient thing to say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.470" end="00:15:51.310" style="s2">not I&#39;m not criticizing Android he was</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.600" end="00:15:52.779" style="s2">expressing something but just saying</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.310" end="00:15:54.310" style="s2">there&#39;s joy there isn&#39;t isn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.779" end="00:15:57.820" style="s2">right there&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.310" end="00:16:01.720" style="s2">something much more going on there and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.820" end="00:16:04.420" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to articulate what it is but</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.720" end="00:16:05.560" style="s2">it is it is very attractive to people</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.420" end="00:16:08.019" style="s2">yeah I know</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.560" end="00:16:09.970" style="s2">no that&#39;s getting a lot of feedback</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.019" end="00:16:13.690" style="s2">around on that idea that it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.970" end="00:16:15.339" style="s2">attractive right right if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.690" end="00:16:18.279" style="s2">the cut a lot of the comments a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.339" end="00:16:21.310" style="s2">the comments are just people like you</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.279" end="00:16:24.640" style="s2">can feel you can feel the spirit of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.310" end="00:16:26.890" style="s2">compass and they they they overflow with</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.640" end="00:16:29.230" style="s2">like impact personal impact but also</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.890" end="00:16:32.350" style="s2">their own own ideas like I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.230" end="00:16:35.230" style="s2">comments are just so a stitute and</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.350" end="00:16:39.040" style="s2">profound oh very much and and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.230" end="00:16:40.899" style="s2">often there&#39;s often that expression of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.040" end="00:16:43.680" style="s2">desire to enter into this or to figure</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.899" end="00:16:46.300" style="s2">out how to do this with other people and</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.680" end="00:16:48.339" style="s2">so that&#39;s part of gain about why I want</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.300" end="00:16:51.070" style="s2">to have the the one we were not catching</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.339" end="00:16:53.500" style="s2">fire because I want to know like I want</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.070" end="00:16:55.990" style="s2">to be able to say to people well this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.500" end="00:16:57.399" style="s2">I mean as much as we can and they have</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.990" end="00:16:59.260" style="s2">to be careful I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.399" end="00:17:01.180" style="s2">idolatrous or anything but as much as we</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.260" end="00:17:05.439" style="s2">can you know this is how you do it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.180" end="00:17:06.669" style="s2">this is what&#39;s going on right yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.439" end="00:17:09.490" style="s2">that&#39;s why I was expressing their</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.669" end="00:17:11.709" style="s2">concern about like trying to get I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.490" end="00:17:13.480" style="s2">riffing on it is great but I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.709" end="00:17:16.419" style="s2">that&#39;ll just be here I&#39;ll just be</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.480" end="00:17:19.270" style="s2">another level at which were unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.419" end="00:17:22.329" style="s2">things that&#39;s valuable but also one</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.270" end="00:17:26.199" style="s2">where we&#39;re like I said a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.329" end="00:17:28.179" style="s2">more no let&#39;s try and get out the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.199" end="00:17:29.500" style="s2">metaphor I use it some people don&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.179" end="00:17:30.429" style="s2">let&#39;s get at the machinery of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.500" end="00:17:33.669" style="s2">going on here</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.429" end="00:17:37.900" style="s2">let&#39;s try and explicate that as best as</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.669" end="00:17:41.260" style="s2">we can because I I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.900" end="00:17:43.049" style="s2">part of what is going to be needed so</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.260" end="00:17:45.629" style="s2">that other people can enter in</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.049" end="00:17:48.389" style="s2">yeah well they know that that you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.629" end="00:17:50.659" style="s2">I&#39;m as we&#39;re talking I&#39;m I&#39;m referencing</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.389" end="00:17:54.299" style="s2">a lot in my mind and having memories of</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.659" end="00:17:55.769" style="s2">when that&#39;s the seven stages circling</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.299" end="00:18:01.019" style="s2">which is what we teach in our course</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.769" end="00:18:03.269" style="s2">they&#39;re part of do articulate and it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.019" end="00:18:04.409" style="s2">vet it was very much the process of like</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.269" end="00:18:07.440" style="s2">God there&#39;s something really amazing</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.409" end="00:18:10.429" style="s2">happening here but what is it like and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.440" end="00:18:15.059" style="s2">remember we had our first two training</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.429" end="00:18:17.009" style="s2">courses Jerry and I did and the moment</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.059" end="00:18:18.600" style="s2">we had our first one when we got our</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.009" end="00:18:22.559" style="s2">students in front of us was the moment I</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.600" end="00:18:28.080" style="s2">realized I had no idea what I was like</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.559" end="00:18:30.269" style="s2">right yeah that that that process of and</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.080" end="00:18:32.429" style="s2">it&#39;s a very difficult thing to do in my</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.269" end="00:18:36.690" style="s2">experience it&#39;s like because so much of</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.429" end="00:18:39.830" style="s2">it is about a reflective attuned</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.690" end="00:18:46.109" style="s2">response yes right like this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.830" end="00:18:48.210" style="s2">this you go into a into flow States</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.109" end="00:18:51.119" style="s2">right very much very much but at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.210" end="00:18:52.859" style="s2">same time there is there is as quality</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.119" end="00:18:55.470" style="s2">where you start to be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.859" end="00:18:57.629" style="s2">distinctions and notice more right yes</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.470" end="00:18:59.509" style="s2">and and because you can notice the more</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.629" end="00:19:02.970" style="s2">you can respond to them more precisely</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.509" end="00:19:05.039" style="s2">and more elegantly right that brings</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.970" end="00:19:08.730" style="s2">more on and it had this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.039" end="00:19:13.019" style="s2">autopoietic process I think that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.730" end="00:19:14.190" style="s2">think that&#39;s very helpful on so I maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.019" end="00:19:16.950" style="s2">this will be helpful to you I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.190" end="00:19:20.700" style="s2">about this in terms of two languages I</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.950" end="00:19:22.470" style="s2">talked about this one in the stuff work</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.700" end="00:19:24.960" style="s2">on mindfulness I tell you that chapter</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.470" end="00:19:26.609" style="s2">that Leo and I wrote on that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.960" end="00:19:30.389" style="s2">language of training in the language of</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.609" end="00:19:34.139" style="s2">explaining and I think we need both and</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.389" end="00:19:36.480" style="s2">I&#39;d and so that trying to articulate a</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.139" end="00:19:38.460" style="s2">training language for people but also</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.480" end="00:19:41.039" style="s2">trying to get a language of explaining</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.460" end="00:19:43.249" style="s2">that connects that training language to</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.039" end="00:19:47.850" style="s2">the cognitive science because ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.249" end="00:19:49.649" style="s2">for me I want to situate this like it</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.850" end="00:19:51.029" style="s2">back into the project you know that</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.649" end="00:19:53.129" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about which is responding</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.029" end="00:19:57.299" style="s2">to the meeting crisis so being able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.129" end="00:19:58.980" style="s2">resituated deeply into</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.299" end="00:20:01.739" style="s2">you know a cognitive scientific</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.980" end="00:20:03.570" style="s2">worldview yeah it is part of project for</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.739" end="00:20:06.539" style="s2">me it&#39;s part of project for me oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.570" end="00:20:09.289" style="s2">we cracked all this language and then it</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.539" end="00:20:11.700" style="s2">sits over here as the language that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.289" end="00:20:13.679" style="s2">disconnected from the scientific Olivia</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.700" end="00:20:17.100" style="s2">then we haven&#39;t really done what we need</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.679" end="00:20:19.249" style="s2">to do ultimately totally yeah that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.100" end="00:20:22.350" style="s2">burden that&#39;s the burden you&#39;re bearing</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.249" end="00:20:26.820" style="s2">yeah well I&#39;m not broke I&#39;m not being</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.350" end="00:20:27.080" style="s2">totally alone you know yeah I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.820" end="00:20:29.639" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.080" end="00:20:31.649" style="s2">Christopher&#39;s helping me a lot and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.639" end="00:20:33.629" style="s2">yeah and Jordan has you know he&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.649" end="00:20:37.889" style="s2">science background to that he&#39;s bringing</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.629" end="00:20:40.440" style="s2">into the discussion yeah so that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.889" end="00:20:44.639" style="s2">helpful as well yeah but yeah but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.440" end="00:20:47.249" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of what I&#39;d like I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.639" end="00:20:49.739" style="s2">try that&#39;s why doing the two riffs might</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.249" end="00:20:53.129" style="s2">be good yeah the first riffing you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.739" end="00:20:55.769" style="s2">the the the right that might be help us</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.129" end="00:20:57.179" style="s2">sort of start drawing out a language of</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.769" end="00:20:59.249" style="s2">training maybe we could even frame it</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.179" end="00:21:03.029" style="s2">this way we could frame we do an</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.249" end="00:21:05.159" style="s2">overview of one of our via logos and we</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.029" end="00:21:06.989" style="s2">we do it and what we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.159" end="00:21:09.059" style="s2">there is the language of training right</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.989" end="00:21:11.519" style="s2">yeah and then we do an overview and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.059" end="00:21:13.320" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get more language of</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.519" end="00:21:14.669" style="s2">explaining and I understand because of</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.320" end="00:21:17.340" style="s2">my training I would have to take you</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.669" end="00:21:19.409" style="s2">know a more heavier burden there I get</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.340" end="00:21:21.840" style="s2">that but nevertheless having everybody</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.409" end="00:21:24.409" style="s2">involved in that might be yeah like we</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.840" end="00:21:27.029" style="s2">could frame it that way so like you one</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.409" end="00:21:28.859" style="s2">around a language of training and one</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.029" end="00:21:31.320" style="s2">around a language of explaining right</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.859" end="00:21:33.600" style="s2">right like like for example I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.320" end="00:21:35.179" style="s2">imagining like for example like the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:40.409" style="s2">different the different kinds of love</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.179" end="00:21:42.809" style="s2">right yeah you know when when you when</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.409" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">you shift to one or the other and being</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.809" end="00:21:47.909" style="s2">able to spot that right yes yes that</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.840" end="00:21:50.100" style="s2">would be good mode of like oh we just</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.909" end="00:21:53.909" style="s2">went up a level or we went just we went</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.100" end="00:21:57.659" style="s2">more right lateral oh we just went</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.909" end="00:21:59.879" style="s2">horizontal like yeah that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.659" end="00:22:02.309" style="s2">language of training that&#39;s excellent</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.879" end="00:22:04.350" style="s2">well then I would try to say okay what</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.309" end="00:22:05.460" style="s2">is that in language of explaining I</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.350" end="00:22:07.740" style="s2">might try and begin and say well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.460" end="00:22:09.420" style="s2">going on in terms of like attachment</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.740" end="00:22:11.250" style="s2">theory or development or</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.420" end="00:22:13.350" style="s2">wake up &#39;native exaptation is working</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.250" end="00:22:15.840" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here it&#39;s similar to</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.350" end="00:22:18.120" style="s2">like like flow I mean so you have you</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.840" end="00:22:20.190" style="s2">have all this training language but you</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.120" end="00:22:22.020" style="s2">know the work I did with Aaron and Leo</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.190" end="00:22:23.010" style="s2">right we also try to okay but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.020" end="00:22:25.710" style="s2">going on what&#39;s what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.010" end="00:22:26.820" style="s2">happening cognitively you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.710" end="00:22:28.680" style="s2">because if you understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.820" end="00:22:30.720" style="s2">happening cognitively you can understand</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.680" end="00:22:34.760" style="s2">why these trading practices are working</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.720" end="00:22:36.840" style="s2">right and and you can improve them</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.760" end="00:22:42.450" style="s2">because that&#39;s ultimately what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.840" end="00:22:47.310" style="s2">do right because I want to try and make</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.450" end="00:22:50.240" style="s2">this a practice of with many other</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.310" end="00:22:53.310" style="s2">people&#39;s help yours you know especially</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.240" end="00:22:57.330" style="s2">but I want to try and make this practice</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.310" end="00:22:59.640" style="s2">off idea Sophia yes right and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.330" end="00:23:02.910" style="s2">going to be funnier Sophia you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.640" end="00:23:05.220" style="s2">can&#39;t cultivate wisdom independent from</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.910" end="00:23:07.530" style="s2">your best knowledge system you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.220" end="00:23:09.660" style="s2">that&#39;s just that just not gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.530" end="00:23:11.130" style="s2">right wisdom it can&#39;t be reduced to</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.660" end="00:23:13.740" style="s2">knowledge I mean I&#39;ve argued that in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.130" end="00:23:16.320" style="s2">series but neither can it be you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.740" end="00:23:18.870" style="s2">prep it can&#39;t be ghettoized from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.320" end="00:23:20.550" style="s2">best knowledge we have the wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.870" end="00:23:23.580" style="s2">knowledge have to inseminate each other</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.550" end="00:23:25.920" style="s2">is very powerful way and and I would</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.580" end="00:23:29.430" style="s2">imagine the best like the best that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.920" end="00:23:33.150" style="s2">can do is is have the experience of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.430" end="00:23:35.430" style="s2">and then work out the constraints that</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.150" end="00:23:37.590" style="s2">give it well that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.430" end="00:23:41.280" style="s2">think I&#39;m trying to think which is what</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.590" end="00:23:47.240" style="s2">you sort of do it flow so you you want</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.280" end="00:23:49.740" style="s2">to try and you want to try and get nice</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.240" end="00:23:51.120" style="s2">you want to get nice integration between</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.740" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">the phenomenology and the functionality</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.120" end="00:23:55.560" style="s2">yeah right so what the what the</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.760" end="00:23:57.420" style="s2">explaining should do is to ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.560" end="00:23:59.370" style="s2">tell you what&#39;s what are the what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.420" end="00:24:01.110" style="s2">function here what&#39;s it doing right and</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.370" end="00:24:02.370" style="s2">then you want to see if you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.110" end="00:24:06.000" style="s2">something that bridges between the</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.370" end="00:24:06.750" style="s2">phenomenology and the functionality in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.000" end="00:24:08.670" style="s2">powerful way</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.750" end="00:24:11.310" style="s2">like why does shifting perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.670" end="00:24:13.470" style="s2">which is a phenomenological thing why</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.310" end="00:24:16.610" style="s2">does that have this functional impact of</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.470" end="00:24:19.590" style="s2">getting people to have an insight into</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.610" end="00:24:20.550" style="s2">their the problems that they can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.590" end="00:24:22.410" style="s2">while they stay in the first-person</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.550" end="00:24:23.310" style="s2">perspective we have sort of an intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.410" end="00:24:24.960" style="s2">sense of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.310" end="00:24:26.490" style="s2">but what&#39;s actually going on right</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.960" end="00:24:28.350" style="s2">what&#39;s actually going on in the ship I</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.490" end="00:24:30.540" style="s2">tried to do that I tried to bridge</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.350" end="00:24:31.950" style="s2">between phenomenology and functionality</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.540" end="00:24:36.180" style="s2">when I gave the talk on the view from</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.950" end="00:24:38.790" style="s2">above because then and me I&#39;m using that</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.180" end="00:24:40.140" style="s2">as sort of a template of yeah so what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.790" end="00:24:43.380" style="s2">was trying to do there as I was trying</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.140" end="00:24:44.190" style="s2">to write zero in on a specific practice</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.380" end="00:24:46.670" style="s2">huh</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.190" end="00:24:48.510" style="s2">and what Hitler and Donald Robinson</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.670" end="00:24:50.310" style="s2">actually took us through the view from</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.510" end="00:24:52.230" style="s2">above as a practice and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.310" end="00:24:54.480" style="s2">say okay here&#39;s the phenomenology and</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.230" end="00:24:58.170" style="s2">then here&#39;s the functionality and try to</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.480" end="00:25:00.140" style="s2">keep those yapping together that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.170" end="00:25:03.300" style="s2">what I would like to do for for</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.140" end="00:25:05.640" style="s2">dialectic and deilogos the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.300" end="00:25:08.850" style="s2">thing so when people are doing this when</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.640" end="00:25:11.820" style="s2">this shift is occurring what like what</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.850" end="00:25:13.800" style="s2">cut what cognitive functionality is it</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.820" end="00:25:16.740" style="s2">you know activating and then why does</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.800" end="00:25:17.220" style="s2">that make sense and and so on and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.740" end="00:25:20.370" style="s2">forth</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.220" end="00:25:22.620" style="s2">totally so I mean that&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.370" end="00:25:24.510" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna happen right away and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.620" end="00:25:26.820" style="s2">even expect to have that that answered</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.510" end="00:25:29.040" style="s2">by the end of after Socrates but I want</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.820" end="00:25:31.320" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing I want to start</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.040" end="00:25:33.060" style="s2">moving towards and get a rhythm I wanna</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.320" end="00:25:35.160" style="s2">move towards that and with you on that</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.060" end="00:25:37.860" style="s2">I&#39;m with like yeah I know you are I know</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.160" end="00:25:39.960" style="s2">your dad and your your accompaniment is</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.860" end="00:25:42.870" style="s2">deeply deeply appreciated like I said</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.960" end="00:25:45.690" style="s2">when Chris and I were working today or</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.870" end="00:25:49.470" style="s2">on the chapter on the four kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.690" end="00:25:50.850" style="s2">knowing and dialectic I will here let me</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.470" end="00:25:52.890" style="s2">give me an example let me have an</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.850" end="00:25:54.750" style="s2">example of what I mean so we were</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.890" end="00:25:55.790" style="s2">talking about this and I said and I said</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.750" end="00:25:58.830" style="s2">oh there&#39;s a connection between</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.790" end="00:26:00.630" style="s2">dialectic and prospect refuge theory and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.830" end="00:26:03.390" style="s2">you said well what&#39;s that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.630" end="00:26:05.850" style="s2">theory right that there that we like</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.390" end="00:26:08.550" style="s2">situations in which we have a vista</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.850" end="00:26:10.710" style="s2">before us yeah but we also feel safe</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.550" end="00:26:17.610" style="s2">prospect and refuge it&#39;s also known as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.710" end="00:26:19.710" style="s2">womb with a view you can see why that</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.610" end="00:26:21.990" style="s2">would be something that would really</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.710" end="00:26:25.290" style="s2">enhance our optimal grip because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.990" end="00:26:27.570" style="s2">we&#39;re relatively safe from predation you</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.290" end="00:26:30.090" style="s2">can see and we can see opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.570" end="00:26:32.070" style="s2">right and then I said notice and then I</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.090" end="00:26:34.620" style="s2">was saying to Christmas notice of guy</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.070" end="00:26:36.909" style="s2">constantly will bring us back to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.620" end="00:26:39.309" style="s2">relationship between the horizon and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.909" end="00:26:42.309" style="s2">out round as we&#39;re get we&#39;re getting a</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.309" end="00:26:44.830" style="s2">secure footing yeah but right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.309" end="00:26:46.989" style="s2">refuge and yet we&#39;re burying put into</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.830" end="00:26:48.580" style="s2">the prospect of the horizon continually</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.989" end="00:26:50.979" style="s2">and then when we talked about how that</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.580" end="00:26:53.349" style="s2">maps onto these different aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.979" end="00:26:54.669" style="s2">sacred like the homing and the numinous</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.349" end="00:26:57.609" style="s2">see that&#39;s the kind of thing I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.669" end="00:27:00.190" style="s2">about we&#39;re trying to get between like</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.609" end="00:27:01.960" style="s2">the language do you bring out right you</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.190" end="00:27:05.349" style="s2">bring out that language of the horizon</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.960" end="00:27:07.539" style="s2">and the ground right but then you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.349" end="00:27:10.239" style="s2">link that to my prospect and refuge</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.539" end="00:27:12.700" style="s2">theory and an evolutionary functionality</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.239" end="00:27:14.889" style="s2">and but oh right and oh and if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.700" end="00:27:17.950" style="s2">what people are looking for then how can</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.889" end="00:27:20.080" style="s2">we better tailor the practice to afford</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.950" end="00:27:22.779" style="s2">that that&#39;s an example that&#39;s a concrete</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.080" end="00:27:24.759" style="s2">example of our talking totally totally</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.779" end="00:27:25.239" style="s2">that&#39;s really cool that&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.759" end="00:27:28.720" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.239" end="00:27:30.220" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s this it&#39;s yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.720" end="00:27:37.450" style="s2">something about this back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.220" end="00:27:39.489" style="s2">thing that like there&#39;s some there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.450" end="00:27:41.739" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like I guess it and very</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.489" end="00:27:44.080" style="s2">much in many ways I think about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.739" end="00:27:46.090" style="s2">thing that you guys talk about and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.080" end="00:27:48.369" style="s2">heard you talk about addiction right</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.090" end="00:27:50.769" style="s2">it&#39;s reversed of that back and forth or</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.369" end="00:27:52.299" style="s2">the reverse yeah I call it reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.769" end="00:27:54.369" style="s2">narrowing as opposed to reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.299" end="00:27:56.979" style="s2">opening we&#39;re bringing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.369" end="00:27:58.779" style="s2">bringing that into into the chapter</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.979" end="00:28:01.049" style="s2">right it&#39;s because we&#39;re talking we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.779" end="00:28:03.279" style="s2">trying to get right the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.049" end="00:28:06.639" style="s2">horizontal sensibility transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.279" end="00:28:08.019" style="s2">unpacked in terms of you know an acog a</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.639" end="00:28:09.580" style="s2">which can be unpacked in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.019" end="00:28:11.710" style="s2">reciprocal opening as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.580" end="00:28:13.389" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing and then right and</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.710" end="00:28:14.889" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got all the machinery all</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.389" end="00:28:16.779" style="s2">the excellent work that mark Lewis has</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.889" end="00:28:18.249" style="s2">done telling you how reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.779" end="00:28:20.440" style="s2">narrowing works and then that gives you</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.249" end="00:28:21.849" style="s2">just okay that gives you some</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.440" end="00:28:24.519" style="s2">understanding of how the reciprocal oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.849" end="00:28:26.289" style="s2">but that&#39;s another example of how you</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.519" end="00:28:29.289" style="s2">could do all this bridging and see</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.289" end="00:28:30.940" style="s2">addiction is great because sorry the top</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.289" end="00:28:32.950" style="s2">the fiction is great addiction is were</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.940" end="00:28:35.080" style="s2">look for people didn&#39;t I shouldn&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.950" end="00:28:37.929" style="s2">so cavalier about such a devastating</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.080" end="00:28:42.270" style="s2">topic I apologize to anybody that to</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.929" end="00:28:44.670" style="s2">whom an apology is old but</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.270" end="00:28:46.559" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s an it&#39;s it&#39;s a see see</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.670" end="00:28:47.910" style="s2">how if you really want to understand</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.559" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">addiction you can&#39;t just stay in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.910" end="00:28:52.830" style="s2">phenomenology yeah I have right you</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:54.840" style="s2">can&#39;t ignore the phenomenology because</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.830" end="00:28:55.920" style="s2">then you&#39;ll just be prescribing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.840" end="00:28:58.679" style="s2">other drugs</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.920" end="00:29:00.510" style="s2">yeah so Marx twerk is brilliant because</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.679" end="00:29:02.790" style="s2">it bridges between the phenomenology and</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.510" end="00:29:06.450" style="s2">the functionality ah okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.790" end="00:29:09.210" style="s2">totally got it right because if you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.450" end="00:29:10.770" style="s2">take the phenomenology and and then do</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.210" end="00:29:12.780" style="s2">you what he does he says no no no the</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.770" end="00:29:15.510" style="s2">phenomenology is not well described by</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.780" end="00:29:17.760" style="s2">the disease metaphor let&#39;s describe it</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.510" end="00:29:19.260" style="s2">with this reciprocal narrowing and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.760" end="00:29:20.910" style="s2">once you do that you could connect it up</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.260" end="00:29:22.770" style="s2">to all of these self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.910" end="00:29:25.080" style="s2">developmental aspects of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.770" end="00:29:26.610" style="s2">processing which is what he does yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.080" end="00:29:31.320" style="s2">so the addictions almost like kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.610" end="00:29:33.900" style="s2">dyslexic form of enlightening kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.320" end="00:29:35.850" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of it for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.900" end="00:29:38.580" style="s2">it&#39;s an instance of the very machinery</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.850" end="00:29:40.320" style="s2">that and lead to self transcendence is</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.580" end="00:29:45.510" style="s2">the machinery that could afford deep</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.320" end="00:29:47.130" style="s2">self-deception right right yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.510" end="00:29:51.210" style="s2">thing I&#39;ve been paying attention to a</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.130" end="00:29:53.040" style="s2">lot lately is so what one of the like</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.210" end="00:29:55.860" style="s2">what actually I think one of the cool</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.040" end="00:29:58.020" style="s2">things about what this also affords</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.860" end="00:29:59.970" style="s2">right breaking everything down like this</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.020" end="00:30:02.880" style="s2">and looking at and looking at all the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.970" end="00:30:07.260" style="s2">ways that we&#39;re describing is it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.880" end="00:30:09.420" style="s2">once once we get um a description of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.260" end="00:30:12.600" style="s2">Phenom like some aspect of it say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.420" end="00:30:15.000" style="s2">like oh the transition from like a gap a</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.600" end="00:30:17.850" style="s2">defy Leah and back again well let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.000" end="00:30:19.910" style="s2">say we can put it up and start to we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.850" end="00:30:23.220" style="s2">start to tell the difference and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.910" end="00:30:25.710" style="s2">describe what happens and then what</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.220" end="00:30:27.809" style="s2">you&#39;re yes Kristen I were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.710" end="00:30:29.520" style="s2">just that because we were talking we</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.809" end="00:30:33.120" style="s2">were talking about I was I was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.520" end="00:30:35.910" style="s2">if right if one of the things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.120" end="00:30:38.700" style="s2">doing see so we&#39;re talking a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.910" end="00:30:41.490" style="s2">arrows this attractive element in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.700" end="00:30:43.440" style="s2">Ilocos right the that Socrates talks</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.490" end="00:30:45.750" style="s2">about but but it&#39;s also bound up with</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.440" end="00:30:48.480" style="s2">midwifery which and that this is like</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.750" end="00:30:50.220" style="s2">very close to like to getting to a goth</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.480" end="00:30:52.890" style="s2">because you&#39;re trying to help people to</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.220" end="00:30:54.990" style="s2">give birth to their aspirational selves</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.890" end="00:30:55.770" style="s2">right but I was saying I said you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.990" end="00:30:58.110" style="s2">there&#39;s a there</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.770" end="00:30:59.730" style="s2">there&#39;s a potential I&#39;m not making an</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.110" end="00:31:01.410" style="s2">identity claim here I&#39;m on a potential</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.730" end="00:31:04.050" style="s2">there&#39;s a potential for eros to</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.410" end="00:31:06.150" style="s2">degenerate with the need for a</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.050" end="00:31:08.910" style="s2">consummation can degenerate into</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.150" end="00:31:10.890" style="s2">consumption yeah right and eros can</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.910" end="00:31:13.590" style="s2">generate into lust and you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.890" end="00:31:16.770" style="s2">an ancient worry and I said I wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.590" end="00:31:19.020" style="s2">the attempt to move to agape right is an</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.770" end="00:31:22.020" style="s2">attempt to always forestall eros</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.020" end="00:31:24.720" style="s2">degenerating into last because you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.020" end="00:31:27.540" style="s2">see file at Philae an Ikea as the lust</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:30.300" style="s2">for victory in conversation as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.540" end="00:31:32.970" style="s2">to the you know the Philae pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.300" end="00:31:35.190" style="s2">wisdom or the agape midwifery of</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.970" end="00:31:38.190" style="s2">people&#39;s aspirational selves yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.190" end="00:31:41.010" style="s2">that language of the loves and way might</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.190" end="00:31:44.040" style="s2">feet they might feature in as you said</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.010" end="00:31:45.929" style="s2">the constraints run dialectical practice</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.040" end="00:31:48.330" style="s2">I think that&#39;s germane I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.929" end="00:31:50.970" style="s2">very germane and it&#39;s like in it and</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.330" end="00:31:52.559" style="s2">then if we if we get those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.970" end="00:31:55.290" style="s2">phenomena logically distinct and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.559" end="00:31:57.090" style="s2">able to see them you know then we go</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.290" end="00:31:58.740" style="s2">over to this side and we start to look</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.090" end="00:32:01.559" style="s2">at the Cox side and we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.740" end="00:32:03.600" style="s2">machinery yes right and start linking</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.559" end="00:32:05.429" style="s2">that up what&#39;s cool about that is then</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.600" end="00:32:07.290" style="s2">you then we have something that where</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.429" end="00:32:10.230" style="s2">you can actually take an aspect of it</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.290" end="00:32:13.380" style="s2">and then make it its own practice yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.230" end="00:32:18.350" style="s2">very much lies that particular muscle</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.380" end="00:32:20.220" style="s2">right ill info it&#39;s very much like like</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.350" end="00:32:21.720" style="s2">some of the work I&#39;m doing with Jensen</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.220" end="00:32:24.540" style="s2">came on that we&#39;re working on a paper a</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.720" end="00:32:27.030" style="s2">naturalistic explanation of of Chi yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.540" end="00:32:28.830" style="s2">and so and and we&#39;re doing exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.030" end="00:32:30.120" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to care very carefully move</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.830" end="00:32:33.300" style="s2">between the phenomenology and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.120" end="00:32:34.679" style="s2">functionality and exactly that as you</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.300" end="00:32:37.470" style="s2">get a better understanding of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.679" end="00:32:39.300" style="s2">bridge that enhanced language of</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.470" end="00:32:41.190" style="s2">explaining and the way of bridges to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.300" end="00:32:43.770" style="s2">phenomenology then enhances your</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.190" end="00:32:45.420" style="s2">capacity as a train it just enhances the</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.770" end="00:32:48.210" style="s2">capacity to Train because like you said</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.420" end="00:32:50.420" style="s2">the problem with the phenomenology is it</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.210" end="00:32:53.700" style="s2">often hits you as a gestalt right a</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.420" end="00:32:55.320" style="s2">dialectical self a dialectic no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.700" end="00:32:57.690" style="s2">want to say that I want to say a</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.320" end="00:33:00.210" style="s2">dynamical we&#39;re talking about dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.690" end="00:33:03.270" style="s2">that&#39;s why God it strikes you as a as</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.210" end="00:33:05.460" style="s2">you know I namaka Gestalt hey you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.270" end="00:33:07.730" style="s2">it&#39;s all at once and it&#39;s moving yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.460" end="00:33:09.950" style="s2">right and it&#39;s very very hard</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.730" end="00:33:12.230" style="s2">like you know when I teach Tai Chi to</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.950" end="00:33:15.320" style="s2">people it&#39;s very hard to intervene in</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.230" end="00:33:17.510" style="s2">that that&#39;s why there was there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.320" end="00:33:20.799" style="s2">there&#39;s like two levels of learning like</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.510" end="00:33:26.149" style="s2">yeah really knowing the form well</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.799" end="00:33:29.090" style="s2">insofar as I know it it is I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.149" end="00:33:31.100" style="s2">doing it 28 years so but but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.090" end="00:33:34.330" style="s2">radically radically insufficient for</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.100" end="00:33:37.340" style="s2">teaching it yeah cuz right because</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.330" end="00:33:40.630" style="s2">because because typically what happens</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.340" end="00:33:43.940" style="s2">is if you know if you can&#39;t step back</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.630" end="00:33:46.070" style="s2">and do this kind of translation and</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.940" end="00:33:48.110" style="s2">analysis what you&#39;re just doing is</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.070" end="00:33:52.639" style="s2">demonstrating the gestalt to the people</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.110" end="00:33:55.669" style="s2">right around you and that&#39;s I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.639" end="00:33:58.820" style="s2">that&#39;s not useless yeah but that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.669" end="00:34:01.970" style="s2">very very hard for them to get to self</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.820" end="00:34:04.940" style="s2">correct that&#39;s yeah yeah to get an</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.970" end="00:34:07.100" style="s2">access to know how to correct themselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.940" end="00:34:09.260" style="s2">right it&#39;s very hard because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.100" end="00:34:11.960" style="s2">well no that&#39;s not right and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.260" end="00:34:14.119" style="s2">they&#39;re like yeah well why what should i</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.960" end="00:34:16.040" style="s2">do well do this well I tried to do that</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.119" end="00:34:19.970" style="s2">like you get you get those that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.040" end="00:34:22.250" style="s2">write if you better try and like get</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.970" end="00:34:25.790" style="s2">something like you said that can take a</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.250" end="00:34:27.800" style="s2">piece out and make it independently</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.790" end="00:34:30.169" style="s2">intelligible and accessible to people I</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.800" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">agree with that I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.169" end="00:34:35.450" style="s2">very pertinent that&#39;s a kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:37.579" style="s2">though like when you go and do circling</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.450" end="00:34:39.589" style="s2">um do you ever got you guys ever like</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.579" end="00:34:41.780" style="s2">start off by doing those like line</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.589" end="00:34:45.200" style="s2">exercises where you face somebody yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.780" end="00:34:49.339" style="s2">yeah but yeah we did we do we do we for</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.200" end="00:34:50.869" style="s2">the first four questions can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.339" end="00:34:54.740" style="s2">how many we&#39;ve done though it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.869" end="00:34:57.079" style="s2">wonderful thank you so much just amazing</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.740" end="00:35:00.400" style="s2">mmm really transformative that&#39;s all so</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.079" end="00:35:03.349" style="s2">now I consider part of my practice yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.400" end="00:35:05.690" style="s2">we did some of those initially I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.349" end="00:35:08.720" style="s2">for two or three sessions I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.690" end="00:35:10.430" style="s2">yeah and then but what happened is</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.720" end="00:35:13.130" style="s2">because there&#39;s only what seven of us</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.430" end="00:35:15.319" style="s2">what and we started meeting regularly we</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.130" end="00:35:16.700" style="s2">can no just it&#39;s like when you meet your</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.319" end="00:35:20.820" style="s2">cousin that you haven&#39;t seen for 10</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.700" end="00:35:27.420" style="s2">years and you just yeah yep</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.820" end="00:35:29.610" style="s2">so um now the other other day when one</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.420" end="00:35:31.260" style="s2">of the people Taylor he brought in an</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.610" end="00:35:33.090" style="s2">issue that we were not taking into the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.260" end="00:35:34.920" style="s2">circling we were discussing it was was a</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.090" end="00:35:37.110" style="s2">bit it was fraught with a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.920" end="00:35:39.090" style="s2">not tension around the group attention</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.110" end="00:35:41.070" style="s2">around the ideas never been discussed</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.090" end="00:35:43.950" style="s2">and so we didn&#39;t immediately just start</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.070" end="00:35:47.520" style="s2">circling we went in to the the mutual</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.950" end="00:35:51.300" style="s2">noticing kind of practices in order to</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.520" end="00:35:53.720" style="s2">warm up again to get back into it very</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.300" end="00:35:57.870" style="s2">much because those those were actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.720" end="00:36:01.140" style="s2">we extracted those out as a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.870" end="00:36:03.000" style="s2">what basically taking particular muscles</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.140" end="00:36:05.010" style="s2">like where you just where there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.000" end="00:36:08.430" style="s2">where all you can do is just paraphrase</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.010" end="00:36:09.690" style="s2">what the person says yeah yeah thick</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.430" end="00:36:13.470" style="s2">through it you stick through you stick</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.690" end="00:36:16.490" style="s2">through it right um and then that this</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.470" end="00:36:20.310" style="s2">is the one that I find just fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.490" end="00:36:21.600" style="s2">is the one where you basically you stood</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.310" end="00:36:23.430" style="s2">across for somebody it&#39;s really simple</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.600" end="00:36:27.240" style="s2">you just say like being with you right</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.430" end="00:36:30.290" style="s2">now I&#39;m noticing and the practices to</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.240" end="00:36:33.000" style="s2">really just speak slow enough such that</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.290" end="00:36:34.800" style="s2">like you&#39;re actually describing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.000" end="00:36:35.280" style="s2">happening such that if if what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.800" end="00:36:37.260" style="s2">describing</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.280" end="00:36:39.900" style="s2">you can adjust right and then the other</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.260" end="00:36:42.720" style="s2">person says hearing that being with</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.900" end="00:36:44.850" style="s2">don&#39;t know I&#39;m noticing and and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.720" end="00:36:46.590" style="s2">practice a few times too and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.850" end="00:36:50.940" style="s2">understand what you&#39;re saying there and</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.590" end="00:36:52.680" style="s2">I had a suspicion that they have they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.940" end="00:36:55.950" style="s2">not just warm-ups that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.680" end="00:37:00.360" style="s2">confidential their components yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.950" end="00:37:03.990" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about now yeah so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.360" end="00:37:04.980" style="s2">also interested in like I said Peter and</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.990" end="00:37:07.830" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking about this peter</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.980" end="00:37:10.290" style="s2">lindbergh about sort of ordering a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.830" end="00:37:13.500" style="s2">of these practices in sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.290" end="00:37:16.380" style="s2">pedagogical program yeah because they do</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.500" end="00:37:17.670" style="s2">they do they do but once we get it clear</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.380" end="00:37:19.170" style="s2">understood this is another thing the</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.670" end="00:37:22.170" style="s2">analysis will help and I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.170" end="00:37:24.450" style="s2">what your point is well we if we get a</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.170" end="00:37:28.230" style="s2">better understanding of a confidential</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.450" end="00:37:29.940" style="s2">analysis of the whole thing like we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.230" end="00:37:32.220" style="s2">get a better understanding of a program</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.940" end="00:37:34.090" style="s2">of how to set these practices in a set</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.220" end="00:37:36.190" style="s2">in an order yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.090" end="00:37:39.490" style="s2">will sort of give us the best momentum</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.190" end="00:37:42.010" style="s2">into the overall thing yeah kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.490" end="00:37:45.010" style="s2">the dialogues right yes exactly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.010" end="00:37:47.200" style="s2">exactly no it&#39;s exactly analogous that</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.010" end="00:37:48.520" style="s2">was in my mind as a and so that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.200" end="00:37:50.830" style="s2">something that Peter and I have been</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.520" end="00:37:53.110" style="s2">sort of thinking about like where would</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.830" end="00:37:56.050" style="s2">you put you know oh you know something</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.110" end="00:37:59.710" style="s2">like the the anti debate or insight</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.050" end="00:38:02.350" style="s2">dialogue or right the empathy circling</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.710" end="00:38:03.760" style="s2">like they seem to be putting different</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.350" end="00:38:05.500" style="s2">emphasis I&#39;ll use your metaphor on</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.760" end="00:38:07.930" style="s2">different muscles and how could we put</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.500" end="00:38:10.840" style="s2">them together and then meet into what</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.930" end="00:38:13.030" style="s2">you call circling 1.0 perhaps and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.840" end="00:38:16.150" style="s2">can we then and then what could we do to</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.030" end="00:38:18.250" style="s2">you know bootstrap that into right no no</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.150" end="00:38:20.710" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a dialectic that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.250" end="00:38:22.890" style="s2">really interested in so there&#39;s a I</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.710" end="00:38:26.740" style="s2">talked with Porcelli</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.890" end="00:38:28.720" style="s2">who is who helped run the the integral</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.740" end="00:38:31.930" style="s2">Institute in Colorado when it when it</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.720" end="00:38:33.490" style="s2">was existing and he&#39;s been talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.930" end="00:38:35.740" style="s2">actually I didn&#39;t know this but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.490" end="00:38:37.300" style="s2">been talking with Jordan you know every</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.740" end="00:38:37.780" style="s2">other month or so he lives down in San</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.300" end="00:38:41.890" style="s2">Diego</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.780" end="00:38:44.980" style="s2">and with the other guy&#39;s name who does</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.890" end="00:38:48.670" style="s2">the war on sense-making Oh Daniels</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.980" end="00:38:50.500" style="s2"> Alberto yeah and there he just</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.670" end="00:38:52.330" style="s2">had mentioned that they&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.500" end="00:38:55.120" style="s2">about their kind of a vision of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.330" end="00:38:56.710" style="s2">some kind of thing where it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.120" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">three-tiered they made these</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.710" end="00:39:02.230" style="s2">distinctions where it&#39;s like there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.520" end="00:39:06.220" style="s2">practice where it&#39;s just purely like</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.230" end="00:39:10.240" style="s2">that in the moment like personal right</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.220" end="00:39:12.310" style="s2">circling stuff and then and then but how</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.240" end="00:39:14.890" style="s2">do you transition from that into like</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.310" end="00:39:17.410" style="s2">doing stuff right you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.890" end="00:39:19.990" style="s2">implementing stuff right and he said he</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.410" end="00:39:23.260" style="s2">said that the stuff that we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.990" end="00:39:25.060" style="s2">like the is like the center right of</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.260" end="00:39:27.250" style="s2">where you start to generate the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.060" end="00:39:28.390" style="s2">and work them out and then there&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.250" end="00:39:31.150" style="s2">how do you go from that with a</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.390" end="00:39:34.030" style="s2">cohesiveness all the way through the</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.150" end="00:39:37.120" style="s2">space of where you go and kick ass right</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.030" end="00:39:39.730" style="s2">you going right yeah I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.120" end="00:39:43.770" style="s2">that&#39;s well said yes I mean and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.730" end="00:39:45.240" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a really that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.770" end="00:39:47.010" style="s2">really difficult problem I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.240" end="00:39:50.490" style="s2">goes towards Paul snow should probably</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.010" end="00:39:52.560" style="s2">about you know almost every corporation</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.490" end="00:39:56.040" style="s2">that ever existed or any kind of group</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.560" end="00:40:03.390" style="s2">yeah get anything done like it&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.040" end="00:40:05.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a huge problem it is and like I</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.390" end="00:40:08.820" style="s2">said I&#39;m again we&#39;ve got some cotton ear</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.520" end="00:40:11.310" style="s2">science of distributed cognition trying</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.820" end="00:40:13.530" style="s2">to bring that in we understand you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.310" end="00:40:16.260" style="s2">network formations better than we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.530" end="00:40:19.050" style="s2">ever had in the past so we have we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.260" end="00:40:21.270" style="s2">some new tools we can bring to bear on</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.050" end="00:40:22.860" style="s2">this weekend we can like Jordan has</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.270" end="00:40:24.750" style="s2">suggested in the dialogue I had with him</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.860" end="00:40:26.940" style="s2">on the religion that&#39;s not a religion we</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.750" end="00:40:29.310" style="s2">can supplement and complement the</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.940" end="00:40:33.450" style="s2">interpersonal process with you know a AI</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.310" end="00:40:35.790" style="s2">data analysis of things that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.450" end="00:40:37.800" style="s2">process because of the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.790" end="00:40:39.630" style="s2">number crunching involved yeah so we</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.800" end="00:40:41.880" style="s2">have some tools to bring to bear on that</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.630" end="00:40:45.150" style="s2">problem you put your finger on the you</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.880" end="00:40:48.690" style="s2">know that the the scalability problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.150" end="00:40:51.630" style="s2">yeah the the the thing that that gives</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.690" end="00:40:55.530" style="s2">me a bit more hope then perhaps Paul has</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.630" end="00:40:57.180" style="s2">Paul bender clay is there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.530" end="00:40:59.820" style="s2">which and there&#39;s a danger in this so I</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.180" end="00:41:01.230" style="s2">bring out the danger in the series but</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.820" end="00:41:04.950" style="s2">there&#39;s essentially which really good</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.230" end="00:41:07.080" style="s2">ideas and practices self scale they sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.950" end="00:41:09.120" style="s2">of self organize because instructor I</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.080" end="00:41:11.010" style="s2">was talking about this stuff who was I</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.120" end="00:41:13.440" style="s2">talking to about this and I said you</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.010" end="00:41:14.940" style="s2">know the way Freud&#39;s ideas have</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.440" end="00:41:17.130" style="s2">permeated through the culture we now</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.940" end="00:41:19.200" style="s2">take it a second nature or even you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.130" end="00:41:21.180" style="s2">some of baked arts ideas like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.200" end="00:41:23.070" style="s2">there&#39;s the degree to which you know I</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.180" end="00:41:24.810" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to invoke too much of</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.070" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">Richard Dawkins here but there there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.810" end="00:41:30.930" style="s2">degree to which these ideas have like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:33.030" style="s2">memetic to palace area to to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.930" end="00:41:36.030" style="s2">replicate it themselves and evolve their</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.030" end="00:41:39.270" style="s2">own scalability yeah to a degree and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.030" end="00:41:40.800" style="s2">think I think that&#39;s as it should be if</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.270" end="00:41:46.560" style="s2">I&#39;m allowed to pronounce on that</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.800" end="00:41:48.840" style="s2">precisely because that I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.560" end="00:41:52.140" style="s2">focus right that&#39;s part of the logos its</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.840" end="00:41:56.040" style="s2">ability to to its own generativity its</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.140" end="00:41:57.870" style="s2">own its ability independent of us yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.040" end="00:42:01.230" style="s2">whoever us is</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.870" end="00:42:05.430" style="s2">to evolve and permeate itself in some</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.230" end="00:42:09.890" style="s2">way that&#39;s not in our hands so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.430" end="00:42:12.000" style="s2">hoping that will also be a factor for us</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.890" end="00:42:14.190" style="s2">you know I&#39;m wondering I just had this</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.000" end="00:42:17.700" style="s2">thought about that thing that evolves</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.190" end="00:42:22.050" style="s2">itself right yes it depended from us in</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.700" end="00:42:23.610" style="s2">some way you look back is it I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.050" end="00:42:27.570" style="s2">it&#39;s that thing that where when you look</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.610" end="00:42:29.610" style="s2">back it all looks like a plan right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.570" end="00:42:31.560" style="s2">like that cooker gar talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.610" end="00:42:33.480" style="s2">yeah thing of like this oh yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.560" end="00:42:35.940" style="s2">straight path when you&#39;re looking back</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.480" end="00:42:38.430" style="s2">but as you&#39;re going forward it you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.940" end="00:42:40.380" style="s2">see the pattern you&#39;re so in it well</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.430" end="00:42:42.750" style="s2">that part of it is right part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.380" end="00:42:44.280" style="s2">when you look would you look forward</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.750" end="00:42:45.480" style="s2">you&#39;re facing combinatorial explosion</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.280" end="00:42:47.370" style="s2">but you look back all the relevance</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.480" end="00:42:49.230" style="s2">realization has been done so it looks</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.370" end="00:42:50.910" style="s2">like it was a career and something</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.230" end="00:42:52.500" style="s2">something says like when we look forward</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.910" end="00:42:54.660" style="s2">and we see freedom and we look backwards</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.500" end="00:42:57.150" style="s2">we see destiny something about along</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.660" end="00:42:58.620" style="s2">those lines and it&#39;s like yeah yeah why</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.150" end="00:43:00.690" style="s2">is that well because this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.620" end="00:43:02.700" style="s2">combinatorial explosive and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.690" end="00:43:05.970" style="s2">the relevant the relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.700" end="00:43:10.140" style="s2">has all been done right and so there is</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.970" end="00:43:14.700" style="s2">that asymmetry there this is cop Latorre</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.140" end="00:43:16.890" style="s2">explosive however somehow it&#39;s in some</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.700" end="00:43:18.720" style="s2">way that we can even think we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.890" end="00:43:23.250" style="s2">in fact we can think we&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.720" end="00:43:26.550" style="s2">opposite right yes yes of what it ends</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.250" end="00:43:30.570" style="s2">up being and it ends up doing all the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.550" end="00:43:33.330" style="s2">right things yeah this goes yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.570" end="00:43:36.330" style="s2">goes towards your point about like in</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.330" end="00:43:38.280" style="s2">the end dialectic isn&#39;t like it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.330" end="00:43:41.660" style="s2">like it&#39;s a virtual engineering we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.280" end="00:43:45.840" style="s2">trying to set up you know probably a</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.660" end="00:43:47.640" style="s2">somewhat complex and dynamic set of</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.840" end="00:43:50.310" style="s2">constraints to afford something that</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.640" end="00:43:52.980" style="s2">ultimately has to be a logo so it has to</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.310" end="00:43:54.990" style="s2">be a gathering of it to a you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.980" end="00:43:57.420" style="s2">through itself out from itself kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.990" end="00:44:00.450" style="s2">thing yes very much so</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.420" end="00:44:01.590" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m trying to also run reading</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.450" end="00:44:02.550" style="s2">through and trying to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.590" end="00:44:04.590" style="s2">slingerland</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.550" end="00:44:07.170" style="s2">ideas from the book trying not to try</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.590" end="00:44:10.320" style="s2">because he argues that the in the east</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.170" end="00:44:11.690" style="s2">especially in how is some branches of</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.320" end="00:44:15.440" style="s2">Buddhism and</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.690" end="00:44:18.500" style="s2">this issue about trying not to try about</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.440" end="00:44:20.930" style="s2">how to how do which is I think the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.500" end="00:44:24.200" style="s2">central problem about participation is</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.930" end="00:44:25.730" style="s2">like how do you balance you know Tanabe</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.200" end="00:44:27.589" style="s2">talks about this in meadow no etics he</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.730" end="00:44:29.270" style="s2">talks about hi Ricky and John Ricky self</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.589" end="00:44:30.770" style="s2">power and other power how do you how do</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.270" end="00:44:33.140" style="s2">you balance those together so they</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.770" end="00:44:35.869" style="s2">you&#39;re genuinely participating in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.140" end="00:44:39.380" style="s2">self-organizing system that has some</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.869" end="00:44:41.869" style="s2">life of its own right right that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.380" end="00:44:43.609" style="s2">that and you see that it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.869" end="00:44:45.530" style="s2">because you don&#39;t see that becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.609" end="00:44:47.809" style="s2">focal philosophical problem so much in</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.530" end="00:44:49.789" style="s2">the West perhaps act perhaps with part</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.809" end="00:44:52.630" style="s2">eager it comes to the fore but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.789" end="00:44:56.059" style="s2">a perennial at least long-standing</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.630" end="00:44:59.539" style="s2">philosophical problem in Asian</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.059" end="00:45:04.789" style="s2">philosophy yeah is it in it in it now I</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.539" end="00:45:06.559" style="s2">was going to ask us so it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.789" end="00:45:09.099" style="s2">difficult for me to really grasp what</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.559" end="00:45:13.039" style="s2">Heidegger talks about is historicity</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.099" end="00:45:15.980" style="s2">correct but I&#39;m wondering if this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.039" end="00:45:18.289" style="s2">kind of gets added a little bit of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.980" end="00:45:21.109" style="s2">which is like there&#39;s a you know his</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.289" end="00:45:24.529" style="s2">views like well what you know how do we</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.109" end="00:45:27.859" style="s2">to understand the current Anto theology</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.529" end="00:45:29.720" style="s2">or understanding being right you can go</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.859" end="00:45:33.049" style="s2">back how you do it is you go back and</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.720" end="00:45:35.930" style="s2">you look at the like the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.049" end="00:45:38.329" style="s2">it&#39;s was understood differently yes and</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.930" end="00:45:40.940" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is like when he</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.329" end="00:45:43.369" style="s2">excavates that understanding from the</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.940" end="00:45:47.059" style="s2">different epochs of history like with</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.369" end="00:45:53.240" style="s2">cons and then you know yeah aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.059" end="00:45:54.950" style="s2">and plato and this pre-socratics it&#39;s he</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.240" end="00:45:57.710" style="s2">this is where it&#39;s really it&#39;s it really</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.950" end="00:45:59.480" style="s2">interesting just as an exercise to do to</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.710" end="00:46:02.829" style="s2">do that and what that exercise is just</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.480" end="00:46:05.990" style="s2">to exercise to excavate this but that um</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.829" end="00:46:09.079" style="s2">it&#39;s not like it&#39;s not like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.990" end="00:46:10.849" style="s2">hearing ears Aristotle or can&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.079" end="00:46:12.650" style="s2">about their understanding of being in</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.849" end="00:46:14.799" style="s2">fact you may even read them talk about</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.650" end="00:46:18.140" style="s2">their understandings me but where he</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.799" end="00:46:24.680" style="s2">where he seems to kind of go is he</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.140" end="00:46:27.200" style="s2">somehow unconcealed uh that</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.680" end="00:46:30.650" style="s2">that by virtue of which they would say</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.200" end="00:46:33.680" style="s2">this about being right yeah way back</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.650" end="00:46:35.660" style="s2">there right the primordial pre thematic</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.680" end="00:46:39.670" style="s2">understanding such that everything that</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.660" end="00:46:42.440" style="s2">they&#39;re saying both conceals but reveals</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.670" end="00:46:45.700" style="s2">you know you know what I&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.440" end="00:46:48.619" style="s2">like that in that sense of destiny right</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.700" end="00:46:53.510" style="s2">yeah that is it has its own movement</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.619" end="00:46:55.280" style="s2">right that is it is so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.510" end="00:46:57.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple things I would want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.280" end="00:47:00.920" style="s2">say in response to that I mean so I take</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.980" end="00:47:04.480" style="s2">the Heidegger and I sort of infect it</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.920" end="00:47:06.410" style="s2">with thick and start and and I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.480" end="00:47:07.490" style="s2">and you could see that in this series</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.410" end="00:47:09.500" style="s2">because they&#39;re trying to get at this</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.490" end="00:47:11.990" style="s2">notion of it evolving grammar yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.500" end="00:47:14.720" style="s2">positive cultural grammar that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.990" end="00:47:19.400" style="s2">try to make sense of that and how that</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.720" end="00:47:21.890" style="s2">is really much you know back during</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.400" end="00:47:25.190" style="s2">other relevance realization process is</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.890" end="00:47:28.520" style="s2">unfolding um great actually there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.190" end="00:47:33.020" style="s2">firm I love that tournament you use that</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.520" end="00:47:35.299" style="s2">grammar ring the Porto grammar yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.020" end="00:47:38.119" style="s2">that&#39;s how I&#39;ve tried to do it</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.299" end="00:47:40.190" style="s2">I try to integrate because I&#39;m een a lot</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.119" end="00:47:43.369" style="s2">of people noted this there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.190" end="00:47:47.780" style="s2">some deep convergences between the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.369" end="00:47:49.670" style="s2">consign and Heidegger on this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.780" end="00:47:50.900" style="s2">stuff and when I try to get a</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.670" end="00:47:55.670" style="s2">participatory knowing I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.900" end="00:47:59.780" style="s2">drawing on both of them towards that so</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.670" end="00:48:07.720" style="s2">there&#39;s that and then this the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.780" end="00:48:10.549" style="s2">destiny see so I have like I said I I is</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.720" end="00:48:11.690" style="s2">well let&#39;s the formulators a question</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.549" end="00:48:14.030" style="s2">because that&#39;s what the most appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.690" end="00:48:16.040" style="s2">representation of how its situated in my</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.030" end="00:48:19.579" style="s2">mind right now is that is that an</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.040" end="00:48:21.230" style="s2">illusion right cause when we look back</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.579" end="00:48:23.210" style="s2">the relevance realization has occurred</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.230" end="00:48:25.339" style="s2">and contrastive Lee when we look forward</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.210" end="00:48:28.069" style="s2">you know it&#39;s open it&#39;s like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.339" end="00:48:33.280" style="s2">facing a combinatorial explosive future</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.069" end="00:48:41.440" style="s2">yeah because I&#39;m try</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.280" end="00:48:44.980" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to I&#39;m trying to get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.440" end="00:48:47.080" style="s2">of well let&#39;s do one of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.980" end="00:48:49.900" style="s2">pre-socratics because Chris mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.080" end="00:48:51.520" style="s2">this Chris mentioned this with Anderson</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.900" end="00:48:54.370" style="s2">you know Heraclitus the characters</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.520" end="00:48:56.200" style="s2">destiny and the characterization that</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.370" end="00:48:57.460" style="s2">Chris does this riff on it raises it</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.200" end="00:49:01.290" style="s2">well that means characterization is</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.460" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2">destination and then I&#39;m trying to think</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.290" end="00:49:08.530" style="s2">yeah but there&#39;s there&#39;s would like is</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.400" end="00:49:09.820" style="s2">is it is it that the right way to think</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.530" end="00:49:16.450" style="s2">about it right</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.820" end="00:49:17.710" style="s2">because for me I it&#39;s to if I guess want</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.450" end="00:49:21.490" style="s2">to try to get it is to uni-directional</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.710" end="00:49:24.640" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m very I&#39;m very sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.490" end="00:49:27.310" style="s2">Keller it&#39;s point about the the promised</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.640" end="00:49:30.430" style="s2">of self-transcendence or what she calls</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.310" end="00:49:32.170" style="s2">self creation all right it even if it</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.430" end="00:49:36.460" style="s2">just totally overtakes me from outside</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.170" end="00:49:38.920" style="s2">and some external force right then I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.460" end="00:49:41.470" style="s2">lost myself it&#39;s not self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.920" end="00:49:42.730" style="s2">and if I totally make it happen and</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.470" end="00:49:45.100" style="s2">caused it to happen</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.730" end="00:49:46.240" style="s2">then there&#39;s no self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.100" end="00:49:48.850" style="s2">because there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.240" end="00:49:50.440" style="s2">created or new ice right and I think it</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.850" end="00:49:52.150" style="s2">was started who said well that means</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.440" end="00:49:54.720" style="s2">that soft transcendence self creation is</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.150" end="00:49:58.030" style="s2">actually impossible and she says no no</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.720" end="00:50:01.210" style="s2">aspiration actually is the process in</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.030" end="00:50:02.860" style="s2">which people do this and as I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.210" end="00:50:05.500" style="s2">argue I think aspiration is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.860" end="00:50:07.870" style="s2">linked to participatory knowing which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.500" end="00:50:10.290" style="s2">deeply linked to the sacred second self</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.870" end="00:50:12.310" style="s2">right and all of that stuff and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.290" end="00:50:15.220" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of why I want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.310" end="00:50:16.600" style="s2">challenge the I&#39;m calling or at least</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.220" end="00:50:18.220" style="s2">call I want to call into question that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.600" end="00:50:20.950" style="s2">because that&#39;s how I framed it right</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.220" end="00:50:22.030" style="s2">this idea of a destiny I think we</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.950" end="00:50:23.110" style="s2">definitely have the phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.030" end="00:50:27.100" style="s2">sense of that</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.110" end="00:50:30.430" style="s2">well is it is that sense or reflective</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.100" end="00:50:33.190" style="s2">of the process that we&#39;re participating</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.430" end="00:50:36.700" style="s2">in or is it actually a skewing of that</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.190" end="00:50:40.390" style="s2">because we have this contrast between</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.700" end="00:50:43.450" style="s2">right the open future and the completely</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.390" end="00:50:45.720" style="s2">intelligible past right the I&#39;m picking</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.450" end="00:50:47.910" style="s2">up on a crooked Guardian theme yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.720" end="00:50:50.870" style="s2">is it fair to say that you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.910" end="00:50:57.530" style="s2">that that sense of destiny the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.870" end="00:50:59.910" style="s2">right is its is what it&#39;s the way it</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.530" end="00:51:05.220" style="s2">somehow constitutes maybe the way I</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.910" end="00:51:07.430" style="s2">participate with the unfold it is but</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.220" end="00:51:09.510" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s irreplaceable</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.430" end="00:51:10.890" style="s2">that&#39;s what my good well that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.510" end="00:51:13.680" style="s2">trying to bring out I&#39;m trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.890" end="00:51:16.770" style="s2">out because the issue with the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.680" end="00:51:18.870" style="s2">destiny isn&#39;t because it can slip into a</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.770" end="00:51:21.180" style="s2">kind of unilateral TD ology a</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.870" end="00:51:22.620" style="s2">unidirectional TD ology I think it</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.180" end="00:51:25.470" style="s2">actually obscures</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.620" end="00:51:27.980" style="s2">a problem rather than addressing it the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.470" end="00:51:27.980" style="s2">problem that</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.310" end="00:51:34.370" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.359" end="00:51:40.740" style="s2">and it seems impossible it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.369" end="00:51:43.020" style="s2">it&#39;s all it&#39;s almost like you know again</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.740" end="00:51:44.309" style="s2">a pre-socratic you know paradox here you</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.020" end="00:51:47.279" style="s2">know it smells like something at a</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.309" end="00:51:48.900" style="s2">permit it is you know if I create other</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.279" end="00:51:50.940" style="s2">than myself then I&#39;m not self creation</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.900" end="00:51:52.529" style="s2">right but if I only make it and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.940" end="00:51:54.779" style="s2">complete then there is no creation</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.529" end="00:52:00.119" style="s2">there&#39;s only repetition and so how can</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.779" end="00:52:02.490" style="s2">right and so I feel that the let me just</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.119" end="00:52:05.640" style="s2">call it this Pro Tem the illusion of</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.490" end="00:52:08.599" style="s2">being destined actually obscures a</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.640" end="00:52:11.520" style="s2">problem that existentially and</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.599" end="00:52:13.470" style="s2">philosophically needs to be resolved</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.520" end="00:52:15.829" style="s2">perhaps my concern that&#39;s my concern</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.470" end="00:52:19.559" style="s2">right right totally</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.829" end="00:52:23.880" style="s2">yeah is it irreplaceable yeah cuz there</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.559" end="00:52:26.579" style="s2">there is this sense of I&#39;ve been I would</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.880" end="00:52:28.920" style="s2">imagine it gets a pity like the epitome</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.579" end="00:52:31.619" style="s2">of it is is the flow state like that</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.920" end="00:52:34.950" style="s2">well that&#39;s it the flow state is very</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.619" end="00:52:37.470" style="s2">much one and which I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.950" end="00:52:39.450" style="s2">these the cotton pieces to break down</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.470" end="00:52:41.309" style="s2">along in an important way</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.450" end="00:52:43.470" style="s2">yeah because the thing about the flow</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.309" end="00:52:46.710" style="s2">state is again that&#39;s why it&#39;s it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.470" end="00:52:48.900" style="s2">exemplary of you know the perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.710" end="00:52:52.170" style="s2">really of being really deeply aligned</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.900" end="00:52:55.710" style="s2">with the participatory because these</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.170" end="00:52:57.510" style="s2">like the self-organization is sort of so</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.710" end="00:53:00.059" style="s2">far grounded rather than background it</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.510" end="00:53:02.789" style="s2">the sense of being the author or just</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.059" end="00:53:06.660" style="s2">the recipient they&#39;re they&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.789" end="00:53:08.819" style="s2">marginalized by how foregrounded this</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.660" end="00:53:11.819" style="s2">while the flow is hence the name right</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.819" end="00:53:16.650" style="s2">the flow gets foregrounded and then the</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.819" end="00:53:18.779" style="s2">thing about the flow is it like it</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.650" end="00:53:21.450" style="s2">pushes against these ideas of authorship</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.779" end="00:53:26.190" style="s2">from within or destiny and from without</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.450" end="00:53:28.529" style="s2">or or things like that and again that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.190" end="00:53:30.630" style="s2">why I often when I&#39;m in discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.529" end="00:53:32.430" style="s2">you know Jonathan puja or Paul bender</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.630" end="00:53:34.740" style="s2">claim they bring up sort of you know the</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.430" end="00:53:36.539" style="s2">teleological things all say well you</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.740" end="00:53:39.059" style="s2">know and things like that was them you</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.539" end="00:53:44.270" style="s2">don&#39;t have that you don&#39;t have this kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.059" end="00:53:47.850" style="s2">of teleological drive and you don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.270" end="00:53:50.700" style="s2">the universe in terms of a cars</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.850" end="00:53:52.860" style="s2">story it&#39;s almost pre axial in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.700" end="00:53:55.560" style="s2">you see it as these huge self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.860" end="00:53:57.750" style="s2">systems yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.560" end="00:54:01.500" style="s2">and that&#39;s a fundamentally different way</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.750" end="00:54:02.850" style="s2">and so I&#39;m interested in the wet the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.500" end="00:54:05.880" style="s2">degree to which human beings could go</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.850" end="00:54:10.350" style="s2">sort of trans or post narrative and get</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.880" end="00:54:12.560" style="s2">out of being found to that illusion of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.350" end="00:54:15.150" style="s2">Destiny in their self interpretive</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.560" end="00:54:19.170" style="s2">self-transcending projects yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.150" end="00:54:22.530" style="s2">totally totally now and when we say</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.170" end="00:54:24.990" style="s2">purpose right cuz I know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.530" end="00:54:28.680" style="s2">like lots of like that&#39;s a big I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.990" end="00:54:31.370" style="s2">big buzzword yeah it is not as important</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.680" end="00:54:35.730" style="s2">to meeting his life as we thought a</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.370" end="00:54:38.930" style="s2">rhetoric mattering mattering me sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.730" end="00:54:41.400" style="s2">was gonna say bang during matters more</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.930" end="00:54:46.050" style="s2">but I think this really came out in</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.400" end="00:54:48.150" style="s2">Susan Wolf&#39;s book like experience</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.050" end="00:54:51.330" style="s2">feeling I want to use the word sensing</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.150" end="00:54:54.270" style="s2">to mean both perceiving and having an</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.330" end="00:54:58.200" style="s2">understanding of right right sensing</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.270" end="00:55:00.390" style="s2">that you are relevant to others</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.200" end="00:55:03.420" style="s2">yeah and that you make and you make a</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.390" end="00:55:06.480" style="s2">difference to others and to something</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.420" end="00:55:08.220" style="s2">beyond yourself yes that seems to be one</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.480" end="00:55:10.290" style="s2">of the central things that&#39;s what some</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.220" end="00:55:13.620" style="s2">of the most recent work on meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.290" end="00:55:17.340" style="s2">life is showing that that connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.620" end="00:55:20.000" style="s2">we there&#39;s two ways we need to feel that</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.340" end="00:55:22.380" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me again the geometry</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.000" end="00:55:24.510" style="s2">yeah you need to feel we need to feel</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.380" end="00:55:27.180" style="s2">that people are vectored towards us and</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.510" end="00:55:29.610" style="s2">care but we also right so we need that</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.180" end="00:55:32.480" style="s2">connectedness but we also need to matter</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.610" end="00:55:35.220" style="s2">we need to feel that what we do is</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.480" end="00:55:37.050" style="s2">relevant to others and to the world at</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.220" end="00:55:40.560" style="s2">large yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.050" end="00:55:44.400" style="s2">in paper yeah and we know and so I can</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.560" end="00:55:47.790" style="s2">get how purpose can he could obscure tha</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.400" end="00:55:50.700" style="s2">Erica right well it could also gather it</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.790" end="00:55:53.790" style="s2">right it could it could it could gather</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.700" end="00:55:57.180" style="s2">it so and I wanted to be clear purpose</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.790" end="00:55:58.530" style="s2">does seem to matter not to meeting in</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.180" end="00:56:01.490" style="s2">life and so it does make a difference</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.530" end="00:56:03.740" style="s2">but what I&#39;m arguing against</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.490" end="00:56:07.730" style="s2">the idea that we can reduce meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.740" end="00:56:10.910" style="s2">life to purpose yeah and so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.730" end="00:56:13.190" style="s2">obscuring of the intelligibility the</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.910" end="00:56:17.930" style="s2">connectedness and the mattering by</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.190" end="00:56:19.520" style="s2">purpose that that concerns me and I was</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.930" end="00:56:21.140" style="s2">trying to address that in some of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.520" end="00:56:23.090" style="s2">final episodes of the series when I was</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.140" end="00:56:24.950" style="s2">trying to get into Heidegger right and</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.090" end="00:56:28.700" style="s2">and and the Rose blooms without a why</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.950" end="00:56:31.280" style="s2">yeah by the way that those lasted that</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.700" end="00:56:36.710" style="s2">those three those last three you did in</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.280" end="00:56:38.960" style="s2">Heidegger I was so impressed by how you</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.710" end="00:56:40.880" style="s2">basically took Heidegger and figure it</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.960" end="00:56:43.280" style="s2">out how to make it available in such a</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.880" end="00:56:47.680" style="s2">short period of time right thank you</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.280" end="00:56:47.680" style="s2">cancel her toast like it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.040" end="00:56:53.660" style="s2">difficult feat I would have met like in</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.660" end="00:56:55.760" style="s2">precisely in what exactly what not to</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.660" end="00:56:57.860" style="s2">talk about right yes that was the</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.760" end="00:57:00.530" style="s2">hardest problem yeah that was the</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.860" end="00:57:03.800" style="s2">hardest problem yeah so I made the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.530" end="00:57:06.050" style="s2">decision that to basically that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.800" end="00:57:08.540" style="s2">bridge through Dreyfuss between</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.050" end="00:57:11.869" style="s2">Heidegger and Cox I was the most</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.540" end="00:57:13.340" style="s2">pertinent to the overall argument of of</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.869" end="00:57:16.460" style="s2">the series so that&#39;s how I made the</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.340" end="00:57:18.470" style="s2">choice right right yeah just you helped</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.460" end="00:57:22.580" style="s2">you got it and you held it and just</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.470" end="00:57:24.650" style="s2">linked better at right and like even</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.580" end="00:57:29.210" style="s2">with Corbin and I mean a Corbett is so</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.650" end="00:57:31.880" style="s2">obscure right yeah yeah oh I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.210" end="00:57:33.320" style="s2">talking with Thomas Chatham I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.880" end="00:57:35.420" style="s2">talking with him yeah we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.320" end="00:57:36.260" style="s2">a video thing and probably record it</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.420" end="00:57:38.000" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.260" end="00:57:39.530" style="s2">so somebody reached out who was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.000" end="00:57:41.660" style="s2">a student of him and was watching my</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.530" end="00:57:43.010" style="s2">series and said you two should talk so</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.660" end="00:57:45.590" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re gonna have a discussion and</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.010" end="00:57:46.970" style="s2">sometime in January about him it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.590" end="00:57:49.850" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s worked with Corbin oh</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.970" end="00:57:52.640" style="s2">that it&#39;s the person who are whose work</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.850" end="00:57:53.780" style="s2">I cited up a lot check on the book he</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.640" end="00:57:54.440" style="s2">wrote the book like the world turned</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.780" end="00:57:57.170" style="s2">inside out</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.440" end="00:57:59.660" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a imaginal love all the</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.170" end="00:58:02.869" style="s2">world an icon that set of books on</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.660" end="00:58:06.320" style="s2">Corvin which is I highly recommend his</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.869" end="00:58:08.030" style="s2">work as the way of getting into Corbin&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.320" end="00:58:10.550" style="s2">so that you can start to you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.030" end="00:58:12.290" style="s2">get a sense of what&#39;s really happening</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.550" end="00:58:15.000" style="s2">in Corbin rather than the probably</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.290" end="00:58:17.520" style="s2">Corbin right is this beautiful lyricism</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.000" end="00:58:20.970" style="s2">yeah it could keep you sort of outside</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.520" end="00:58:24.119" style="s2">of the movement of his thought yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.970" end="00:58:26.760" style="s2">stuff but Chatham is like he&#39;s he says</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.119" end="00:58:29.220" style="s2">this perspicacious access providing</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.760" end="00:58:33.900" style="s2">because I was I was I got in contact</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.220" end="00:58:35.490" style="s2">with Corbin first um when I think I want</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.900" end="00:58:39.800" style="s2">like right after I graduated high school</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.490" end="00:58:42.300" style="s2">through James Hillman yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.800" end="00:58:44.940" style="s2">psychology I was like that was a whole</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.300" end="00:58:45.329" style="s2">whole period of your life diving into</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.940" end="00:58:47.790" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.329" end="00:58:49.440" style="s2">yeah Chatham talks about that and he he</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.790" end="00:58:51.359" style="s2">talks so he talks about which I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.440" end="00:58:54.180" style="s2">touch on he talks about the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.359" end="00:58:55.530" style="s2">between Corman and Hillman it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.180" end="00:58:57.000" style="s2">especially in the book on a national</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.530" end="00:59:00.930" style="s2">love that because human figure is much</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.000" end="00:59:02.369" style="s2">larger much more largely in that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.930" end="00:59:03.930" style="s2">connection between Corbin and Hillman</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.369" end="00:59:09.000" style="s2">also comes out in avens book the new</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.930" end="00:59:10.829" style="s2">gnosis uh-huh but Chatham also discusses</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.000" end="00:59:12.660" style="s2">also the Corbin young connection to</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.829" end="00:59:13.500" style="s2">because that&#39;s relevant for me</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.660" end="00:59:15.599" style="s2">fulfillment as well</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.500" end="00:59:19.290" style="s2">totally I what&#39;s with that with the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.599" end="00:59:21.390" style="s2">archetypal psychology stuff um that at</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.290" end="00:59:24.630" style="s2">least at least when I was I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.390" end="00:59:26.700" style="s2">notice it went back then anyway it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.630" end="00:59:28.740" style="s2">maybe I could I can see it now but I</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.700" end="00:59:31.319" style="s2">don&#39;t I didn&#39;t get the sense that they</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.740" end="00:59:35.819" style="s2">excavated the the Heidegger connection</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.319" end="00:59:37.140" style="s2">watch out of right not as not as much as</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.819" end="00:59:40.140" style="s2">they should have so part of what I was</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.140" end="00:59:42.960" style="s2">trying to do was use Corbin as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.140" end="00:59:45.510" style="s2">doing that use the Heidegger Corbin</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.960" end="00:59:47.160" style="s2">young connection yeah and also the</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.510" end="00:59:49.560" style="s2">Heidegger Tillich connection and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.160" end="00:59:52.800" style="s2">Matilda keung connection I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.560" end="00:59:55.619" style="s2">get I was trying to like I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.800" end="00:59:58.560" style="s2">constantly around young yeah and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.619" end="01:00:01.470" style="s2">also why I did the and just uploaded</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.560" end="01:00:04.230" style="s2">that thought the dialogue with Anderson</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.470" end="01:00:05.819" style="s2">Todd about young yeah cuz I like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.230" end="01:00:08.940" style="s2">thing that I liked how you highlighted</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.819" end="01:00:10.710" style="s2">the danger with you yes you know it</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.940" end="01:00:13.079" style="s2">depends on what where you&#39;re coming from</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.710" end="01:00:14.760" style="s2">like you can read you them and from a</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.079" end="01:00:21.329" style="s2">certain perspective and get something</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.760" end="01:00:24.500" style="s2">really like manic kind of yet here again</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.329" end="01:00:28.300" style="s2">right you can that&#39;s definitely the case</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.500" end="01:00:30.700" style="s2">I didn&#39;t get to talk a bit about</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.300" end="01:00:32.170" style="s2">Wilbur&#39;s critique about young the pre</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.700" end="01:00:36.150" style="s2">trans fallacy I think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.170" end="01:00:40.600" style="s2">important thing to needs to be discussed</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.150" end="01:00:45.270" style="s2">yeah yeah there there there is that sort</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.600" end="01:00:47.620" style="s2">of danger I think that&#39;s the right word</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.270" end="01:00:51.730" style="s2">trying to get trying to get all those</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.620" end="01:00:53.980" style="s2">guys like sort of talking to each other</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.730" end="01:00:57.010" style="s2">and then talking with the argument of</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.980" end="01:00:59.440" style="s2">the course that was that was kind of an</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.010" end="01:01:02.320" style="s2">exhilarating challenge trying to figure</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.440" end="01:01:04.780" style="s2">out how try to get them to all talk to</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.320" end="01:01:07.210" style="s2">each other and sort of what is it one of</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.780" end="01:01:11.050" style="s2">the possible connections that would help</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.210" end="01:01:14.920" style="s2">I help other people gain access because</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.050" end="01:01:16.630" style="s2">I I try to present them like I said as</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.920" end="01:01:19.120" style="s2">the consolation the profits of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.630" end="01:01:20.980" style="s2">meeting crisis and that it&#39;s it&#39;s best</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.120" end="01:01:23.620" style="s2">to understand them in that in that</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.980" end="01:01:25.990" style="s2">fashion rather than seeing them as</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.620" end="01:01:27.850" style="s2">isolated figures right and plus I would</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.990" end="01:01:29.200" style="s2">I would look I mean that&#39;s part again</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.850" end="01:01:32.050" style="s2">when I had the discussion with Anderson</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.200" end="01:01:39.040" style="s2">I would like to bring young back into</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.050" end="01:01:40.690" style="s2">discussion rather than just like just I</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.040" end="01:01:42.910" style="s2">don&#39;t know what just being venerated I</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.690" end="01:01:45.910" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be too harsh sure but but</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.910" end="01:01:50.920" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s part of what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.910" end="01:01:53.290" style="s2">do yeah yeah so I mean that&#39;s why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.920" end="01:01:55.890" style="s2">what an Anderson and I talked about this</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.290" end="01:01:58.210" style="s2">a bit but that&#39;s why I talked about it</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.890" end="01:02:01.270" style="s2">also in the series</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.210" end="01:02:03.340" style="s2">you know boobers critique of young which</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.270" end="01:02:04.810" style="s2">is part of the danger they k20 but like</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.340" end="01:02:05.500" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a sense in which the</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.810" end="01:02:07.720" style="s2">intrapsychic</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.500" end="01:02:09.790" style="s2">can become so captivating that you lose</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.720" end="01:02:11.620" style="s2">the existential in a powerful way</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.790" end="01:02:14.710" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s part of Tillich&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.620" end="01:02:18.520" style="s2">critique too and I understand argued I</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.710" end="01:02:22.150" style="s2">think quite cogently that that&#39;s that is</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.520" end="01:02:24.310" style="s2">not that is not correct of young towards</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.150" end="01:02:26.880" style="s2">the end that towards the end of his</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.310" end="01:02:32.440" style="s2">development and is thinking right the</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.880" end="01:02:35.470" style="s2">right the it becomes progressively much</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.440" end="01:02:38.260" style="s2">more trans ejected and existential and</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.470" end="01:02:40.580" style="s2">not just intrapsychic yeah as you move</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.260" end="01:02:44.210" style="s2">into them into the later young me</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.580" end="01:02:46.250" style="s2">so Anderson with uh he enters a talk</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.210" end="01:02:50.330" style="s2">like he would be made maybe he made a</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.250" end="01:02:53.450" style="s2">very good point about that he also did a</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.330" end="01:02:55.010" style="s2">very good criticism of my take on young</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.450" end="01:02:56.510" style="s2">and the divine double which I thought</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.010" end="01:02:59.000" style="s2">was correct so that was some good self</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.510" end="01:03:02.660" style="s2">correction yes what was the correction I</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.000" end="01:03:06.800" style="s2">haven&#39;t watched it yet okay so you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.660" end="01:03:09.080" style="s2">in this series I talked about you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.800" end="01:03:11.210" style="s2">the divine double because we need this</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.080" end="01:03:12.890" style="s2">we need the inactive symbol in order to</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.210" end="01:03:15.080" style="s2">afford aspiration because proactive</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.890" end="01:03:17.510" style="s2">rationality is constitutive of</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.080" end="01:03:18.910" style="s2">rationality I think that I like that</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.510" end="01:03:23.300" style="s2">argument I think it&#39;s a good argument</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.910" end="01:03:25.910" style="s2">but I thought it was between the ego and</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.300" end="01:03:27.980" style="s2">of itself that&#39;s actually a mistake</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.910" end="01:03:30.619" style="s2">what Anderson pointed out was no no no</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.980" end="01:03:32.330" style="s2">no right the divine double is actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.619" end="01:03:34.730" style="s2">the anima or the animus right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.330" end="01:03:36.530" style="s2">because the divine double has to</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.730" end="01:03:40.940" style="s2">actually stand it has to mediate between</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.530" end="01:03:42.740" style="s2">you and the self between the ego and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.940" end="01:03:44.540" style="s2">self and if you think about it that</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.740" end="01:03:46.340" style="s2">actually maps on to the divine double</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.540" end="01:03:49.070" style="s2">better because the divine double is</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.340" end="01:03:51.800" style="s2">actually between you right in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.070" end="01:03:55.430" style="s2">gnostic it&#39;s between you and and God</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.800" end="01:03:58.520" style="s2">right and the ultimate right right and</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.430" end="01:04:02.450" style="s2">so so it&#39;s like if you&#39;d allow me or the</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.520" end="01:04:05.600" style="s2">language the soul right looks looks</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.450" end="01:04:08.150" style="s2">towards you and calls you right but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.600" end="01:04:10.760" style="s2">also being called so called forward</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.150" end="01:04:14.650" style="s2">right and so you&#39;re both moving together</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.760" end="01:04:18.260" style="s2">so that&#39;s why right the divine double is</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.650" end="01:04:20.720" style="s2">huh right well it&#39;s a sacred second self</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.260" end="01:04:22.970" style="s2">it&#39;s your--it&#39;s right but it&#39;s sacred in</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.720" end="01:04:26.000" style="s2">that it&#39;s not only affording your</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.970" end="01:04:28.340" style="s2">aspiration it&#39;s well it&#39;s doing what we</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.000" end="01:04:31.100" style="s2">talked about right it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s giving</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.340" end="01:04:33.740" style="s2">you a place to stand but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.100" end="01:04:36.490" style="s2">prospecting you towards what it&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.740" end="01:04:38.869" style="s2">what it&#39;s a symbol for itself right</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.490" end="01:04:41.390" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s this interesting thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.869" end="01:04:44.300" style="s2">right you&#39;re you&#39;re enacting a symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.390" end="01:04:46.460" style="s2">relationship with the sacred second self</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.300" end="01:04:50.130" style="s2">but it itself is in a symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.460" end="01:04:52.710" style="s2">relationship right to</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.130" end="01:04:54.840" style="s2">the fountain intelligibility right in</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.710" end="01:04:56.850" style="s2">his transparent yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.840" end="01:04:59.430" style="s2">or translucent at least and loosened</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.850" end="01:05:00.540" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.430" end="01:05:02.520" style="s2">so I thought that was an excellent</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.540" end="01:05:05.340" style="s2">critique so that&#39;s afforded some self</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.520" end="01:05:07.320" style="s2">criticism like of my of my take on you</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.340" end="01:05:08.610" style="s2">and I thought that was oh yeah I thought</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.320" end="01:05:11.010" style="s2">that was really I thought there was a</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.610" end="01:05:13.770" style="s2">very germane criticism that he made</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.010" end="01:05:16.710" style="s2">right totally</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.770" end="01:05:26.160" style="s2">I appreciate your um what you said about</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.710" end="01:05:28.110" style="s2">I found myself sunk into the experience</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.160" end="01:05:29.460" style="s2">or imagining the experience and when you</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.110" end="01:05:35.340" style="s2">say when he talked about getting them</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.460" end="01:05:38.670" style="s2">all talking to each other yes like that</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.340" end="01:05:40.470" style="s2">that I would imagine I am yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.670" end="01:05:42.030" style="s2">really curious to like we should we</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.470" end="01:05:44.460" style="s2">should just like do make sure that we do</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.030" end="01:05:47.460" style="s2">the sacred geometry around the same time</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.460" end="01:05:48.840" style="s2">so we can talk about our there about it</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.460" end="01:05:50.430" style="s2">but I have a feeling I would like that</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.840" end="01:05:54.600" style="s2">that would be helpful to me thank you</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.430" end="01:05:56.010" style="s2">like it&#39;s like because what some of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.600" end="01:05:57.810" style="s2">questions I&#39;ve had is wondered about</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.010" end="01:05:59.670" style="s2">when you talk about like yeah when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.810" end="01:06:02.160" style="s2">working on this project with somebody</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.670" end="01:06:04.950" style="s2">right like with Chris and with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.160" end="01:06:07.920" style="s2">different people with Leo when you what</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.950" end="01:06:10.380" style="s2">does that look like like when you when</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.920" end="01:06:12.450" style="s2">he like you go to his house do you like</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.380" end="01:06:15.750" style="s2">brew coffee do you drink beer do you</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.450" end="01:06:19.320" style="s2">like do you write emails like are you in</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.750" end="01:06:22.590" style="s2">questions like this that&#39;s mostly I mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.320" end="01:06:25.140" style="s2">so when I work with Chris or Leo or</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.590" end="01:06:29.310" style="s2">Anderson they usually come to my place</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.140" end="01:06:31.670" style="s2">the apartment and we hang out usually we</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.310" end="01:06:34.860" style="s2">need to set aside a big chunk of time</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.670" end="01:06:37.010" style="s2">right so we often talk about it as a</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.860" end="01:06:42.000" style="s2">marathon session like four or five hours</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.010" end="01:06:45.480" style="s2">to and and then and then it&#39;s sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.000" end="01:06:47.970" style="s2">you&#39;re writing sometimes like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.480" end="01:06:50.160" style="s2">actually generating text at some time</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.970" end="01:06:54.900" style="s2">you you pull away from the text and you</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.160" end="01:06:58.550" style="s2">enter into discussion and reflection I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.900" end="01:06:58.550" style="s2">often sort of pacing around the room</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.210" end="01:07:03.660" style="s2">although although although that&#39;s with</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.220" end="01:07:05.220" style="s2">Chris or Anderson although</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.660" end="01:07:07.440" style="s2">with Leo it tends to be a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.220" end="01:07:09.960" style="s2">reversed except when we&#39;re writing</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.440" end="01:07:11.700" style="s2">usually Leo&#39;s at the computer but in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.960" end="01:07:14.670" style="s2">initial stages all usually being a chair</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.700" end="01:07:16.470" style="s2">and Leo is is facing around very</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.670" end="01:07:18.660" style="s2">dynamically but when we sit to write</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.470" end="01:07:21.869" style="s2">then you usually Leo&#39;s actually at the</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.660" end="01:07:23.670" style="s2">computer and then we switch roles and</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.869" end="01:07:25.740" style="s2">there again there&#39;s that there&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.670" end="01:07:27.539" style="s2">something about you know it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.740" end="01:07:30.990" style="s2">Peripatetic thing that the walking</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.539" end="01:07:33.839" style="s2">around the inactive movement is somehow</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.990" end="01:07:35.280" style="s2">in touch with the stoah stoah was the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.839" end="01:07:38.730" style="s2">place where the Stoics literally walked</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.280" end="01:07:40.980" style="s2">back and forth right and so there</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.730" end="01:07:43.920" style="s2">there&#39;s all of that going on typically</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.980" end="01:07:46.380" style="s2">and then and then you know and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.920" end="01:07:48.270" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s usually think it&#39;s taken</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.380" end="01:07:50.099" style="s2">back into some text and then you do the</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.270" end="01:07:53.609" style="s2">more analytic reflection on the text and</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.099" end="01:07:59.369" style="s2">you come back together mm-hmm to do the</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.609" end="01:08:00.809" style="s2">project to think that it&#39;s you might</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.369" end="01:08:02.849" style="s2">differently with different people really</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.809" end="01:08:03.660" style="s2">bonded don&#39;t you with the people that</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.849" end="01:08:06.089" style="s2">you work with</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.660" end="01:08:08.640" style="s2">oh very much I mean the man is so</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.089" end="01:08:10.079" style="s2">immersive in so many ways and I bet like</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.640" end="01:08:13.380" style="s2">it the relationship that you end up</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.079" end="01:08:15.569" style="s2">building is this really really rich it</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.380" end="01:08:16.679" style="s2">is it is in there and they&#39;re different</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.569" end="01:08:20.940" style="s2">cuz you work differently with different</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.679" end="01:08:23.609" style="s2">people yeah so like for example when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.940" end="01:08:25.940" style="s2">working with Leah we&#39;ll turn to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.609" end="01:08:29.640" style="s2">sentence by sentence construction</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.940" end="01:08:33.600" style="s2">whereas with Chris well you&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.640" end="01:08:35.370" style="s2">Chris has a lyricism mm-hmm yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.600" end="01:08:37.140" style="s2">don&#39;t want you like you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.370" end="01:08:39.210" style="s2">you know blade you don&#39;t want to crush</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.140" end="01:08:41.910" style="s2">the butterfly right so typically what</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.210" end="01:08:45.299" style="s2">happens is Chris and I get together and</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.910" end="01:08:49.259" style="s2">we&#39;ll do well right in sort of will</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.299" end="01:08:52.609" style="s2">write the argument and I usually play</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.259" end="01:08:57.319" style="s2">the leading role there then he goes away</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.609" end="01:09:03.179" style="s2">and when he comes back there&#39;s all this</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.319" end="01:09:07.080" style="s2">text that so rich with his lyricism and</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.179" end="01:09:08.400" style="s2">his and the police this right and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.080" end="01:09:11.370" style="s2">and then we were and then we read</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.400" end="01:09:12.000" style="s2">through it together and sort of edit and</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.370" end="01:09:15.120" style="s2">riff on it</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.000" end="01:09:15.619" style="s2">so saying Oh interesting so if you have</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.120" end="01:09:17.839" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.619" end="01:09:18.830" style="s2">yeah you have to adjust sorry I</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.839" end="01:09:21.529" style="s2">interrupted you you Pig</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.830" end="01:09:24.880" style="s2">you have to adjust to the person you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.529" end="01:09:27.199" style="s2">working with yeah the geometry again</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.880" end="01:09:29.449" style="s2">exactly exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.199" end="01:09:31.759" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s so interesting to look at just</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.449" end="01:09:33.409" style="s2">what that of like what that did what is</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.759" end="01:09:34.969" style="s2">the difference that makes how do we know</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.409" end="01:09:38.210" style="s2">to be different with each other in that</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.969" end="01:09:42.770" style="s2">way right that&#39;s very very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.210" end="01:09:44.359" style="s2">and what are we tuned into in responding</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.770" end="01:09:48.230" style="s2">differently to different people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.359" end="01:09:50.779" style="s2">one of the things I&#39;ve I&#39;ve yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.230" end="01:09:52.489" style="s2">a good question I it&#39;s the way I mean</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.779" end="01:09:54.049" style="s2">part of it is you know you think about</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.489" end="01:09:56.630" style="s2">planning you know all that all that</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.049" end="01:10:02.050" style="s2">tacit stuff all those patterns that</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.630" end="01:10:02.050" style="s2">we&#39;re picking up passively there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.119" end="01:10:10.580" style="s2">there&#39;s something about sorry this this</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.570" end="01:10:13.429" style="s2">is very joyful there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.580" end="01:10:15.440" style="s2">the way you get the alignment</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.429" end="01:10:19.040" style="s2">you know the alignment between the kinds</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.440" end="01:10:22.310" style="s2">of knowing within you and when that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.040" end="01:10:24.949" style="s2">when that&#39;s working and the other person</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.310" end="01:10:26.560" style="s2">seems to feel that working well then</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.949" end="01:10:30.230" style="s2">whatever it is that you&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.560" end="01:10:31.849" style="s2">between you that&#39;s got you know what</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.230" end="01:10:34.130" style="s2">Chris and I are talking about this in</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.849" end="01:10:35.510" style="s2">the dialectic right but you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.130" end="01:10:36.739" style="s2">do there Sensibility transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.510" end="01:10:38.780" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to fit yourself to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.739" end="01:10:41.449" style="s2">other person horizontally but that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.780" end="01:10:42.980" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s always an interplay and I</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.449" end="01:10:44.810" style="s2">use that word deliberately that&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.980" end="01:10:46.760" style="s2">an interplay with this vertical</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.810" end="01:10:48.409" style="s2">alignment between the kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.760" end="01:10:51.500" style="s2">so you&#39;re getting the deep understand</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.409" end="01:10:53.030" style="s2">make within that that&#39;s interpenetrating</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.500" end="01:10:54.980" style="s2">with the deep understanding without and</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.030" end="01:10:55.580" style="s2">it was two sort of playing off against</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.980" end="01:10:59.239" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.580" end="01:11:02.270" style="s2">uh-huh for me so you sort of play around</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.239" end="01:11:04.969" style="s2">with yeah different ways in which you</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.270" end="01:11:07.760" style="s2">sort of reconfigure yourself and and</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.969" end="01:11:09.409" style="s2">then when you get for me when you get</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.760" end="01:11:11.449" style="s2">that sort of phenomenon logical sense</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.409" end="01:11:15.050" style="s2">that oh wow there&#39;s the inner alignment</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.449" end="01:11:18.409" style="s2">and he or she seems to be now glowing</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.050" end="01:11:20.929" style="s2">right and there&#39;s a and then then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.409" end="01:11:22.550" style="s2">how and then when you start to do is you</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.929" end="01:11:25.099" style="s2">start to tack on that you start to get</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.550" end="01:11:26.659" style="s2">the sense of okay keep finding that okay</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.099" end="01:11:28.670" style="s2">how do I get back now I can go over to</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.659" end="01:11:29.370" style="s2">here oh that&#39;s too far that&#39;s breaking</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.670" end="01:11:30.930" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.370" end="01:11:33.090" style="s2">you get back and you get like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.930" end="01:11:35.520" style="s2">almost like like like a martial art</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.090" end="01:11:37.770" style="s2">you&#39;re getting like how what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.520" end="01:11:40.260" style="s2">what&#39;s the space in which I can move</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.770" end="01:11:41.990" style="s2">around with this person and maintain</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.260" end="01:11:48.120" style="s2">that vertical horizontal integration</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.990" end="01:11:54.420" style="s2">right got that just that just to think</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.120" end="01:11:55.890" style="s2">about just that just that sense like in</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.420" end="01:11:57.660" style="s2">some way we&#39;re doing that without even</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.890" end="01:12:00.810" style="s2">having to know that we&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.660" end="01:12:03.150" style="s2">right I don&#39;t think we can do it totally</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.810" end="01:12:05.040" style="s2">in a knowing fashion I think it</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.150" end="01:12:08.280" style="s2">permeates and impregnates our capacity</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.040" end="01:12:10.050" style="s2">for knowing yeah yeah this is part of</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.280" end="01:12:12.390" style="s2">what Plato is trying to articulate with</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.050" end="01:12:13.860" style="s2">the mythos of recollection but if you if</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.390" end="01:12:17.700" style="s2">you don&#39;t have if you don&#39;t have this</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.860" end="01:12:20.340" style="s2">already already operating easier then</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.700" end="01:12:22.980" style="s2">you can&#39;t recognize it you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.340" end="01:12:25.530" style="s2">recognize it&#39;s so interesting because I</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.980" end="01:12:26.280" style="s2">think about that sometimes with um you</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.530" end="01:12:29.130" style="s2">know with</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.280" end="01:12:32.220" style="s2">doing these because we just when we just</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.130" end="01:12:34.710" style="s2">started off doing circling we would we</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.220" end="01:12:37.170" style="s2">would do these three day two to three</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.710" end="01:12:41.340" style="s2">day courses every every couple of months</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.170" end="01:12:43.830" style="s2">or so and and then when I started</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.340" end="01:12:50.760" style="s2">training people right inside of like a</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.830" end="01:12:53.040" style="s2">year-long container that was we that was</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.760" end="01:12:55.050" style="s2">like that was a totally it&#39;s not and</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.040" end="01:12:59.040" style="s2">it&#39;s it goes beyond what&#39;s the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.050" end="01:13:02.900" style="s2">we had more time together yeah there is</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.040" end="01:13:05.780" style="s2">something that goes on that seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.900" end="01:13:10.950" style="s2">more of the it seems to be more</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.780" end="01:13:12.780" style="s2">developmental right whereas the weekends</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.950" end="01:13:14.940" style="s2">a weekend course you can you can witness</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.780" end="01:13:18.000" style="s2">like transformation you can witness</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.940" end="01:13:24.710" style="s2">people have a deep perspective shift</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.000" end="01:13:27.900" style="s2">right however in the year-long</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.710" end="01:13:29.520" style="s2">there&#39;s something about I haven&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.900" end="01:13:32.790" style="s2">about that there&#39;s some teacher there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.520" end="01:13:36.240" style="s2">a teacher that&#39;sthat&#39;s that that no one</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.790" end="01:13:38.220" style="s2">is anonymous through the whole thing we</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.240" end="01:13:40.440" style="s2">talked about this explicitly like a Tai</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.220" end="01:13:42.840" style="s2">Chi Chuan I tell people that you you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.440" end="01:13:44.250" style="s2">have an external teacher me yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.840" end="01:13:46.410" style="s2">that will help to give birth to the</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.250" end="01:13:49.140" style="s2">internal teacher that eventually will</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.410" end="01:13:52.230" style="s2">make me up sleep yeah that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.140" end="01:13:55.200" style="s2">and of course you you it&#39;s again this</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.230" end="01:13:57.870" style="s2">this weird paradox of self creation you</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.200" end="01:13:59.430" style="s2">you can&#39;t make the teacher right but you</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.870" end="01:14:02.490" style="s2">can&#39;t just receive the teacher either</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.430" end="01:14:06.330" style="s2">yeah kind of what a kind of one of those</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.490" end="01:14:08.520" style="s2">will work again yeah I think part of it</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.330" end="01:14:12.120" style="s2">like I have a similar experience when I</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.520" end="01:14:15.810" style="s2">get to teach people over years and part</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.120" end="01:14:18.210" style="s2">of it is if you&#39;ve if you&#39;ve entered</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.810" end="01:14:20.430" style="s2">into a more academically appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.210" end="01:14:23.190" style="s2">kind of intimacy with them I want to use</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.430" end="01:14:27.060" style="s2">my words carefully here right but if you</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.190" end="01:14:29.220" style="s2">do that what what happens is I think you</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.060" end="01:14:30.680" style="s2">get what we&#39;ve been talking about you</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.220" end="01:14:33.450" style="s2">don&#39;t just witness their transfer their</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.680" end="01:14:36.420" style="s2">transformation permeates into you and</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.450" end="01:14:39.480" style="s2">you the way you know yourself is being</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.420" end="01:14:41.880" style="s2">changed in the way your knowing them and</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.480" end="01:14:43.230" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s part of that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.880" end="01:14:47.970" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the difference there</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.230" end="01:14:49.920" style="s2">right yeah so it&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.970" end="01:14:52.230" style="s2">certain sense there&#39;s a way where I</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.920" end="01:14:54.750" style="s2">often to think about that like in some</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.230" end="01:14:56.010" style="s2">ways you know the content of what like</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.750" end="01:14:57.930" style="s2">will be up there teaching something</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.010" end="01:15:00.030" style="s2">let&#39;s say right so on one level like</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.930" end="01:15:02.460" style="s2">what we&#39;re teaching is they&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.030" end="01:15:06.150" style="s2">it right frontal yeah but there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.460" end="01:15:08.820" style="s2">other way in which the way that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.150" end="01:15:16.410" style="s2">sitting like the distance between each</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.820" end="01:15:18.810" style="s2">other the the the the the values that</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.410" end="01:15:21.780" style="s2">even have it buddy like come together</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.810" end="01:15:25.350" style="s2">like that that somehow organize in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.780" end="01:15:27.450" style="s2">background right doing did that</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.350" end="01:15:29.280" style="s2">participative deep participation with</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.450" end="01:15:34.980" style="s2">each other and all these ways that are</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.280" end="01:15:37.560" style="s2">like that are autopoietic itself right</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.980" end="01:15:39.360" style="s2">in that way it&#39;s the same kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.560" end="01:15:42.300" style="s2">it&#39;s like you walk out with a with an</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.360" end="01:15:45.330" style="s2">accent but you didn&#39;t yes yes yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.300" end="01:15:48.050" style="s2">well put I like that metaphor that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.330" end="01:15:51.780" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.050" end="01:15:53.100" style="s2">or a bit of a dialect even huh but</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.780" end="01:15:55.310" style="s2">there&#39;s some thing I&#39;ve lived between</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.100" end="01:15:57.500" style="s2">dialect and dialectical here but</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.310" end="01:16:00.230" style="s2">but yeah there&#39;s yeah you definitely</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.500" end="01:16:02.590" style="s2">have that that&#39;s a good way of putting</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.230" end="01:16:02.590" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.980" end="01:16:08.060" style="s2">it&#39;s I mean part of it is human beings</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.960" end="01:16:10.700" style="s2">are terrific you let me there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.060" end="01:16:12.320" style="s2">something about making their - oh I</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.700" end="01:16:14.840" style="s2">think there&#39;s I mean cuz there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.320" end="01:16:16.310" style="s2">imitation right there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.840" end="01:16:20.090" style="s2">reciprocal imitation there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.310" end="01:16:22.310" style="s2">reciprocal internalization going on and</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.090" end="01:16:24.170" style="s2">and then when we internalize somebody we</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.310" end="01:16:25.580" style="s2">inhabit our mind and body differently so</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.170" end="01:16:28.820" style="s2">that we inhabit the world differently</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.580" end="01:16:33.170" style="s2">and there&#39;s all that habitus want us</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.820" end="01:16:34.370" style="s2">change and so and then of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.170" end="01:16:36.500" style="s2">also the issue that you know human</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.370" end="01:16:38.450" style="s2">beings are terrifically complex right</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.500" end="01:16:41.150" style="s2">and when systems are very complex it</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.450" end="01:16:42.980" style="s2">takes a lot of time right in many</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.150" end="01:16:45.350" style="s2">dimensions before you can get at the</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.980" end="01:16:46.970" style="s2">deeper more hidden variables behind what</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.350" end="01:16:50.330" style="s2">they&#39;re doing that just takes a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.970" end="01:16:51.770" style="s2">time right I think about like if you</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.330" end="01:16:54.290" style="s2">were trying to figure out how a jungle</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.770" end="01:16:57.790" style="s2">was operating okay like if you spent the</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.290" end="01:16:59.750" style="s2">weekend with the jungle how are you</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.790" end="01:17:00.740" style="s2">you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve got to walk through</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.750" end="01:17:02.150" style="s2">the jungle and you&#39;ve got to go to</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.740" end="01:17:04.790" style="s2">different places in the jungle you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.150" end="01:17:07.940" style="s2">got to move around it like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.790" end="01:17:10.280" style="s2">getting that the diversity and the</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.940" end="01:17:12.050" style="s2">amount of data you need in order to get</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.280" end="01:17:15.380" style="s2">at the deeper variables that just takes</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.050" end="01:17:19.610" style="s2">up a lot of time and a lot of difference</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.380" end="01:17:22.280" style="s2">totally totally and then in that and</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.610" end="01:17:24.050" style="s2">that&#39;s why I&#39;m kind of like the the like</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.280" end="01:17:26.240" style="s2">that&#39;s why I don&#39;t think I can I can</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.050" end="01:17:28.580" style="s2">really I mean I still do some weekend</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.240" end="01:17:31.420" style="s2">courses and stuff right but but the ones</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.580" end="01:17:34.880" style="s2">that are just so satisfying are those</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.420" end="01:17:37.520" style="s2">watching somebody through a year right</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.880" end="01:17:40.130" style="s2">no I think I think it&#39;s right what what</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.520" end="01:17:42.890" style="s2">seems to be what seems to I where I</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.130" end="01:17:44.180" style="s2">first noticed that difference right was</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.890" end="01:17:45.830" style="s2">I think it I think it may have something</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.180" end="01:17:50.180" style="s2">to different do with that difference</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.830" end="01:17:53.320" style="s2">between transformation and development</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.180" end="01:17:53.320" style="s2">raising like</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.689" end="01:17:58.679" style="s2">I was sitting I think it was the last</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.760" end="01:18:00.479" style="s2">course of what the first year that I was</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.679" end="01:18:02.280" style="s2">doing this and I was sitting up on it</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.479" end="01:18:05.070" style="s2">was like getting aloft kind of space and</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.280" end="01:18:08.130" style="s2">they&#39;re in we&#39;re on a break and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.070" end="01:18:10.199" style="s2">sitting relaxing on the stairwell and</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.130" end="01:18:13.380" style="s2">I&#39;m just kind of just watching people</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.199" end="01:18:16.050" style="s2">just intermingle yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.380" end="01:18:19.559" style="s2">interesting because I just started to</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.050" end="01:18:21.780" style="s2">tune into how like somebody and how they</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.559" end="01:18:23.880" style="s2">were just responding to somebody else</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.780" end="01:18:25.530" style="s2">right and just kind of just watching the</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.880" end="01:18:28.289" style="s2">way that they all their micro movements</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.530" end="01:18:30.360" style="s2">and their pre sponses like their</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.289" end="01:18:33.449" style="s2">immediate their immediacy how they were</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.360" end="01:18:34.979" style="s2">in the immediate sense and I started</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.449" end="01:18:37.860" style="s2">thinking about like well what what did</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.979" end="01:18:41.729" style="s2">they come here for right and in so many</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.860" end="01:18:44.969" style="s2">cases I was like oh my god like they did</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.729" end="01:18:49.409" style="s2">not only if they did not only a big not</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.969" end="01:18:51.090" style="s2">gotten what they came for but they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.409" end="01:18:53.719" style="s2">gotten it in such a way that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.090" end="01:18:56.820" style="s2">even notice that they&#39;re responding</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.719" end="01:18:59.189" style="s2">completely differently right right okay</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.820" end="01:19:01.590" style="s2">make it like they can recognize it if</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.189" end="01:19:03.389" style="s2">you point it out and then it can see it</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.590" end="01:19:06.809" style="s2">but I could I could tell in the pre</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.389" end="01:19:09.119" style="s2">reflective immediate sense of how they</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.809" end="01:19:11.309" style="s2">showed up for them over that period of</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.119" end="01:19:14.659" style="s2">time and I was like I have a feeling</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.309" end="01:19:20.070" style="s2">that something like development it is</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.659" end="01:19:22.260" style="s2">and I think well I think it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.070" end="01:19:24.539" style="s2">know how do you develop a taste in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.260" end="01:19:26.400" style="s2">old sense of the word like the taste for</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.539" end="01:19:30.289" style="s2">classical music we talked about this the</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.400" end="01:19:37.229" style="s2">three senses of appreciation yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.289" end="01:19:38.880" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s how that works is well I</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.229" end="01:19:42.659" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s one of the central</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.880" end="01:19:46.800" style="s2">issues for both development and and and</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.659" end="01:19:52.230" style="s2">trying to understand aspiration what</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.800" end="01:19:54.870" style="s2">like it&#39;s intriguing how people</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.230" end="01:19:56.910" style="s2">like how they exist it&#39;s like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.870" end="01:19:59.510" style="s2">what narrative does it how we we become</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.910" end="01:20:01.920" style="s2">temporally extended agents right</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.510" end="01:20:04.020" style="s2">aspiration does something similar but</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.920" end="01:20:05.910" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s not temporally extended I</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.020" end="01:20:08.280" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the what the dimension</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.910" end="01:20:11.490" style="s2">is but we what&#39;s intriguing to me is how</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.280" end="01:20:12.560" style="s2">people extend their identity into what</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.490" end="01:20:16.200" style="s2">they&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.560" end="01:20:18.960" style="s2">right because of course there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.200" end="01:20:21.150" style="s2">times when change is forced upon us and</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.960" end="01:20:24.060" style="s2">we don&#39;t extend our identity into that</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.150" end="01:20:25.770" style="s2">we get an illness and oh right like I</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.060" end="01:20:28.020" style="s2">don&#39;t identify with my illness or</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.770" end="01:20:32.130" style="s2">something like that but like how do</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.020" end="01:20:34.350" style="s2">people do this is it like they try to</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.130" end="01:20:36.630" style="s2">get a stigma I have to do the cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.350" end="01:20:38.580" style="s2">scientists like what would I do I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.630" end="01:20:40.710" style="s2">gonna get a machine to go through self</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.580" end="01:20:43.350" style="s2">transcendence and do this weird thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.710" end="01:20:46.050" style="s2">where it established a non-logical</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.350" end="01:20:49.350" style="s2">identity between its current self and</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.050" end="01:20:52.200" style="s2">the self that had transcended that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.350" end="01:20:54.300" style="s2">that it could say it could say with</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.200" end="01:20:57.420" style="s2">conviction I have gone through</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.300" end="01:21:01.020" style="s2">development I have developed and</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.420" end="01:21:03.330" style="s2">transcended my preview I was before yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.020" end="01:21:07.020" style="s2">in that rather than experience it as</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.330" end="01:21:08.730" style="s2">some logical chaos they like narrative</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.020" end="01:21:11.580" style="s2">allows us to do that again in ways that</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.730" end="01:21:12.780" style="s2">are kind of still obscure like the way</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.580" end="01:21:14.520" style="s2">we can point to a picture of a</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.780" end="01:21:16.980" style="s2">one-year-old and say there I am like</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.520" end="01:21:18.660" style="s2">which is just a bizarre thing and we</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.980" end="01:21:20.310" style="s2">take it a second nature because of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.660" end="01:21:22.320" style="s2">way we practice with narrative so much</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.310" end="01:21:26.040" style="s2">and I think there&#39;s something similar to</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.320" end="01:21:27.990" style="s2">aspiration the way when people are going</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.040" end="01:21:31.200" style="s2">through this process and they become</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.990" end="01:21:33.390" style="s2">like it&#39;s like that person is right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.200" end="01:21:37.020" style="s2">not only that she or he or she is prema</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.390" end="01:21:39.660" style="s2">is it a pre reflective state but I would</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.020" end="01:21:41.880" style="s2">say right their identity is already</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.660" end="01:21:46.950" style="s2">growing beyond their self authorship</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.880" end="01:21:51.230" style="s2">yeah yeah and that&#39;s the process on</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.950" end="01:21:55.350" style="s2">their self yes that&#39;s what really really</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.230" end="01:21:57.840" style="s2">intrigues me it reminds me of what court</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.350" end="01:22:00.060" style="s2">talks about temptation I mean the</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.840" end="01:22:02.670" style="s2">symbolism of evil he says we feel like</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.060" end="01:22:04.440" style="s2">we&#39;re being tempted by something other</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.670" end="01:22:05.760" style="s2">than ourselves but this goes back to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.440" end="01:22:07.110" style="s2">kirko Guardian thing but</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.760" end="01:22:09.389" style="s2">once we give it to the temptation we</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.110" end="01:22:12.329" style="s2">feel that we tempted ourselves like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.389" end="01:22:14.760" style="s2">this weird there&#39;s this weird non like</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.329" end="01:22:18.480" style="s2">there&#39;s right and somehow our identity</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.760" end="01:22:21.000" style="s2">extends in ways outside of our it you</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.480" end="01:22:24.690" style="s2">know our ego self authoring in this</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.000" end="01:22:26.550" style="s2">really interesting way and because what</p>

<p begin="01:22:26.550" end="01:22:30.630" style="s2">was extending identity and internalizing</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.530" end="01:22:32.699" style="s2">not in any way that was being done</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.630" end="01:22:35.010" style="s2">deliberatively or like I say in a self</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.699" end="01:22:38.219" style="s2">authoring fashion but her identity is</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.010" end="01:22:42.480" style="s2">absorbing and extending and then she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.219" end="01:22:44.880" style="s2">gonna discover right how her identity or</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.480" end="01:22:48.570" style="s2">I think it was you said it was her you</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.880" end="01:22:55.679" style="s2">know grew but what does that mean you</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.570" end="01:22:58.829" style="s2">know that&#39;s like I know it&#39;s like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.679" end="01:23:01.139" style="s2">chills or something yeah yeah and how</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.829" end="01:23:03.920" style="s2">does it wait what&#39;s being like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.139" end="01:23:06.750" style="s2">what is the intelligibility that that</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.920" end="01:23:09.719" style="s2">self-organized itself in that way like</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.750" end="01:23:12.420" style="s2">yes yes there&#39;s something so much about</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.719" end="01:23:14.760" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s like the way art the</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.420" end="01:23:20.789" style="s2">machinery how would a possible with the</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.760" end="01:23:23.280" style="s2">machinery it&#39;s just it&#39;s like there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.789" end="01:23:25.050" style="s2">much I mean that&#39;s what I spent so much</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.280" end="01:23:27.630" style="s2">time trying to unpack as much of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.050" end="01:23:30.300" style="s2">machinery as I could in the series to</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.630" end="01:23:31.860" style="s2">try and give us as many but and I never</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.300" end="01:23:35.130" style="s2">have made claims of it being sort of</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.860" end="01:23:37.349" style="s2">exhaustive or anything like just because</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.130" end="01:23:41.929" style="s2">it&#39;s I think we need all the tools we</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.349" end="01:23:46.650" style="s2">can bring to bear yeah that issue that</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.929" end="01:23:50.429" style="s2">the quiet I mean the question the the</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.650" end="01:23:54.570" style="s2">question that that it verges on a</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.429" end="01:23:56.789" style="s2">mystery of what&#39;s actually a forwarding</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.570" end="01:23:58.349" style="s2">that&#39;s going on and what&#39;s affording on</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.789" end="01:24:00.449" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in self transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.349" end="01:24:02.610" style="s2">the selfs transcendence is so essential</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.449" end="01:24:05.940" style="s2">to overcoming self-deception and so</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.610" end="01:24:08.610" style="s2">essential to mattering right and right</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.940" end="01:24:10.500" style="s2">like that that&#39;s all that has always</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.610" end="01:24:13.019" style="s2">deeply intrigued me right from the very</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.500" end="01:24:15.420" style="s2">beginning when I was reading Plato and</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.019" end="01:24:17.739" style="s2">Nietzsche in first-year University a</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.420" end="01:24:20.019" style="s2">long time ago in a galaxy far far away</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.739" end="01:24:24.189" style="s2">I think that I was like that that issue</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.019" end="01:24:28.119" style="s2">is always always like it&#39;s like has like</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.189" end="01:24:31.809" style="s2">oh I feel I hope that I&#39;ve helped to</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.119" end="01:24:37.809" style="s2">elucidate that issue a lot I hope but I</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.809" end="01:24:41.320" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t feel that I well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.809" end="01:24:45.780" style="s2">no way in which I it&#39;s comprehensive or</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.320" end="01:24:52.059" style="s2">complete or anything like that but that</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.780" end="01:24:54.699" style="s2">a capacity for like I can say that we</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.059" end="01:24:57.059" style="s2">reach beyond ourselves but we don&#39;t to</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.699" end="01:24:59.470" style="s2">call ourselves but we don&#39;t to become</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.059" end="01:25:04.780" style="s2">ourselves who we weren&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.470" end="01:25:07.869" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.780" end="01:25:12.489" style="s2">totally and that there&#39;s a quality of</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.869" end="01:25:15.570" style="s2">there&#39;s an element of that we kind of</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.489" end="01:25:17.320" style="s2">arrive here with the with that going on</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.570" end="01:25:21.659" style="s2">yes yes</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.320" end="01:25:24.579" style="s2">like the intelligence the intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.659" end="01:25:27.489" style="s2">pressed in that it&#39;s just so it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.579" end="01:25:33.309" style="s2">it it&#39;s so wondrous and so mysterious it</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.489" end="01:25:35.139" style="s2">almost hurts yes so part of it part of</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.309" end="01:25:37.539" style="s2">the I really guy I just want to say I</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.139" end="01:25:39.130" style="s2">just really felt like there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.539" end="01:25:40.539" style="s2">moment there&#39;s a moment right there</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.130" end="01:25:44.469" style="s2">where I just thought were you just like</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.539" end="01:25:47.139" style="s2">what is this I felt like in the center</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.469" end="01:25:54.329" style="s2">of life like like why we do anything at</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.139" end="01:25:57.519" style="s2">all like well that the core yeah what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.329" end="01:25:59.139" style="s2">adalah is what it felt like to me sorry</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.519" end="01:26:01.719" style="s2">I didn&#39;t hear it just felt like it was</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.139" end="01:26:03.639" style="s2">like at the set it was it that mystery</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.719" end="01:26:05.969" style="s2">is like it that in the wonderment that</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.639" end="01:26:08.409" style="s2">it evokes right yes very much</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.969" end="01:26:12.880" style="s2">like why we&#39;re doing any of this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.409" end="01:26:14.559" style="s2">right and somewhat and I think we talked</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.880" end="01:26:16.150" style="s2">about this and I don&#39;t know was you and</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.559" end="01:26:23.409" style="s2">I individually or when we were in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.150" end="01:26:26.260" style="s2">four-way discussion the how to how to</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.409" end="01:26:28.570" style="s2">elucidate that scientifically while</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.260" end="01:26:31.330" style="s2">maintaining a proper existential</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.570" end="01:26:34.120" style="s2">reverence towards it that&#39;s not a doctor</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.330" end="01:26:36.630" style="s2">it&#39;s a really challenge big thing for me</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.120" end="01:26:43.060" style="s2">I step back and think about that</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.630" end="01:26:44.920" style="s2">periodically so you know something it</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.060" end="01:26:47.410" style="s2">has to do with focal a lot to do with</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.920" end="01:26:49.600" style="s2">like this sense of going back and forth</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.410" end="01:26:51.700" style="s2">between the theory and the theory for</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.600" end="01:26:55.270" style="s2">sure there&#39;s definitely and and and and</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.700" end="01:26:58.960" style="s2">the the talika noted the notion for</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.270" end="01:27:02.290" style="s2">Tillich of the todas detention detention</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.960" end="01:27:04.590" style="s2">that is never resolvable and so the</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.290" end="01:27:08.970" style="s2">point of processing is always always</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.590" end="01:27:11.530" style="s2">needed i think i think that&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.970" end="01:27:12.670" style="s2">but like for example like part of what</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.530" end="01:27:15.040" style="s2">you know part of what i&#39;ve tried to do</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.670" end="01:27:16.930" style="s2">is you you know well you can understand</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.040" end="01:27:18.490" style="s2">self transcendence in terms of a process</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.930" end="01:27:20.260" style="s2">that complexify ours if when it</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.490" end="01:27:22.120" style="s2">complexify as it gets emergent functions</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.260" end="01:27:24.370" style="s2">and those emergent functions exhaust</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.120" end="01:27:26.290" style="s2">existing machinery and all of that sort</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.370" end="01:27:29.290" style="s2">of takes a little bit of the mystery</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.290" end="01:27:32.170" style="s2">away in one sense but on the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.290" end="01:27:35.230" style="s2">right it shouldn&#39;t it should be well no</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.170" end="01:27:38.980" style="s2">no because you should still see like</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.230" end="01:27:41.590" style="s2">well what is like your commitment to a</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.980" end="01:27:44.110" style="s2">way of talking and being and thinking</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.590" end="01:27:45.940" style="s2">that afford such emergence is still a</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.110" end="01:27:47.980" style="s2">task that falls onto you</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.940" end="01:27:52.390" style="s2">right and that&#39;s important to me because</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.980" end="01:27:54.430" style="s2">you see you see this as kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.390" end="01:27:56.320" style="s2">what i&#39;m seeing what&#39;s going on in rebel</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.430" end="01:27:58.060" style="s2">wisdom and and and and on a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.320" end="01:28:02.020" style="s2">dialogue there&#39;s this constant</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.060" end="01:28:07.050" style="s2">indication of like of being open to</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.020" end="01:28:10.180" style="s2">emergence right and and that&#39;s the so</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.050" end="01:28:13.420" style="s2">having done that that theorizing i just</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.180" end="01:28:15.550" style="s2">did with you does not remove yes but</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.420" end="01:28:16.690" style="s2">what what&#39;s what&#39;s the existential</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.550" end="01:28:19.600" style="s2">responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.690" end="01:28:22.630" style="s2">what&#39;s the reverential attitude i need</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.600" end="01:28:25.930" style="s2">to bring into existence so that i can</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.630" end="01:28:27.730" style="s2">yes properly open and affording of that</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.930" end="01:28:30.280" style="s2">emergency that&#39;s what I mean about</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.730" end="01:28:30.820" style="s2">trying to get the two to talk to each</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.280" end="01:28:34.000" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.820" end="01:28:36.160" style="s2">appropriately because it seems I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.000" end="01:28:37.990" style="s2">know that the last time you and I had</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.160" end="01:28:40.120" style="s2">talked we were talking a lot about that</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.990" end="01:28:43.480" style="s2">like the proper place for propositional</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.120" end="01:28:44.800" style="s2">knowing yes I kind of felt like this I</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.480" end="01:28:47.020" style="s2">have exist this sense</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.800" end="01:28:52.329" style="s2">well like I guess a really good</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.020" end="01:28:55.360" style="s2">proposition is it allows you to UM to to</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.329" end="01:28:57.309" style="s2">have it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s correct to the</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.360" end="01:28:59.770" style="s2">degree that it has what you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.309" end="01:29:03.280" style="s2">at to be like render more of its mystery</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.770" end="01:29:05.530" style="s2">right that it&#39;s mysteriousness right and</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.280" end="01:29:07.389" style="s2">it&#39;s made it like that I think that you</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.530" end="01:29:08.500" style="s2">had talked about what point you talked</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.389" end="01:29:10.840" style="s2">about like oh that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.500" end="01:29:15.639" style="s2">it&#39;s a deeper pragmatism that&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.840" end="01:29:18.940" style="s2">that that yeah James yeah I think so I</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.639" end="01:29:21.070" style="s2">think that&#39;s what James was on about I I</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.940" end="01:29:22.750" style="s2">think that you know James is struggling</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.070" end="01:29:25.980" style="s2">because he I think his notion of</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.750" end="01:29:30.130" style="s2">usefulness is basically something like</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.980" end="01:29:33.610" style="s2">relevance and and then he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.130" end="01:29:35.440" style="s2">get viability around that and then and</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.610" end="01:29:37.510" style="s2">he tends to sometimes think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.440" end="01:29:41.349" style="s2">the same as truth and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.510" end="01:29:43.059" style="s2">that&#39;s quite right because viability has</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.349" end="01:29:44.860" style="s2">a sense that there&#39;s something beyond</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.059" end="01:29:47.530" style="s2">your desires and needs that you have to</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.860" end="01:29:49.239" style="s2">be responsible to and you know and the</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.530" end="01:29:52.059" style="s2">pragmatist need to see a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.239" end="01:29:53.770" style="s2">what why is something not viable yeah</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.059" end="01:29:55.929" style="s2">like if you want it why is it not viable</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.770" end="01:29:58.119" style="s2">to you something else is at work that</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.929" end="01:30:02.409" style="s2">you are holding to and responsible too</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.119" end="01:30:02.860" style="s2">right yeah so yeah but I do like that</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.409" end="01:30:09.059" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.860" end="01:30:12.280" style="s2">about how a proposition like part of</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.059" end="01:30:13.480" style="s2">part of a prop I mean it depends whether</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.280" end="01:30:14.409" style="s2">or not we&#39;re making the knowledge planes</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.480" end="01:30:15.670" style="s2">that we&#39;re trying to afford</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.409" end="01:30:16.840" style="s2">understanding with our propositions</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.670" end="01:30:19.540" style="s2">because we do different things with them</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.840" end="01:30:21.130" style="s2">right but unless state insofar as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.540" end="01:30:22.630" style="s2">trying to do understanding and that</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.130" end="01:30:26.889" style="s2">links up with the hermeneutics right</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.630" end="01:30:29.469" style="s2">well then you know the proposition isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.889" end="01:30:31.270" style="s2">just in its semantic content its how</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.469" end="01:30:34.780" style="s2">when you drop it into the pragmatic</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.270" end="01:30:37.090" style="s2">sphere it right out of all of its</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.780" end="01:30:38.949" style="s2">potential implications some are deemed</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.090" end="01:30:42.130" style="s2">significant or relevant and in you grasp</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.949" end="01:30:48.639" style="s2">yeah the relevant implications right and</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.130" end="01:30:52.280" style="s2">right and presumably if the person has</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.639" end="01:30:55.610" style="s2">some wisdom in their knowledge pursuit</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.280" end="01:30:57.710" style="s2">that&#39;s going to shift away around a way</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.610" end="01:31:00.080" style="s2">that we just talked about James&#39;s notion</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.710" end="01:31:01.460" style="s2">of viability which implications are</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.080" end="01:31:03.740" style="s2">going to be viable and that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.460" end="01:31:06.260" style="s2">be some sensitivity to your existential</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.740" end="01:31:10.580" style="s2">mode and the way in which you are</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.260" end="01:31:12.440" style="s2">coupled to the world yeah yeah so I</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.580" end="01:31:15.860" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that&#39;s helping but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.440" end="01:31:19.910" style="s2">thinking the idea that again the degree</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.860" end="01:31:21.260" style="s2">to which a proposition discloses couples</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.910" end="01:31:23.300" style="s2">you to the world in a way that leads you</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.260" end="01:31:25.160" style="s2">deeper into it more ontological depth</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.300" end="01:31:26.740" style="s2">perception but I think it&#39;s bound up</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.160" end="01:31:30.230" style="s2">with again this idea about how the</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.740" end="01:31:31.910" style="s2">propositional aligns in its grounding</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.230" end="01:31:34.580" style="s2">procedural knowing which aligns and</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.910" end="01:31:36.410" style="s2">grant or grounds in its aligns to its</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.580" end="01:31:37.760" style="s2">grounding perspectival knowing which</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.410" end="01:31:43.210" style="s2">then Alliance and grounds in its</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.760" end="01:31:48.830" style="s2">participatory not knowing and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.210" end="01:31:52.070" style="s2">yeah that that&#39;s how I cuz I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.830" end="01:31:54.620" style="s2">remember saying this in my ha I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.070" end="01:31:56.930" style="s2">dialogue I had with harm zone that you</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.620" end="01:32:00.020" style="s2">know you really truth is only grass ball</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.930" end="01:32:04.340" style="s2">in transcendence if we don&#39;t take truth</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.020" end="01:32:06.920" style="s2">as a property in propositions but as an</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.340" end="01:32:09.320" style="s2">event heidi areum said right it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.920" end="01:32:12.020" style="s2">in the overcoming of self-deception or a</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.320" end="01:32:14.150" style="s2">limitation that you can realize that you</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.020" end="01:32:17.150" style="s2">were deceived or limited it&#39;s only in</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.150" end="01:32:18.980" style="s2">the transcendence that you know right so</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.150" end="01:32:20.900" style="s2">the truth is never a place you laying</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.980" end="01:32:25.490" style="s2">and it&#39;s always something you see in</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.900" end="01:32:27.950" style="s2">transit right yeah and so if a</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.490" end="01:32:32.380" style="s2">proposition is affording that transit</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.950" end="01:32:35.210" style="s2">both within and between I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.380" end="01:32:38.000" style="s2">totally and it&#39;s something about like I</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.210" end="01:32:42.050" style="s2">just I I&#39;m imagining - it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.000" end="01:32:44.060" style="s2">culture it&#39;s like the it&#39;s like the the</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.050" end="01:32:46.610" style="s2">community ah right like the community</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.060" end="01:32:50.000" style="s2">very much very much like what is like</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.610" end="01:32:54.010" style="s2">what is the community is it are are</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.000" end="01:32:56.600" style="s2">people relating to each other in</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.010" end="01:32:58.760" style="s2">cultivating a sense of wonderment right</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.600" end="01:33:00.410" style="s2">about what they&#39;re doing so like when</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.760" end="01:33:02.870" style="s2">you go like if you&#39;re a scientist and</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.410" end="01:33:05.870" style="s2">you like you go on lunch like like are</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.870" end="01:33:08.720" style="s2">we like are we just doing for</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.870" end="01:33:10.310" style="s2">or are we no no never never that was</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.720" end="01:33:13.190" style="s2">Pilates point that&#39;s right it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.310" end="01:33:14.930" style="s2">personal not theoretical knowledge is</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.190" end="01:33:17.180" style="s2">always situated within the personal</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.930" end="01:33:20.000" style="s2">knowledge yeah it just seems to me that</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.180" end="01:33:22.700" style="s2">that so gets a vote well gets evokes in</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.000" end="01:33:25.790" style="s2">a lot of places but like it can really</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.700" end="01:33:26.870" style="s2">be a vocht in relationship right oh very</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.790" end="01:33:28.730" style="s2">much I think so</p>
