<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:05.520" style="s2">so hi my name is Joe brewer and in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.480" end="00:00:08.550" style="s2">presentation I want to share with you a</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.520" end="00:00:11.040" style="s2">powerful framework that can be used to</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.550" end="00:00:13.769" style="s2">help think about large scale social</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.040" end="00:00:15.960" style="s2">change efforts and that is the framework</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.769" end="00:00:18.449" style="s2">of cultural scaffolding and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.960" end="00:00:21.119" style="s2">to discuss this in the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.449" end="00:00:23.760" style="s2">efforts that are needed to make the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.119" end="00:00:25.949" style="s2">transition to global sustainability now</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.760" end="00:00:28.080" style="s2">first off to really get a sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.949" end="00:00:29.730" style="s2">I mean by scaffolding we&#39;re all familiar</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.080" end="00:00:32.640" style="s2">with the use of scaffolding and</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.730" end="00:00:34.620" style="s2">construction where the basic frame of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.640" end="00:00:37.020" style="s2">building isn&#39;t yet able to support</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.620" end="00:00:39.690" style="s2">itself and so the scaffolding is set up</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.020" end="00:00:41.280" style="s2">to help the construction workers to</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.690" end="00:00:43.230" style="s2">build the basic supports that then</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.280" end="00:00:45.539" style="s2">enable the building to stand on its own</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.230" end="00:00:47.700" style="s2">and the scaffolding at that point can be</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.539" end="00:00:49.190" style="s2">removed so you can think of scaffolding</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.700" end="00:00:51.870" style="s2">is something that supports a</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.190" end="00:00:54.480" style="s2">developmental process but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.870" end="00:00:57.690" style="s2">necessarily need to continue to function</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.480" end="00:01:00.030" style="s2">or serve an active role at a later stage</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.690" end="00:01:01.710" style="s2">in the development now when we think</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.030" end="00:01:03.930" style="s2">about this in the context of culture</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.710" end="00:01:06.570" style="s2">it&#39;s really helpful to think of</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.930" end="00:01:07.470" style="s2">scaffolding in the way that we raise</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.570" end="00:01:11.310" style="s2">children</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.470" end="00:01:14.220" style="s2">so just reflect for a moment on how much</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.310" end="00:01:16.200" style="s2">support is needed to take someone from</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.220" end="00:01:18.570" style="s2">being a newborn all the way through</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.200" end="00:01:20.280" style="s2">adolescence where they have a supportive</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.570" end="00:01:23.100" style="s2">environment where there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.280" end="00:01:25.259" style="s2">give them objects to play with that</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.100" end="00:01:27.750" style="s2">teach them basic skills and knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.259" end="00:01:30.930" style="s2">and over time they build on these things</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.750" end="00:01:32.640" style="s2">to be able to develop as a person so in</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.930" end="00:01:35.880" style="s2">the same way that all of the scaffolding</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.640" end="00:01:38.250" style="s2">is provided to raise a child into early</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.880" end="00:01:41.009" style="s2">adulthood we can think about larger</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.250" end="00:01:44.250" style="s2">cultural patterns as building upon a</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.009" end="00:01:48.960" style="s2">number of supports as a process develops</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.250" end="00:01:51.570" style="s2">and changes that are vital to the future</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.960" end="00:01:55.079" style="s2">possibilities or future capabilities</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.570" end="00:01:59.610" style="s2">that that culture is is eventually going</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.079" end="00:02:01.320" style="s2">to have now before we go into cultural</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.610" end="00:02:03.060" style="s2">scaffolding in detail I want to take a</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.320" end="00:02:05.540" style="s2">brief detour into the world of</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.060" end="00:02:09.090" style="s2">thermodynamics and talk about entropy</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.540" end="00:02:12.510" style="s2">now entropy is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.090" end="00:02:16.680" style="s2">of disorder within a system as you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.510" end="00:02:18.870" style="s2">see what these well-organized horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.680" end="00:02:21.150" style="s2">and vertical rows of dots in the left</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.870" end="00:02:23.970" style="s2">the low entropy picture then in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.150" end="00:02:26.190" style="s2">kind of a system that has that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.970" end="00:02:28.050" style="s2">uniformity it doesn&#39;t require very much</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.190" end="00:02:30.989" style="s2">information to describe everything</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.050" end="00:02:33.060" style="s2">that&#39;s going on whereas the same number</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.989" end="00:02:35.310" style="s2">of dots in the right hand picture where</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.060" end="00:02:39.480" style="s2">it says high entropy requires more</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.310" end="00:02:41.220" style="s2">information to to reproduce that pattern</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.480" end="00:02:43.410" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a higher level of</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.220" end="00:02:45.720" style="s2">information that&#39;s involved so sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.410" end="00:02:47.640" style="s2">this is called having more disorder in</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.720" end="00:02:49.500" style="s2">the system but you can also think of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.640" end="00:02:51.600" style="s2">as how much information does it take to</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.500" end="00:02:53.760" style="s2">characterize it now the image on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.600" end="00:02:55.950" style="s2">bottom is a fractal called the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:02:58.709" style="s2">sierpinski triangle and what I want you</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.950" end="00:03:01.290" style="s2">to see is that as as you go through the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.709" end="00:03:03.720" style="s2">steps of removing pieces from a triangle</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.290" end="00:03:06.030" style="s2">in a very specific way the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.720" end="00:03:09.209" style="s2">entropy goes up so there&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.030" end="00:03:11.010" style="s2">thinking about patterns that simply by</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.209" end="00:03:13.590" style="s2">playing out the pattern you can increase</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.010" end="00:03:15.900" style="s2">the amount of disorder or the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.590" end="00:03:18.390" style="s2">structure in a system well we can think</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.900" end="00:03:21.420" style="s2">in the same way about how culture can</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.390" end="00:03:24.209" style="s2">have increasing structure over time as</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.420" end="00:03:26.160" style="s2">its increasing its entropy and the key</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.209" end="00:03:28.709" style="s2">thing is that there&#39;s the second law of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.160" end="00:03:31.680" style="s2">thermodynamics which says that in any</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.709" end="00:03:34.980" style="s2">kind of energy exchange entropy can</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.680" end="00:03:36.859" style="s2">never reduce so this is a physical limit</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.980" end="00:03:41.310" style="s2">on our ability to organize information</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.859" end="00:03:43.230" style="s2">that anytime we do work on a system we</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.310" end="00:03:45.450" style="s2">either keep the amount of information</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.230" end="00:03:47.340" style="s2">the same or we increase it so we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.450" end="00:03:50.250" style="s2">reduce it so that means that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.340" end="00:03:52.859" style="s2">scaffolding process for energy exchanges</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.250" end="00:03:54.660" style="s2">in thermodynamics is always one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.859" end="00:03:57.870" style="s2">leaning toward greater empathy over to</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.660" end="00:03:59.370" style="s2">our greater entropy over time and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.870" end="00:04:01.889" style="s2">simple way to think about this is if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.370" end="00:04:05.519" style="s2">are to take this course this wine glass</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.889" end="00:04:08.160" style="s2">goblet and shatter it as you can see</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.519" end="00:04:11.370" style="s2">that as time goes on as its breaking</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.160" end="00:04:13.440" style="s2">down its energy is being used up as it</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.370" end="00:04:16.410" style="s2">breaks but you would have to do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.440" end="00:04:16.750" style="s2">work and add energy and very specific</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.410" end="00:04:18.910" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.750" end="00:04:20.709" style="s2">is to move these broken pieces back</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.910" end="00:04:24.420" style="s2">together and reproduce the original</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.709" end="00:04:27.370" style="s2">goblet this in thermodynamics is called</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.420" end="00:04:29.920" style="s2">irreversibility and a process where</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.370" end="00:04:32.230" style="s2">entropy increases is also one that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.920" end="00:04:34.090" style="s2">irreversible which means that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.230" end="00:04:36.700" style="s2">spontaneously go back to the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.090" end="00:04:39.450" style="s2">that existed before but instead work has</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.700" end="00:04:41.920" style="s2">to be done and in some cases it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.450" end="00:04:44.260" style="s2">practical terms impossible to do the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.920" end="00:04:46.350" style="s2">work to return to the original state so</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.260" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">you can think of this process of going</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.350" end="00:04:54.040" style="s2">irreversibly from one organization of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:56.169" style="s2">system to some higher level disorder or</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.040" end="00:04:58.780" style="s2">higher entropy state of a system as</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.169" end="00:05:02.650" style="s2">being something that is there reversible</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.780" end="00:05:06.070" style="s2">is that&#39;s a constraint on how patterns</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.650" end="00:05:09.040" style="s2">form in nature in general so when we</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.070" end="00:05:11.470" style="s2">look at something like this mold that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.040" end="00:05:13.450" style="s2">forming in a petri dish you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.470" end="00:05:15.250" style="s2">in the beginning there&#39;s very little</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.450" end="00:05:17.290" style="s2">structure and then as it grows it</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.250" end="00:05:19.930" style="s2">creates new structures as it goes along</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.290" end="00:05:22.260" style="s2">as it&#39;s radiating outward and this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.930" end="00:05:25.110" style="s2">not violating the laws of thermodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.260" end="00:05:27.250" style="s2">actually we can see that the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.110" end="00:05:30.460" style="s2">organizational structure is increasing</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.250" end="00:05:32.740" style="s2">over time but also we can see that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.460" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">patterns that were there before or of</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.740" end="00:05:34.870" style="s2">setting constraints for what can come</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:36.970" style="s2">later</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.870" end="00:05:39.910" style="s2">and this is something we can see really</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.970" end="00:05:42.700" style="s2">well if we look at how a snowflake grows</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.910" end="00:05:45.100" style="s2">so here is an ice crystal or what we</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.700" end="00:05:48.070" style="s2">would call snowflake and a normal</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.100" end="00:05:50.590" style="s2">everyday language you can see how as the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.070" end="00:05:53.140" style="s2">ice crystal is forming that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.590" end="00:05:55.030" style="s2">structures that existed before set</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.140" end="00:05:57.760" style="s2">constraints on what kind of structures</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.030" end="00:06:00.490" style="s2">can emerge later so you can think of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.760" end="00:06:03.160" style="s2">existing structures of this ice crystal</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.490" end="00:06:06.820" style="s2">as being like a scaffolding on which new</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.160" end="00:06:09.130" style="s2">structures grow and in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.820" end="00:06:11.320" style="s2">this ice crystal can only grow in</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.130" end="00:06:14.470" style="s2">certain ways without violating the laws</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.320" end="00:06:17.050" style="s2">of thermodynamics cultural scaffolding</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.470" end="00:06:19.720" style="s2">can only develop in certain ways without</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.050" end="00:06:21.550" style="s2">violating the laws of physics but also</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.720" end="00:06:23.020" style="s2">some of the laws of cultural revolution</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.550" end="00:06:26.229" style="s2">that we&#39;ll discuss a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.020" end="00:06:28.210" style="s2">later on now these constraints on how</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.229" end="00:06:30.699" style="s2">patterns form can be quite complex as</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.210" end="00:06:33.280" style="s2">you can see here with these ma with</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.699" end="00:06:35.889" style="s2">these mushrooms that in living systems</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.280" end="00:06:37.990" style="s2">and biology the constraints on</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.889" end="00:06:39.819" style="s2">development can be quite complex</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.990" end="00:06:41.979" style="s2">so the scaffolding for earlier</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.819" end="00:06:44.409" style="s2">structures in the development of an</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.979" end="00:06:47.379" style="s2">organism&#39;s body can create very</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.409" end="00:06:50.080" style="s2">elaborate structures later on so the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.379" end="00:06:52.090" style="s2">scaffolding process can be destructive</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.080" end="00:06:55.479" style="s2">the way that we saw with the broken wine</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.090" end="00:06:57.430" style="s2">glass or it can be highly generative and</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.479" end="00:07:00.970" style="s2">create very details and intricate</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.430" end="00:07:02.560" style="s2">structures now the way that I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.970" end="00:07:04.500" style="s2">be talking about cultural scaffolding</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.560" end="00:07:07.090" style="s2">for the rest of this presentation is</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.500" end="00:07:09.069" style="s2">informed by this paper written by</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.090" end="00:07:12.960" style="s2">William Wimsatt and James Gray Simha</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.069" end="00:07:16.240" style="s2">where they talk in great detail about</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.960" end="00:07:17.770" style="s2">how an entrenchment process leads to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.240" end="00:07:19.449" style="s2">kinds of scaffolded structures in</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.770" end="00:07:20.979" style="s2">culture so if you want to learn more</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.449" end="00:07:22.870" style="s2">about this then I&#39;m going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.979" end="00:07:25.719" style="s2">here I recommend going and getting a</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.870" end="00:07:28.150" style="s2">copy of this paper so here&#39;s how they</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.719" end="00:07:30.370" style="s2">describe what cultural scaffolding is</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.150" end="00:07:33.370" style="s2">they say that cultural scaffolding is</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.370" end="00:07:35.440" style="s2">the generative interactions between</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.370" end="00:07:37.780" style="s2">actors artifacts practices and</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.440" end="00:07:40.569" style="s2">infrastructure so the culture is able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.780" end="00:07:43.479" style="s2">build upon itself and I&#39;ve clearly here</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.569" end="00:07:45.639" style="s2">an image of a teacher who is teaching a</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.479" end="00:07:47.500" style="s2">student how to do mathematics and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.639" end="00:07:48.639" style="s2">can see that there are two actors in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.500" end="00:07:50.919" style="s2">scene there&#39;s the teacher and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.639" end="00:07:54.039" style="s2">student they&#39;re using artifacts in this</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.919" end="00:07:55.900" style="s2">case the chalk and the blackboard in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.039" end="00:07:57.430" style="s2">classroom that they&#39;re in and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.900" end="00:08:00.550" style="s2">they&#39;re engaging in different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.430" end="00:08:02.889" style="s2">pedagogical practices to teach the child</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.550" end="00:08:05.440" style="s2">how to do mathematics in this case</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.889" end="00:08:06.909" style="s2">learning basic arithmetic and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.440" end="00:08:09.759" style="s2">there&#39;s a larger set of infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.909" end="00:08:12.490" style="s2">in the curriculum of the entire school</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.759" end="00:08:14.380" style="s2">and larger shared knowledge in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.490" end="00:08:16.569" style="s2">culture I&#39;ll say the same language that</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.380" end="00:08:19.300" style="s2">they both speak and the infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.569" end="00:08:21.610" style="s2">of the classroom or the school system so</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.300" end="00:08:24.130" style="s2">the ability to learn something like</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.610" end="00:08:26.680" style="s2">mathematics requires these interactions</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.130" end="00:08:29.169" style="s2">between the actors performing different</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.680" end="00:08:31.690" style="s2">tasks the artifacts that they use the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.169" end="00:08:33.909" style="s2">practices that they&#39;re using to engage</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.690" end="00:08:34.900" style="s2">in activities with the artifacts and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.909" end="00:08:37.510" style="s2">structures</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.900" end="00:08:40.210" style="s2">of their social environment it was in</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.510" end="00:08:42.310" style="s2">the same way we could see how a parent</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.210" end="00:08:44.320" style="s2">was teaching their child how to walk he</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.310" end="00:08:46.480" style="s2">is providing the scaffolding every step</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.320" end="00:08:49.630" style="s2">of the way as the child&#39;s brain and body</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.480" end="00:08:53.170" style="s2">develops or in a more complex setting</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.630" end="00:08:55.180" style="s2">like learning how to do ballet there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.170" end="00:08:57.130" style="s2">a whole set of structured practices</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.180" end="00:08:59.350" style="s2">where the teacher will use different</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.130" end="00:09:01.150" style="s2">artifacts like the bar that&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.350" end="00:09:02.620" style="s2">wall that the students will put their</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.150" end="00:09:05.140" style="s2">feet up on and do stretches and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.620" end="00:09:07.170" style="s2">movements and so there&#39;s quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.140" end="00:09:09.460" style="s2">complexity that can arise between the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.170" end="00:09:11.830" style="s2">generative interactions of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.460" end="00:09:13.930" style="s2">scaffolding and of course in the final</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.830" end="00:09:16.090" style="s2">picture we have two people working in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.930" end="00:09:18.760" style="s2">chemistry lab where you can imagine how</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.090" end="00:09:22.060" style="s2">many years of cultural scaffolding or</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.760" end="00:09:24.220" style="s2">formal education or needed in different</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.060" end="00:09:27.520" style="s2">laboratory settings to learn how to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.220" end="00:09:28.960" style="s2">an active professional chemist so in</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.520" end="00:09:31.450" style="s2">every one of these cases the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.960" end="00:09:34.720" style="s2">scaffolding is quite complex and it can</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.450" end="00:09:37.360" style="s2">last anywhere from weeks through many</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.720" end="00:09:38.250" style="s2">years of development across the person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.360" end="00:09:40.450" style="s2">lifespan</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.250" end="00:09:42.340" style="s2">so now returning to this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.450" end="00:09:44.350" style="s2">cultural scaffolding as a development</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.340" end="00:09:47.110" style="s2">process though we can see really well</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.350" end="00:09:49.690" style="s2">for how children grow up from newborns</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.110" end="00:09:51.400" style="s2">to adults that we can also see things</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.690" end="00:09:53.830" style="s2">like after a certain period of time</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.400" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">there may be scaffolding that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.830" end="00:09:58.420" style="s2">put in place certain structures so that</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:00.940" style="s2">other structures are much more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.420" end="00:10:03.400" style="s2">to learn and a popular example is</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.940" end="00:10:05.080" style="s2">learning languages there&#39;s a well-known</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.400" end="00:10:07.630" style="s2">phenomenon that parts of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.080" end="00:10:10.510" style="s2">develop their capacity to learn language</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.630" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">very well but at a very early age and</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.510" end="00:10:15.250" style="s2">then later in life it takes much more</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.120" end="00:10:17.320" style="s2">effort to learn the language that it</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.250" end="00:10:19.300" style="s2">would have earlier on so we can think of</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.320" end="00:10:21.730" style="s2">there being physical scaffolding in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.300" end="00:10:24.910" style="s2">structures of the brain itself that</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.730" end="00:10:27.280" style="s2">might hinder or help how the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.910" end="00:10:28.460" style="s2">scaffolding process works for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.280" end="00:10:31.160" style="s2">ability to learn new</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.460" end="00:10:33.560" style="s2">offices similarly if we think of</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.160" end="00:10:35.660" style="s2">something like differential calculus or</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.560" end="00:10:39.320" style="s2">other kinds of advanced mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.660" end="00:10:41.900" style="s2">where it may require learning more</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.320" end="00:10:43.820" style="s2">elementary forms of mathematics so that</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.900" end="00:10:45.590" style="s2">the concepts and the language and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.820" end="00:10:47.600" style="s2">skills are present for doing more</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.590" end="00:10:49.910" style="s2">advanced mathematics so we can think of</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.600" end="00:10:52.160" style="s2">there being sequencing for some cultural</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.910" end="00:10:54.320" style="s2">scaffolding processes that are necessary</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.160" end="00:10:57.200" style="s2">to learn some things earlier before</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.320" end="00:10:59.090" style="s2">other things can be learned later on so</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.200" end="00:11:02.120" style="s2">there might be developmental constraints</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.090" end="00:11:04.160" style="s2">in terms of sequencing as well as having</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.120" end="00:11:06.020" style="s2">critical periods of development where</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.160" end="00:11:08.630" style="s2">it&#39;s easier or more difficult to put</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.020" end="00:11:10.970" style="s2">scaffolding in place and now there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.630" end="00:11:12.470" style="s2">other kinds of experiences in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.970" end="00:11:15.680" style="s2">all we can see how this cultural</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.470" end="00:11:18.290" style="s2">scaffolding process works for example if</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.680" end="00:11:20.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve already taken a pathway in your</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.290" end="00:11:22.400" style="s2">life where you got a degree and now have</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.120" end="00:11:25.490" style="s2">a career but you want to go back and get</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.400" end="00:11:27.680" style="s2">another degree and learn knowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.490" end="00:11:29.240" style="s2">you could apply to change careers that</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.680" end="00:11:31.970" style="s2">this is something that takes time and</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.240" end="00:11:34.070" style="s2">effort so we can&#39;t simply add any</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.970" end="00:11:37.160" style="s2">cultural Skype thing that we want but</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.070" end="00:11:38.930" style="s2">sometimes the ways that we&#39;ve chosen how</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.160" end="00:11:40.280" style="s2">our lives unfold or just the way our</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.930" end="00:11:43.340" style="s2">lives are developed without us having</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.280" end="00:11:45.110" style="s2">any say in it may cut off the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.340" end="00:11:47.540" style="s2">do certain things so that it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.110" end="00:11:49.600" style="s2">effortful core it&#39;s disruptive to what</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.540" end="00:11:52.210" style="s2">we&#39;re doing to make big changes</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.600" end="00:11:55.550" style="s2">similarly we might be financially or</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.210" end="00:11:57.140" style="s2">legally locked and obligations such as</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.550" end="00:11:59.480" style="s2">if you take out a mortgage on a house</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.140" end="00:12:01.700" style="s2">and you owe money and it&#39;s difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.480" end="00:12:03.590" style="s2">move without selling the home that</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.700" end="00:12:05.660" style="s2">basically you have created a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.590" end="00:12:08.960" style="s2">entrenchment for yourself where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.660" end="00:12:10.550" style="s2">much more difficult to make big changes</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.960" end="00:12:13.310" style="s2">in your life without addressing this</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.550" end="00:12:15.020" style="s2">this debt or this owned piece of</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.310" end="00:12:17.330" style="s2">property that&#39;s now a part of your life</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.020" end="00:12:18.950" style="s2">and of course with the example of</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.330" end="00:12:22.580" style="s2">starting a family you can see how</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.950" end="00:12:24.740" style="s2">there&#39;s an irreversibility to the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.580" end="00:12:26.960" style="s2">of choices and priorities that people</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.740" end="00:12:27.840" style="s2">have before having children versus after</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.960" end="00:12:29.820" style="s2">having children</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.840" end="00:12:32.820" style="s2">so all of these are aspects about</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.820" end="00:12:34.500" style="s2">cultural scaffolding works where large</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.820" end="00:12:36.870" style="s2">changes may be disruptive and be</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.500" end="00:12:39.270" style="s2">effortful later in life or that we may</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.870" end="00:12:40.830" style="s2">walk ourselves into pathways where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.270" end="00:12:42.840" style="s2">very difficult to change and do</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.830" end="00:12:45.510" style="s2">something quite different because the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.840" end="00:12:48.000" style="s2">constraints of our choices have set us</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.510" end="00:12:50.070" style="s2">into a path that makes development away</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:51.630" style="s2">from that path more difficult so all of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.070" end="00:12:54.270" style="s2">this is about how about cultural</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.630" end="00:12:57.270" style="s2">scaffolding constrains what can develop</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.270" end="00:12:59.610" style="s2">in the future so not only is this true</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.270" end="00:13:02.130" style="s2">for people&#39;s lives it&#39;s also true for</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.610" end="00:13:04.860" style="s2">the development of technology so if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.130" end="00:13:07.500" style="s2">think about as this graphic shows the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.860" end="00:13:10.350" style="s2">way the technology builds on itself such</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.500" end="00:13:12.360" style="s2">as how the designs of automobiles can</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.350" end="00:13:14.339" style="s2">build on previous designs that came</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.360" end="00:13:16.410" style="s2">before where there may have been</p>

<p begin="00:13:16.410" end="00:13:20.970" style="s2">vehicle that was unsafe to drive so they</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.570" end="00:13:23.250" style="s2">made modifications to make it more safe</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.970" end="00:13:25.680" style="s2">or they may have had new breakthrough</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.250" end="00:13:27.180" style="s2">innovations and materials that create</p>

<p begin="00:13:27.180" end="00:13:32.339" style="s2">example or there might be new tools and</p>

<p begin="00:13:34.740" end="00:13:40.220" style="s2">of the cars but there is a developmental</p>

<p begin="00:13:40.220" end="00:13:45.420" style="s2">create optimal paths for developing new</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.290" end="00:13:48.510" style="s2">designs so that through a process of</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.420" end="00:13:50.220" style="s2">iteration you can have considerable</p>

<p begin="00:13:50.220" end="00:13:55.530" style="s2">and this whole complex process depends</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.760" end="00:13:59.070" style="s2">on cultural scaffolding every step of</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.530" end="00:14:01.920" style="s2">the way for example you have people who</p>

<p begin="00:14:10.470" end="00:14:17.010" style="s2">lot of artifacts and infrastructure that</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.190" end="00:14:19.050" style="s2">are used to inform how automotive</p>

<p begin="00:14:22.560" end="00:14:29.520" style="s2">could be the use of sketches or digital</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.440" end="00:15:14.080" style="s2">so that we dedicate more of the land</p>

<p begin="00:15:21.160" end="00:15:25.900" style="s2">if we&#39;re using it as agriculture then</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.580" end="00:15:29.080" style="s2">you can really see this development</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.900" end="00:15:32.050" style="s2">process in this set of images which</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.080" end="00:15:34.420" style="s2">shows how the structures of the land for</p>

<p begin="00:15:34.420" end="00:15:39.070" style="s2">time as a built up and became more</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.370" end="00:15:41.890" style="s2">complex so just as we saw with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.070" end="00:15:44.380" style="s2">mushroom that was growing earlier in</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.890" end="00:15:45.580" style="s2">that animation that we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.380" end="00:15:47.620" style="s2">briefly a few minutes ago</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.580" end="00:15:50.830" style="s2">you can see how there can be very</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.620" end="00:15:53.050" style="s2">complex and intricate structures that</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.830" end="00:15:55.810" style="s2">arise through this cultural scaffolding</p>

<p begin="00:15:55.810" end="00:16:01.690" style="s2">an entire city that is filled with</p>

<p begin="00:16:06.550" end="00:16:11.470" style="s2">so cultural scaffolding greatly limits</p>

<p begin="00:16:16.810" end="00:16:22.750" style="s2">developments to build upon what did come</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.850" end="00:16:25.780" style="s2">before now let&#39;s take a step back and</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.750" end="00:16:28.870" style="s2">think about this very simply using a</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.780" end="00:16:31.890" style="s2">mental image and this image comes from</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.870" end="00:16:35.590" style="s2">developmental biology for the way that a</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.890" end="00:16:37.720" style="s2">fertilized egg was developed through a</p>

<p begin="00:16:51.960" end="00:16:55.830" style="s2">laid out it&#39;s meant to show that if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.330" end="00:16:59.310" style="s2">want to move from one channel to another</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.830" end="00:17:00.720" style="s2">you have to do work on the ball in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.310" end="00:17:01.830" style="s2">case you know pushing it back up the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.720" end="00:17:03.720" style="s2">hill that are pushing it over a hill</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.830" end="00:17:06.390" style="s2">sideways and this is meant to be a</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.720" end="00:17:09.270" style="s2">visual metaphor for how developmental</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.390" end="00:17:11.700" style="s2">choices will lock us into some pathways</p>

<p begin="00:17:11.700" end="00:17:16.310" style="s2">already seen several examples of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.440" end="00:17:18.390" style="s2">and the way that we talked about well a</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.310" end="00:17:20.520" style="s2">childhood development and learning</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.390" end="00:17:23.250" style="s2">language or developing complex skills</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.520" end="00:17:25.740" style="s2">like advanced mathematics or also in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.250" end="00:17:27.540" style="s2">design of technology over time that</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.740" end="00:17:30.990" style="s2">there is a kind of lock-in that happens</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.540" end="00:17:33.120" style="s2">where their work has to be done to</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.990" end="00:17:34.800" style="s2">change paths when you can already see</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.120" end="00:17:36.840" style="s2">with the implications of this for</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.800" end="00:17:38.670" style="s2">thinking about the global ecological</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.840" end="00:17:41.880" style="s2">crisis which we&#39;ll get to in a moment</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.670" end="00:17:44.130" style="s2">now here&#39;s an example where we can start</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.880" end="00:17:46.290" style="s2">to see that the generative interactions</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.130" end="00:17:48.990" style="s2">can be quite dynamic so here we have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.290" end="00:17:50.910" style="s2">scene where the structures of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.990" end="00:17:54.030" style="s2">landscape the shape of the road and</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.910" end="00:17:56.730" style="s2">where the entrances and exits are allow</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.030" end="00:17:59.640" style="s2">for constraints that create the patterns</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.730" end="00:18:01.680" style="s2">of traffic flow so just as the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.640" end="00:18:03.090" style="s2">structures help shape what the patterns</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.680" end="00:18:05.160" style="s2">are in real time for the movement of</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.090" end="00:18:07.500" style="s2">traffic you can see that cultural</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.160" end="00:18:10.170" style="s2">scaffolding can be quite dynamic for a</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.500" end="00:18:12.600" style="s2">moment to moment and if we go up in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.170" end="00:18:14.840" style="s2">level higher we can see for an entire</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.600" end="00:18:17.280" style="s2">city that there are tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.840" end="00:18:20.070" style="s2">constraints in an urban landscape like</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.280" end="00:18:22.920" style="s2">this one on where traffic can flow which</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.070" end="00:18:26.850" style="s2">ways it can flow and at what speeds it</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.920" end="00:18:29.010" style="s2">can flow so the scaffolding for social</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.850" end="00:18:31.290" style="s2">environments in today&#39;s world can be</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.010" end="00:18:35.190" style="s2">very entrenched and can be multifaceted</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.290" end="00:18:37.860" style="s2">and lead to very complex multiple level</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.190" end="00:18:40.560" style="s2">structures like a 21st century urban</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.860" end="00:18:43.320" style="s2">landscape so I just want you to think</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.560" end="00:18:46.560" style="s2">for a moment as you look at images like</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.320" end="00:18:48.630" style="s2">this one out of London just how much</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.560" end="00:18:50.700" style="s2">cultural scaffolding has developed</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.630" end="00:18:53.730" style="s2">throughout the 4,000 year history of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.700" end="00:18:56.370" style="s2">city creating a place that is going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.730" end="00:18:59.010" style="s2">be very limited and how we can change it</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.370" end="00:19:00.370" style="s2">is already very much on a pathway with</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.010" end="00:19:02.500" style="s2">inertia and</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.370" end="00:19:05.410" style="s2">ability and all of its embedded</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.500" end="00:19:08.410" style="s2">structures so what would be involved in</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.410" end="00:19:10.540" style="s2">the cultural scaffolding process to move</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.410" end="00:19:13.630" style="s2">away from this kind of infrastructure to</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.540" end="00:19:15.850" style="s2">something different the same thing could</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.630" end="00:19:18.190" style="s2">be said about large-scale agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.850" end="00:19:20.800" style="s2">where a few flyover most parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.190" end="00:19:22.570" style="s2">United States or Western Europe or</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.800" end="00:19:24.880" style="s2">really just about any part of the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.570" end="00:19:27.160" style="s2">that&#39;s not too high in the latitudes</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.880" end="00:19:30.760" style="s2">you&#39;ll see that the rand works like this</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.160" end="00:19:33.010" style="s2">where most of the ground cover has been</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.760" end="00:19:35.679" style="s2">converted for human uses to use as</p>

<p begin="00:20:00.760" end="00:20:04.720" style="s2">you see the same location in two</p>

<p begin="00:20:08.340" end="00:20:14.350" style="s2">the landscape has changed dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.140" end="00:20:16.660" style="s2">as urbanization has set in so the human</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.350" end="00:20:18.330" style="s2">population has been growing and the city</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.660" end="00:20:21.640" style="s2">went from being very sparsely populated</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.330" end="00:20:23.620" style="s2">to very densely populated and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.640" end="00:20:26.290" style="s2">trajectory of scaffolding and</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.620" end="00:20:28.990" style="s2">development that has caused this and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.290" end="00:20:31.710" style="s2">to think of dealing with large-scale</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.990" end="00:20:33.910" style="s2">social problems like say global warming</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.710" end="00:20:36.700" style="s2">what we need to move away from fossil</p>

<p begin="00:20:36.700" end="00:20:41.140" style="s2">think about how these large-scale</p>

<p begin="00:20:41.140" end="00:20:45.670" style="s2">kinds of cultural scaffolding involved</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.450" end="00:20:49.360" style="s2">limit our ability to make substantial</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.670" end="00:20:52.420" style="s2">changes so this leads to a profound and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.360" end="00:20:54.760" style="s2">somewhat disturbing question or are we</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.420" end="00:20:59.650" style="s2">already locked into an unsustainable</p>

<p begin="00:21:02.830" end="00:21:07.120" style="s2">social infrastructure are we teaching</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.470" end="00:21:08.410" style="s2">things to children as they grow up so</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.120" end="00:21:12.380" style="s2">that they have the skills and knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.410" end="00:21:14.090" style="s2">and the practices that they need to help</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.380" end="00:21:15.590" style="s2">a transition to the sustainable world</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.090" end="00:21:18.100" style="s2">and would they be able to survive</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.590" end="00:21:20.990" style="s2">through disruptions if we&#39;re not able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.100" end="00:21:23.390" style="s2">also are we able to change things like</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.990" end="00:21:26.600" style="s2">the infrastructure for transportation</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.390" end="00:21:28.910" style="s2">and energy or agriculture when so much</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.600" end="00:21:31.430" style="s2">entrenchment has already happened these</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.910" end="00:21:33.770" style="s2">are really important questions and a</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.430" end="00:21:36.320" style="s2">good place to start really unpacking</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.770" end="00:21:40.540" style="s2">them is with a really seemingly simple</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.320" end="00:21:43.910" style="s2">question how much can still be changed</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.540" end="00:21:45.920" style="s2">so just as we saw with the development</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.910" end="00:21:48.350" style="s2">process across the lifespan for a human</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.920" end="00:21:50.780" style="s2">being and we saw across those changing</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.350" end="00:21:53.330" style="s2">landscapes of cities and countryside&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.780" end="00:21:54.800" style="s2">that some of the changes are so deeply</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.330" end="00:21:57.230" style="s2">entrenched that they be very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.800" end="00:21:59.150" style="s2">to reverse but there are some things</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.230" end="00:22:02.030" style="s2">that can be changed so a key question</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.150" end="00:22:04.670" style="s2">for us as you ponder what this cultural</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.030" end="00:22:07.460" style="s2">scaffolding approach to thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.670" end="00:22:08.840" style="s2">cultural change suggests is that there</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.460" end="00:22:10.850" style="s2">gonna be a lot of things that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.840" end="00:22:13.700" style="s2">changed or things that can be changed</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.850" end="00:22:15.530" style="s2">will require work and effort to move</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.700" end="00:22:17.690" style="s2">away from one developmental pathway to</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.530" end="00:22:20.810" style="s2">another and that that can be quite</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.690" end="00:22:23.030" style="s2">difficult and time-consuming to do so</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.810" end="00:22:26.000" style="s2">how much can still be changed needs to</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.030" end="00:22:28.730" style="s2">be answered in two ways one is what can</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.000" end="00:22:31.670" style="s2">be changed at all is it even possible to</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.730" end="00:22:34.250" style="s2">make a change of a particular kind with</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.670" end="00:22:36.830" style="s2">another thing is on the timescales that</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.250" end="00:22:38.930" style="s2">we have to address different problems</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.830" end="00:22:41.330" style="s2">can we make the changes that are needed</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.930" end="00:22:43.610" style="s2">in the time for those problems to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.330" end="00:22:45.560" style="s2">addressed this is particularly crucial</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.610" end="00:22:47.060" style="s2">for global warming where we need to</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.560" end="00:22:49.250" style="s2">remove carbon dioxide from the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.060" end="00:22:50.870" style="s2">atmosphere and dramatically change our</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.250" end="00:22:53.210" style="s2">land use practices and energy</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.870" end="00:22:56.390" style="s2">infrastructure and a time frame that</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.210" end="00:22:58.670" style="s2">keeps us safe from runaway global</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.390" end="00:23:00.020" style="s2">warming so there are time scales that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.670" end="00:23:04.520" style="s2">need to think about for those sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.020" end="00:23:06.800" style="s2">problems one way to begin to reflect on</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.520" end="00:23:09.110" style="s2">what can be changed is to reflect on</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.800" end="00:23:11.510" style="s2">what has already changed and I&#39;m showing</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.110" end="00:23:14.470" style="s2">you this image of Africa where you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.510" end="00:23:15.940" style="s2">see in a very large and dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.470" end="00:23:18.909" style="s2">impression from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.940" end="00:23:20.320" style="s2">the image that the Sahara Desert is</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.909" end="00:23:23.590" style="s2">absolutely huge</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.320" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">this desert covers about a third of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.590" end="00:23:28.509" style="s2">largest landmass on earth it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:30.490" style="s2">gigantic it&#39;s almost inconceivable how</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.509" end="00:23:33.279" style="s2">big it is but what most people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.490" end="00:23:35.950" style="s2">know is that the Sahara Desert has only</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.279" end="00:23:39.610" style="s2">been a desert for five or six thousand</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.950" end="00:23:42.039" style="s2">years during the last kind of halfway</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.610" end="00:23:44.919" style="s2">between the time of the last ice age in</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.039" end="00:23:47.889" style="s2">the present day we&#39;ve had a massive</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.919" end="00:23:50.980" style="s2">change in the land use of the African</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.889" end="00:23:53.049" style="s2">continent that has happened in</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.980" end="00:23:56.320" style="s2">conjunction with changes in planetary</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.049" end="00:23:58.629" style="s2">climate to create the largest desert on</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.320" end="00:24:01.240" style="s2">earth so one thing that you can think</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.629" end="00:24:04.899" style="s2">about here is that the timeframe that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.240" end="00:24:07.240" style="s2">took to turn this lush green landscape</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.899" end="00:24:09.730" style="s2">into that giant desert with several</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.240" end="00:24:12.309" style="s2">thousand years so to try to reverse that</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.730" end="00:24:14.649" style="s2">and make that giant desert desert lush</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.309" end="00:24:16.600" style="s2">and green again well it may not take</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.649" end="00:24:18.519" style="s2">several thousand years it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.600" end="00:24:21.039" style="s2">can&#39;t be done over a period of three or</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.519" end="00:24:23.590" style="s2">four years so you can begin to think</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.039" end="00:24:25.210" style="s2">about global scale processes setting</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.590" end="00:24:29.710" style="s2">their own constraints on what can and</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.210" end="00:24:30.909" style="s2">can&#39;t be done in a given timeframe now I</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.710" end="00:24:33.700" style="s2">want to share another way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.909" end="00:24:35.919" style="s2">about cultural scaffolding that really</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.700" end="00:24:37.899" style="s2">was not presented originally as cultural</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.919" end="00:24:39.309" style="s2">scaffolding but in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.899" end="00:24:41.799" style="s2">thinking about these developmental</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.309" end="00:24:44.379" style="s2">processes that limit the patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.799" end="00:24:46.179" style="s2">can emerge in the future just glance at</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.379" end="00:24:48.129" style="s2">the different graphs that I&#39;m showing</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.179" end="00:24:50.409" style="s2">now and some of them may be difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.129" end="00:24:52.629" style="s2">read because they&#39;re small but every one</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.409" end="00:24:56.259" style="s2">of these graphs is showing a timeframe</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.629" end="00:24:58.450" style="s2">of the industrial era from 1750 to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.259" end="00:25:00.909" style="s2">present day where you can see there have</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.450" end="00:25:03.250" style="s2">been massive changes in things like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.909" end="00:25:05.620" style="s2">amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide or</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.250" end="00:25:08.350" style="s2">the amount of foreign direct investment</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.620" end="00:25:10.870" style="s2">in fossil fuels or the growth of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.350" end="00:25:12.669" style="s2">human population and you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.870" end="00:25:16.539" style="s2">arise and the incurrence rate of great</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.669" end="00:25:19.740" style="s2">floods or that you can see there being a</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.539" end="00:25:21.990" style="s2">shrinking of global biodiversity as</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.740" end="00:25:23.670" style="s2">as an extinction event is taking place a</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.990" end="00:25:26.190" style="s2">mass extinction event is beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.670" end="00:25:27.690" style="s2">happen what all these graphs indicate in</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.190" end="00:25:29.670" style="s2">their own ways is that there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.690" end="00:25:32.490" style="s2">amount of momentum in our globalized</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.670" end="00:25:34.080" style="s2">economic system and that it&#39;s built up</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.490" end="00:25:37.080" style="s2">over a period of several hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.080" end="00:25:39.990" style="s2">so the cultural scaffolding that has put</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.080" end="00:25:43.920" style="s2">us on a pathway toward ecological</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.990" end="00:25:45.270" style="s2">collapse is huge and very substantial so</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.920" end="00:25:49.010" style="s2">this calls into question the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.270" end="00:25:52.050" style="s2">of making a transition to sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.010" end="00:25:53.490" style="s2">so now we can ask a question like this</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.050" end="00:25:55.290" style="s2">you know which future will we guide</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.490" end="00:25:59.700" style="s2">ourselves toward as a species</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.290" end="00:26:01.559" style="s2">and what I hope you are really feeling</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.700" end="00:26:04.920" style="s2">at this point in the presentation is</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.559" end="00:26:07.410" style="s2">that we&#39;re limited in the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.920" end="00:26:09.690" style="s2">changes we can make for our future so</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.410" end="00:26:11.610" style="s2">part of our future that we will guide</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.690" end="00:26:14.040" style="s2">ourselves is the future we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.610" end="00:26:16.050" style="s2">been guiding ourselves toward for</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.040" end="00:26:17.760" style="s2">several hundred years because the</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.050" end="00:26:20.610" style="s2">cultural scaffolding throughout that</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.760" end="00:26:22.830" style="s2">time gave rise to the explosion of human</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.610" end="00:26:25.260" style="s2">population and the acceleration of</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.830" end="00:26:29.040" style="s2">technology and the use of energy</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.260" end="00:26:32.250" style="s2">especially fossil fuels so during the</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.040" end="00:26:36.300" style="s2">last 250 years we have seen a</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.250" end="00:26:39.150" style="s2">considerable amount of pathway</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.300" end="00:26:41.700" style="s2">constraint that tells us quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.150" end="00:26:43.230" style="s2">about what pathway we are now on so</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.700" end="00:26:45.330" style="s2">we&#39;ve already been guiding ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.230" end="00:26:48.240" style="s2">toward a future that we may not have</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.330" end="00:26:49.740" style="s2">been aware of so part of answering this</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.240" end="00:26:51.990" style="s2">question is to understand what those</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.740" end="00:26:54.330" style="s2">constraints are but another part is to</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.990" end="00:26:58.260" style="s2">ask what can still be changed and what</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.330" end="00:27:00.480" style="s2">kind of future do we want this is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.260" end="00:27:03.870" style="s2">challenge for what I call culture design</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.480" end="00:27:06.330" style="s2">which is the into the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.870" end="00:27:08.760" style="s2">approach to intentional change at large</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.330" end="00:27:10.290" style="s2">skills so this concept of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.760" end="00:27:13.080" style="s2">scaffolding comes from the study of</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.290" end="00:27:15.870" style="s2">cultural evolution which is basically to</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.080" end="00:27:18.480" style="s2">take an approach similar to how Charles</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.870" end="00:27:20.940" style="s2">Darwin thought about changes in species</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.480" end="00:27:24.360" style="s2">in biology in this idea of natural</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.940" end="00:27:26.640" style="s2">selection that there is an analogous way</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.360" end="00:27:28.830" style="s2">of thinking about culture where it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.640" end="00:27:30.900" style="s2">evolutionary process where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.830" end="00:27:33.420" style="s2">variety of different cultural traits at</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.900" end="00:27:35.940" style="s2">any given time and some of those trained</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.420" end="00:27:37.920" style="s2">some of those behaviors ideas practices</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.940" end="00:27:39.960" style="s2">etc or more adapted to their</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.920" end="00:27:41.660" style="s2">environments than others and so the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.960" end="00:27:45.600" style="s2">better we understand how evolution</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.660" end="00:27:47.550" style="s2">informs cultural adaptiveness the better</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.600" end="00:27:51.570" style="s2">we can apply cultural scaffolding</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.550" end="00:27:54.030" style="s2">processes to social change efforts so we</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.570" end="00:27:56.010" style="s2">are going to try to make the change from</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.030" end="00:27:58.410" style="s2">our current trajectory to one that gets</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.010" end="00:28:01.350" style="s2">us the planetary sustainability we will</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.410" end="00:28:04.530" style="s2">have to use culture design to do it and</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.350" end="00:28:08.340" style="s2">so right now we hold in our hands the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.530" end="00:28:10.560" style="s2">future of our entire world and so as you</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.340" end="00:28:13.260" style="s2">think about what I&#39;ve said here in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.560" end="00:28:15.540" style="s2">presentation that cultural scaffolding</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.260" end="00:28:20.070" style="s2">is a set of generative interactions</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.540" end="00:28:22.860" style="s2">between actors artifacts practices and</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.070" end="00:28:24.900" style="s2">infrastructure that the patterns are</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.860" end="00:28:27.180" style="s2">constrained in ways that we really need</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.900" end="00:28:30.540" style="s2">to understand very well so as we</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.180" end="00:28:33.270" style="s2">consider our future together in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.540" end="00:28:36.510" style="s2">period of time where disruptions are</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.270" end="00:28:39.150" style="s2">quite huge in the futures is not looking</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.510" end="00:28:41.160" style="s2">that positive for us we really need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.150" end="00:28:44.610" style="s2">take seriously this cultural scaffolding</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.160" end="00:28:46.260" style="s2">process and I want you to know that I</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.610" end="00:28:48.570" style="s2">take it very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.260" end="00:28:51.450" style="s2">this is a picture of my ten month old</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.570" end="00:28:54.210" style="s2">daughter Elise and I am very</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.450" end="00:28:57.270" style="s2">thoughtfully trying along with my wife</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.210" end="00:28:59.430" style="s2">we are both but I thoughtfully trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.270" end="00:29:01.440" style="s2">develop the cultural scaffolding we feel</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.430" end="00:29:05.070" style="s2">she will need in our parenting</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.440" end="00:29:07.980" style="s2">philosophies so that we can help her to</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.070" end="00:29:11.610" style="s2">thrive as an adult in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.980" end="00:29:13.800" style="s2">21st century so just as we are taking</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.610" end="00:29:16.440" style="s2">great care to raise our child we feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.800" end="00:29:19.890" style="s2">that there&#39;s need for our societies to</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.440" end="00:29:21.660" style="s2">take great care to create the</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.890" end="00:29:24.360" style="s2">scaffolding that will create resilience</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.660" end="00:29:26.880" style="s2">and thriving for entire communities and</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.360" end="00:29:29.700" style="s2">regions of people so as I think about</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.880" end="00:29:33.090" style="s2">the future I think of my daughter at</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.700" end="00:29:35.100" style="s2">some point being an adult and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.090" end="00:29:38.670" style="s2">going to see a world in front of her</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.100" end="00:29:40.260" style="s2">that we helped create so this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.670" end="00:29:43.800" style="s2">cultural scaffolding is also very</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.260" end="00:29:44.480" style="s2">interesting in that it&#39;s ultimately up</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.800" end="00:29:46.700" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.480" end="00:29:49.040" style="s2">to choose what kinds of developmental</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.700" end="00:29:51.980" style="s2">pathways we want for the future of</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.040" end="00:29:54.770" style="s2">humanity and life on earth and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.980" end="00:29:57.710" style="s2">future that we are choosing today in our</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.770" end="00:29:59.179" style="s2">actions and our collective decisions are</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.710" end="00:30:00.950" style="s2">going to create the world that our</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.179" end="00:30:03.710" style="s2">children will experience tomorrow as</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.950" end="00:30:06.230" style="s2">adults and so with that in mind</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.710" end="00:30:08.299" style="s2">I really hope to leave with you a sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.230" end="00:30:09.740" style="s2">of responsiblity the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.299" end="00:30:12.770" style="s2">scaffolding is not just something that</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.740" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">you can let happen accidentally or be</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.770" end="00:30:17.090" style="s2">controlled by someone else is taking the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:19.460" style="s2">world toward a place that you don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.090" end="00:30:21.049" style="s2">is right for your children that it&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.460" end="00:30:25.030" style="s2">to all of us to create the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.049" end="00:30:28.429" style="s2">scaffolding that we&#39;ll need to get there</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.030" end="00:30:30.860" style="s2">with that in mind I just say let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.429" end="00:30:32.780" style="s2">to work we have a lot of culture design</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.860" end="00:30:34.360" style="s2">that we need to do to build the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.780" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">scaffolding for our future</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.360" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">onward fellow humans</p>
