<p begin="00:02:13.239" end="00:02:17.560" style="s2">not like angling for Libertarian Party</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.160" end="00:02:18.790" style="s2">candidates not the work opposed that</p>

<p begin="00:02:18.790" end="00:02:24.310" style="s2">just um our editor always likes to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.950" end="00:02:27.910" style="s2">politics is downstream of culture and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.310" end="00:02:32.230" style="s2">who said that quote pretty sure was</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.910" end="00:02:32.739" style="s2">Andrew Breitbart was it really yeah oh</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.230" end="00:02:35.590" style="s2">did he</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.739" end="00:02:36.730" style="s2">I don&#39;t know well that would be funny</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.590" end="00:02:38.440" style="s2">though would it that&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.730" end="00:02:39.970" style="s2">okay yeah well I mean call it politics</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.440" end="00:02:41.530" style="s2">is definitely downstream from culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.970" end="00:02:43.540" style="s2">and I would argue that like college</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.530" end="00:02:44.080" style="s2">campuses are upstream from culture and</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.540" end="00:02:45.550" style="s2">that&#39;s why I like</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.080" end="00:02:47.770" style="s2">spend a lot of time on college and think</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.550" end="00:02:49.840" style="s2">about that place quite a bit but tell me</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.770" end="00:02:51.160" style="s2">how did you how did you come to reason</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:52.330" style="s2">what were you doing before that I like</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.160" end="00:02:54.250" style="s2">to just you know give a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.330" end="00:02:55.780" style="s2">background for people because you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.250" end="00:02:56.860" style="s2">these interviews are not just about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.780" end="00:02:58.840" style="s2">subject matter but about the people</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.860" end="00:03:01.330" style="s2">behind the work and so I&#39;m interested to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.840" end="00:03:03.910" style="s2">hear what what brought you to riding for</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.330" end="00:03:06.010" style="s2">a reason calm yeah I think it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.910" end="00:03:07.780" style="s2">good to you&#39;ll appreciate this having</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.010" end="00:03:10.060" style="s2">taken a sort of roundabout way to</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.780" end="00:03:10.930" style="s2">writing and path to getting involved in</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.060" end="00:03:12.610" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.930" end="00:03:14.650" style="s2">um because I mean I&#39;ve been a writer and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.610" end="00:03:16.270" style="s2">a journalist for my whole career pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.650" end="00:03:18.340" style="s2">much but I&#39;ve been all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.270" end="00:03:20.500" style="s2">sort of within that sphere yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.340" end="00:03:22.360" style="s2">started at a legal newspaper at Ohio</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.500" end="00:03:25.620" style="s2">right after Columbus Ohio right after</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.360" end="00:03:27.820" style="s2">college and then I I came here to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.620" end="00:03:30.250" style="s2">seminar for the Institute for Humane</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.820" end="00:03:33.490" style="s2">studies and it was about libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.250" end="00:03:35.470" style="s2">classical liberalism and this was I in</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.490" end="00:03:37.330" style="s2">DC and it was funded by the Koch</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.470" end="00:03:38.650" style="s2">brothers so I like to say that you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.330" end="00:03:41.020" style="s2">I went to like Koch brainwashing camp</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.650" end="00:03:45.130" style="s2">nice have you been able to shake that</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.020" end="00:03:46.900" style="s2">yeah I didn&#39;t really know much about</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.130" end="00:03:49.060" style="s2">libertarianism or classical liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.900" end="00:03:50.709" style="s2">but it wasn&#39;t like they you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.060" end="00:03:52.269" style="s2">convinced me of things that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.709" end="00:03:54.400" style="s2">believe it was like oh my gosh this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.269" end="00:03:55.840" style="s2">what I believe and there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.400" end="00:03:58.300" style="s2">word for it cuz I used to think that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.840" end="00:04:00.580" style="s2">was too liberal for the Democrats in</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.300" end="00:04:02.140" style="s2">some ways but then also not an iota so</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.580" end="00:04:04.150" style="s2">you know I just knew it wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.140" end="00:04:07.840" style="s2">Republican but um so finally was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.150" end="00:04:08.890" style="s2">this is what I would I am so I am and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.840" end="00:04:11.260" style="s2">also discovered that there&#39;s this whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.890" end="00:04:13.420" style="s2">weird world in DC of like think tanks</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.260" end="00:04:15.100" style="s2">and nonprofits and things where people</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.420" end="00:04:17.109" style="s2">just get paid to like write and think</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.100" end="00:04:19.810" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know college professor</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.109" end="00:04:21.580" style="s2">without the students office students and</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.810" end="00:04:23.320" style="s2">I was like I want to do that or or I</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.580" end="00:04:25.030" style="s2">want to you know do PR for one of those</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.320" end="00:04:26.740" style="s2">because I also learned the PR gets paid</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.030" end="00:04:29.380" style="s2">a lot better than journalism oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.740" end="00:04:31.390" style="s2">because the pr&#39;s job is to withhold</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.380" end="00:04:36.490" style="s2">information restrict information and</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.390" end="00:04:39.130" style="s2">journalism job exactly it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.490" end="00:04:41.890" style="s2">lucrative it&#39;s worth more to people yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.130" end="00:04:43.900" style="s2">oh I am I applied to a grad school and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.890" end="00:04:45.850" style="s2">came here to American University it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.900" end="00:04:47.620" style="s2">just a one year program in strategic</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.850" end="00:04:49.300" style="s2">communications which was like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.620" end="00:04:51.610" style="s2">communication theory but also very</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.300" end="00:04:53.140" style="s2">practical we had like people from all</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.610" end="00:04:56.110" style="s2">these you know working in DC you come</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.140" end="00:04:58.030" style="s2">and talk to us and so I did that and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.110" end="00:04:59.680" style="s2">was great and was very</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.030" end="00:05:01.420" style="s2">because it got me out of Ohio and it got</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.680" end="00:05:02.920" style="s2">me to DC yet I started hanging out at</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.420" end="00:05:05.050" style="s2">Reason magazine and with libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.920" end="00:05:08.830" style="s2">groups in DC at that time this was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.050" end="00:05:10.330" style="s2">long time ago um this was 2006 and but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.830" end="00:05:12.820" style="s2">learned that I didn&#39;t want to go into PR</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.330" end="00:05:14.170" style="s2">at all so that was also I guess right</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.820" end="00:05:16.480" style="s2">learning learn out you don&#39;t want it</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.170" end="00:05:18.280" style="s2">even more value I gotta like pare it</p>

<p begin="00:10:52.040" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">much driven on just like you need to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.720" end="00:10:58.520" style="s2">clicks and that&#39;s at the bottom line</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:11:01.459" style="s2">right and every publication has its own</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.520" end="00:11:04.790" style="s2">bias right and it&#39;s just you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.459" end="00:11:06.560" style="s2">honest and open about it right yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.790" end="00:11:08.600" style="s2">I think that&#39;s admirable and we&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.560" end="00:11:10.550" style="s2">through I mean every human being has</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.600" end="00:11:13.010" style="s2">their own bias season so when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.550" end="00:11:14.510" style="s2">just out front and and spoken then</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.010" end="00:11:16.700" style="s2">that&#39;s legit it&#39;s just when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.510" end="00:11:18.320" style="s2">hidden and that&#39;s the issue so can you</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.700" end="00:11:19.820" style="s2">do you mind talking a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.320" end="00:11:21.830" style="s2">the debate that you guys have between</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.820" end="00:11:23.180" style="s2">following the story of the day in the or</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.830" end="00:11:24.380" style="s2">versus like setting your own agenda</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.180" end="00:11:26.540" style="s2">because I think that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.380" end="00:11:28.400" style="s2">interesting question you know we live in</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.540" end="00:11:30.140" style="s2">a world of narratives narratives or will</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.400" end="00:11:31.610" style="s2">control our minds and if you can control</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.140" end="00:11:34.240" style="s2">the narrative you can basically control</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.610" end="00:11:36.730" style="s2">people&#39;s mind so being proactive or</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.240" end="00:11:40.570" style="s2">is reactive how I&#39;ve been playing out in</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.730" end="00:11:42.010" style="s2">your discussions I mean so and this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.570" end="00:11:44.140" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s maybe changed a little</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.010" end="00:11:46.390" style="s2">bit in the past few years but so when I</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.140" end="00:11:48.430" style="s2">started everything was 2014 and it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.390" end="00:11:51.130" style="s2">it was the the very brief libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.430" end="00:11:52.630" style="s2">moment as deemed by the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.130" end="00:11:54.220" style="s2">there was all this talk about Rand Paul</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.630" end="00:11:55.779" style="s2">being a front-runner and all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.220" end="00:11:57.580" style="s2">and there was leaking all this attention</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.779" end="00:11:59.260" style="s2">and then when it didn&#39;t pan out</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.580" end="00:12:03.790" style="s2">everyone&#39;s like haha how&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.260" end="00:12:05.740" style="s2">libertarian moment but well yeah so one</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.790" end="00:12:07.089" style="s2">of the things I mean none of us that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.740" end="00:12:08.440" style="s2">everyone else&#39;s way that was sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.089" end="00:12:09.850" style="s2">mainstream media and the people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.440" end="00:12:11.620" style="s2">wanted to taunt us his way of framing it</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.850" end="00:12:13.330" style="s2">was that it was all about getting a</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.620" end="00:12:14.830" style="s2">libertarians elected to politics or</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.330" end="00:12:16.540" style="s2">having more Republicans and Democrats</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.830" end="00:12:18.760" style="s2">that were elected adopt libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.540" end="00:12:20.080" style="s2">ideas and whatever and that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.760" end="00:12:22.810" style="s2">we were I mean that&#39;s clearly not</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.080" end="00:12:24.550" style="s2">happening but the world is getting more</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.810" end="00:12:26.110" style="s2">libertarian despite the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.550" end="00:12:28.209" style="s2">there&#39;s so many examples you can point</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.110" end="00:12:29.709" style="s2">to that aren&#39;t there&#39;s also so many so</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.209" end="00:12:31.660" style="s2">many that are I mean I don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.709" end="00:12:32.770" style="s2">the whole world I think I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.660" end="00:12:34.180" style="s2">talking about the United States but if</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.770" end="00:12:36.149" style="s2">you look around us I mean just things</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.180" end="00:12:39.070" style="s2">like with you know with same-sex</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.149" end="00:12:40.420" style="s2">relationships or with marijuana</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.070" end="00:12:41.890" style="s2">legalization I mean these are just two</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.420" end="00:12:43.660" style="s2">of the major ones but there&#39;s all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.890" end="00:12:45.850" style="s2">of things where people are so much less</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.660" end="00:12:47.350" style="s2">conformist so much more you know into</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.850" end="00:12:49.450" style="s2">individual liberties than ever before</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.350" end="00:12:52.510" style="s2">and so like on a cultural level I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.450" end="00:12:53.709" style="s2">that people are or at least until very</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.510" end="00:12:55.300" style="s2">recently we&#39;re getting more and more</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.709" end="00:12:56.920" style="s2">libertarian there&#39;s some weird stuff</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.300" end="00:12:58.600" style="s2">going on the past few years well I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.920" end="00:13:01.089" style="s2">all the cool kids are definitely leaning</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.600" end="00:13:02.589" style="s2">libertarian that&#39;s for sure and I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.089" end="00:13:04.300" style="s2">that that&#39;s sort of like the unifying</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.589" end="00:13:07.079" style="s2">theme of people that I find that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.300" end="00:13:08.980" style="s2">relate to are people that believe in</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.079" end="00:13:10.930" style="s2">individual liberties you know I always</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.980" end="00:13:12.640" style="s2">said that my platform before I even</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.930" end="00:13:14.950" style="s2">understood with libertarianism was I</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.640" end="00:13:17.440" style="s2">always said my platform was gays guns</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.950" end="00:13:18.430" style="s2">and drugs right like do whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.440" end="00:13:20.350" style="s2">want as long as you&#39;re not hurting</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.430" end="00:13:22.300" style="s2">anybody else or yourself in some</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.350" end="00:13:24.579" style="s2">terrible way and then basically just you</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.300" end="00:13:26.200" style="s2">know leave everybody alone and I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.579" end="00:13:30.130" style="s2">that that&#39;s if there&#39;s sort of like a</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.200" end="00:13:31.420" style="s2">unifying Center these days you know the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.130" end="00:13:33.579" style="s2">from the extreme right to the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.420" end="00:13:36.130" style="s2">left like in the middle I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.579" end="00:13:38.500" style="s2">finding is like libertarian minded</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.130" end="00:13:40.060" style="s2">Liberty is libertarian is that a mod</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.500" end="00:13:42.160" style="s2">that&#39;s like a moderate middle ground now</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.060" end="00:13:44.560" style="s2">I know it&#39;s weird I kind of think of us</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.160" end="00:13:46.420" style="s2">as that which is weird cuz I mean yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.560" end="00:13:47.770" style="s2">we&#39;re try think of any individual</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.420" end="00:13:49.840" style="s2">position it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.770" end="00:13:51.070" style="s2">but I think that a lot of people out</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.840" end="00:13:53.110" style="s2">there just regular people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.070" end="00:13:55.360" style="s2">necessarily paying attention to politics</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.110" end="00:13:56.890" style="s2">who aren&#39;t necessarily very tribal about</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.360" end="00:13:57.940" style="s2">it or just very clued into the daily I</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.890" end="00:14:00.070" style="s2">think of it I mean I think most people</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.940" end="00:14:01.390" style="s2">are very kind of have this it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.070" end="00:14:04.360" style="s2">American you throw start this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.390" end="00:14:06.730" style="s2">like live and let live and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.360" end="00:14:09.490" style="s2">I mean well I&#39;d like to maintain it as</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.730" end="00:14:11.350" style="s2">being an American yeah right it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.490" end="00:14:12.760" style="s2">it seems to be you know the narratives</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.350" end="00:14:14.890" style="s2">and some of our politicians are</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.760" end="00:14:17.020" style="s2">definitely moving away from that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.890" end="00:14:19.330" style="s2">in a more authoritarian direction and</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.020" end="00:14:22.780" style="s2">definitely coercion in terms of what you</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.330" end="00:14:24.010" style="s2">see think feel act do it cetera but you</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.780" end="00:14:25.540" style="s2">know I I didn&#39;t even know what</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.010" end="00:14:27.580" style="s2">libertarianism was and then I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.540" end="00:14:29.110" style="s2">at George Mason for act for economics</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.580" end="00:14:30.940" style="s2">and so I just sort of like fell</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.110" end="00:14:33.640" style="s2">backwards into the most libertarian well</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.940" end="00:14:35.740" style="s2">second most libertarian economics and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.640" end="00:14:38.380" style="s2">public policy school in the country</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.740" end="00:14:40.450" style="s2">after University of Chicago and bet</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.380" end="00:14:43.420" style="s2">that&#39;s where I learned about the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.450" end="00:14:45.540" style="s2">like real ideological libertarianism</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.420" end="00:14:48.760" style="s2">which I think taken in its own way to</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.540" end="00:14:51.370" style="s2">extremes can be problematic you know in</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.760" end="00:14:52.870" style="s2">and of itself but at the same time it</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.370" end="00:14:54.970" style="s2">definitely introduced me to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.870" end="00:14:56.770" style="s2">that you know a market market-based</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.970" end="00:14:58.330" style="s2">solutions for things seem to work out</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.770" end="00:15:01.390" style="s2">better than government based solutions</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.330" end="00:15:03.070" style="s2">so at least the common strand of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.390" end="00:15:04.840" style="s2">people that I&#39;ve been interviewing and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.070" end="00:15:06.520" style="s2">maybe maybe that&#39;s a reflection of me</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.840" end="00:15:09.130" style="s2">you know from jeffrey miller he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.520" end="00:15:11.770" style="s2">definitely libertarian and then speaking</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.130" end="00:15:14.230" style="s2">with art davana he&#39;s definitely he calls</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.770" end="00:15:15.430" style="s2">himself a libertarian conservative and</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.230" end="00:15:17.080" style="s2">definitely talking to you and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.430" end="00:15:18.430" style="s2">excited about it because it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.080" end="00:15:21.310" style="s2">that there&#39;s like an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.430" end="00:15:23.500" style="s2">honesty in that space that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.310" end="00:15:25.270" style="s2">exactly found in the other other</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.500" end="00:15:28.000" style="s2">extremes right or left well and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.270" end="00:15:29.650" style="s2">also a there&#39;s a path forward maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.000" end="00:15:31.150" style="s2">we don&#39;t see in a lot of our stuff today</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.650" end="00:15:32.710" style="s2">with the right and the left who are very</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.150" end="00:15:34.870" style="s2">sort of all-or-nothing about the way</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.710" end="00:15:36.970" style="s2">they approach things on I mean we get a</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.870" end="00:15:38.920" style="s2">lot sort of within the libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.970" end="00:15:40.090" style="s2">movement and within among conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.920" end="00:15:42.940" style="s2">or some people who think of Reason as</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.090" end="00:15:45.220" style="s2">being this crazy left-leaning libertine</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.940" end="00:15:46.630" style="s2">you know think and then on the Left</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.220" end="00:15:47.980" style="s2">there&#39;s or you know amongst Democrats</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.630" end="00:15:49.330" style="s2">there&#39;s look there&#39;s this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.980" end="00:15:50.680" style="s2">we&#39;re very conservative and rightly</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.330" end="00:15:53.320" style="s2">always here the right leaning or the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.680" end="00:15:55.510" style="s2">conservative Reason magazine and I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.320" end="00:15:57.460" style="s2">it&#39;s because I mean there is room for</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.510" end="00:15:59.500" style="s2">people with all of those views within</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.460" end="00:16:00.449" style="s2">libertarianism like libertarianism</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.500" end="00:16:03.629" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a position</p>

<p begin="00:18:30.870" end="00:18:35.040" style="s2">like a really hot button issue and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.580" end="00:18:37.950" style="s2">and that&#39;s an issue around human</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.040" end="00:18:40.530" style="s2">trafficking sex trafficking sex workers</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.950" end="00:18:42.600" style="s2">individual liberties the right for</p>

<p begin="00:18:45.140" end="00:18:51.660" style="s2">it&#39;s a real sensitive button because</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.150" end="00:18:53.940" style="s2">people who are I think uninformed or</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.660" end="00:18:55.500" style="s2">even ill informed on the matter hear the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.940" end="00:18:57.180" style="s2">word sex trafficking and immediately</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.500" end="00:18:59.160" style="s2">think about just little kids getting</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.180" end="00:19:01.320" style="s2">pushed into slavery and sex slavery and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.160" end="00:19:03.990" style="s2">then they immediately it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.320" end="00:19:05.580" style="s2">lose all sense of rational thought and</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.990" end="00:19:07.320" style="s2">reasonable reasonable thinking on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.580" end="00:19:09.120" style="s2">matter and then I&#39;m and just are like</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.320" end="00:19:10.740" style="s2">okay like whatever you want to do we got</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.120" end="00:19:12.870" style="s2">to save the children save the children</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.740" end="00:19:15.180" style="s2">and so it&#39;s it&#39;s actually much more</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.870" end="00:19:17.430" style="s2">complicated and complex than that what</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.180" end="00:19:18.570" style="s2">do you know imagine that and so um</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.430" end="00:19:20.640" style="s2">that&#39;s something that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.570" end="00:19:21.990" style="s2">working on quite a bit and and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.640" end="00:19:23.760" style="s2">that I love about this podcast is I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:19:39.420" end="00:19:42.570" style="s2">yeah I guess I kind of say my main beat</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.130" end="00:19:44.610" style="s2">my main coverage area is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.570" end="00:19:48.480" style="s2">intersection of sex speech and civil</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.610" end="00:19:51.630" style="s2">liberties I started you know I&#39;d always</p>

<p begin="00:19:51.630" end="00:19:54.990" style="s2">rights and things like that and so when</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.700" end="00:19:56.520" style="s2">I started yet reason I was you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.990" end="00:19:59.670" style="s2">gonna write about I&#39;d written</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.520" end="00:20:01.710" style="s2">you know before about dumb taxes sin</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.670" end="00:20:03.960" style="s2">taxes on strip clubs and things like</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.710" end="00:20:05.340" style="s2">that and you know just sort of different</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.960" end="00:20:06.900" style="s2">sex worker rights movements and it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.340" end="00:20:08.160" style="s2">just kind of focusing on that the very</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.900" end="00:20:09.600" style="s2">libertarian thing like people should be</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.160" end="00:20:11.220" style="s2">able to do what they want you know with</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.600" end="00:20:12.360" style="s2">you know with their bodies consenting</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.220" end="00:20:14.250" style="s2">adults as long as they&#39;re not harming</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.360" end="00:20:16.200" style="s2">anyone and between adults they should be</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.250" end="00:20:19.560" style="s2">you know allowed consent is the key</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.200" end="00:20:22.759" style="s2">consent of course but as I was you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.560" end="00:20:24.440" style="s2">starting to write about that it was just</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.759" end="00:20:25.190" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t write about that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.440" end="00:20:26.929" style="s2">couldn&#39;t write about any of that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.190" end="00:20:29.599" style="s2">without coming across sex trafficking</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.929" end="00:20:31.039" style="s2">because suddenly it&#39;s become and this</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.599" end="00:20:33.799" style="s2">has been a thing that&#39;s been brewing for</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.039" end="00:20:36.559" style="s2">like 15 or more years now but suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.799" end="00:20:41.779" style="s2">it really really picked up in the around</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.559" end="00:20:42.949" style="s2">2010 you know after that so um by 2014</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.779" end="00:20:44.779" style="s2">when I started no reason it was just</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.949" end="00:20:46.579" style="s2">like anything that had to do with sex</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.779" end="00:20:47.929" style="s2">there was people talking about sex</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.579" end="00:20:49.489" style="s2">trafficking saying that it was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.929" end="00:20:51.320" style="s2">lead to sex trafficking and proposing</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.489" end="00:20:52.639" style="s2">why we need to shut down any and</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.320" end="00:20:54.169" style="s2">anything like having to relate with</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.639" end="00:20:56.749" style="s2">adults and sex because of sex</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.169" end="00:20:58.009" style="s2">trafficking right and so yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.749" end="00:20:59.449" style="s2">started sort of you know trying to dig</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.009" end="00:21:02.869" style="s2">into things first starting with I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.449" end="00:21:05.329" style="s2">the numbers behind it and you know it</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.869" end="00:21:07.819" style="s2">turns out that there has just been so</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.329" end="00:21:09.349" style="s2">much crazy inflation and made up things</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.819" end="00:21:11.719" style="s2">with statistics when it comes to this</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.349" end="00:21:13.039" style="s2">stuff and if you actually look at you</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.719" end="00:21:16.069" style="s2">know what real numbers we do have it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.039" end="00:21:17.659" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s ridiculously smaller than the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.069" end="00:21:20.449" style="s2">picture and all the data that they do</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.659" end="00:21:21.979" style="s2">have is very unlike just for one example</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.449" end="00:21:23.749" style="s2">there&#39;s a statistic that goes all around</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.979" end="00:21:26.749" style="s2">all the time about how three hundred</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.749" end="00:21:28.309" style="s2">thousand kids a year are or being sex</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.749" end="00:21:30.709" style="s2">trafficking in the United States or at</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.309" end="00:21:32.209" style="s2">risk of being sex trafficked and it</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.709" end="00:21:34.699" style="s2">turns out it&#39;s from this one study that</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.209" end="00:21:36.919" style="s2">wasn&#39;t peer-reviewed in like 2001 and</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.699" end="00:21:38.119" style="s2">the author counted anybody who lived in</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.919" end="00:21:40.309" style="s2">public housing anybody who had a</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.119" end="00:21:41.839" style="s2">divorced parent anybody who&#39;d like all</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.309" end="00:21:43.099" style="s2">these different things as at-risk for</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.839" end="00:21:45.409" style="s2">sex trafficking if they had more than</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.099" end="00:21:47.449" style="s2">one factor he counted them twice or</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.409" end="00:21:48.409" style="s2">three times and then added all them up</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.449" end="00:21:50.449" style="s2">and then that&#39;s where they came from</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.409" end="00:21:52.009" style="s2">this number and that both him and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.449" end="00:21:53.449" style="s2">like national children&#39;s groups have</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.009" end="00:21:54.949" style="s2">been like please don&#39;t use a statistic</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.449" end="00:21:56.569" style="s2">it&#39;s wrong it doesn&#39;t come from anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.949" end="00:21:58.099" style="s2">Oh even the guy that made him gay guy</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.569" end="00:22:01.399" style="s2">disavowed it he&#39;s just like no this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.099" end="00:22:03.049" style="s2">not this was a bad study like so um you</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.399" end="00:22:06.409" style="s2">know we see that quite a bit right like</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.049" end="00:22:08.059" style="s2">even with the the rape on campus numbers</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.409" end="00:22:09.889" style="s2">oh yeah even like some of those original</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.059" end="00:22:11.509" style="s2">studies the authors have come out and</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.889" end="00:22:13.459" style="s2">said like this is not represented</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.509" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">nationally representative it was just a</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.459" end="00:22:19.190" style="s2">survey like please don&#39;t take its</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:20.929" style="s2">numbers seriously and even even the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.190" end="00:22:22.879" style="s2">implicit association test guide the</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.929" end="00:22:25.699" style="s2">biased guy he&#39;s even so that his test</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.879" end="00:22:27.739" style="s2">doesn&#39;t like accurately predict bias but</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.699" end="00:22:30.379" style="s2">yet somehow all these statistics get</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.739" end="00:22:32.779" style="s2">used they it&#39;s like it&#39;s like telephone</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.379" end="00:22:34.190" style="s2">right it gets said once and then it gets</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.779" end="00:22:36.710" style="s2">mutated again and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.190" end="00:22:38.059" style="s2">never never it never dies it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.710" end="00:22:39.950" style="s2">zombie stats and then it makes its way</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.059" end="00:22:41.450" style="s2">into government policy but but before we</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.950" end="00:22:43.100" style="s2">get into that can you can you just give</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.450" end="00:22:44.960" style="s2">like a working definition of what sex</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.100" end="00:22:46.190" style="s2">trafficking is oh sorry yeah I should</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:49.009" style="s2">probably just back up and say you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.190" end="00:22:50.450" style="s2">um real quick when people talk about sex</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.009" end="00:22:52.399" style="s2">work that&#39;s usually sort of a broad</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.450" end="00:22:53.899" style="s2">category that includes both legal and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.399" end="00:22:55.340" style="s2">illegal things you know everything from</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.899" end="00:22:58.190" style="s2">people who are working at strip clubs</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.340" end="00:23:00.919" style="s2">and doing legal sort of you know sexy</p>

<p begin="00:23:03.080" end="00:23:09.500" style="s2">money um prostitution or what we would</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.200" end="00:23:11.419" style="s2">call prostitution sex trafficking</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.500" end="00:23:13.039" style="s2">theoretically and when people hear about</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.419" end="00:23:14.299" style="s2">it they think of these the worst sorts</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.039" end="00:23:15.950" style="s2">of things you know they think of people</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.299" end="00:23:20.169" style="s2">being abducted they think of people</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.950" end="00:23:22.490" style="s2">being held against their will under</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.169" end="00:23:24.919" style="s2">federal definition of sex trafficking</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.490" end="00:23:26.659" style="s2">anyone who is under 18 is defined as a</p>

<p begin="00:23:26.659" end="00:23:30.649" style="s2">for sex or if anyone offers some money</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.399" end="00:23:34.009" style="s2">for sex so there doesn&#39;t have to be any</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.649" end="00:23:36.350" style="s2">force fraud or coercion involved oh god</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.009" end="00:23:37.220" style="s2">it&#39;s like a girl who lies about her age</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.350" end="00:23:39.710" style="s2">on tinder</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.220" end="00:23:41.659" style="s2">she&#39;s 17 she goes on there she&#39;s 18 she</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.710" end="00:23:43.700" style="s2">says send me five dollars venmo and I&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="00:23:46.669" end="00:23:49.580" style="s2">actually like the bulk of the people</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.049" end="00:23:53.210" style="s2">that they prosecute in federal courts</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.580" end="00:23:54.679" style="s2">are stories like that technically if</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.210" end="00:23:56.450" style="s2">you&#39;re an adult then there does have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.679" end="00:23:59.779" style="s2">be an element of force fraud or coercion</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.450" end="00:24:01.669" style="s2">involved but that&#39;s very dicey and</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.779" end="00:24:02.809" style="s2">especially while that while that might</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.669" end="00:24:05.120" style="s2">be actually true when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.809" end="00:24:06.919" style="s2">federal charges it&#39;s not at all how they</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.120" end="00:24:07.850" style="s2">use it in the media I mean this started</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.919" end="00:24:10.370" style="s2">sort of at the federal level and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.850" end="00:24:11.809" style="s2">seeped down to local news and local cops</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.370" end="00:24:13.159" style="s2">and now pretty much I mean if you look</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.809" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">at any headline across the country and</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.159" end="00:24:16.340" style="s2">you see a human trafficking operation or</p>

<p begin="00:24:16.340" end="00:24:19.730" style="s2">and then you look at what it says it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:20.929" style="s2">always say that they arrested a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.730" end="00:24:21.889" style="s2">people for prostitution</p>

<p begin="00:25:16.029" end="00:25:18.759" style="s2">not naive you know I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.139" end="00:25:20.230" style="s2">everybody was working in sex workers</p>

<p begin="00:25:30.070" end="00:25:33.429" style="s2">very good reasons why someone who was in</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.960" end="00:25:35.350" style="s2">prostitution especially at a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.429" end="00:25:36.759" style="s2">lower end level and his meeting people</p>

<p begin="00:25:45.340" end="00:25:49.299" style="s2">thing so I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s not always in</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.230" end="00:25:51.970" style="s2">a exploitive situation but it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.299" end="00:25:55.149" style="s2">treated like that right so where do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.970" end="00:25:57.820" style="s2">think this this hysteria came from I</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.149" end="00:26:01.899" style="s2">mean I use hysteria is it a hysteria I</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.820" end="00:26:03.940" style="s2">think so what is the point and who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.899" end="00:26:05.440" style="s2">winning from this and and how does it</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.940" end="00:26:07.179" style="s2">play itself out in our national</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.440" end="00:26:09.489" style="s2">dialogues and in our in our laws and</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.179" end="00:26:12.609" style="s2">then what is what are the negative side</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.489" end="00:26:15.820" style="s2">effects yeah so where this came from is</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.609" end="00:26:17.109" style="s2">really there was sort of and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.820" end="00:26:18.519" style="s2">fascinating actually there&#39;s this paper</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.109" end="00:26:19.869" style="s2">that talks all it has all these quotes</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.519" end="00:26:21.700" style="s2">from these people when they were passing</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.869" end="00:26:23.769" style="s2">the first trafficking anti-sex</p>

<p begin="00:26:24.850" end="00:26:27.669" style="s2">there was a sort of Human Rights</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.749" end="00:26:29.230" style="s2">coalition that was just like we want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.669" end="00:26:30.940" style="s2">deal with global issues you know we want</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.230" end="00:26:32.919" style="s2">to make sure we were giving enough US</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.940" end="00:26:34.809" style="s2">resources to stop sex trafficking abroad</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.919" end="00:26:36.009" style="s2">and whatever and then there was a group</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.809" end="00:26:37.509" style="s2">that was kind of concerned with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.009" end="00:26:39.309" style="s2">bureaucracy and they were like we want</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.509" end="00:26:40.509" style="s2">to make sure we have the right I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.309" end="00:26:41.889" style="s2">even know what you know weird federal</p>

<p begin="00:26:44.169" end="00:26:47.559" style="s2">violence shelters and whatever within</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.519" end="00:26:49.659" style="s2">the United States and then there was the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.559" end="00:26:50.739" style="s2">coalition of sort of Christian</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.659" end="00:26:53.470" style="s2">conservatives and evangelicals</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.739" end="00:26:54.730" style="s2">conservatives and radical feminists the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.470" end="00:26:56.850" style="s2">sort of anti porn</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.730" end="00:26:58.900" style="s2">ninis you know Catherine MacKinnon style</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.850" end="00:27:01.420" style="s2">Andrea Dworkin very and</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.900" end="00:27:03.190" style="s2">you know sex feminist so they had sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.420" end="00:27:04.690" style="s2">of teamed up and been working on anti</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.190" end="00:27:06.940" style="s2">porn stuff and now they needed a new</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.690" end="00:27:09.340" style="s2">issue and they settled on sex</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.940" end="00:27:11.050" style="s2">trafficking they settled on being anti</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.340" end="00:27:12.550" style="s2">prostitution and there&#39;s actually all</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.050" end="00:27:14.260" style="s2">this stuff about them sort of talking</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.550" end="00:27:16.120" style="s2">and coming to the idea that most</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.260" end="00:27:17.380" style="s2">Americans at the time were even becoming</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.120" end="00:27:19.180" style="s2">more and more comfortable with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.380" end="00:27:21.640" style="s2">of legalizing or decriminalizing</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.180" end="00:27:23.290" style="s2">prostitution and that in order to draw</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.640" end="00:27:24.550" style="s2">up support for you know these sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.290" end="00:27:27.000" style="s2">policies they were gonna have to reframe</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.550" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">it as sex trafficking and reframe</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.000" end="00:27:30.970" style="s2">arresting the customers of it as ending</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:32.980" style="s2">demand for sex trafficking</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.970" end="00:27:37.510" style="s2">so it&#39;s sort of been a concerted</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.980" end="00:27:42.190" style="s2">strategy use the radical feminists get</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.510" end="00:27:46.600" style="s2">involved and they want to end access to</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.190" end="00:27:48.250" style="s2">sexual partners for men it&#39;s or they</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.600" end="00:27:50.740" style="s2">think that yeah or they&#39;re under some</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.250" end="00:27:52.710" style="s2">you know that sort of silly like oh by</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.740" end="00:27:55.500" style="s2">letting men pay for sex then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.710" end="00:27:57.880" style="s2">promoting and objectification of women</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.500" end="00:28:00.070" style="s2">reinforcing the patriarchy right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.880" end="00:28:01.750" style="s2">just that all that sort of I&#39;d be remiss</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.070" end="00:28:04.090" style="s2">if I let this go without commenting that</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.750" end="00:28:07.030" style="s2">it&#39;s a the radical feminists tend to</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.090" end="00:28:09.640" style="s2">want to sort of enforce the sex cartels</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.030" end="00:28:11.290" style="s2">and like it&#39;s a way of limiting sexual</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.640" end="00:28:13.150" style="s2">access for men whether it&#39;s through</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.290" end="00:28:15.040" style="s2">pornography prostitution</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.150" end="00:28:16.270" style="s2">don&#39;t you dare masturbate any of those</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.040" end="00:28:18.700" style="s2">things and then you find this very</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.270" end="00:28:21.400" style="s2">strange alliance between the religious</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.700" end="00:28:23.710" style="s2">right and hard courts or rightist people</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.400" end="00:28:26.920" style="s2">teaming up yes with the radical</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.710" end="00:28:29.170" style="s2">feminists in order to shame people like</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.920" end="00:28:30.400" style="s2">individual actions and consensual sexual</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.170" end="00:28:32.020" style="s2">activities yeah when I say radical</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.400" end="00:28:33.370" style="s2">feminists I don&#39;t mean just like really</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.020" end="00:28:35.680" style="s2">really feminists like it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.370" end="00:28:37.510" style="s2">specific sect of Furness like I consider</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.680" end="00:28:38.770" style="s2">myself a feminist you know there are all</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.510" end="00:28:41.920" style="s2">sorts of different kinds but um</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.770" end="00:28:43.660" style="s2">definitely but yes so they combined and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.920" end="00:28:47.680" style="s2">they sort of they started pushing this</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.660" end="00:28:49.900" style="s2">legislation I mean why it&#39;s bad is so</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.680" end="00:28:51.220" style="s2">many reasons you know the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.900" end="00:28:53.380" style="s2">we&#39;ve just been discussing is the fact</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.220" end="00:28:55.090" style="s2">that it it catches up a lot of innocent</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.380" end="00:28:57.430" style="s2">people who are adults just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.090" end="00:28:58.720" style="s2">engage in consensual sexual activity and</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.430" end="00:29:00.730" style="s2">throws them into the criminal justice</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.720" end="00:29:02.440" style="s2">system and all sorts of horrible</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.730" end="00:29:03.430" style="s2">outcomes and records and you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.440" end="00:29:05.140" style="s2">sometimes even registered as a sex</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.430" end="00:29:07.090" style="s2">offender and all sorts of stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.140" end="00:29:10.570" style="s2">and there&#39;s more like this adds an extra</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.090" end="00:29:12.230" style="s2">layer of prosecution on the top of just</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.570" end="00:29:13.460" style="s2">solicitation and prostitution</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.230" end="00:29:14.840" style="s2">they&#39;re so they&#39;re ramping up the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.460" end="00:29:16.910" style="s2">charges for these things because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.840" end="00:29:18.500" style="s2">saying well now we&#39;re going for some</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.910" end="00:29:20.540" style="s2">people like yeah ramp that you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.500" end="00:29:22.730" style="s2">penalty up for I mean in in Seattle they</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.540" end="00:29:25.460" style="s2">even redefined soliciting prostitution</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.730" end="00:29:27.230" style="s2">as soliciting someone for sexual</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.460" end="00:29:28.820" style="s2">exploitation or something like that like</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.230" end="00:29:30.830" style="s2">it says it in the new town its</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.820" end="00:29:33.559" style="s2">exploitive no matter what yeah yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.830" end="00:29:35.870" style="s2">so yes so it&#39;s you know bad for sex</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.559" end="00:29:40.250" style="s2">workers bad for people who want to pay</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.870" end="00:29:43.520" style="s2">for sex or it&#39;s bad for sex trafficking</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.250" end="00:29:46.100" style="s2">victims because they&#39;re spending so much</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.520" end="00:29:47.360" style="s2">time you know a they&#39;re spending so much</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.100" end="00:29:48.620" style="s2">time doing this other stuff with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.360" end="00:29:49.669" style="s2">money that they&#39;re supposed to be using</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.620" end="00:29:53.690" style="s2">to try and help people who are actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.669" end="00:29:55.280" style="s2">in trouble right and be they are driving</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.690" end="00:29:57.320" style="s2">things deeper into the shadows with a</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.280" end="00:29:58.130" style="s2">lot of their policies and you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.320" end="00:29:59.299" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole lot of different ways</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.130" end="00:30:02.090" style="s2">they&#39;re doing that but the the net</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.299" end="00:30:04.910" style="s2">effect is that it&#39;s made people less</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.090" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">willing to you know be customers less</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.910" end="00:30:08.720" style="s2">willing to be screened people less</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:11.480" style="s2">willing to be communicating in open ways</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.720" end="00:30:13.580" style="s2">and therefore both makes you know it</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.480" end="00:30:15.080" style="s2">more likely for people to be explained</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.580" end="00:30:16.669" style="s2">without anyone knowing and harder for</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.080" end="00:30:19.490" style="s2">the cops to actually find them and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.669" end="00:30:22.100" style="s2">know when people are in trouble and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.490" end="00:30:23.809" style="s2">just at the the larger level though it</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.100" end="00:30:26.299" style="s2">there&#39;s all sorts of ways that harms</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.809" end="00:30:27.980" style="s2">people just not at all connected to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.299" end="00:30:30.860" style="s2">sex industry or anything okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.980" end="00:30:32.660" style="s2">because we your politicians have really</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.860" end="00:30:35.210" style="s2">learned over the past 15 years that they</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.660" end="00:30:37.220" style="s2">can use sex trafficking as a way to pass</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.210" end="00:30:39.169" style="s2">pretty much anything and so there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.220" end="00:30:40.940" style="s2">every two or three years these giant</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.169" end="00:30:43.100" style="s2">bills and at the federal level and also</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.940" end="00:30:45.020" style="s2">various state houses and they will tuck</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.100" end="00:30:46.790" style="s2">all sorts of stuff into it all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.020" end="00:30:49.160" style="s2">sort of civil liberties infringement and</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.790" end="00:30:51.770" style="s2">various things into it and in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.160" end="00:30:55.610" style="s2">sort of regulating the Internet in terms</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.770" end="00:30:56.690" style="s2">of you know sort of surveillance and</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.610" end="00:30:58.400" style="s2">creating you know giving giving</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.690" end="00:31:00.590" style="s2">government permission to do warrantless</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.400" end="00:31:02.780" style="s2">wiretapping on things and various things</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.590" end="00:31:05.000" style="s2">and so there&#39;s just been a whole and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.780" end="00:31:06.830" style="s2">know as a result of this - I mean one of</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.000" end="00:31:08.650" style="s2">the most recent examples is fast I mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.830" end="00:31:10.970" style="s2">get into that in a second but it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.650" end="00:31:13.520" style="s2">resulted in people cracking down on</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.970" end="00:31:15.530" style="s2">speech and on images online just more</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.520" end="00:31:16.760" style="s2">broadly in a way that just affects the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.530" end="00:31:18.380" style="s2">whole internet just affects everybody</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.760" end="00:31:20.210" style="s2">because they&#39;re so worried about running</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.380" end="00:31:22.070" style="s2">afoul of these sex trafficking laws that</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.210" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">now they&#39;re just preemptively you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.070" end="00:31:25.920" style="s2">banning all sorts of speech</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.240" end="00:31:27.870" style="s2">you mentioned FAFSA and we&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.920" end="00:31:30.630" style="s2">to that we&#39;re gonna also get to social</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.870" end="00:31:33.780" style="s2">media and internet censorship and an</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.630" end="00:31:35.340" style="s2">infringement on on freedom of speech but</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.780" end="00:31:38.160" style="s2">one thing I wanted to follow up on there</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.340" end="00:31:40.740" style="s2">was you you mentioned that they&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.160" end="00:31:43.110" style="s2">you know jurisdictions are using the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.740" end="00:31:44.580" style="s2">guise of sex trafficking in order to</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.110" end="00:31:47.340" style="s2">sort of like pass bills and increase</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.580" end="00:31:50.700" style="s2">their budgets do you think that the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.340" end="00:31:53.790" style="s2">the false threat of sex trafficking has</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.700" end="00:31:56.010" style="s2">led in part to the militarization of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.790" end="00:31:57.660" style="s2">local police forces of they they use</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.010" end="00:32:00.150" style="s2">this as a way to get more money and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.660" end="00:32:01.980" style="s2">ramp up their their budgets and buy more</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.150" end="00:32:03.900" style="s2">equipment and get that leftover US</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.980" end="00:32:05.220" style="s2">military gear and they&#39;re just not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.900" end="00:32:07.290" style="s2">not just like the guy walking down the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.220" end="00:32:08.940" style="s2">street with this nightstick like running</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.290" end="00:32:11.010" style="s2">it along the fences anymore I mean these</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.940" end="00:32:13.440" style="s2">are like heavily equipped heavily armed</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.010" end="00:32:15.450" style="s2">serious sort of paramilitary operations</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.440" end="00:32:18.210" style="s2">I mean is that are you seeing that as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.450" end="00:32:21.150" style="s2">result of this sort of madness I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.210" end="00:32:23.670" style="s2">most of that came from sort of the drug</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.150" end="00:32:25.410" style="s2">war and then the aughts that like sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.670" end="00:32:26.970" style="s2">of terror budgets that police</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.410" end="00:32:31.020" style="s2">departments had I don&#39;t think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.970" end="00:32:34.200" style="s2">the the militarization stuff came from</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.020" end="00:32:35.640" style="s2">this but what I do see is two things any</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.200" end="00:32:37.920" style="s2">departments that hardly we&#39;re doing any</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.640" end="00:32:40.350" style="s2">sort of Vice stings at all before then</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.920" end="00:32:41.790" style="s2">they get these grants to do to do sex</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.350" end="00:32:43.559" style="s2">trafficking stings and which just turn</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.790" end="00:32:45.110" style="s2">out effectively as vice stings so</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.559" end="00:32:46.620" style="s2">they&#39;re doing you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.110" end="00:32:48.330" style="s2">prostitutions things that they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.620" end="00:32:50.010" style="s2">before but they also end up sweeping up</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.330" end="00:32:51.330" style="s2">just a ton of people I mean they arrest</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.010" end="00:32:53.130" style="s2">you all for drugs they adjust you for</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.330" end="00:32:54.630" style="s2">driving on an expired license for having</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.130" end="00:32:57.000" style="s2">unpaid Court funds I mean every time you</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.630" end="00:32:58.590" style="s2">look there&#39;s dozens of people so they</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.000" end="00:33:00.660" style="s2">sort of just use it as a dragnet to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.590" end="00:33:02.070" style="s2">anybody who&#39;s done anything wrong at a</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.660" end="00:33:03.240" style="s2">very petty level these aren&#39;t like big</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.070" end="00:33:06.929" style="s2">criminals that they&#39;re catching it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.240" end="00:33:11.510" style="s2">like unpaid court fines and then also</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.929" end="00:33:15.929" style="s2">the they work with Homeland Security and</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.510" end="00:33:17.640" style="s2">ice and with the FBI and with the US</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.929" end="00:33:19.559" style="s2">Marshals and all sorts of stuff on these</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.640" end="00:33:21.960" style="s2">anti-sex trafficking operations all the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.559" end="00:33:24.600" style="s2">time so they do end up very militarized</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.960" end="00:33:26.220" style="s2">in practice he sort of SWAT raids on</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.600" end="00:33:27.750" style="s2">hotel rooms I mean there&#39;s some footage</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.220" end="00:33:30.000" style="s2">of the FBI&#39;s operation cross country</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.750" end="00:33:32.429" style="s2">which is this big annual and online and</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.000" end="00:33:34.559" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really disturbing to watch</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.429" end="00:33:37.170" style="s2">because it&#39;s just this you know gaggle</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.559" end="00:33:39.480" style="s2">of men in the Swat gear busting into</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.170" end="00:33:41.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a woman who looks like she&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.480" end="00:33:43.770" style="s2">even 18 years old and you know underwear</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.610" end="00:33:45.060" style="s2">boy shorts and a tank top and you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.770" end="00:33:46.590" style="s2">sitting on the bed crying and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.060" end="00:33:47.850" style="s2">busting in to arrest her after she just</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.590" end="00:33:50.640" style="s2">thought she was you know me you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.850" end="00:33:52.080" style="s2">customer and it&#39;s just it&#39;s very it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.640" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">very disturbing the way they handle this</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.080" end="00:33:55.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s very traumatizing the way that</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:56.730" style="s2">they treat these people who they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.200" end="00:33:58.110" style="s2">saying well we need to find out if</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.730" end="00:34:02.250" style="s2">they&#39;re victims and then they often</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.110" end="00:34:04.710" style="s2">arrest them and they make them victims</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.250" end="00:34:06.870" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s you know it&#39;s I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.710" end="00:34:08.940" style="s2">obviously we should make it very clear</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.870" end="00:34:11.610" style="s2">that like in any instances like kid</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.940" end="00:34:13.050" style="s2">being transported and forced in the sex</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.610" end="00:34:15.090" style="s2">work and stuff we&#39;re obviously very</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.050" end="00:34:16.919" style="s2">adamantly opposed to that and we really</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.090" end="00:34:18.870" style="s2">would like to see that taken care of but</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.919" end="00:34:21.990" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing though is like just a</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.870" end="00:34:24.960" style="s2">crazed overstatement of the case</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.990" end="00:34:27.030" style="s2">totally inflated facts using this as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.960" end="00:34:28.350" style="s2">weapon as a way to go after and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.030" end="00:34:30.179" style="s2">gonna get to even like the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.350" end="00:34:32.429" style="s2">picture issues but as using it as a way</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.179" end="00:34:34.980" style="s2">to go after you know just local people</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.429" end="00:34:36.810" style="s2">doing local things that we both at least</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.980" end="00:34:39.030" style="s2">in our sort of libertarian perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.810" end="00:34:40.980" style="s2">believe should be left to individual</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.030" end="00:34:42.810" style="s2">adults is to decide what&#39;s what&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.980" end="00:34:43.980" style="s2">for them but also and it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.810" end="00:34:45.780" style="s2">people will try to do this all the time</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.980" end="00:34:47.400" style="s2">- yeah with with me writing on this</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.780" end="00:34:49.050" style="s2">subject try to say you know why do you</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.400" end="00:34:50.250" style="s2">care more about them than the victims</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.050" end="00:34:53.250" style="s2">why do you care more about these people</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.250" end="00:34:55.590" style="s2">and it&#39;s like I don&#39;t I mean I care</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.250" end="00:34:57.630" style="s2">about both and I think that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.590" end="00:34:59.130" style="s2">doing actively harms the victims I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.630" end="00:35:01.890" style="s2">especially just because we&#39;re not at all</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.130" end="00:35:03.060" style="s2">treating the people who need you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.890" end="00:35:05.610" style="s2">finding the people who are needed</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.060" end="00:35:07.410" style="s2">because the people who actually are end</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.610" end="00:35:09.150" style="s2">up sort of you know coerced and forced</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.410" end="00:35:11.040" style="s2">into prostitution and even occasionally</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.150" end="00:35:13.530" style="s2">abducted and things like that and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.040" end="00:35:15.120" style="s2">it&#39;s bad stuff and if they&#39;re underage</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.530" end="00:35:17.040" style="s2">they tend to be foster children it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.120" end="00:35:19.500" style="s2">like 75 percent of them come from foster</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.040" end="00:35:21.420" style="s2">care or state care because they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.500" end="00:35:22.830" style="s2">I guess you know state cares are so</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.420" end="00:35:24.330" style="s2">horrible in so many situations that</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.830" end="00:35:27.270" style="s2">they&#39;re just runaways so they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.330" end="00:35:29.220" style="s2">constantly running away and also when it</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.270" end="00:35:30.570" style="s2">comes to adults it&#39;s usually a domestic</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.220" end="00:35:32.250" style="s2">violence sort of situation or very</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.570" end="00:35:33.450" style="s2">frequently a domestic violence sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.250" end="00:35:35.400" style="s2">situation you know where the person</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.450" end="00:35:36.780" style="s2">thinks that they&#39;re in love with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.400" end="00:35:38.340" style="s2">partner and then they&#39;re abusing them</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.780" end="00:35:39.420" style="s2">and taking advantage of them and taking</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.340" end="00:35:40.800" style="s2">their money and making them you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.420" end="00:35:42.720" style="s2">work in prostitution you know so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.800" end="00:35:44.280" style="s2">you know if they don&#39;t want to so those</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.720" end="00:35:45.480" style="s2">are I mean those are yeah those are</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.280" end="00:35:47.490" style="s2">serious problems that I care about those</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.480" end="00:35:50.310" style="s2">things that it&#39;s like by focusing on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.490" end="00:35:51.089" style="s2">sudden you know imaginary mythical idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.310" end="00:35:53.130" style="s2">of sex trafficking</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.089" end="00:35:55.170" style="s2">we&#39;re not devoting any resources to</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.130" end="00:35:56.339" style="s2">those things first and foremost like</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.170" end="00:35:58.440" style="s2">figuring out what the heck is going on</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.339" end="00:36:00.180" style="s2">with the state you know care of children</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.440" end="00:36:01.650" style="s2">that are underage like why is it so bad</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.180" end="00:36:03.450" style="s2">that the vast majority of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.650" end="00:36:05.579" style="s2">being who are minors in the sex trade</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.450" end="00:36:07.259" style="s2">are supposed to be being taken care of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.579" end="00:36:08.430" style="s2">by the government and meanwhile they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.259" end="00:36:10.079" style="s2">just spending all their time arresting</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.430" end="00:36:12.180" style="s2">adult sex workers instead of figuring</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.079" end="00:36:13.410" style="s2">that out it&#39;s just like right and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.180" end="00:36:15.719" style="s2">know a similar thing happens with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.410" end="00:36:17.729" style="s2">inflated campus rates rape statistics</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.719" end="00:36:20.460" style="s2">you know what happens is it distracts</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.729" end="00:36:23.369" style="s2">from the real issue and it harms actual</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.460" end="00:36:25.289" style="s2">victims if everybody is a victimizer and</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.369" end="00:36:27.509" style="s2">everybody is a victim then the people</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.289" end="00:36:29.430" style="s2">that are actually suffering from sexual</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.509" end="00:36:30.989" style="s2">violence are are not getting the care</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.430" end="00:36:33.210" style="s2">attention and resources that they should</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.989" end="00:36:34.979" style="s2">get so that&#39;s really what this is all</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.210" end="00:36:38.880" style="s2">about right now there are actual</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.979" end="00:36:41.219" style="s2">follow-on consequences to this that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.880" end="00:36:42.809" style="s2">even more impactful or more widespread</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.219" end="00:36:44.670" style="s2">and so why don&#39;t we start talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.809" end="00:36:47.069" style="s2">that a little bit what what has evolved</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.670" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">out of this conversation and joined</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.069" end="00:36:53.249" style="s2">infused and some weird mad you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.920" end="00:36:55.349" style="s2">marriage mutated marriage and resulted</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.249" end="00:36:58.920" style="s2">in and basically like the end of free</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.349" end="00:37:00.239" style="s2">speech too dramatic but it&#39;s on it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.920" end="00:37:01.890" style="s2">on our way there I mean it&#39;s chipping</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.239" end="00:37:03.180" style="s2">away at it so we&#39;ll start my thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.890" end="00:37:05.670" style="s2">when I get in the back page and all that</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.180" end="00:37:08.569" style="s2">now yes so FASTA was a law passed last</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.670" end="00:37:11.700" style="s2">year in this in the winter or spring and</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.569" end="00:37:13.559" style="s2">it may be in the works for a while and</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.700" end="00:37:17.369" style="s2">various forms but they finally got it</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.559" end="00:37:18.479" style="s2">through it effectively it was described</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.369" end="00:37:20.039" style="s2">a lot as being a law that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.479" end="00:37:22.950" style="s2">illegal to advertise sex trafficking</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.039" end="00:37:25.170" style="s2">victims online that is not a thing that</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.950" end="00:37:27.089" style="s2">was legal before this law it was not</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.170" end="00:37:28.680" style="s2">okay to actively advertise sex</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.089" end="00:37:30.690" style="s2">trafficking victims online before this</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.680" end="00:37:33.390" style="s2">so I mean that&#39;s just--that&#39;s crap that</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.690" end="00:37:35.160" style="s2">this is what that law did the federal</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.390" end="00:37:37.769" style="s2">government explicitly passed the law in</p>

<p begin="00:40:32.789" end="00:40:36.480" style="s2">that we started to see people crack down</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.559" end="00:40:38.549" style="s2">on all sorts of speech which is why and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.480" end="00:40:40.500" style="s2">you know it&#39;s hard to say exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.549" end="00:40:43.049" style="s2">much of any particular new policy is</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.500" end="00:40:44.730" style="s2">related to FASTA and some of them</p>

<p begin="00:40:45.569" end="00:40:48.780" style="s2">because of FASTA it&#39;s because of</p>

<p begin="00:44:57.100" end="00:45:00.520" style="s2">isn&#39;t inherently sort of traumatizing</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.660" end="00:45:03.190" style="s2">and negative experience I mean I never</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.520" end="00:45:05.950" style="s2">so it&#39;s yeah well thank you thank you</p>

<p begin="00:45:07.000" end="00:45:12.540" style="s2">the whole SlutWalk phenomenon has sort</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.730" end="00:45:14.920" style="s2">of evaporated hasn&#39;t it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.540" end="00:45:18.610" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s not really like a public</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.920" end="00:45:20.440" style="s2">push for like more sexual acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.610" end="00:45:21.880" style="s2">these days it&#39;s actually it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.440" end="00:45:24.520" style="s2">the opposite and that&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.880" end="00:45:26.050" style="s2">manifestation of like kids these days</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.520" end="00:45:27.910" style="s2">aren&#39;t having as much sex and drinking</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.050" end="00:45:29.560" style="s2">as much or driving as much for going on</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.910" end="00:45:31.660" style="s2">as many dates or having as much fun or</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.560" end="00:45:32.830" style="s2">going outside as much they&#39;re just</p>

<p begin="00:45:32.830" end="00:45:36.850" style="s2">phones getting depressed and anxious</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.130" end="00:45:39.190" style="s2">well you know I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.850" end="00:45:41.500" style="s2">phenomenon that can be applied in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.190" end="00:45:44.230" style="s2">of scenarios we&#39;re like the more equal</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.500" end="00:45:48.990" style="s2">of society becomes then each instance of</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.230" end="00:45:48.990" style="s2">inequality gets amplified even more so</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.820" end="00:45:55.540" style="s2">groups that have someone to comment tend</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.930" end="00:45:57.790" style="s2">to yeah fight or amplify the things that</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.540" end="00:45:59.950" style="s2">are then right and and so we see that</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.790" end="00:46:02.800" style="s2">sort of in so many different</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.950" end="00:46:03.640" style="s2">circumstances that&#39;s interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.800" end="00:46:06.040" style="s2">hadn&#39;t really thought about that</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.640" end="00:46:09.850" style="s2">SlutWalk phenomenon that&#39;s cond that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.040" end="00:46:11.740" style="s2">gone that&#39;s gone I know and it would you</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.850" end="00:46:13.900" style="s2">would you would feel it would feel out</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.740" end="00:46:15.040" style="s2">of context or slightly wrong or</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.900" end="00:46:19.540" style="s2">something if it happened again today</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.040" end="00:46:23.470" style="s2">yeah yeah I you know I saw I you know I</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.540" end="00:46:27.580" style="s2">was in you know grade school and junior</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.470" end="00:46:29.380" style="s2">high when the sort of 90s riot girls</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.580" end="00:46:31.900" style="s2">stuff was was happening and you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.380" end="00:46:33.670" style="s2">that that sort of wave of feminism but</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.900" end="00:46:35.650" style="s2">you know I I remember like looking at</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.670" end="00:46:37.600" style="s2">like bitch magazine and stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.650" end="00:46:40.090" style="s2">they&#39;re always like I always I use the</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.600" end="00:46:41.680" style="s2">like crocheted dildo covers it was just</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.090" end="00:46:44.230" style="s2">like every other ad was for a crocheted</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.680" end="00:46:46.390" style="s2">dildo cover but I feel like there was</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.230" end="00:46:47.920" style="s2">this version of sort of and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.390" end="00:46:49.090" style="s2">I thought of as being third wave the</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.920" end="00:46:50.080" style="s2">wave conversation is not very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.090" end="00:46:51.100" style="s2">cuz I think we all say different things</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.080" end="00:46:52.359" style="s2">but you know that&#39;s what I thought of</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.100" end="00:46:54.640" style="s2">his third wave feminists</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.359" end="00:46:56.499" style="s2">you know ii was the 60s through the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.640" end="00:46:58.299" style="s2">Andrea Dworkin porn Wars but now we had</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.499" end="00:47:00.609" style="s2">these people who were like interested in</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.299" end="00:47:01.690" style="s2">pop culture they were you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.609" end="00:47:03.220" style="s2">they&#39;d you were like I can wear a</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.690" end="00:47:04.660" style="s2">lipstick and dress slutty and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.220" end="00:47:07.749" style="s2">not even slutty but I can just pretty</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.660" end="00:47:09.759" style="s2">and care about my looks and great</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.749" end="00:47:11.829" style="s2">emphasis on choice so it was very</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.759" end="00:47:13.599" style="s2">positive towards some sex workers but it</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.829" end="00:47:15.730" style="s2">was very positive towards women owning</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.599" end="00:47:17.950" style="s2">their sexuality and you know things like</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.730" end="00:47:20.529" style="s2">that and I feel like even though it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.950" end="00:47:22.470" style="s2">maybe changed it was sort of a steady</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.529" end="00:47:25.900" style="s2">trend in that direction and feminism</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.470" end="00:47:29.499" style="s2">until recently and then it&#39;s just now</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.900" end="00:47:32.739" style="s2">then it&#39;s changed yeah I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.499" end="00:47:34.269" style="s2">like we&#39;re like careening wildly off my</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.739" end="00:47:35.410" style="s2">topic list but this is awesome because</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.269" end="00:47:37.569" style="s2">because this is actually very</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.410" end="00:47:40.089" style="s2">interesting I think I think that part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.569" end="00:47:42.789" style="s2">the the sort of anti sex element within</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.089" end="00:47:46.269" style="s2">the feminist movement has been generated</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.789" end="00:47:48.759" style="s2">by their sort of battles over what Trant</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.269" end="00:47:50.890" style="s2">the trans issue right and like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.759" end="00:47:52.930" style="s2">really it&#39;s really put a big divider in</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.890" end="00:47:55.390" style="s2">that sort of radical gender feminist</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.930" end="00:47:58.180" style="s2">community of like who actually is even a</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.390" end="00:47:59.859" style="s2">man who actually is even a woman and if</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.180" end="00:48:01.900" style="s2">you&#39;re having sex with that person are</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.859" end="00:48:03.640" style="s2">you reinforcing the patriarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.900" end="00:48:06.009" style="s2">you&#39;re not doing your duty as a feminist</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.640" end="00:48:08.019" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve gotten a lot of trouble for</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.009" end="00:48:10.299" style="s2">talking about sex and feminism and</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.019" end="00:48:12.430" style="s2">whether or not feminists have like you</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.299" end="00:48:14.920" style="s2">know sexual fantasies that veer towards</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.430" end="00:48:17.140" style="s2">you know you know violent or dominating</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.920" end="00:48:19.539" style="s2">or whatever like I&#39;ve got I&#39;ve dipped my</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.140" end="00:48:21.880" style="s2">toe in this conversation before but it</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.539" end="00:48:24.460" style="s2">fascinates me to no end that I end up</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.880" end="00:48:27.249" style="s2">arguing on behalf of the rights of women</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.460" end="00:48:28.869" style="s2">to make their own choices yeah I mean so</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.249" end="00:48:30.369" style="s2">that&#39;s what and I know now I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.869" end="00:48:33.400" style="s2">enough your topic list even further but</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.369" end="00:48:36.099" style="s2">I should use this opportunity to plug I</p>

<p begin="00:48:40.749" end="00:48:45.069" style="s2">goal is to promote libertarian feminism</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.700" end="00:48:49.900" style="s2">because you know a Bert Aryan friend</p>

<p begin="00:48:49.900" end="00:48:54.039" style="s2">discovered that I was I just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.480" end="00:48:55.119" style="s2">discovered feminism around the same time</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.039" end="00:48:56.019" style="s2">I discovered the Praetorian ism and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.119" end="00:48:57.819" style="s2">thought that there was never any</p>

<p begin="00:49:02.280" end="00:49:07.230" style="s2">longer than that even so but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.890" end="00:49:09.690" style="s2">identify with many people and you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.230" end="00:49:11.700" style="s2">mainstream feminism I think that right</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.690" end="00:49:13.590" style="s2">now there&#39;s just such a solution to</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.700" end="00:49:16.410" style="s2">identify problems that are real but then</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.590" end="00:49:18.960" style="s2">reach for the wrong the wrong solutions</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.410" end="00:49:20.700" style="s2">to them and then also the tendency which</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.960" end="00:49:23.100" style="s2">is just very common in politics across</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.700" end="00:49:24.720" style="s2">the board though to then even exaggerate</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.100" end="00:49:26.340" style="s2">and you know yet the bad statistic and</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.720" end="00:49:29.190" style="s2">that sort of stuff the hyperbole in</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.340" end="00:49:30.480" style="s2">service of the solution to the problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.190" end="00:49:32.820" style="s2">which is about solution anyways</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.480" end="00:49:35.280" style="s2">and so I mean I think that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.820" end="00:49:38.700" style="s2">things that I really try to do is focus</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.280" end="00:49:40.650" style="s2">on usually people kind of be like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.700" end="00:49:42.270" style="s2">just a stupid issue altogether the</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.650" end="00:49:44.640" style="s2">feminine feminists are talking about or</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.270" end="00:49:46.260" style="s2">like here&#39;s the issue and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.640" end="00:49:47.730" style="s2">feel like this way about it or that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.260" end="00:49:49.230" style="s2">so I think that you know one of our</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.730" end="00:49:52.410" style="s2">things we&#39;re trying to do is is try and</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.230" end="00:49:54.000" style="s2">not be negative about a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.410" end="00:49:56.340" style="s2">things that are important to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.000" end="00:49:59.510" style="s2">but try and encourage you know non-state</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.340" end="00:50:01.650" style="s2">solutions on sort of a intense</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.510" end="00:50:03.630" style="s2">authoritarianism both both from the</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.650" end="00:50:05.340" style="s2">state and at a cultural level you know I</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.630" end="00:50:07.950" style="s2">think the thing that always struck me</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.340" end="00:50:11.340" style="s2">about the evolution of feminism was that</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.950" end="00:50:14.760" style="s2">if if to me I always thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.340" end="00:50:17.580" style="s2">about celebrating female agency yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.760" end="00:50:19.080" style="s2">and the ability for women to that that</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.580" end="00:50:20.790" style="s2">but they have the capability to make</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.080" end="00:50:22.470" style="s2">their own choices I mean it seems absurd</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.790" end="00:50:23.760" style="s2">to even like lay it out like this but</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.470" end="00:50:25.290" style="s2">they have the capability to make their</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.760" end="00:50:27.360" style="s2">own choices and that they should be</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.290" end="00:50:28.440" style="s2">empowered to make those choices and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.360" end="00:50:29.760" style="s2">there&#39;s like the third thing that people</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.440" end="00:50:31.200" style="s2">don&#39;t want to talk about which is like</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.760" end="00:50:33.450" style="s2">and then everybody has to live with</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.200" end="00:50:36.300" style="s2">their choices right and that includes</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.450" end="00:50:39.120" style="s2">other women living with the choices that</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.300" end="00:50:41.310" style="s2">other women are making and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.120" end="00:50:42.870" style="s2">I started to see this like inherent</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.310" end="00:50:45.300" style="s2">contradiction this sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.870" end="00:50:46.410" style="s2">coerciveness that wasn&#39;t that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.300" end="00:50:48.600" style="s2">jive with some notion of like</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.410" end="00:50:51.630" style="s2">libertarian feminism which I love that I</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.600" end="00:50:54.060" style="s2">love that idea and and that&#39;s when I</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.630" end="00:50:56.310" style="s2">found myself like arguing on behalf of</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.060" end="00:50:59.820" style="s2">women&#39;s agency and women&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.310" end="00:51:02.070" style="s2">against feminists which to me is just a</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.820" end="00:51:03.690" style="s2">fascinating position to be and so I like</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.070" end="00:51:06.990" style="s2">really indulged it and took it that far</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.690" end="00:51:09.900" style="s2">but the fact that you have identified a</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.990" end="00:51:11.820" style="s2">need for something called</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.900" end="00:51:14.170" style="s2">libertarian feminism I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.820" end="00:51:16.630" style="s2">fantastic I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.170" end="00:51:19.539" style="s2">yeah like you know there&#39;s a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.630" end="00:51:20.619" style="s2">classical liberal writers you know sort</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.539" end="00:51:22.359" style="s2">of the classical liberal tradition there</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.619" end="00:51:23.890" style="s2">was a lot of feminist writers and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.359" end="00:51:26.140" style="s2">they kind of went by the name into</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.890" end="00:51:27.759" style="s2">individualist feminist Scott it&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.140" end="00:51:29.739" style="s2">would say until the seventies there was</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.759" end="00:51:32.170" style="s2">a Association of libertarian feminists</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.739" end="00:51:33.819" style="s2">founded in the 70s so it&#39;s been I mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.170" end="00:51:36.160" style="s2">it&#39;s been a strain of and I think a much</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.819" end="00:51:38.799" style="s2">bigger strain back win back a long time</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.160" end="00:51:40.630" style="s2">ago when there was less you know talk</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.799" end="00:51:42.460" style="s2">about things but there&#39;s always been</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.630" end="00:51:43.900" style="s2">there&#39;s always been this tension if you</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.460" end="00:51:45.730" style="s2">look at any era of feminism there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.900" end="00:51:47.109" style="s2">always been this tension between two</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.730" end="00:51:48.609" style="s2">sort of groups of feminism and I can</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.109" end="00:51:50.380" style="s2">call it like individualist versus</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.609" end="00:51:52.119" style="s2">socialist or whatever but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.380" end="00:51:55.690" style="s2">whatever name they take there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.119" end="00:51:59.079" style="s2">who&#39;s sort of yet once once women to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.690" end="00:52:01.630" style="s2">protected by either a state or you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.079" end="00:52:03.730" style="s2">a bureaucracy or thinks of women as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.630" end="00:52:05.799" style="s2">class that has sort of been historically</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.730" end="00:52:08.289" style="s2">downtrodden and then therefore needs</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.799" end="00:52:09.880" style="s2">extra protections or whatever or you</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.289" end="00:52:11.559" style="s2">know and then there&#39;s a class that sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.880" end="00:52:13.150" style="s2">of says women should be equals under the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.559" end="00:52:14.710" style="s2">law and then that&#39;s it like you know we</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.150" end="00:52:16.960" style="s2">don&#39;t want and so that&#39;s obviously on</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.710" end="00:52:18.910" style="s2">the lab the former centers the equals</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.960" end="00:52:20.619" style="s2">under the law side you know that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.910" end="00:52:22.180" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be we shouldn&#39;t be worrying</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.619" end="00:52:23.589" style="s2">about that the equality of outcomes per</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.180" end="00:52:25.569" style="s2">se we should be worried about treating</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.589" end="00:52:27.579" style="s2">men and women equal under the law so</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.569" end="00:52:28.839" style="s2">yeah and I mean this is a poly dump</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.579" end="00:52:31.390" style="s2">phrase but I&#39;m gonna test it on you I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.839" end="00:52:33.430" style="s2">been I heard someone say the thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.390" end="00:52:35.289" style="s2">recently about how you know feminism is</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.430" end="00:52:37.269" style="s2">what feminism is the radical notion that</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.289" end="00:52:39.279" style="s2">women are people that that saying yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.269" end="00:52:40.720" style="s2">libertarian feminism is the radical</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.279" end="00:52:42.789" style="s2">notion that women are people who can</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.720" end="00:52:44.769" style="s2">think for themselves right so right</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.789" end="00:52:47.470" style="s2">exactly and you know you when you laid</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.769" end="00:52:49.960" style="s2">out that first case and you said women</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.470" end="00:52:51.940" style="s2">looking to like it&#39;s like an appeal to</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.960" end="00:52:54.039" style="s2">an authority right to help sort of right</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.940" end="00:52:58.329" style="s2">the wrong and I think that we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.039" end="00:53:00.130" style="s2">that play out in sort of the the on</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.329" end="00:53:01.930" style="s2">college campuses where in the 60s and</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.130" end="00:53:04.089" style="s2">the 70s they wanted to get rid of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.930" end="00:53:06.519" style="s2">administration out of the out of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.089" end="00:53:08.259" style="s2">dorm room and locos parentis however the</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.519" end="00:53:10.690" style="s2">phrase was and they fought really hard</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.259" end="00:53:12.849" style="s2">to have the choice to do whatever they</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.690" end="00:53:14.829" style="s2">wanted which really meant like fuck and</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.849" end="00:53:16.210" style="s2">drink and smoke weed and do whatever</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.829" end="00:53:17.859" style="s2">they wanted because they were free from</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.210" end="00:53:21.190" style="s2">their parents and their their adults now</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.859" end="00:53:24.309" style="s2">and then now you&#39;ve got bias response</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.190" end="00:53:26.920" style="s2">teams on campuses and and administration</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.309" end="00:53:28.599" style="s2">urging students to narc on each other</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.920" end="00:53:30.069" style="s2">and every little sleight and every</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.599" end="00:53:31.960" style="s2">little bias is reported to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.069" end="00:53:33.490" style="s2">administration and you know I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.960" end="00:53:34.920" style="s2">a lot about this stuff through your</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.490" end="00:53:37.539" style="s2">colleague Robby</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.920" end="00:53:38.920" style="s2">suave Robby swab is work I mean it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.539" end="00:53:41.380" style="s2">great work on title nine I&#39;ll just plug</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.920" end="00:53:42.549" style="s2">that right now and and even in my own</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.380" end="00:53:44.049" style="s2">experience traveling to different</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.549" end="00:53:46.180" style="s2">college campuses getting feedback from</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.049" end="00:53:47.680" style="s2">people they&#39;re like it&#39;s so crazy you</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.180" end="00:53:50.289" style="s2">know I won&#39;t even try to date somebody</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.680" end="00:53:53.079" style="s2">on campus right so it&#39;s like that that</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.289" end="00:53:55.559" style="s2">feminist strain is like what has won out</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.079" end="00:53:59.230" style="s2">in terms of like the power Wars I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.559" end="00:54:00.640" style="s2">of this appeal to Authority so it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.230" end="00:54:02.529" style="s2">like frustrating about it too is that I</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.640" end="00:54:03.880" style="s2">mean I get why people are angry</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.529" end="00:54:05.079" style="s2">sometimes I don&#39;t mean all the time</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.880" end="00:54:06.849" style="s2">about all the reasons right but I do</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.079" end="00:54:08.380" style="s2">think that women have you know has some</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.849" end="00:54:10.779" style="s2">has some damn good reasons to be angry</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.380" end="00:54:14.109" style="s2">about certain things and I get why</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.779" end="00:54:16.599" style="s2">people are you know kind of I understand</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.109" end="00:54:18.220" style="s2">the impulse and not just for women if I</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.599" end="00:54:20.710" style="s2">wasn&#39;t but to be like we&#39;ve been treated</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.220" end="00:54:21.910" style="s2">this way so therefore we need to go and</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.710" end="00:54:24.819" style="s2">correct it we need to have a corrective</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.910" end="00:54:26.920" style="s2">and overcorrect but but that inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.819" end="00:54:28.420" style="s2">comes back and you know harms I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.920" end="00:54:29.859" style="s2">the group that is more marginalized to</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.420" end="00:54:32.710" style="s2">begin with because when you&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.859" end="00:54:33.640" style="s2">I mean a there&#39;s a resentment factor but</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.710" end="00:54:35.740" style="s2">I think be when you&#39;re creating</p>

<p begin="00:56:01.560" end="00:56:03.270" style="s2">violence</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.130" end="00:56:04.800" style="s2">I used to write about this a lot when I</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.270" end="00:56:06.420" style="s2">first started reason two and then I</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.800" end="00:56:07.680" style="s2">Robbie and I were both writing about</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.420" end="00:56:10.200" style="s2">this stuff and then he ended up sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.680" end="00:56:14.460" style="s2">there was he was taking enough gaming I</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.200" end="00:56:17.970" style="s2">was like I you know I we were both</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.460" end="00:56:21.690" style="s2">fighting about a lot of different I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.970" end="00:56:23.130" style="s2">take the heat for this but yes I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.690" end="00:56:25.050" style="s2">yeah I did a lot of research into those</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.130" end="00:56:27.000" style="s2">studies to it it&#39;s they&#39;re all so</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.050" end="00:56:29.340" style="s2">ridiculous and flawed and right</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.000" end="00:56:30.690" style="s2">it&#39;s and also again one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.340" end="00:56:32.220" style="s2">that struck me the most reading those</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.690" end="00:56:33.480" style="s2">back in the day when they would they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.220" end="00:56:36.330" style="s2">always sort of publishing here are the</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.480" end="00:56:38.310" style="s2">real stories on campus was the people</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.330" end="00:56:40.500" style="s2">didn&#39;t describe them often as sexual</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.310" end="00:56:42.780" style="s2">assault or rape and the only they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.500" end="00:56:44.610" style="s2">like self reporting right and they would</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.780" end="00:56:46.020" style="s2">even have the you know quotes from from</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.610" end="00:56:48.030" style="s2">college women saying you know like well</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.020" end="00:56:49.830" style="s2">I didn&#39;t think of it like that but the</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.030" end="00:56:51.780" style="s2">researchers then Anna stick you this one</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.830" end="00:56:53.100" style="s2">in The Washington Post which was but</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.780" end="00:56:54.540" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen a lot of them like this and it</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.100" end="00:56:56.640" style="s2">was like the research was then if they</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.540" end="00:56:59.820" style="s2">said though that a certain set of</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.640" end="00:57:01.710" style="s2">circumstances happen you know yeah or</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.820" end="00:57:02.940" style="s2">like they had felt uncomfortable not</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.710" end="00:57:05.190" style="s2">wanted to but didn&#39;t think they could</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.940" end="00:57:07.380" style="s2">say something then they just code that</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.190" end="00:57:09.540" style="s2">as assault right even if the respondent</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.380" end="00:57:11.070" style="s2">said it wasn&#39;t right yeah I mean sure</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.540" end="00:57:12.480" style="s2">someone could be not saying something</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.070" end="00:57:14.250" style="s2">because they were literally feeling</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.480" end="00:57:17.010" style="s2">threatened but like often if someone</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.250" end="00:57:19.470" style="s2">says oh I just felt on called me a mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.010" end="00:57:20.850" style="s2">that they just for whatever reason you</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.470" end="00:57:22.110" style="s2">know people are very uncomfortable in</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.850" end="00:57:24.690" style="s2">communicating in sex and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.110" end="00:57:26.370" style="s2">instead of teaching when I was reading</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.690" end="00:57:28.650" style="s2">those things what I was struck by was a</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.370" end="00:57:30.420" style="s2">that yeah researchers and you know media</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.650" end="00:57:31.740" style="s2">we&#39;re not respecting women&#39;s agency</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.420" end="00:57:33.810" style="s2">young women&#39;s agency when it came to</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.740" end="00:57:35.730" style="s2">them defining their own experiences but</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.810" end="00:57:36.900" style="s2">B that there was a lot of there is</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.730" end="00:57:39.210" style="s2">obviously a lot of room among young</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.900" end="00:57:40.860" style="s2">people in general to teach them better</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.210" end="00:57:43.740" style="s2">sexual etiquette that she said how to</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.860" end="00:57:45.270" style="s2">better understand partners cues to</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.740" end="00:57:46.800" style="s2">better understand and especially amongst</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.270" end="00:57:48.210" style="s2">these women there was so many of them</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.800" end="00:57:50.820" style="s2">saying I just didn&#39;t know how to tell</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.210" end="00:57:51.980" style="s2">them no I so I just froze or I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.820" end="00:57:53.869" style="s2">know what to say I found uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.980" end="00:57:55.850" style="s2">just decided to do it and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.869" end="00:57:57.530" style="s2">whatever and it&#39;s like assertiveness</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.850" end="00:57:58.609" style="s2">like young women I mean anything</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.530" end="00:58:00.560" style="s2">probably always but young women today</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.609" end="00:58:02.390" style="s2">have still have such a problem with</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.560" end="00:58:04.160" style="s2">sexual assertiveness and instead of</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.390" end="00:58:06.320" style="s2">focusing on why that is and how he can</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.160" end="00:58:07.850" style="s2">correct that everyone&#39;s like yep you</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.320" end="00:58:09.740" style="s2">know what we should just not expect them</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.850" end="00:58:11.150" style="s2">to say no then and we&#39;ll just decide but</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.740" end="00:58:12.560" style="s2">that&#39;s rape if they thought that it was</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.150" end="00:58:13.970" style="s2">you know I mean that&#39;s literally what</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.560" end="00:58:16.790" style="s2">these things are doing and it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.970" end="00:58:18.650" style="s2">it&#39;s right you know let&#39;s dig down on</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.790" end="00:58:20.480" style="s2">that a little bit where do you think</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.650" end="00:58:23.170" style="s2">that this sense comes from that women</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.480" end="00:58:25.730" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t or can&#39;t or incapable of being</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.170" end="00:58:27.560" style="s2">assertive in that in those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.730" end="00:58:29.600" style="s2">situations and like who benefits from</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.560" end="00:58:33.320" style="s2">that and where&#39;s that coming from</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.600" end="00:58:37.970" style="s2">I don&#39;t know because yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.320" end="00:58:39.560" style="s2">understand I mean I think that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.970" end="00:58:40.850" style="s2">probably it&#39;s one of those things</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.560" end="00:58:44.510" style="s2">sometimes where like there was a few bad</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.850" end="00:58:46.580" style="s2">examples that are that are real and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.510" end="00:58:47.990" style="s2">people take those and try to shove that</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.580" end="00:58:50.630" style="s2">and like you know obviously there are</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.990" end="00:58:52.850" style="s2">situations where someone has been too</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.630" end="00:58:54.859" style="s2">incapacitated literally in capacity you</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.850" end="00:58:57.290" style="s2">know unconscious drunk and or you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.859" end="00:58:59.150" style="s2">or was so traumatized because of</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.290" end="00:59:00.530" style="s2">previous whatever and I mean there are</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.150" end="00:59:03.800" style="s2">situations like that and the person</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.530" end="00:59:05.240" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been in trouble and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.800" end="00:59:07.670" style="s2">so like the thing that comes to mind to</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.240" end="00:59:09.140" style="s2">me like his louis c.k right like he</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.670" end="00:59:10.520" style="s2">basically would just like whip his dick</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.140" end="00:59:12.470" style="s2">out and start jerking off in front of</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.520" end="00:59:14.359" style="s2">girls but like they could have just</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.470" end="00:59:15.890" style="s2">gotten up and left but then they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.359" end="00:59:16.760" style="s2">they just sat there and then they blamed</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.890" end="00:59:18.380" style="s2">him for it later</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.760" end="00:59:19.970" style="s2">I mean sure you don&#39;t hey if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.380" end="00:59:21.770" style="s2">want to do it don&#39;t say no get up and</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.970" end="00:59:23.720" style="s2">leave I mean isn&#39;t it that easy and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.770" end="00:59:26.060" style="s2">remember the Z zones are a thing too and</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.720" end="00:59:27.590" style="s2">I kept telling to myself that that was a</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.060" end="00:59:29.690" style="s2">case in which the woman could have just</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.590" end="00:59:32.780" style="s2">gotten up and left but she didn&#39;t cuz</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.690" end="00:59:34.790" style="s2">she wanted it well I don&#39;t I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.780" end="00:59:36.710" style="s2">she wanted like the size she wanted she</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.790" end="00:59:38.270" style="s2">wanted to continue to be there straight</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.710" end="00:59:39.410" style="s2">she wanted to have a good impression of</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.270" end="00:59:40.580" style="s2">her if she weren&#39;t him to act</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.410" end="00:59:43.790" style="s2">differently and he wasn&#39;t acting</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.580" end="00:59:45.109" style="s2">differently but well and I think and</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.790" end="00:59:46.400" style="s2">this is again sort of one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.109" end="00:59:48.590" style="s2">where it&#39;s like okay how can we look at</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.400" end="00:59:50.359" style="s2">this in a way that is you know um</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.590" end="00:59:53.420" style="s2">constructive from him from this point</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.359" end="00:59:55.190" style="s2">like I look at this and I see not that</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.420" end="00:59:56.390" style="s2">it&#39;s just that that women do have a</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.190" end="00:59:58.130" style="s2">problem with this assertiveness and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.390" end="00:59:59.720" style="s2">like why yeah why is that even in those</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.130" end="01:00:01.940" style="s2">situations the comedians and the Izzy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.720" end="01:00:04.190" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry thing like I mean I think that</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.940" end="01:00:05.210" style="s2">yes I tend to read this and I get so mad</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.190" end="01:00:05.660" style="s2">sometimes and my first thing is just</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.210" end="01:00:08.480" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.660" end="01:00:09.829" style="s2">just leave just go then you think about</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.480" end="01:00:11.750" style="s2">it you&#39;re like I don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.829" end="01:00:13.640" style="s2">circumstances right and so for whatever</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.750" end="01:00:15.200" style="s2">reason if we assume these people are</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.640" end="01:00:16.670" style="s2">telling the truth you know forgive him</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.200" end="01:00:19.670" style="s2">the better for the doubt they did feel</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.670" end="01:00:21.589" style="s2">like they say they really did feel like</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.670" end="01:00:22.819" style="s2">that so why is that because even if they</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.589" end="01:00:24.049" style="s2">didn&#39;t in particular some people really</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.819" end="01:00:26.450" style="s2">do there are a lot of women it seems</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.049" end="01:00:28.480" style="s2">nowadays who really feel like just</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.450" end="01:00:31.039" style="s2">telling some man know is gonna get them</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.480" end="01:00:32.780" style="s2">assaulted or killed or whatever I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.039" end="01:00:34.010" style="s2">think that there I&#39;m shocked Holly</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.780" end="01:00:35.900" style="s2">people does seem to really believe this</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.010" end="01:00:37.520" style="s2">so it&#39;s like what is going on and how do</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.900" end="01:00:39.559" style="s2">we solve that instead of just be like</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.520" end="01:00:41.720" style="s2">right well I think that the part of it</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.559" end="01:00:43.609" style="s2">is the hysteria right the hysteria</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.720" end="01:00:45.950" style="s2">around sex trafficking the hysteria</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.609" end="01:00:50.030" style="s2">around rape numbers it&#39;s the hysteria</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.950" end="01:00:51.829" style="s2">around all sex is about power all sex</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.030" end="01:00:53.660" style="s2">could be rape like I mean even the more</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.829" end="01:00:56.180" style="s2">the most radical ones out there will say</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.660" end="01:00:57.650" style="s2">that all penetrated sex is rape but you</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.180" end="01:00:59.720" style="s2">know there&#39;s definitely trade war can</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.650" end="01:01:02.809" style="s2">never said that no not dworkin but the</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.720" end="01:01:04.280" style="s2">crazy the crayons you know and and</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.809" end="01:01:06.380" style="s2">clearly that&#39;s not the case so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.280" end="01:01:08.359" style="s2">there&#39;s just a lot of fear and I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.380" end="01:01:09.589" style="s2">that a lot of people are not bad who are</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.359" end="01:01:11.119" style="s2">spreading and I think there are just</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.589" end="01:01:13.250" style="s2">like yeah a lot of average young women</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.119" end="01:01:15.859" style="s2">out there who actually just are fucking</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.250" end="01:01:17.809" style="s2">scared because they&#39;re but yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.859" end="01:01:19.309" style="s2">there&#39;s people who are concertedly</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.809" end="01:01:20.390" style="s2">making an effort to spread that and</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.309" end="01:01:23.119" style="s2">that&#39;s the people who I think deserve</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.390" end="01:01:24.920" style="s2">the blame and right now well you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.119" end="01:01:27.230" style="s2">they&#39;ll say well men are much more</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.920" end="01:01:28.730" style="s2">likely to commit acts of violence well</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.230" end="01:01:30.049" style="s2">yeah no shit cuz men and women are</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.730" end="01:01:31.700" style="s2">different and men are aggressive but</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.049" end="01:01:34.789" style="s2">that&#39;s not to say that in like every</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.700" end="01:01:37.700" style="s2">situation in which a woman says no that</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.789" end="01:01:40.339" style="s2">like an assault is like you know sure to</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.700" end="01:01:41.450" style="s2">follow immediately thereafter I mean and</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.339" end="01:01:43.400" style="s2">that&#39;s what that&#39;s what I think that</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.450" end="01:01:45.200" style="s2">some of this yeah this is like so much</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.400" end="01:01:46.910" style="s2">fear-mongering has convinced women that</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.200" end="01:01:48.799" style="s2">that will happen and so then you have</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.910" end="01:01:49.910" style="s2">them having sex that they don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.799" end="01:01:51.289" style="s2">have or stay in situations they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.910" end="01:01:54.410" style="s2">have because they think it&#39;s gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.289" end="01:01:56.829" style="s2">worse if they leave really right and</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.410" end="01:02:00.470" style="s2">this this is a great example of how</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.829" end="01:02:02.690" style="s2">misdirected rage and fear are actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.470" end="01:02:06.380" style="s2">creating more victims than they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.690" end="01:02:07.849" style="s2">actually helping yeah well I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.380" end="01:02:09.260" style="s2">a subject that I could talk about quite</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.849" end="01:02:12.289" style="s2">a bit and I and I have you know I</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.260" end="01:02:14.450" style="s2">started my writing definitely was around</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.289" end="01:02:17.690" style="s2">some of these subjects but it&#39;s great to</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.450" end="01:02:18.540" style="s2">talk to somebody who has both a feminist</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.690" end="01:02:20.700" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.540" end="01:02:22.830" style="s2">in perspective and you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.700" end="01:02:25.040" style="s2">experience in these sort of markets and</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.830" end="01:02:27.180" style="s2">information zones as it were to</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.040" end="01:02:28.770" style="s2">understand the history of what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.180" end="01:02:32.160" style="s2">going on and to see it holistically</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.770" end="01:02:34.260" style="s2">without without having a real tainted</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.160" end="01:02:36.990" style="s2">advocates position which is what you</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.260" end="01:02:39.420" style="s2">find all these stats all this</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.990" end="01:02:41.640" style="s2">information all of it all comes from</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.420" end="01:02:43.710" style="s2">advocacy organizations that are</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.640" end="01:02:46.800" style="s2">dependent upon their funding that is</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.710" end="01:02:48.030" style="s2">dependent upon people being afraid so</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.800" end="01:02:49.740" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing with the sex</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.030" end="01:02:51.000" style="s2">trafficking stuff driving that panic to</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.740" end="01:02:52.980" style="s2">you know I said the groups that were</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.000" end="01:02:54.630" style="s2">driving it at first I think now is</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.980" end="01:02:57.390" style="s2">pretty much all comes down to money</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.630" end="01:02:59.070" style="s2">because there&#39;s been a whole industry</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.390" end="01:03:00.900" style="s2">built up of tons of nonprofits that are</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.070" end="01:03:03.150" style="s2">getting so much money bonus exists</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.900" end="01:03:04.260" style="s2">exclusively on federal grants contingent</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.150" end="01:03:05.340" style="s2">and police forces that are getting the</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.260" end="01:03:07.710" style="s2">money contingent on either making</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.340" end="01:03:09.210" style="s2">arrests and calling them sex trafficking</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.710" end="01:03:11.220" style="s2">stings and sex trafficking arrests or</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.210" end="01:03:12.870" style="s2">with you know getting grants to create</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.220" end="01:03:14.670" style="s2">awareness about the problem the problem</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.870" end="01:03:16.410" style="s2">has to be getting bigger or you have to</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.670" end="01:03:18.570" style="s2">be you know in order to keep demanding</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.410" end="01:03:21.360" style="s2">money for awareness so it&#39;s just yeah</p>

<p begin="01:03:36.150" end="01:03:43.140" style="s2">see those signs so I wanted to take this</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.580" end="01:03:44.850" style="s2">conversation and move it a little bit a</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.140" end="01:03:49.200" style="s2">little bit more forward when and get</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.850" end="01:03:52.650" style="s2">into section 230 social media publisher</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.200" end="01:03:55.620" style="s2">versus platforms so just pretend for me</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.650" end="01:03:57.870" style="s2">that like none of my listeners or me or</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.620" end="01:04:00.810" style="s2">I know anything about what 2:30 means</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.870" end="01:04:02.640" style="s2">what a platform is what a publisher is</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.810" end="01:04:06.000" style="s2">and can you just like walk us through</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.640" end="01:04:08.790" style="s2">that and then sort of set up the crisis</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.000" end="01:04:10.680" style="s2">that we&#39;re facing right now yeah so it</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.790" end="01:04:13.050" style="s2">was um you know it was part of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.680" end="01:04:16.290" style="s2">Communications Decency Act of 1996 and</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.050" end="01:04:18.660" style="s2">it said that no Internet service</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.290" end="01:04:22.130" style="s2">provider should be treated as the</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.660" end="01:04:26.160" style="s2">speaker of the speaker or publisher of</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.130" end="01:04:28.500" style="s2">content treated or posted by a third</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.160" end="01:04:30.450" style="s2">party and unless you know unless they</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.500" end="01:04:32.250" style="s2">created that content</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.450" end="01:04:33.539" style="s2">it&#39;s you know the legalese surrounding</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.250" end="01:04:35.970" style="s2">it is sort of complicated but basically</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.539" end="01:04:38.130" style="s2">what it&#39;s saying is that any sort of</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.970" end="01:04:39.390" style="s2">internet platform and the words here are</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.130" end="01:04:40.680" style="s2">kind of hard to use to write cuz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.390" end="01:04:42.690" style="s2">like what do you call Twitter or what do</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.680" end="01:04:44.609" style="s2">you call different things like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.690" end="01:04:46.380" style="s2">the crux of it all right and I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.609" end="01:04:48.329" style="s2">think a reason reason is a publisher</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.380" end="01:04:50.880" style="s2">reason is literally a news outlet right</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.329" end="01:04:53.220" style="s2">but we were protected by section 230 in</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.880" end="01:04:55.680" style="s2">our comments so let me just back up real</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.220" end="01:04:58.079" style="s2">quick what section 230 does in effect it</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.680" end="01:04:59.700" style="s2">says that any of these online platforms</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.079" end="01:05:02.039" style="s2">from yeah you know any sort of Internet</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.700" end="01:05:03.690" style="s2">service provider online messaging board</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.039" end="01:05:07.260" style="s2">anything like that that has</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.690" end="01:05:12.180" style="s2">user-generated content cannot be found</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.260" end="01:05:16.410" style="s2">liable in state court or in civil cases</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.180" end="01:05:19.109" style="s2">for offenses that happen because they</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.410" end="01:05:21.000" style="s2">there&#39;s their platform was open for that</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.109" end="01:05:22.680" style="s2">kind of speech John it so if I posted</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.000" end="01:05:24.990" style="s2">something on on you know Twitter and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.680" end="01:05:26.609" style="s2">was like I am gonna come and kill you</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.990" end="01:05:28.440" style="s2">and then I got arrested for making truth</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.609" end="01:05:31.049" style="s2">that&#39;s against you Twitter couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.440" end="01:05:32.730" style="s2">held responsible offense right right you</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.049" end="01:05:34.559" style="s2">know if if I post an ad on Craigslist</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.730" end="01:05:36.660" style="s2">and I was like hey you want to meet and</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.559" end="01:05:39.029" style="s2">hook up and then I raped you</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.660" end="01:05:41.579" style="s2">Craigslist wouldn&#39;t be responsible for</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.029" end="01:05:44.099" style="s2">that right so without this law people</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.579" end="01:05:46.259" style="s2">who were you know who facilitated the</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.099" end="01:05:48.569" style="s2">speech there were sort of neutral</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.259" end="01:05:50.549" style="s2">facilitators of the speech that ended in</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.569" end="01:05:52.500" style="s2">criminal conduct could be held liable</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.549" end="01:05:53.880" style="s2">and you can see why that would prevent</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.500" end="01:05:55.470" style="s2">you know pretty much any of the internet</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.880" end="01:05:57.329" style="s2">as we&#39;ve known it today from having</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.470" end="01:05:58.859" style="s2">developed right and it&#39;s been really</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.329" end="01:06:00.720" style="s2">really essential for the building of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.859" end="01:06:02.279" style="s2">social internet blogs</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.720" end="01:06:03.900" style="s2">I mean comment sections on things</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.279" end="01:06:07.710" style="s2">everything like that has been really</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.900" end="01:06:10.349" style="s2">dependent on section 230 existing um to</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.710" end="01:06:12.269" style="s2">to just quick notes on that is that it</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.349" end="01:06:13.980" style="s2">doesn&#39;t one thing is that there are some</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.269" end="01:06:16.589" style="s2">exceptions and it doesn&#39;t prevent people</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.980" end="01:06:19.259" style="s2">from liability for federal crimes so you</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.589" end="01:06:22.440" style="s2">know if some of a platform is um and</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.259" end="01:06:24.390" style="s2">there&#39;s special things for IP and</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.440" end="01:06:25.799" style="s2">pornography related crimes and try child</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.390" end="01:06:27.210" style="s2">born so you know you can&#39;t just host</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.799" end="01:06:28.769" style="s2">child porn and they&#39;d be like well you</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.210" end="01:06:30.000" style="s2">know we didn&#39;t put it there so I mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.769" end="01:06:32.069" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s and if there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.000" end="01:06:33.720" style="s2">exceptions like that that exist for</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.069" end="01:06:37.910" style="s2">federal crimes but not for the state</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.720" end="01:06:37.910" style="s2">crimes and not for suing people in court</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.809" end="01:06:43.799" style="s2">well what about didn&#39;t we just say that</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.430" end="01:06:44.430" style="s2">the publishers or the platforms are now</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.799" end="01:06:46.680" style="s2">responsible</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.430" end="01:06:48.030" style="s2">for the sex trafficking stuffers yes so</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.680" end="01:06:51.150" style="s2">that was the first big carve out that</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.030" end="01:06:53.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve had in this eye in a long time and</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.150" end="01:06:56.220" style="s2">so they carved it out so now yes you you</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.640" end="01:06:58.890" style="s2">do not get section 230 protections if</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.220" end="01:07:01.110" style="s2">you are hosting content that facilitates</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.890" end="01:07:02.610" style="s2">prostitution okay so I&#39;ve got a blog and</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.110" end="01:07:04.770" style="s2">in the comment section two people</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.610" end="01:07:07.080" style="s2">solicit each other for some sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.770" end="01:07:12.150" style="s2">transaction sex transaction I am now</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.080" end="01:07:13.710" style="s2">responsible for yes and there are a lot</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.150" end="01:07:17.070" style="s2">of people who want to carve out other</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.710" end="01:07:19.410" style="s2">exceptions for various other things too</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.070" end="01:07:22.740" style="s2">you know you&#39;ve seen it everything from</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.410" end="01:07:24.690" style="s2">in Vkontakte about that bias is a big</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.740" end="01:07:25.830" style="s2">one but but there wasn&#39;t on the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.690" end="01:07:28.920" style="s2">liberal side are people talking about</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.830" end="01:07:31.110" style="s2">you know for people who facilitate gun</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.920" end="01:07:32.790" style="s2">crimes if there&#39;s a mass shooter if the</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.110" end="01:07:34.530" style="s2">mass shooter you know posted anywhere on</p>

<p begin="01:07:36.210" end="01:07:39.630" style="s2">could hold the site liable on hate</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.490" end="01:07:41.520" style="s2">speeches would be when people want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.630" end="01:07:43.440" style="s2">carve out inspections for hate speech</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.520" end="01:07:46.530" style="s2">and I hope people can&#39;t see what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.440" end="01:07:48.240" style="s2">doing air I&#39;m always guilty of doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.530" end="01:07:50.310" style="s2">that air quotes while on the podcast</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.240" end="01:07:51.660" style="s2">does not work does not work so they want</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.310" end="01:07:56.340" style="s2">to carve out these exceptions for that</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.660" end="01:07:57.450" style="s2">and the other side the other just really</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.340" end="01:07:59.480" style="s2">important thing to note about section</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.450" end="01:08:02.670" style="s2">232 is that it specifically states that</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.480" end="01:08:05.850" style="s2">good faith efforts to moderate content</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.670" end="01:08:08.100" style="s2">do not disqualify someone from section</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.850" end="01:08:10.080" style="s2">230 protections so if you have you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.100" end="01:08:11.370" style="s2">words that are banned on your site or if</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.080" end="01:08:12.780" style="s2">you have Terms of Service that say this</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.370" end="01:08:14.160" style="s2">kind of content you can pretty much pick</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.780" end="01:08:17.010" style="s2">any sort of Terms of Service you want</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.160" end="01:08:18.540" style="s2">and try to enforce them and doing that</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.010" end="01:08:20.880" style="s2">and trying to filter out content that</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.540" end="01:08:23.490" style="s2">violates those or trying to filter out</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.880" end="01:08:24.990" style="s2">content that is illegal does not mean</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.490" end="01:08:26.400" style="s2">that just because you tried to you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.990" end="01:08:27.810" style="s2">banned some of that content and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.400" end="01:08:28.830" style="s2">you did banned some of it and failed to</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.810" end="01:08:30.750" style="s2">ban other parts of it just because</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.830" end="01:08:33.240" style="s2">that&#39;s the nature of processing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.750" end="01:08:35.850" style="s2">so many yeah then you aren&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.240" end="01:08:36.780" style="s2">suddenly liable okay and that&#39;s the big</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.850" end="01:08:39.150" style="s2">understanding I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.780" end="01:08:40.950" style="s2">conservatives have right now with you</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.150" end="01:08:43.170" style="s2">know calling out social media companies</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.950" end="01:08:44.790" style="s2">for for bias and so they&#39;ve been saying</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.170" end="01:08:45.960" style="s2">oh we need to you know we need to do</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.790" end="01:08:47.610" style="s2">something about this because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.960" end="01:08:49.620" style="s2">they&#39;re acting like a publisher or not a</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.610" end="01:08:51.930" style="s2">platform and they shouldn&#39;t be liable</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.620" end="01:08:54.360" style="s2">for a section 230 protection but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.930" end="01:08:56.040" style="s2">a very fundamental misunderstanding of</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.360" end="01:08:57.900" style="s2">how this works yeah so let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.040" end="01:09:01.080" style="s2">that argument a little bit so with</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.900" end="01:09:03.089" style="s2">the way that Twitter I mean less you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.080" end="01:09:05.549" style="s2">got let&#39;s use Gavin McGinnis for example</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.089" end="01:09:07.350" style="s2">so Gavin McGinnis has recently been</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.549" end="01:09:09.210" style="s2">banned from YouTube which was his last</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.350" end="01:09:12.179" style="s2">social media cow was banned from Twitter</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.210" end="01:09:13.949" style="s2">ban from Instagram Facebook he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.179" end="01:09:16.109" style="s2">he&#39;s been basically wiped off the</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.949" end="01:09:17.670" style="s2">internet he got fired from his job at CR</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.109" end="01:09:18.719" style="s2">TV and they took down his entire back</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.670" end="01:09:19.830" style="s2">catalogue now that&#39;s a completely</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.719" end="01:09:22.170" style="s2">separate issue right that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.830" end="01:09:23.310" style="s2">private employer hiring somebody in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.170" end="01:09:24.960" style="s2">private basis they can do whatever they</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.310" end="01:09:26.580" style="s2">want it&#39;s wrong it&#39;s stupid I cancelled</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.960" end="01:09:31.020" style="s2">my see our TV subscription because of it</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.580" end="01:09:33.330" style="s2">but still and so he&#39;s been banned and</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.020" end="01:09:35.370" style="s2">there are people that would argue that</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.330" end="01:09:37.620" style="s2">he has been banned because he&#39;s saying a</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.370" end="01:09:39.690" style="s2">particular thing and if he&#39;s saying a</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.620" end="01:09:41.100" style="s2">particular thing and they&#39;re saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.690" end="01:09:42.600" style="s2">hate speech and whatever and a proud</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.100" end="01:09:45.359" style="s2">boys are an extremist group even though</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.600" end="01:09:47.159" style="s2">now the FBI came out and said that they</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.359" end="01:09:50.130" style="s2">are not classified as like an extremist</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.159" end="01:09:52.699" style="s2">or a hate group but what there&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.130" end="01:09:55.340" style="s2">people will argue is that by selectively</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.699" end="01:09:57.929" style="s2">taking people off of their platforms</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.340" end="01:10:00.060" style="s2">YouTube and Twitter are effectively</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.929" end="01:10:01.440" style="s2">pushing a certain kind of content while</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.060" end="01:10:04.140" style="s2">restricting a certain kind of content</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.440" end="01:10:06.060" style="s2">and therefore have become publishers and</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.140" end="01:10:08.310" style="s2">that platforms right right so what do</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.060" end="01:10:11.040" style="s2">you think about that well whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.310" end="01:10:12.989" style="s2">that is true and that they I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.040" end="01:10:15.150" style="s2">think it&#39;s definitely true that they</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.989" end="01:10:17.070" style="s2">have certain proclivities in certain you</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.150" end="01:10:18.929" style="s2">know norms of speech that yes they</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.070" end="01:10:21.929" style="s2">respect and they are not necessarily I</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.929" end="01:10:23.520" style="s2">mean equally applied I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.929" end="01:10:24.449" style="s2">think there&#39;s all of the bias that a lot</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.520" end="01:10:26.070" style="s2">of people say there are but I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.449" end="01:10:27.330" style="s2">there are certain you know different</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.070" end="01:10:28.650" style="s2">platforms have different norms of speech</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.330" end="01:10:30.900" style="s2">that they enforce in different ways and</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.650" end="01:10:35.550" style="s2">so people saying that and pointing that</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.900" end="01:10:38.190" style="s2">out sure but that doesn&#39;t make them a</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.550" end="01:10:40.230" style="s2">publisher for the purposes of this law</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.190" end="01:10:44.190" style="s2">okay because like I said like um you</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.230" end="01:10:47.510" style="s2">know actual magazines are protected by</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.190" end="01:10:50.010" style="s2">section 230 Reason magazine is protected</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.510" end="01:10:51.719" style="s2">for our comments right for our comments</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.010" end="01:10:53.820" style="s2">so not for the actual stuff but that</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.719" end="01:10:55.260" style="s2">stuff that we pop you know write the</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.820" end="01:10:57.090" style="s2">stuff that users this we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.260" end="01:10:59.900" style="s2">talking about things that users post on</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.090" end="01:11:02.130" style="s2">Twitter it&#39;s not like Twitter created</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.900" end="01:11:03.600" style="s2">this certain sort you know sort of</p>

<p begin="01:11:03.600" end="01:11:08.790" style="s2">there this is concept posted by users so</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.300" end="01:11:10.409" style="s2">saying that they are allowing or not</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.790" end="01:11:11.790" style="s2">allowing a certain sort of speech it</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.409" end="01:11:14.310" style="s2">just it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.790" end="01:11:17.280" style="s2">for terms of section 230 protections got</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.310" end="01:11:19.950" style="s2">it it&#39;s a different issue and I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.280" end="01:11:21.690" style="s2">very sympathetic to I hate you know the</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.950" end="01:11:23.700" style="s2">sort of idea that we should do platform</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.690" end="01:11:25.500" style="s2">people from from all across all the</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.700" end="01:11:27.630" style="s2">social medias because we don&#39;t like what</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.500" end="01:11:29.160" style="s2">they&#39;re saying you know I think that you</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.630" end="01:11:31.230" style="s2">know I don&#39;t hardly agree with Gavin</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.160" end="01:11:33.090" style="s2">McGinnis on much of anything but I&#39;d you</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.230" end="01:11:40.290" style="s2">know yeah I don&#39;t think that I think</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.090" end="01:11:43.020" style="s2">he&#39;s a libertarian too but you know I</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.290" end="01:11:44.490" style="s2">but that&#39;s but that&#39;s a separate issue</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.020" end="01:11:45.720" style="s2">from the section 230 thing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.490" end="01:11:47.910" style="s2">what&#39;s so dangerous is that I think</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.720" end="01:11:50.100" style="s2">people have been trying to say like well</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.910" end="01:11:51.720" style="s2">now we need to you know do something</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.100" end="01:11:54.600" style="s2">about section 230 because it&#39;s allowing</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.720" end="01:11:56.550" style="s2">this to happen and it&#39;s like do you</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.600" end="01:11:58.620" style="s2">understand the alternative because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.550" end="01:12:00.720" style="s2">horrible right the alternative is that</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.620" end="01:12:02.580" style="s2">you know if if the government has much</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.720" end="01:12:05.160" style="s2">then the government has much more say</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.580" end="01:12:06.810" style="s2">over what anyone on any of these</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.160" end="01:12:08.340" style="s2">platforms can say and and so I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.810" end="01:12:11.070" style="s2">was trying to say like if conservatives</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.340" end="01:12:13.170" style="s2">think it&#39;s bad right now that you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.070" end="01:12:14.760" style="s2">private companies are you know kicking</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.170" end="01:12:17.070" style="s2">off people for various things like</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.760" end="01:12:18.360" style="s2">imagine if the federal government is in</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.070" end="01:12:20.010" style="s2">charge at bureaucrats in the federal</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.360" end="01:12:22.230" style="s2">government are in charge of moderating</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.010" end="01:12:23.400" style="s2">content you&#39;re just gonna have the same</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.230" end="01:12:24.870" style="s2">problem we talked about with foster</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.400" end="01:12:27.300" style="s2">earlier which is that there&#39;s just gonna</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.870" end="01:12:28.620" style="s2">be almost no even second thought about</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.300" end="01:12:30.050" style="s2">whether we should allow anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.620" end="01:12:32.190" style="s2">reported if something gets reported</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.050" end="01:12:33.570" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna they&#39;re gonna ban it you</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.190" end="01:12:36.270" style="s2">know I mean they&#39;re gonna they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.570" end="01:12:37.680" style="s2">err on the side of you know harm so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.270" end="01:12:38.370" style="s2">this is I&#39;m kind of mixing things</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.680" end="01:12:39.360" style="s2">because obviously the federal</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.370" end="01:12:40.920" style="s2">government&#39;s not gonna be running</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.360" end="01:12:42.480" style="s2">Twitter directly right what I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.920" end="01:12:44.550" style="s2">saying when you invite and when you</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.480" end="01:12:46.710" style="s2">invite then when you invite people to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.550" end="01:12:48.690" style="s2">able to prosecute websites for for the</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.710" end="01:12:51.450" style="s2">way that they you know moderate content</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.690" end="01:12:53.310" style="s2">then you were there&#39;s only gonna be so</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.450" end="01:12:55.080" style="s2">much more content moderation right well</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.310" end="01:12:55.920" style="s2">I think the argument is actually maybe</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.080" end="01:12:58.200" style="s2">coming at it from a different</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.920" end="01:13:01.740" style="s2">perspective which is they want to use</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.200" end="01:13:04.770" style="s2">the hammer of the 230 tip force these</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.740" end="01:13:09.000" style="s2">sodas like platforms into not moderating</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.770" end="01:13:10.980" style="s2">right into into leaving often right</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.000" end="01:13:13.680" style="s2">right and because if your mom if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.980" end="01:13:15.840" style="s2">moderating you&#39;re modulating your</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.680" end="01:13:17.130" style="s2">moderated you&#39;re modulating and then</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.840" end="01:13:19.560" style="s2">your but so you&#39;re crafting a message</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.130" end="01:13:21.160" style="s2">but I mean they specifically say you are</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.560" end="01:13:23.440" style="s2">allowed to moderate content</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.160" end="01:13:25.480" style="s2">that it without it because you can</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.440" end="01:13:26.740" style="s2">create a Terms of Service I mean these</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.480" end="01:13:28.210" style="s2">are private platforms they&#39;re allowed to</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.740" end="01:13:30.010" style="s2">craft a message they&#39;re allowed to say</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.210" end="01:13:30.940" style="s2">only people I know I blog about their</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.010" end="01:13:32.770" style="s2">day I was like if you wanted to Chris</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.940" end="01:13:34.390" style="s2">you know say we are a social platform</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.770" end="01:13:36.760" style="s2">you know we&#39;re creating that&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.390" end="01:13:39.160" style="s2">Twitter but like only Amish redheads who</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.760" end="01:13:41.230" style="s2">are into BDSM and koalas can write here</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.160" end="01:13:43.540" style="s2">like it sounds like a party yeah and if</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.230" end="01:13:44.950" style="s2">you post about you know BDSM and Amish</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.540" end="01:13:48.160" style="s2">people but like panda bears they&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.950" end="01:13:51.670" style="s2">like no right right but would they be a</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.160" end="01:13:53.530" style="s2">platform or a publisher yeah it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.670" end="01:13:56.200" style="s2">about it&#39;s not about not being able to</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.530" end="01:13:59.410" style="s2">set rules it&#39;s about who creates the</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.200" end="01:14:02.530" style="s2">content okay interesting so this is why</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.410" end="01:14:04.690" style="s2">the big thing with Backpage has been you</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.530" end="01:14:08.260" style="s2">know a thing because they filtered out</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.690" end="01:14:10.630" style="s2">ads that said certain words right so</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.260" end="01:14:12.010" style="s2">let&#39;s this is a great segue and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.630" end="01:14:13.540" style="s2">just put wrap a bow on this last one the</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.010" end="01:14:16.000" style="s2">reason why I wanted you to bring this up</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.540" end="01:14:19.120" style="s2">is because I hang out with a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.000" end="01:14:21.340" style="s2">people on the right who are very I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.120" end="01:14:23.440" style="s2">rightfully scared of being deep</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.340" end="01:14:24.940" style="s2">platformed I suspect at some point I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.440" end="01:14:27.220" style="s2">gonna get kicked off of Twitter I mean</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.940" end="01:14:28.960" style="s2">if they go if they&#39;re even like looking</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.220" end="01:14:30.790" style="s2">at like your offline activities and</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.960" end="01:14:32.290" style="s2">looking at your past deleted posts and</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.790" end="01:14:34.330" style="s2">whatever I mean you know someday the</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.290" end="01:14:35.830" style="s2">hammer might come for me but you know I</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.330" end="01:14:38.890" style="s2">hang out a lot of people that are really</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.830" end="01:14:41.020" style="s2">concerned about that and a lot of them</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.890" end="01:14:43.630" style="s2">are I want to use this argument that</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.020" end="01:14:46.060" style="s2">Twitter through their mod moderation and</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.630" end="01:14:48.490" style="s2">through their content sort of window</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.060" end="01:14:49.810" style="s2">Overton Window I guess not really but</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.490" end="01:14:52.440" style="s2">they&#39;re the window that they&#39;re opening</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.810" end="01:14:56.080" style="s2">is becoming a publisher and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.440" end="01:14:59.170" style="s2">subject to all kinds of laws as a way to</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.080" end="01:15:01.390" style="s2">force them to not moderate content</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.170" end="01:15:02.230" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that that argument is just</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.390" end="01:15:04.510" style="s2">dead on arrival</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.230" end="01:15:05.500" style="s2">yeah yes and you can look I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.510" end="01:15:07.510" style="s2">been a bunch of people writing about</p>

<p begin="01:23:03.570" end="01:23:07.830" style="s2">they would do these things and pretty</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.640" end="01:23:09.630" style="s2">much every step they took to help now</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.830" end="01:23:12.300" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to use against them which</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.630" end="01:23:14.520" style="s2">is just they started on after they they</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.300" end="01:23:15.900" style="s2">there was a sheriff who got the credit</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.520" end="01:23:18.000" style="s2">cards to stop doing business with them</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.900" end="01:23:20.430" style="s2">and they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.000" end="01:23:22.830" style="s2">so then Visa and MasterCard and AMEX</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.430" end="01:23:25.650" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t work with the Slayer anymore so</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.830" end="01:23:28.320" style="s2">then they started accepting Bitcoin for</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.650" end="01:23:29.520" style="s2">ads and then they&#39;ve been like well you</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.320" end="01:23:30.540" style="s2">only started as something bitcoins that</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.520" end="01:23:32.760" style="s2">you could further try and facilitate</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.540" end="01:23:34.680" style="s2">like illegal things like be shifting</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.760" end="01:23:36.150" style="s2">Bitcoin cuz the sheriff like right</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.680" end="01:23:37.170" style="s2">threatened in and it went all the way</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.150" end="01:23:38.790" style="s2">through the federal court and it was</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.170" end="01:23:42.600" style="s2">ruled unconstitutional that he did that</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.790" end="01:23:44.850" style="s2">but it was too late already business so</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.600" end="01:23:46.800" style="s2">what you got is like guys who own this</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.850" end="01:23:48.840" style="s2">newspaper they&#39;re doing everything that</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.800" end="01:23:51.390" style="s2">they can to coordinate with law</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.840" end="01:23:53.310" style="s2">enforcement they&#39;re they&#39;re letting</p>

<p begin="01:23:55.980" end="01:23:59.550" style="s2">transmitting information and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.290" end="01:24:03.060" style="s2">basically doing everything that they can</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.550" end="01:24:05.310" style="s2">to prevent the sex trafficking okay from</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.060" end="01:24:07.050" style="s2">happening things involving minors well</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.310" end="01:24:10.890" style="s2">still having a platform where people can</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.050" end="01:24:12.840" style="s2">you know to consult sex work right legal</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.890" end="01:24:14.640" style="s2">sex work and you know obviously probably</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.840" end="01:24:16.890" style="s2">some that&#39;s not legal but is consenting</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.640" end="01:24:19.170" style="s2">between adults right right so nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.890" end="01:24:21.600" style="s2">being exploited per se in that case so</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.170" end="01:24:24.270" style="s2">what do you you know what do you think</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.600" end="01:24:26.280" style="s2">drove this prosecution of them and</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.270" end="01:24:28.470" style="s2">or the motivations and who are the</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.280" end="01:24:29.670" style="s2">players in the bigger picture of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.470" end="01:24:33.240" style="s2">going on here with these guys in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.670" end="01:24:34.710" style="s2">back page a couple of different things -</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.240" end="01:24:36.780" style="s2">I mean I think you just said sort of</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.710" end="01:24:37.830" style="s2">some of the general you know all the</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.780" end="01:24:39.030" style="s2">like we were talking about earlier the</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.830" end="01:24:40.650" style="s2">sort of general hysteria around this</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.030" end="01:24:42.540" style="s2">issue and they kept needing to find new</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.650" end="01:24:43.830" style="s2">targets and like I said the Association</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.540" end="01:24:45.000" style="s2">of attorneys general especially the guy</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.830" end="01:24:47.760" style="s2">who was in charge of it was the</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.000" end="01:24:50.520" style="s2">Washington State one and he&#39;d made this</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.760" end="01:24:51.870" style="s2">his like signature issue so he put a lot</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.520" end="01:24:53.220" style="s2">of effort going into Craigslist and put</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.870" end="01:24:54.510" style="s2">it all these press releases saying we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.220" end="01:24:56.280" style="s2">gonna get him to do this and then they</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.510" end="01:24:58.590" style="s2">didn&#39;t anybody else things saying we got</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.280" end="01:25:01.290" style="s2">him to do that so I think a back piece</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.590" end="01:25:03.120" style="s2">just pissed people off by not just doing</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.290" end="01:25:05.040" style="s2">what law enforcement said you know like</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.120" end="01:25:06.990" style="s2">they just wouldn&#39;t do what they said and</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.040" end="01:25:08.580" style="s2">they were like if you would have just</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.990" end="01:25:09.510" style="s2">moved the adult section and let the</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.580" end="01:25:11.430" style="s2">other stuff happen I think you probably</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.510" end="01:25:12.900" style="s2">been fine but they were like no so then</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.430" end="01:25:14.730" style="s2">they you know they really started going</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.900" end="01:25:16.080" style="s2">after it and then you have people in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.730" end="01:25:18.830" style="s2">federal government who started sort of</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.080" end="01:25:21.240" style="s2">making it their signature issue too and</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.830" end="01:25:23.370" style="s2">you know back page presented a very good</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.240" end="01:25:24.710" style="s2">scapegoat for for everything so I think</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.370" end="01:25:26.910" style="s2">that you just had it become a very</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.710" end="01:25:31.140" style="s2">convenient target for something that</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.910" end="01:25:32.850" style="s2">people wanted to talk about this is a</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.140" end="01:25:34.980" style="s2">really really cynical part too but at</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.850" end="01:25:37.530" style="s2">the there&#39;s a couple of people who are</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.980" end="01:25:39.660" style="s2">you know in every single state and</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.530" end="01:25:41.730" style="s2">federal testimony about FASTA passing</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.660" end="01:25:43.050" style="s2">FASTA and about why back patientsí be</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.730" end="01:25:45.930" style="s2">shut down all this stuff you have these</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.050" end="01:25:50.160" style="s2">parents whose daughters ran away and</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.930" end="01:25:51.900" style="s2">ended up working selling sex and had ads</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.160" end="01:25:54.060" style="s2">on craigslist and backpage and other</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.900" end="01:25:55.320" style="s2">places and then when they came when</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.060" end="01:25:57.180" style="s2">police found their kids please actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.320" end="01:25:58.560" style="s2">found the kids through they were I think</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.180" end="01:26:01.110" style="s2">one of almost fifteen or one of them was</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.560" end="01:26:03.030" style="s2">16 they found them through back page ads</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.110" end="01:26:04.410" style="s2">that they had posted and they were able</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.030" end="01:26:06.120" style="s2">to get their information through back</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.410" end="01:26:08.910" style="s2">page and find them and return them to</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.120" end="01:26:11.280" style="s2">their parents and the parents sued back</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.910" end="01:26:13.830" style="s2">page and they lost because of section</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.280" end="01:26:15.180" style="s2">230 okay and we&#39;ve had various attorney</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.830" end="01:26:17.730" style="s2">generals try to sue back page two and</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.180" end="01:26:20.700" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s you know I want to say ten</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.730" end="01:26:22.530" style="s2">maybe more cases in federal court and in</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.700" end="01:26:24.630" style="s2">every single one the judges said like</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.530" end="01:26:26.040" style="s2">look that they are this is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.630" end="01:26:28.860" style="s2">protected from this because of section</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.040" end="01:26:30.300" style="s2">230 I mean they did not the the ads did</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.860" end="01:26:33.270" style="s2">not say these were underage girls the</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.300" end="01:26:34.860" style="s2">girls said that they were above age you</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.270" end="01:26:36.420" style="s2">know things like that so it&#39;s there was</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.860" end="01:26:36.820" style="s2">there was no way of knowing really and</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.420" end="01:26:39.840" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.820" end="01:26:42.659" style="s2">they were you know not liable for it and</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.840" end="01:26:45.159" style="s2">the people who actually were guilty of</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.659" end="01:26:48.400" style="s2">exploiting them these girls had pimps</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.159" end="01:26:50.050" style="s2">both of them they were found guilty and</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.400" end="01:26:52.239" style="s2">went to prison and so like there are</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.050" end="01:26:54.159" style="s2">people being punished for this right and</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.239" end="01:26:56.800" style="s2">those people were found with the help of</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.159" end="01:26:58.750" style="s2">Backpage but these people don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.800" end="01:27:00.880" style="s2">lot of money these sort of petty pimps</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.750" end="01:27:02.230" style="s2">that are that were in this particular</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.880" end="01:27:03.429" style="s2">case or in general when I see these</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.230" end="01:27:04.900" style="s2">cases you know they don&#39;t have deep</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.429" end="01:27:07.090" style="s2">pockets these sort of guys who are</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.900" end="01:27:09.130" style="s2">hustling and you know maybe have like</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.090" end="01:27:11.230" style="s2">two teen girls who are working for them</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.130" end="01:27:12.670" style="s2">I mean they&#39;re scum and they also don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.230" end="01:27:14.619" style="s2">have a lot of money from being scum and</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.670" end="01:27:17.110" style="s2">so they&#39;re don&#39;t have a lot of payout</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.619" end="01:27:19.060" style="s2">for civil asset forfeiture purposes or</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.110" end="01:27:21.400" style="s2">for victims to get awarded in civil</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.060" end="01:27:24.130" style="s2">court okay so a lot of money back page</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.400" end="01:27:27.010" style="s2">and other internet sites and tech giants</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.130" end="01:27:28.869" style="s2">so I think the goal has been all along</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.010" end="01:27:30.699" style="s2">at some level for some groups to be able</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.869" end="01:27:31.929" style="s2">to I mean you specifically have one of</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.699" end="01:27:33.429" style="s2">the moms who said this and at the</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.929" end="01:27:35.920" style="s2">hearing and Congress saying like I want</p>

<p begin="01:27:39.010" end="01:27:44.230" style="s2">get money from them right and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.440" end="01:27:45.730" style="s2">just you know I know she&#39;s hurt and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.230" end="01:27:47.290" style="s2">you know had her daughter go through</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.730" end="01:27:49.000" style="s2">this and looking for someone else to</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.290" end="01:27:51.130" style="s2">blame other than the actual person but</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.000" end="01:27:52.780" style="s2">like at a certain point it also is just</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.130" end="01:27:53.800" style="s2">like you can&#39;t and that guy who was</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.780" end="01:27:55.179" style="s2">supposed to pay like five thousand</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.800" end="01:27:56.860" style="s2">dollars it hasn&#39;t really paid very much</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.179" end="01:27:58.960" style="s2">of it he&#39;s paid some though you can see</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.860" end="01:28:00.400" style="s2">that it&#39;s in the court thing but you</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.960" end="01:28:01.719" style="s2">know they were asking for like a million</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.400" end="01:28:05.110" style="s2">from Backpage so I just think that</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.719" end="01:28:06.429" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of that right you</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.110" end="01:28:08.679" style="s2">know you and I have had talks about this</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.429" end="01:28:11.050" style="s2">before the podcast and the name Kamala</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.679" end="01:28:13.000" style="s2">Harris came up what talked about her</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.050" end="01:28:14.619" style="s2">role her role in Back Bay she&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.000" end="01:28:16.449" style="s2">favorite person to and I think that if</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.619" end="01:28:18.040" style="s2">she is seriously running for president</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.449" end="01:28:20.079" style="s2">we have a moral obligation to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.040" end="01:28:21.880" style="s2">her as much as possible so what what</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.079" end="01:28:24.820" style="s2">what was her involvement in this whole</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.880" end="01:28:26.619" style="s2">in this whole shenanigans here yes so</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.820" end="01:28:28.900" style="s2">she was one of the when she was Attorney</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.619" end="01:28:32.710" style="s2">General of California until 2016 or</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.900" end="01:28:35.829" style="s2">until 2017 she was one of the people who</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.710" end="01:28:37.510" style="s2">was very big on with the other Attorney</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.829" end="01:28:39.130" style="s2">General&#39;s talking out about Backpage and</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.510" end="01:28:42.099" style="s2">saying you know it&#39;s the world&#39;s largest</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.130" end="01:28:43.840" style="s2">online brothel and all this stuff we</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.099" end="01:28:45.400" style="s2">must shut it down we must shut it down</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.840" end="01:28:47.170" style="s2">she was one of the Attorney General&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.400" end="01:28:48.040" style="s2">assigned a letter asking Congress this</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.170" end="01:28:51.700" style="s2">is back in</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.040" end="01:28:53.050" style="s2">2013 I think to get rid of section 230</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.700" end="01:28:53.920" style="s2">so that they could sue back page that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.050" end="01:28:55.480" style="s2">specifically what I said it was like</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.920" end="01:28:57.700" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to amend section 230 so that</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.480" end="01:28:59.590" style="s2">we can sue back page and Congress was</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.700" end="01:29:02.650" style="s2">like no no I can do that right now</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.590" end="01:29:05.710" style="s2">and so then Kamala Harris brought</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.650" end="01:29:07.420" style="s2">charges against back page under the very</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.710" end="01:29:09.520" style="s2">theory that she I mean she knew it was</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.420" end="01:29:10.720" style="s2">illegal she knew that the Constitution</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.520" end="01:29:12.460" style="s2">barred this because they had already had</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.720" end="01:29:14.410" style="s2">these courts say that a bunch of times</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.460" end="01:29:16.120" style="s2">and then she&#39;d asked Congress to be like</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.410" end="01:29:18.520" style="s2">can you change the law so that this is</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.120" end="01:29:22.390" style="s2">okay they said no and so she just did it</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.520" end="01:29:25.270" style="s2">anyways so this was and I think the</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.390" end="01:29:27.400" style="s2">first charges were in 2020 16 she</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.270" end="01:29:29.620" style="s2">brought money laundering and pimping</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.400" end="01:29:31.960" style="s2">charges or assisted pimping charges</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.620" end="01:29:35.830" style="s2">against the CEOs and the heads of</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.960" end="01:29:38.290" style="s2">Backpage and assisted pimping yes and</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.830" end="01:29:40.090" style="s2">the because because of the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.290" end="01:29:42.220" style="s2">you know where there were ads for people</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.090" end="01:29:43.360" style="s2">who ended up you know but not you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.220" end="01:29:45.880" style="s2">back page had no knowledge of them</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.360" end="01:29:47.980" style="s2">whatever that kind of thing so again a</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.880" end="01:29:49.810" style="s2">judge threw the case out and said no</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.980" end="01:29:52.720" style="s2">this is unconstitutional like you were</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.810" end="01:29:54.610" style="s2">not allowed to do this and then this was</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.720" end="01:29:56.380" style="s2">right in 2016 right during the elections</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.610" end="01:29:58.390" style="s2">so she was she arrests she had them</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.380" end="01:30:00.790" style="s2">arrested right before she was a you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.390" end="01:30:04.510" style="s2">election week and she got her name in</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.790" end="01:30:05.860" style="s2">all the earth so she she knew that</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.510" end="01:30:07.660" style="s2">something was against the law she filed</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.860" end="01:30:10.210" style="s2">a lawsuit that she knew was unlawful and</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.660" end="01:30:14.490" style="s2">then she arrested people for violating</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.210" end="01:30:14.490" style="s2">right before the election on the same</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.310" end="01:30:23.860" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.580" end="01:30:26.140" style="s2">Kamala Harris and December by December</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.860" end="01:30:28.390" style="s2">the judge threw the case out December</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.140" end="01:30:30.100" style="s2">27th she&#39;s got like three days left as</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.390" end="01:30:32.110" style="s2">Attorney General of California she</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.100" end="01:30:33.250" style="s2">brings another charge more charges</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.110" end="01:30:35.080" style="s2">against them pretty much the exact same</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.250" end="01:30:38.560" style="s2">charges but like very slightly different</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.080" end="01:30:39.970" style="s2">in another court she lumpin does this</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.560" end="01:30:41.320" style="s2">already thrown out the pimping and</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.970" end="01:30:43.030" style="s2">facilitating prostitution part of that</p>

<p begin="01:31:53.139" end="01:31:57.670" style="s2">and call them you know and I think this</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.630" end="01:31:59.469" style="s2">is what has disconnected so many people</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.670" end="01:32:02.199" style="s2">from the new progressive left within the</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.469" end="01:32:05.260" style="s2">Democratic Party is that it&#39;s know that</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.199" end="01:32:06.699" style="s2">when I was younger if you wanted to if</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.260" end="01:32:09.610" style="s2">you wanted to be in support of civil</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.699" end="01:32:11.260" style="s2">liberties then you were a Democrat right</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.610" end="01:32:13.210" style="s2">if you wanted to support gay guys</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.260" end="01:32:16.090" style="s2">getting Marian or whatever if you wanted</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.210" end="01:32:17.619" style="s2">to be against the drug war you know if</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.090" end="01:32:19.570" style="s2">you want it to be about freedom and</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.619" end="01:32:21.100" style="s2">liberty for yourself that what you that</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.570" end="01:32:24.489" style="s2">was like a democrats position that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.100" end="01:32:26.320" style="s2">what I remember but now now that it</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.489" end="01:32:27.670" style="s2">seems like the far left progressive and</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.320" end="01:32:29.110" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to get you in trouble for</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.670" end="01:32:31.719" style="s2">coming on my podcast but I&#39;m gonna rant</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.110" end="01:32:33.869" style="s2">just a little bit the the far left</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.719" end="01:32:36.159" style="s2">progressives seemed to be more about</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.869" end="01:32:38.409" style="s2">abdicating curtailing civil liberties</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.159" end="01:32:40.290" style="s2">than sort of releasing them from from</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.409" end="01:32:43.540" style="s2">the control the government and I think</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.290" end="01:32:45.610" style="s2">for me personally once once a gay</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.540" end="01:32:47.590" style="s2">marriage was off the table and now that</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.610" end="01:32:49.780" style="s2">the pot decriminalization seems</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.590" end="01:32:52.350" style="s2">relatively imminent in the next I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.780" end="01:32:55.449" style="s2">know two to four years maybe federally</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.350" end="01:32:57.369" style="s2">the those social issues no longer like</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.449" end="01:32:59.130" style="s2">confined me to being a Democrat and</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.369" end="01:33:01.929" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of like allowed me to</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.130" end="01:33:04.540" style="s2">participate in new political coalition&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.929" end="01:33:07.659" style="s2">and there&#39;s no way I could participate</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.540" end="01:33:08.710" style="s2">in a in a democratic political coalition</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.659" end="01:33:11.050" style="s2">that includes something like Kamala</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.710" end="01:33:12.500" style="s2">Harris who doesn&#39;t care about civil</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.050" end="01:33:13.700" style="s2">liberties who doesn&#39;t care actually</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.500" end="01:33:16.220" style="s2">following the law is all about</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.700" end="01:33:17.690" style="s2">grandstanding and pandering and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.220" end="01:33:20.120" style="s2">seeing more and more of that I think</p>
