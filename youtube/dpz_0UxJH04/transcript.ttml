<p begin="00:00:54.149" end="00:00:59.969" style="s2">since World War two and how that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.520" end="00:01:01.710" style="s2">intersecting and interacting with you</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.969" end="00:01:03.960" style="s2">know already some existing background</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.710" end="00:01:05.820" style="s2">crisis we have a meeting crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.960" end="00:01:07.350" style="s2">other you know socio political and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.820" end="00:01:09.810" style="s2">economic disparity and we see all these</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.350" end="00:01:11.760" style="s2">things sort of rolling together in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.810" end="00:01:14.460" style="s2">really complex fashion Jordan Hall calls</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.760" end="00:01:16.950" style="s2">it are unfolding meta-crisis which i</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.460" end="00:01:20.159" style="s2">think is apropos and you reached out to</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.950" end="00:01:22.500" style="s2">me which i appreciate by the way thank</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.159" end="00:01:26.490" style="s2">you and saying you you you have some</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.500" end="00:01:27.840" style="s2">thoughts on this and and obviously you</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.490" end="00:01:30.079" style="s2">have some relevant expertise and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.840" end="00:01:32.340" style="s2">talked about that in our our last</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.079" end="00:01:36.060" style="s2">meeting together where you you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.340" end="00:01:38.700" style="s2">unpacked in a very precipitations manner</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.060" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">the spirituality implicit and also</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.700" end="00:01:44.610" style="s2">needed within a therapeutic context and</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:47.009" style="s2">but maybe you can you know bring some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.610" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">that wisdom to bear right now sure or</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.009" end="00:01:51.210" style="s2">some of your thoughts about you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:57.000" style="s2">what does this mean for us how can we</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.210" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">respond to it well yeah I mean I am you</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.000" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">know like everybody I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:04.740" style="s2">paying attention I&#39;m experiencing a</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:08.550" style="s2">significant wave of recalibration and</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.740" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">you know my schema of understanding you</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.550" end="00:02:13.760" style="s2">know I certainly like Jordan like</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:16.470" style="s2">yourself you know have</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:18.510" style="s2">meta-crisis sense of the globe in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.470" end="00:02:20.700" style="s2">sense that our relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.510" end="00:02:23.400" style="s2">planet the complexities of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.700" end="00:02:26.400" style="s2">arrangements are the way we make sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.400" end="00:02:27.900" style="s2">out of the world the way we cultivate or</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.400" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">fail to cultivate virtue and character</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.900" end="00:02:33.750" style="s2">and wisdom and all of that complexity</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:36.239" style="s2">was making us very vulnerable yeah to a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.750" end="00:02:38.640" style="s2">wide variety of different you know we we</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.239" end="00:02:40.019" style="s2">had stacked fragilities which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.640" end="00:02:42.260" style="s2">something I think that you know Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.019" end="00:02:44.040" style="s2">Hall would speak about and inter system</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.260" end="00:02:46.859" style="s2">dependencies in ways that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.040" end="00:02:50.129" style="s2">understand that make a massive flux you</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.859" end="00:02:53.639" style="s2">know in those macro level systems really</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.129" end="00:02:55.980" style="s2">vulnerable to lots of externalities and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.639" end="00:02:57.930" style="s2">contingencies that then will create</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.980" end="00:03:00.599" style="s2">waves of change that are very very hard</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.930" end="00:03:07.769" style="s2">to anticipate and I think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.599" end="00:03:09.840" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing and so for me and I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.769" end="00:03:11.370" style="s2">that you know for all of us then what</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.840" end="00:03:13.889" style="s2">will happen is that you&#39;ll start to then</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.370" end="00:03:15.870" style="s2">get an enormous sense of anxiety and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.889" end="00:03:18.150" style="s2">think you you and Jordan spoke to this</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.870" end="00:03:20.280" style="s2">some in the sense that that anxiety will</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.150" end="00:03:23.220" style="s2">then start to look for sense making</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.280" end="00:03:26.010" style="s2">systems potentially transfer into fear</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.220" end="00:03:27.930" style="s2">and belie and and oh my god this is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.010" end="00:03:29.579" style="s2">you know and then and then try to attack</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.930" end="00:03:32.840" style="s2">certain kinds of things because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.579" end="00:03:32.840" style="s2">a general unprecedented</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.000" end="00:03:40.049" style="s2">thats a ill stated problem that&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.760" end="00:03:42.419" style="s2">to solve right right now and and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.049" end="00:03:44.430" style="s2">then what to do with that you know and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.419" end="00:03:48.150" style="s2">so one of the things that I would want</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.430" end="00:03:50.069" style="s2">folks to think some about is is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.150" end="00:03:52.290" style="s2">first I talk about awareness acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.069" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">and change mmm no sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.290" end="00:03:56.370" style="s2">developmentally those are big three like</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:03:58.260" style="s2">if I do psychotherapy what is the work</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.370" end="00:04:02.329" style="s2">of psychotherapy they almost always fall</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.260" end="00:04:02.329" style="s2">under one of those three categories</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.319" end="00:04:08.639" style="s2">awareness so we want to create a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.699" end="00:04:11.069" style="s2">metacognitive understanding of thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.639" end="00:04:13.859" style="s2">feelings relationships situations</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.069" end="00:04:16.530" style="s2">history and and piece them together with</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.859" end="00:04:18.510" style="s2">more richness and sophistication and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.530" end="00:04:20.190" style="s2">complexity you know so you want that</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.510" end="00:04:23.639" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things that we do and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.190" end="00:04:25.740" style="s2">we all we all want that and so all right</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.639" end="00:04:27.510" style="s2">and then as you gain awareness then</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.740" end="00:04:30.480" style="s2">there&#39;s this dialectic awill</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.510" end="00:04:35.460" style="s2">acceptance like how do we how how do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.480" end="00:04:41.010" style="s2">be with say pain or unpressed a table</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.460" end="00:04:44.180" style="s2">anxiety you know distress of of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.010" end="00:04:46.680" style="s2">might be present in our psyche how do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.180" end="00:04:49.530" style="s2">maintain that from a number of different</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.680" end="00:04:53.550" style="s2">perspectives and and also how do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.530" end="00:04:55.560" style="s2">become through active change you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.550" end="00:04:59.160" style="s2">and maybe imaginal structures of what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.560" end="00:05:04.200" style="s2">could be ideals virtues notions symbols</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.160" end="00:05:07.170" style="s2">right to become better grow to become</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.200" end="00:05:09.540" style="s2">more adaptive and so you know so when I</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.170" end="00:05:12.600" style="s2">find myself in this kind of situation</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.540" end="00:05:15.450" style="s2">I&#39;ll get bumped you know by the wave of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.600" end="00:05:16.950" style="s2">panic say you know I&#39;ve definitely sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.450" end="00:05:18.780" style="s2">of my daughter</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.950" end="00:05:22.320" style="s2">two nights ago had a really bad migraine</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.780" end="00:05:23.250" style="s2">she gets them maybe you know every two</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.320" end="00:05:27.180" style="s2">or three times a year</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.250" end="00:05:29.490" style="s2">my son ah so we were there and she was</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.180" end="00:05:32.040" style="s2">crying you know and and my my wife and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.490" end="00:05:33.930" style="s2">were there and you know normally you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.040" end="00:05:36.780" style="s2">have more psychological resources right</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.930" end="00:05:38.610" style="s2">yeah you know but I will tell you you</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.780" end="00:05:41.310" style="s2">watching my daughter cry and in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.610" end="00:05:44.130" style="s2">context had you know had added layers of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.310" end="00:05:46.140" style="s2">meaning right right because you&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.130" end="00:05:47.550" style="s2">of like okay there&#39;s a there&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.140" end="00:05:49.470" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be a wave of suffering I</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.550" end="00:05:51.390" style="s2">mean that&#39;s not very profound but it it</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.470" end="00:05:54.180" style="s2">will be quite intense and when you feel</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.390" end="00:05:56.850" style="s2">it in your heart and you get can get a</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.180" end="00:05:59.460" style="s2">little overwhelmed so I had to take a</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.850" end="00:06:03.390" style="s2">moment to find my centerline you know be</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.460" end="00:06:06.270" style="s2">in contact with that recognize what that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.390" end="00:06:08.970" style="s2">means for me and and cultivate a sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.270" end="00:06:10.770" style="s2">of curiosity with it a capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.970" end="00:06:14.160" style="s2">tolerate it</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.770" end="00:06:17.490" style="s2">really enhance my loving compassion for</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.160" end="00:06:20.040" style="s2">us as humans my daughter myself right</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.490" end="00:06:22.410" style="s2">and then just situate myself as</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.040" end="00:06:24.840" style="s2">motivated to what valued outcomes they</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.410" end="00:06:27.200" style="s2">are given the situation that I&#39;m in you</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.840" end="00:06:30.510" style="s2">know so those that&#39;s that&#39;s the calm mo</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.200" end="00:06:33.000" style="s2">kind of psycho technology that I talked</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.510" end="00:06:35.850" style="s2">about before and you know I so I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.000" end="00:06:37.440" style="s2">maybe two of those two moments since</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.850" end="00:06:40.410" style="s2">this thing started where it really felt</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.440" end="00:06:41.430" style="s2">you know because I&#39;m pretty pressed with</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.410" end="00:06:43.530" style="s2">all of the things that are going</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.430" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">at least in the way my mind rolls them</p>

<p begin="00:06:57.720" end="00:07:02.070" style="s2">the way you just went through sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.030" end="00:07:05.420" style="s2">their concretely what you did in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.070" end="00:07:07.800" style="s2">face of sort of meant mounting panic</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.420" end="00:07:11.130" style="s2">given of course the fact that we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.800" end="00:07:13.230" style="s2">all suffering cognitive overload and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.130" end="00:07:14.760" style="s2">know a sense of scarcity in a sense you</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.230" end="00:07:17.100" style="s2">know Chris and I have been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.760" end="00:07:19.160" style="s2">how a lot of you know we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.100" end="00:07:21.600" style="s2">through an enforced period of you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.160" end="00:07:23.220" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing and Dom aside in</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.600" end="00:07:25.740" style="s2">which a lot of what we found to be home</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.220" end="00:07:27.510" style="s2">and the world is collapsing in and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.740" end="00:07:30.630" style="s2">feeling threatened even in our in our</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.510" end="00:07:34.170" style="s2">homes and and the meaning of everything</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.630" end="00:07:37.200" style="s2">is in question and so you know in that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.170" end="00:07:39.510" style="s2">sense this is magnifying the enactment</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.200" end="00:07:42.180" style="s2">of important aspects of the mean crisis</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.510" end="00:07:44.700" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly right that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.180" end="00:07:46.200" style="s2">I mean I just happened to see something</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.700" end="00:07:48.570" style="s2">on psychology day a little bit that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.200" end="00:07:50.910" style="s2">trying to deconstruct some of the key</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.570" end="00:07:54.210" style="s2">elements of you die ammonia you know in</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.910" end="00:07:55.770" style="s2">terms of purpose coherence of one&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.210" end="00:07:58.230" style="s2">narrative and then it really hit on</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.770" end="00:07:59.730" style="s2">mattering and argument mattering was you</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.230" end="00:08:02.340" style="s2">know was he and in this particular</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.730" end="00:08:04.980" style="s2">analysis mattering popped even more than</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.340" end="00:08:06.540" style="s2">coherence or purpose and yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.980" end="00:08:08.640" style="s2">yeah you get this whole wave and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.540" end="00:08:10.710" style="s2">know those of us that are existentially</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.640" end="00:08:13.710" style="s2">inclined you know as all you always you</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.710" end="00:08:16.440" style="s2">know at some level of it confronted the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.710" end="00:08:19.230" style="s2">existential absurdity and the inherent</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.440" end="00:08:20.760" style="s2">fragility of human life in general in</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.230" end="00:08:22.830" style="s2">our own human lives you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.760" end="00:08:25.560" style="s2">this is one of those moments at some</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.830" end="00:08:27.600" style="s2">level you know where you it is at least</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.560" end="00:08:29.640" style="s2">and confronts some of that and and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.600" end="00:08:31.260" style="s2">struggle to matter and how to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.640" end="00:08:33.600" style="s2">out of mattering in these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.260" end="00:08:35.660" style="s2">moments as I think what you know what</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.600" end="00:08:42.180" style="s2">the human condition often finds itself</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.660" end="00:08:44.610" style="s2">as being about it&#39;s the point about</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.180" end="00:08:46.860" style="s2">mattering is is so directly and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.610" end="00:08:51.360" style="s2">personally relevant that&#39;s why I was out</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.860" end="00:08:52.760" style="s2">of frame it so AM are flus basically my</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.170" end="00:09:01.250" style="s2">and what can I do and we&#39;ve been talking</p>

<p begin="00:09:15.290" end="00:09:19.970" style="s2">how much having a concrete sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.350" end="00:09:22.190" style="s2">being able to make a difference for</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.970" end="00:09:25.340" style="s2">other people and to matter to other</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.190" end="00:09:26.870" style="s2">people was actually also you know I</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.340" end="00:09:32.450" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to say therapeutic for</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.870" end="00:09:34.250" style="s2">me that says I could potentially help in</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.450" end="00:09:36.740" style="s2">some way I&#39;m not trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.250" end="00:09:38.600" style="s2">presumptuous but you know people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.740" end="00:09:40.910" style="s2">saying it&#39;s helping so I&#39;m going on what</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.600" end="00:09:44.090" style="s2">people are saying oh absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.910" end="00:09:45.650" style="s2">right and that you know that comes again</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.090" end="00:09:47.840" style="s2">to this whole point of mattering of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.650" end="00:09:50.810" style="s2">being bright not just how things are</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.840" end="00:09:55.430" style="s2">relevant to me but how I am relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.810" end="00:09:59.420" style="s2">outside of my and it&#39;s interesting how</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.430" end="00:10:00.830" style="s2">much I mean I don&#39;t like to use the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.420" end="00:10:05.150" style="s2">cliche of the silver lining because it</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.830" end="00:10:06.740" style="s2">tends to be too dismissive but a Peter</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.150" end="00:10:09.680" style="s2">Peter Lindberg talks about this as being</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.740" end="00:10:12.860" style="s2">a Kairos like a turning point because on</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.680" end="00:10:15.050" style="s2">one hand we&#39;re getting this sort of dama</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.860" end="00:10:17.960" style="s2">side reciprocal nearing yes whole world</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.050" end="00:10:20.330" style="s2">view all of the all of the complacent</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.960" end="00:10:31.430" style="s2">obviousness although one second just one</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.330" end="00:10:36.460" style="s2">second sorry I&#39;m sorry I said a little</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.430" end="00:10:38.390" style="s2">bit no no and yes go ahead and you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.460" end="00:10:40.460" style="s2">Peter Lindbergh talked about when a</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.390" end="00:10:42.200" style="s2">Kairos because while we&#39;re having all</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.460" end="00:10:45.680" style="s2">this reciprocal narrowing and Dom aside</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.200" end="00:10:47.960" style="s2">as you just said you know mattering and</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.680" end="00:10:50.630" style="s2">you know directly connecting to other</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.960" end="00:10:52.340" style="s2">people is popping out as a weight that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.630" end="00:10:56.000" style="s2">that thing that I attended to background</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.340" end="00:10:58.970" style="s2">a lot is actually foreground thing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.000" end="00:10:59.870" style="s2">you know I have to rely on that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.970" end="00:11:01.870" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.870" end="00:11:05.060" style="s2">this and I were talking about you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.870" end="00:11:06.170" style="s2">that I actually cannot pause you there</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.060" end="00:11:09.709" style="s2">for two seconds I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.170" end="00:11:12.170" style="s2">so fundamentally actually in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.709" end="00:11:13.810" style="s2">realizing what&#39;s relevant yes all right</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.170" end="00:11:17.209" style="s2">I put it in realizing what&#39;s relevant</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.810" end="00:11:19.579" style="s2">your your capacity John to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.209" end="00:11:21.529" style="s2">position to offer the kind of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.579" end="00:11:24.980" style="s2">technologist individuals that they need</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.529" end="00:11:26.839" style="s2">at this moment to foster growth you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.980" end="00:11:29.389" style="s2">what in some ways that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.839" end="00:11:31.220" style="s2">that&#39;s the essence of what mattering is</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.389" end="00:11:34.339" style="s2">about is to socially influence people</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.220" end="00:11:36.649" style="s2">towards the growth and meaning processes</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.339" end="00:11:39.230" style="s2">that they can enact you know and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.649" end="00:11:42.440" style="s2">so it is something to be honored as</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.230" end="00:11:44.899" style="s2">exactly the kind of value and quite</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.440" end="00:11:47.060" style="s2">frankly if we think about what&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.899" end="00:11:48.920" style="s2">the values that we need to embrace on</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.060" end="00:11:51.050" style="s2">the other side of this you know on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.920" end="00:11:54.019" style="s2">other side of the meaning crisis that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.050" end="00:11:56.120" style="s2">exactly that would be an exemplar right</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.019" end="00:11:57.920" style="s2">yeah of the kind of things that need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.120" end="00:12:01.040" style="s2">matter so I just want to I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.920" end="00:12:02.420" style="s2">hold that and and honor that no thank</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.040" end="00:12:10.339" style="s2">you for saying that I think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.420" end="00:12:12.529" style="s2">I think wisdom as both the the reliable</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.339" end="00:12:15.560" style="s2">ability to ameliorate you know the way</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.529" end="00:12:17.540" style="s2">in which you know these conditions can</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.560" end="00:12:19.760" style="s2">lead us into self-deception so that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.540" end="00:12:22.010" style="s2">have the discernment to see through you</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.760" end="00:12:24.589" style="s2">know the way all of this can cloud us on</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.010" end="00:12:27.050" style="s2">powerful ways and then the affording of</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.589" end="00:12:31.010" style="s2">the reliable affording of the these</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.050" end="00:12:33.680" style="s2">connections ultimately are constitutive</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.010" end="00:12:36.230" style="s2">of our humanity our sense of our</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.680" end="00:12:39.769" style="s2">humanity and our meaning yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.230" end="00:12:40.279" style="s2">that wisdom is needed more yeah now more</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.769" end="00:12:42.589" style="s2">than ever</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.279" end="00:12:44.899" style="s2">um and and I I don&#39;t want to say that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.589" end="00:12:46.579" style="s2">I was mentioning to Chris the other day</p>

<p begin="00:13:50.480" end="00:13:56.210" style="s2">and meaning becomes central I understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.620" end="00:13:59.630" style="s2">you know that right now we have to give</p>

<p begin="00:14:48.020" end="00:14:54.110" style="s2">are building and we&#39;ve lost a bit of our</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.050" end="00:14:58.400" style="s2">way in relation and and that is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.110" end="00:15:01.520" style="s2">great hope that I have for this virus is</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.400" end="00:15:03.080" style="s2">that in many ways it&#39;s and I want to be</p>

<p begin="00:15:16.430" end="00:15:21.200" style="s2">but I really do think that what we need</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.100" end="00:15:23.720" style="s2">is some leadership that this holds the</p>

<p begin="00:15:23.720" end="00:15:27.560" style="s2">the same time helps without being glib</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.120" end="00:15:29.600" style="s2">or trite recognize that there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:15:30.330" end="00:15:34.980" style="s2">yep deep deep recalibrations I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.840" end="00:15:38.280" style="s2">is probably going to be the best year</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.980" end="00:15:40.440" style="s2">ever for the planet in terms of over the</p>

<p begin="00:15:40.440" end="00:15:45.830" style="s2">years in terms of carbon footprint and</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.690" end="00:15:48.120" style="s2">things like that as the GDP comes down</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.830" end="00:15:49.890" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.120" end="00:15:52.230" style="s2">being burned and damaged and happening</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.890" end="00:15:55.140" style="s2">and there&#39;s an enormous opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.230" end="00:15:59.190" style="s2">us to then potentially shift like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.140" end="00:16:01.050" style="s2">been talking about zoom topia you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.190" end="00:16:03.300" style="s2">I&#39;ve had more great conversations on</p>

<p begin="00:16:03.300" end="00:16:07.230" style="s2">had you know and that there&#39;s no carbon</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.760" end="00:16:09.630" style="s2">footprint there there&#39;s lots of good</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.230" end="00:16:11.720" style="s2">wonderful connection we thought we</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.630" end="00:16:14.400" style="s2">formed certain kinds of communities</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.720" end="00:16:18.570" style="s2">seeking those kinds of they feel healthy</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.400" end="00:16:21.650" style="s2">so I&#39;m I&#39;m thinking about kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.570" end="00:16:23.940" style="s2">processes by which we hold and attend to</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.650" end="00:16:25.230" style="s2">the kinds of events that I you know I</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.940" end="00:16:27.840" style="s2">had with my daughter and things like</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.230" end="00:16:29.790" style="s2">that and come together and know that</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.840" end="00:16:31.890" style="s2">family&#39;s going to be stressed and and at</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.790" end="00:16:34.500" style="s2">the same time we need leadership we need</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.890" end="00:16:37.350" style="s2">guidance we need we need hope we need</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.500" end="00:16:39.180" style="s2">movement towards valued states of being</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.350" end="00:16:41.670" style="s2">and I really do believe there are in</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.180" end="00:16:43.590" style="s2">fact my old mentor and still good</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.670" end="00:16:45.720" style="s2">friends sociologist Joe Mikulski I just</p>

<p begin="00:16:55.740" end="00:17:01.050" style="s2">a lot of potential opportunity here for</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.560" end="00:17:02.400" style="s2">growth in an adaptive direction so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.050" end="00:17:04.200" style="s2">talk about that because I think that was</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.400" end="00:17:07.920" style="s2">very well said well you just you just</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.200" end="00:17:09.750" style="s2">said there&#39;s definitely that opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.920" end="00:17:11.310" style="s2">there&#39;s also a lot of threat you</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.750" end="00:17:12.870" style="s2">mentioned that earlier there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.310" end="00:17:14.910" style="s2">threat in which people could try and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.870" end="00:17:17.970" style="s2">find you know the the lightning rod to</p>

<p begin="00:17:20.010" end="00:17:24.630" style="s2">feel that they have a narrative that</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.450" end="00:17:25.890" style="s2">gives them some action to perform these</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.630" end="00:17:27.690" style="s2">are all real dangers you would know that</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.890" end="00:17:29.100" style="s2">better than I in fact I&#39;m sure you see</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.690" end="00:17:31.140" style="s2">that kind of transference and</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.100" end="00:17:32.940" style="s2">displacement going on within therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.140" end="00:17:36.780" style="s2">context and it&#39;s happened in a clinic</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.940" end="00:17:39.840" style="s2">room here and there so you know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.780" end="00:17:43.260" style="s2">referring to I think there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.840" end="00:17:43.920" style="s2">danger of nostalgia which is let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.260" end="00:17:47.310" style="s2">back to nor</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.920" end="00:17:48.690" style="s2">as soon as we can and I think that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.310" end="00:17:50.220" style="s2">I if this came out in the discussion I</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.690" end="00:17:52.500" style="s2">would Jordan Hall I think that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.220" end="00:17:54.570" style="s2">mistake I think thinking that this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.500" end="00:17:57.690" style="s2">going to be the only pandemic that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.570" end="00:17:59.160" style="s2">gonna face in the next 10 years is III</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.690" end="00:18:01.770" style="s2">think that I find that highly improbable</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.160" end="00:18:05.100" style="s2">I think all the factors that made this</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.770" end="00:18:07.850" style="s2">happen are still in place and are going</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.100" end="00:18:11.310" style="s2">to ramp up once again if we don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.850" end="00:18:15.900" style="s2">significant systemic changes and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.310" end="00:18:18.030" style="s2">won&#39;t have the you know the the economic</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.900" end="00:18:21.990" style="s2">leverage to do what we&#39;re doing right</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.030" end="00:18:26.220" style="s2">now multiple times and we&#39;re gonna wear</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.990" end="00:18:27.930" style="s2">things down and so I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.220" end="00:18:29.940" style="s2">danger of nostalgia which is let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.930" end="00:18:31.950" style="s2">back to normal and let&#39;s just pretend</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.940" end="00:18:35.010" style="s2">you know that&#39;s never gonna ever happen</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.950" end="00:18:37.170" style="s2">again I think that&#39;s a threat that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.010" end="00:18:40.950" style="s2">have to take very seriously because</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.170" end="00:18:44.190" style="s2">nostalgia can be very sort of welcoming</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.950" end="00:18:46.860" style="s2">in in their earth SATs homecoming that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.190" end="00:18:52.740" style="s2">they sort of give you right and then the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.860" end="00:18:59.490" style="s2">other fear I have is a fear of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.740" end="00:19:03.330" style="s2">utopia in which people use this as an</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.490" end="00:19:05.730" style="s2">excuse for claiming justification for</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.800" end="00:19:15.330" style="s2">- you can see people saying aha you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.350" end="00:19:20.370" style="s2">I told you and you know we and so those</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.330" end="00:19:21.240" style="s2">strike me as both very significant</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.370" end="00:19:22.620" style="s2">dangerous what are your thoughts about</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.240" end="00:19:26.040" style="s2">that oh absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.620" end="00:19:29.730" style="s2">I mean you know the the I mean first off</p>

<p begin="00:20:33.660" end="00:20:39.660" style="s2">fragile you know if there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.060" end="00:20:42.570" style="s2">profound fragility that resides in</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.660" end="00:20:44.940" style="s2">relationship to our current system so</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.570" end="00:20:47.460" style="s2">those people that want nostalgia you</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.940" end="00:20:49.230" style="s2">know my point was be very aware that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.460" end="00:20:50.790" style="s2">we were living on borrowed time</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.230" end="00:20:53.160" style="s2">you know I mean we were living on</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.790" end="00:20:54.900" style="s2">borrowed time we were not in a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.160" end="00:20:57.930" style="s2">we were addicted to certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.900" end="00:20:59.190" style="s2">things yeah yeah and and what I say you</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.930" end="00:21:02.220" style="s2">know and I try not to say this</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.190" end="00:21:04.290" style="s2">politically but I I my assessment you</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.220" end="00:21:06.990" style="s2">know is we elect President Trump for a</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.290" end="00:21:08.760" style="s2">number of different reasons but when</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.990" end="00:21:10.230" style="s2">people say that he&#39;s authentic one of</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.760" end="00:21:12.210" style="s2">the things that they mean about him is</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.230" end="00:21:16.080" style="s2">that he represents a particular type of</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.210" end="00:21:17.610" style="s2">archetype and I believe he represents a</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.080" end="00:21:21.150" style="s2">particular type of archetype that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.610" end="00:21:23.330" style="s2">been living off of a shallow</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.150" end="00:21:27.060" style="s2">consumeristic kind of narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.330" end="00:21:29.100" style="s2">me-first egotistical frame of reference</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.060" end="00:21:31.500" style="s2">that basically was like that is what we</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.100" end="00:21:34.320" style="s2">are and I somebody vote Democratic I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.500" end="00:21:36.450" style="s2">also saying I am Trump you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.320" end="00:21:38.640" style="s2">we kind of have to recognize that there</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.450" end="00:21:40.350" style="s2">so when I if I were here people say hey</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.640" end="00:21:41.700" style="s2">we just got to go back the good times</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.350" end="00:21:43.650" style="s2">were good in certain ways but they were</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.700" end="00:21:45.210" style="s2">building a nested set of fragilities</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.650" end="00:21:48.660" style="s2">that were very very dangerous we were</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.210" end="00:21:50.100" style="s2">not anti fragile integrated coherent you</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.660" end="00:21:52.410" style="s2">know and and and our inability to</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.100" end="00:21:54.240" style="s2">respond to this is just diagnostic of</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.410" end="00:21:55.800" style="s2">that and there&#39;s other systems that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.240" end="00:21:57.540" style="s2">gonna be coming and hitting this thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.800" end="00:21:59.190" style="s2">and we can only take so many we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.540" end="00:22:02.250" style="s2">how this one happens you know we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.190" end="00:22:04.230" style="s2">if this one grows so I think that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.250" end="00:22:06.630" style="s2">need leadership that says this is a I</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.230" end="00:22:08.790" style="s2">hope this will be a somewhat painful but</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.630" end="00:22:10.290" style="s2">not catastrophic wake-up call and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.790" end="00:22:11.670" style="s2">better be a wake-up call to say that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.290" end="00:22:14.040" style="s2">were addicted to things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.670" end="00:22:17.070" style="s2">dangerous to be addicted to meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.040" end="00:22:18.810" style="s2">we have gotten into dukkha Paris excite</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.070" end="00:22:20.760" style="s2">mind structures that have narrowed our</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.810" end="00:22:23.880" style="s2">field of understanding and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.760" end="00:22:25.530" style="s2">use this to wake it up so so and at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.880" end="00:22:27.540" style="s2">same time the world is changing so much</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.530" end="00:22:29.580" style="s2">than anybody has an ideology that thinks</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.540" end="00:22:31.620" style="s2">they know what the future is right that</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.580" end="00:22:35.540" style="s2">they know what the answers are in terms</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.620" end="00:22:37.980" style="s2">of what 2030 2040 should look like</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.540" end="00:22:40.200" style="s2">there&#39;s great ancient wisdom traditions</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.980" end="00:22:41.940" style="s2">and a lot of intelligent thought about</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.200" end="00:22:43.740" style="s2">the kind of collective intelligence ease</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.940" end="00:22:45.870" style="s2">that we need to bring to bear but those</p>

<p begin="00:22:45.870" end="00:22:49.320" style="s2">gonna have to grow from the ground and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.940" end="00:22:51.960" style="s2">don&#39;t think anybody says that they have</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.320" end="00:22:55.590" style="s2">a prescribed ideology that has it all</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.960" end="00:22:57.390" style="s2">well whatever right Wow very eloquently</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.590" end="00:23:00.750" style="s2">said Greg that was really wonderful I</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.390" end="00:23:02.940" style="s2">wanted to and thank you for alluding to</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.750" end="00:23:08.910" style="s2">some of my work in what you were saying</p>

<p begin="00:23:08.910" end="00:23:13.890" style="s2">like the way you you you you pointed how</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.860" end="00:23:15.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a common thing and and both the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.890" end="00:23:18.540" style="s2">utopianism and the Nostalgia are getting</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.870" end="00:23:21.450" style="s2">it wrong which is sort of the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.540" end="00:23:23.580" style="s2">complexity and how much how much</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.450" end="00:23:25.860" style="s2">ignorance we have in the face of it I</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.580" end="00:23:29.010" style="s2">think that&#39;s really really very well</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.860" end="00:23:32.180" style="s2">said I wanted to bring up one point that</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.010" end="00:23:36.750" style="s2">johannes anita Houser talks about and</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.180" end="00:23:38.370" style="s2">kim it&#39;s he and guys in stock of had</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.750" end="00:23:41.220" style="s2">some I&#39;ve had one with your harness and</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.370" end="00:23:43.710" style="s2">then Joe your harness and guy and I had</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.220" end="00:23:47.550" style="s2">one he brings a sort of a Haida garyun</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.710" end="00:23:50.250" style="s2">critique and one of the things he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.550" end="00:23:51.840" style="s2">talking about recently and it converges</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.250" end="00:23:56.250" style="s2">with stuff Chris and I are working on is</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.840" end="00:23:59.490" style="s2">how how it&#39;s happening right now it has</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.250" end="00:24:01.470" style="s2">what it&#39;s thrown us back on to the sort</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.490" end="00:24:04.290" style="s2">of the god of our world which is our</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.470" end="00:24:05.970" style="s2">subjectivity right and you alluded to</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.290" end="00:24:08.040" style="s2">that with our narcissism right</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.970" end="00:24:09.930" style="s2">and so right we&#39;re and we&#39;re being sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.040" end="00:24:12.240" style="s2">of forced now and this is almost like</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.930" end="00:24:14.970" style="s2">you know a crooked Guardian moment we</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.240" end="00:24:17.400" style="s2">sort of well I am I I&#39;m self made and</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.970" end="00:24:20.190" style="s2">it&#39;s all you know and so you have that</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.400" end="00:24:22.650" style="s2">that you know the intense authority of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.190" end="00:24:25.170" style="s2">our of our subjectivity and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.650" end="00:24:27.600" style="s2">actually being forced to it and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.170" end="00:24:30.150" style="s2">point is finding that what is supposed</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.600" end="00:24:32.040" style="s2">to be the own phallus of the world I am</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.150" end="00:24:34.560" style="s2">the center and my subjectivity in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.040" end="00:24:36.930" style="s2">Cartesian cogito and all that right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.560" end="00:24:40.650" style="s2">finding wow this is actually really</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.930" end="00:24:43.170" style="s2">shallow this it doesn&#39;t have any of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.650" end="00:24:45.570" style="s2">depth or resources from which I can give</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.170" end="00:24:49.230" style="s2">birth to the wisdom and the growth I</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.570" end="00:24:51.030" style="s2">need and we need for it even better in</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.230" end="00:24:53.280" style="s2">order to respond appropriately to this</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.030" end="00:24:55.830" style="s2">crisis and I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.280" end="00:24:58.620" style="s2">a very important point that you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.830" end="00:25:00.870" style="s2">that this challenges that whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.620" end="00:25:03.510" style="s2">orientation which I think you rightly</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.870" end="00:25:06.750" style="s2">point out Trump exemplifies as an</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.510" end="00:25:11.730" style="s2">archetype that shallow all-consuming</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.750" end="00:25:13.740" style="s2">self referential subjectivity yes I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.730" end="00:25:16.860" style="s2">and that&#39;s why we&#39;re that&#39;s why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.740" end="00:25:20.850" style="s2">psychically fragile yes you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.860" end="00:25:23.220" style="s2">and so to to then say you know I matter</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.850" end="00:25:24.810" style="s2">because I have this degree from you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.220" end="00:25:26.340" style="s2">from some Ivy League and I matter</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.810" end="00:25:28.110" style="s2">because I&#39;ve climbed the market matter</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.340" end="00:25:29.820" style="s2">and I matter because I have a 4,000</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.110" end="00:25:31.260" style="s2">square-foot house and I matter and now</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.820" end="00:25:33.000" style="s2">all of a sudden you see this wave of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.260" end="00:25:35.310" style="s2">economic collapse in a particular way</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.000" end="00:25:37.650" style="s2">right and then you&#39;re like wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.310" end="00:25:38.760" style="s2">I do I do all these toys make me matter</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.650" end="00:25:40.290" style="s2">which of course everybody on their</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.760" end="00:25:41.730" style="s2">deathbed realized it&#39;s not all the toys</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.290" end="00:25:43.620" style="s2">you&#39;ve eliminated that makes you matter</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.730" end="00:25:45.600" style="s2">anyway right it&#39;s the it&#39;s the positive</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.620" end="00:25:47.700" style="s2">wise impact that you&#39;ve had in the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.600" end="00:25:49.380" style="s2">that ultimately allows the subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.700" end="00:25:51.690" style="s2">reflect on itself with some degree of</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.380" end="00:25:53.340" style="s2">existential stability you know now what</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.690" end="00:25:54.450" style="s2">I think is happening given our culture</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.340" end="00:25:57.600" style="s2">in its corruptions</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.450" end="00:25:59.190" style="s2">is is yeah but this is gonna be an</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.600" end="00:26:00.990" style="s2">existential crisis for a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.190" end="00:26:03.000" style="s2">because that collapse onto subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.990" end="00:26:05.250" style="s2">is going to realize a shallowness and</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.000" end="00:26:07.530" style="s2">this is what the work of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.250" end="00:26:10.410" style="s2">through the coronavirus suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.530" end="00:26:12.810" style="s2">the post coronavirus reality if this was</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.410" end="00:26:14.220" style="s2">a wake up call and actually it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.810" end="00:26:16.680" style="s2">well a very well position to do it</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.220" end="00:26:19.560" style="s2">because we&#39;re gonna be alone with</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.680" end="00:26:22.020" style="s2">ourselves right with lots of time on our</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.560" end="00:26:24.720" style="s2">hands and a lots of fiddling about what</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.020" end="00:26:28.740" style="s2">matters and so one of the hopes is is</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.720" end="00:26:32.100" style="s2">that this can knock a system to waken to</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.740" end="00:26:34.890" style="s2">the existential realities that I believe</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.100" end="00:26:36.900" style="s2">the psychic is soul into spirit really</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.890" end="00:26:39.570" style="s2">requires</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.900" end="00:26:42.000" style="s2">to have to have integrity coherence</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.570" end="00:26:44.160" style="s2">purpose and mattering so I mean that was</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.000" end="00:26:46.170" style="s2">well said and and then the you you of</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.160" end="00:26:48.300" style="s2">course and I think you did it very</p>

<p begin="00:26:55.890" end="00:26:59.790" style="s2">course there&#39;s a difference between you</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.210" end="00:27:03.780" style="s2">know you know when Descartes thought</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.790" end="00:27:05.250" style="s2">that he could capture what we had</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.780" end="00:27:07.410" style="s2">previously been meant by the word soul</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.250" end="00:27:08.900" style="s2">with with that moment of</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.410" end="00:27:12.480" style="s2">self-consciousness I think that was a</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.900" end="00:27:13.940" style="s2">breathing pivotable I pivot all that I</p>

<p begin="00:27:13.940" end="00:27:20.730" style="s2">in our cultural cognitive grammar uh but</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.000" end="00:27:23.970" style="s2">this brings me to the point that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.730" end="00:27:26.210" style="s2">wanted to say more explicitly a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.970" end="00:27:28.740" style="s2">people are facing this kind of crisis</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.210" end="00:27:31.140" style="s2">let me let me let&#39;s do a bit of history</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.740" end="00:27:32.970" style="s2">so you mentioned world war two right and</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.140" end="00:27:34.500" style="s2">then right after it of course is world</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.970" end="00:27:37.080" style="s2">war two part two which is the cold war</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.500" end="00:27:38.580" style="s2">right and let you see in America that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.080" end="00:27:40.620" style="s2">people think of it you know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.580" end="00:27:41.970" style="s2">been the steady decline in for example</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.620" end="00:27:43.440" style="s2">church attendance or religious</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.970" end="00:27:46.260" style="s2">affiliation but you see after World War</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.440" end="00:27:49.170" style="s2">two you see this huge spike right in</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.260" end="00:27:52.350" style="s2">religious attendance affiliation right</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.170" end="00:27:54.390" style="s2">and so what I mean is people have tended</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.350" end="00:27:56.580" style="s2">and and that it&#39;s that&#39;s just one</p>

<p begin="00:28:00.630" end="00:28:06.060" style="s2">they typically have been able to turn to</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.420" end="00:28:07.770" style="s2">a religious framework it&#39;s dumb</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.060" end="00:28:10.410" style="s2">something to take them out of their</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.770" end="00:28:12.120" style="s2">subjectivity give them some access to</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.410" end="00:28:13.590" style="s2">wisdom literature and you know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.120" end="00:28:15.720" style="s2">going with this of course which most</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.590" end="00:28:17.220" style="s2">people know you know we don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.720" end="00:28:20.670" style="s2">right anymore</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.220" end="00:28:22.230" style="s2">and pretending you can&#39;t just you trying</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.670" end="00:28:23.520" style="s2">to take on a religion you currently</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.230" end="00:28:24.900" style="s2">don&#39;t have is like trying to say you</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.520" end="00:28:26.640" style="s2">have a friend that it&#39;s not currently</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.900" end="00:28:30.000" style="s2">your friend it just doesn&#39;t work right</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.640" end="00:28:34.110" style="s2">there just says hey sure yep nope so</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.000" end="00:28:37.530" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which you know large</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.110" end="00:28:38.700" style="s2">segments of our population are facing</p>

<p begin="00:28:47.030" end="00:28:50.759" style="s2">attendant upon all of that is of course</p>

<p begin="00:29:38.039" end="00:29:41.459" style="s2">the course of my maturity I guess if you</p>

<p begin="00:30:05.999" end="00:30:08.099" style="s2">of college</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.569" end="00:30:09.989" style="s2">oh I realized that I&#39;m just a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.099" end="00:30:13.229" style="s2">chemicals right it was like you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.989" end="00:30:14.929" style="s2">that kind of and I had a bit of that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.229" end="00:30:17.369" style="s2">know and then I&#39;ve realized over the</p>

<p begin="00:30:17.369" end="00:30:22.199" style="s2">that I built how unbelievably horribly</p>

<p begin="00:30:32.849" end="00:30:36.449" style="s2">in a number I think there is a way to</p>

<p begin="00:33:16.290" end="00:33:22.920" style="s2">and gives us something to to live for I</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.930" end="00:33:24.420" style="s2">was very well said you I&#39;m sorry this</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.920" end="00:33:25.950" style="s2">isn&#39;t supposed to be a left-handed</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.420" end="00:33:31.820" style="s2">compliment you&#39;re extremely eloquent</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.950" end="00:33:35.160" style="s2">today I&#39;ve got a lots of Zoom practicing</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.820" end="00:33:38.520" style="s2">really well yeah I like the way you sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.160" end="00:33:41.730" style="s2">of you know that maybe the central task</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.520" end="00:33:44.010" style="s2">coming out of this is to in discover in</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.730" end="00:33:46.040" style="s2">a in a practicable way I don&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.010" end="00:33:48.300" style="s2">practical anyway anymore because I</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.040" end="00:33:50.820" style="s2">reserve that for what it now denotes</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.300" end="00:33:53.790" style="s2">right I want to talk about be you know a</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.820" end="00:33:56.490" style="s2">way they can be put into practice what</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.790" end="00:34:01.950" style="s2">this religion that&#39;s not a religion is</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.490" end="00:34:05.910" style="s2">going to look like and help III I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.950" end="00:34:07.830" style="s2">that getting into these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.910" end="00:34:10.770" style="s2">discussions so we can marshal the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.830" end="00:34:14.700" style="s2">distributed cognition so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.770" end="00:34:16.980" style="s2">help conduce it into existence because</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.700" end="00:34:20.429" style="s2">it&#39;s already emerging I think in an</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.980" end="00:34:22.710" style="s2">importantly I do see that as one of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.429" end="00:34:25.650" style="s2">central tasks facing us right now and</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.710" end="00:34:28.350" style="s2">I&#39;m hoping that as this community this</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.650" end="00:34:31.790" style="s2">biological dialectical community forms</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.350" end="00:34:35.700" style="s2">that we will get increasingly better</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.790" end="00:34:38.310" style="s2">translating a lot of this theory into</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.700" end="00:34:40.140" style="s2">lives into lives and relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.310" end="00:34:41.580" style="s2">you&#39;re you I think you will play up a</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.140" end="00:34:44.010" style="s2">particularly important role to play in</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.580" end="00:34:47.190" style="s2">that precisely because I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.010" end="00:34:48.480" style="s2">already have this overarching the tree</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.190" end="00:34:50.460" style="s2">of knowledge and you&#39;re doing all this</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.480" end="00:34:54.179" style="s2">work on trying to get all these various</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.460" end="00:34:56.580" style="s2">levels you know integrated in all use</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.179" end="00:34:59.520" style="s2">your your as you given an Aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.580" end="00:35:02.910" style="s2">fashion which i think is a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.520" end="00:35:05.640" style="s2">model to follow but I think I mean your</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.910" end="00:35:09.470" style="s2">particular expertise I mean there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.640" end="00:35:14.940" style="s2">sense in which you know the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.470" end="00:35:17.010" style="s2">the existential the ontological having</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.940" end="00:35:19.740" style="s2">to do with your worldview right and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.010" end="00:35:22.730" style="s2">aspirational you know all come into the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.740" end="00:35:26.730" style="s2">Nexus of the therapeutic situation</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.730" end="00:35:29.010" style="s2">you&#39;ve had to you know so I see</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.730" end="00:35:29.940" style="s2">spirituality as having to be what you</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.010" end="00:35:32.010" style="s2">know what what</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.940" end="00:35:35.099" style="s2">it activates all the kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.010" end="00:35:37.770" style="s2">and activates them across the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.099" end="00:35:40.170" style="s2">of the existential her ontological right</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.770" end="00:35:42.180" style="s2">and then I know that you see you see</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.170" end="00:35:45.660" style="s2">something very analogous to this in your</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.180" end="00:35:47.550" style="s2">work and and I&#39;m not I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.660" end="00:35:48.630" style="s2">you know background the theory you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.550" end="00:35:51.119" style="s2">doing but what I&#39;m saying is your</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.630" end="00:35:54.210" style="s2">expertise also because like I said the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.119" end="00:35:58.530" style="s2">therapeutic context is you know in some</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.210" end="00:36:02.310" style="s2">ways the closest we have right now to</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.530" end="00:36:03.510" style="s2">the Socratic encounter now I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.310" end="00:36:05.160" style="s2">it&#39;s the same and I think you would</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.510" end="00:36:06.540" style="s2">agree with me on that and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.160" end="00:36:08.339" style="s2">one of the work that I&#39;m trying to some</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.540" end="00:36:10.500" style="s2">of the work I&#39;m trying to do with you</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.339" end="00:36:12.750" style="s2">and especially with Chris and Peter and</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.500" end="00:36:15.780" style="s2">guy and Jordan is yeah but how do we</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.750" end="00:36:18.599" style="s2">take that you know here&#39;s circling out</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.780" end="00:36:20.490" style="s2">here and here&#39;s here and then how do we</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.599" end="00:36:22.410" style="s2">get back to what Socrates was doing with</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.490" end="00:36:26.210" style="s2">those things which is also the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.410" end="00:36:28.680" style="s2">philosophy ax the cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.210" end="00:36:33.780" style="s2">so I think you have an important role to</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.680" end="00:36:37.950" style="s2">say to that well I mean I thank you and</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.780" end="00:36:39.839" style="s2">yes I mean either I would you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.950" end="00:36:42.329" style="s2">been doing therapy for what 25 years or</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.839" end="00:36:43.710" style="s2">so uh it is a crucible you know it</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.329" end="00:36:45.869" style="s2">really is it&#39;s a crucible of</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.710" end="00:36:47.849" style="s2">encountering I mean people keep coming</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.869" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">to therapy because of some soul spirit</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.849" end="00:36:51.300" style="s2">concern and in the generic you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.920" end="00:36:51.780" style="s2">y&#39;all my life see they&#39;re not going very</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.300" end="00:36:53.880" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.780" end="00:36:56.460" style="s2">or I&#39;m having an existential collapse</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.880" end="00:36:58.530" style="s2">crisis I I can&#39;t make sense you know out</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.460" end="00:37:00.329" style="s2">of what I am and what I&#39;m doing and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.530" end="00:37:02.339" style="s2">in a panic mode or I&#39;m gonna depress</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.329" end="00:37:03.720" style="s2">shut down mode or you know that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.339" end="00:37:07.349" style="s2">that&#39;s what it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.720" end="00:37:08.760" style="s2">right but what I&#39;ve actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.349" end="00:37:10.530" style="s2">interesting but you say that because</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.760" end="00:37:13.170" style="s2">it&#39;s also the case that I&#39;m actually in</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.530" end="00:37:15.930" style="s2">this context and maybe over the last two</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.170" end="00:37:17.970" style="s2">years or so I&#39;m really frustrated with</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.930" end="00:37:20.150" style="s2">what I see is the institutional barriers</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.970" end="00:37:22.950" style="s2">that are built up around the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.150" end="00:37:25.230" style="s2">psychotherapy world okay and meaning</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.950" end="00:37:27.000" style="s2">like you know it&#39;s like so much so that</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.230" end="00:37:28.410" style="s2">I&#39;ve I mean I need to have it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.000" end="00:37:30.390" style="s2">like I want to give up my license and</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.410" end="00:37:32.339" style="s2">just go and talk to people about like</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.390" end="00:37:34.140" style="s2">the secrets that we built in the therapy</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.339" end="00:37:35.730" style="s2">room and then and then we carve them out</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.140" end="00:37:37.859" style="s2">is this sort of confessional and then we</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.730" end="00:37:39.480" style="s2">have all of this stuff that oh and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.859" end="00:37:41.130" style="s2">then we do this horrible thing kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.480" end="00:37:42.940" style="s2">like the psychopharmacology although</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.130" end="00:37:45.099" style="s2">they do it in different ways like Oh</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.940" end="00:37:47.050" style="s2">now you have a certain negative level of</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.099" end="00:37:49.690" style="s2">negative Afric will you go see an expert</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.050" end="00:37:52.359" style="s2">they&#39;ll help you figure that out right</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.690" end="00:37:55.240" style="s2">we do not want to farm out all of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.359" end="00:37:58.060" style="s2">psycho technological wisdom to two</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.240" end="00:38:02.829" style="s2">secret isolated confidential rooms with</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.060" end="00:38:04.450" style="s2">professionals not what we want to do we</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.829" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">want to take that knowledge and we want</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.450" end="00:38:11.859" style="s2">to insert that knowledge as clearly and</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:14.859" style="s2">applicable ec2 to the wisdom of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.859" end="00:38:16.599" style="s2">dialog in real indigenous human</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.859" end="00:38:18.220" style="s2">exchanges I mean that&#39;s what we really</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.599" end="00:38:20.470" style="s2">want to do yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.220" end="00:38:23.140" style="s2">so I want to connect with you guys and</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.470" end="00:38:25.150" style="s2">and connect to bring all of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.140" end="00:38:27.849" style="s2">out of the therapy of course with</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.150" end="00:38:29.710" style="s2">specific you know psychological health</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.849" end="00:38:32.050" style="s2">related issues in particular of course</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.710" end="00:38:35.020" style="s2">we need a professional context but we</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.050" end="00:38:37.359" style="s2">want to generalize that stuff that ya</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.020" end="00:38:40.390" style="s2">know yeah and we want to generalize it</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.359" end="00:38:42.579" style="s2">too because of course as you know as</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.390" end="00:38:44.770" style="s2">much as we can personally reflect it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.579" end="00:38:46.630" style="s2">the vast majority of our health let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.770" end="00:38:48.640" style="s2">face it is embedded in the society in</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.630" end="00:38:51.880" style="s2">which we live yes yes right so we need</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.640" end="00:38:54.160" style="s2">to create a society that is conducive to</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.880" end="00:38:56.079" style="s2">wisdom and psychological flourishing</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.160" end="00:38:57.819" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the responsibility and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.079" end="00:38:59.440" style="s2">actually I don&#39;t know that psychology</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.819" end="00:39:01.329" style="s2">especially not with its focus on</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.440" end="00:39:03.910" style="s2">individual psychotherapy I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.329" end="00:39:05.890" style="s2">there&#39;s been that great in helping you</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.910" end="00:39:08.130" style="s2">know in society I think it Cloisters a</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.890" end="00:39:10.240" style="s2">lot of stuff away I think it slices a</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.130" end="00:39:12.220" style="s2">professional knowledge that shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.240" end="00:39:14.380" style="s2">professional I think it should be and</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.220" end="00:39:17.530" style="s2">and so I think we have to get out there</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.380" end="00:39:19.900" style="s2">and and hand the psycho technologies and</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.530" end="00:39:24.040" style="s2">embed them in the communities and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.900" end="00:39:25.630" style="s2">relationships that we live in right this</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.040" end="00:39:28.359" style="s2">is Socrates in the Agora</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.630" end="00:39:31.060" style="s2">right Socrates is walking into the</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.359" end="00:39:33.310" style="s2">market right right and we need</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.060" end="00:39:35.530" style="s2">philosophy we need pedagogy we need</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.310" end="00:39:38.770" style="s2">psychology all to come together as part</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.530" end="00:39:41.800" style="s2">of society not as siloed separate</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.770" end="00:39:43.990" style="s2">isolated things but as real-world around</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.800" end="00:39:47.230" style="s2">the day or dinner table realities that</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.990" end="00:39:49.060" style="s2">are part of and parcel to the human</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.230" end="00:39:50.470" style="s2">experience yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.060" end="00:39:52.630" style="s2">I think that&#39;s very well said I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.470" end="00:40:00.949" style="s2">that&#39;s very well said</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.630" end="00:40:03.039" style="s2">so that brings me again to what do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.949" end="00:40:05.390" style="s2">think needs to change them</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.039" end="00:40:08.150" style="s2">institutionally because you and you sort</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.390" end="00:40:11.079" style="s2">of invoked I believe an institutional</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.150" end="00:40:14.029" style="s2">prison in some ways in his prison or</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.079" end="00:40:15.859" style="s2">oystering or warehousing it like the a</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.029" end="00:40:18.920" style="s2">lot of these images came to my mind when</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.859" end="00:40:20.959" style="s2">when you you were speaking so</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.920" end="00:40:22.579" style="s2">passionately well I didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.959" end="00:40:24.920" style="s2">language before I sort of entered into</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.579" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">the you know the meta modern community</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.920" end="00:40:30.890" style="s2">which I know that you know and learn</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:33.559" style="s2">things like the blue church from Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.890" end="00:40:35.539" style="s2">Hall and that kind of stuff and I sort</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.559" end="00:40:36.979" style="s2">of feel trapped in that in retrospect I</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.539" end="00:40:39.309" style="s2">feel trapped in the blue church of</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.979" end="00:40:41.809" style="s2">psychology both inside the Academy</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.309" end="00:40:44.449" style="s2">inside its psychotherapy and I actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.809" end="00:40:46.219" style="s2">see it now as they try to follow I&#39;m you</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.449" end="00:40:48.170" style="s2">should I think they&#39;re opening up of</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.219" end="00:40:49.849" style="s2">course because they have to but some</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.170" end="00:40:52.069" style="s2">people as they try to follow the rules</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.849" end="00:40:53.989" style="s2">of confidentiality and it&#39;s state</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.069" end="00:40:55.369" style="s2">licensure and because everyone now is</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.989" end="00:40:56.029" style="s2">trying to do therapy and now all of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.369" end="00:40:58.219" style="s2">sudden you&#39;re doing everything</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.029" end="00:41:01.249" style="s2">telehealth and everyone disperses to</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.219" end="00:41:03.319" style="s2">their homes and what is okay and I get</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.249" end="00:41:06.380" style="s2">it it&#39;s it&#39;s complicated but it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.319" end="00:41:09.079" style="s2">so out of date it&#39;s just so archaic and</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.380" end="00:41:12.130" style="s2">just so misguided it&#39;s just like the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.079" end="00:41:15.979" style="s2">whole blue church narrative writ large</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.130" end="00:41:18.650" style="s2">so in the sense that the institutional</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.979" end="00:41:19.309" style="s2">ways of thinking inside let&#39;s say inside</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.650" end="00:41:21.529" style="s2">the Academy</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.309" end="00:41:24.079" style="s2">okay so inside the Academy I kept</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.529" end="00:41:26.059" style="s2">bumping up against classic and peeresses</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.079" end="00:41:27.680" style="s2">you know with the theory is like sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.059" end="00:41:29.509" style="s2">like well show me the data it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.680" end="00:41:33.890" style="s2">well okay let&#39;s have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.509" end="00:41:37.339" style="s2">how&#39;s that for data then the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.890" end="00:41:39.140" style="s2">so so what do i what do i hope i hope</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.339" end="00:41:40.519" style="s2">that we let the lesson that we learn</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.140" end="00:41:44.299" style="s2">from this is that we were in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.519" end="00:41:46.219" style="s2">vulnerable spot okay i hope that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.299" end="00:41:48.859" style="s2">people can see that what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.219" end="00:41:51.680" style="s2">transition from is what I would call</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.859" end="00:41:54.650" style="s2">late stage capitalism so-so capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.680" end="00:41:56.569" style="s2">did a great thing in turning in many</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.650" end="00:41:58.430" style="s2">ways I believe that I&#39;m somewhat of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.569" end="00:42:01.009" style="s2">human Exceptionalist I believe you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.430" end="00:42:02.329" style="s2">humans are exceptional and confer value</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.009" end="00:42:04.699" style="s2">to them although all sentient beings</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.329" end="00:42:06.320" style="s2">aren&#39;t that but humans are special and</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.699" end="00:42:08.870" style="s2">we did a lot of good things and</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.320" end="00:42:10.610" style="s2">pulling all the resources from many of</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.870" end="00:42:12.920" style="s2">the resources from the earth and doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.610" end="00:42:17.060" style="s2">stuff like this look at my house it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.920" end="00:42:18.320" style="s2">great right but at the same time you</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.060" end="00:42:19.670" style="s2">know and I know and everybody thinks</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.320" end="00:42:21.980" style="s2">about this issue knows that people</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.670" end="00:42:24.080" style="s2">around seven and a half billion people</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.980" end="00:42:25.760" style="s2">can&#39;t live like you and I I&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.080" end="00:42:27.410" style="s2">accustomed to living and our strife and</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.760" end="00:42:29.690" style="s2">so many people are striving to live from</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.410" end="00:42:31.250" style="s2">a capitalistic materialistic right they</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.690" end="00:42:34.760" style="s2">just you can&#39;t put that kind of pressure</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.250" end="00:42:38.060" style="s2">on the planet right and and what does</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.760" end="00:42:40.880" style="s2">that mean and we don&#39;t need to okay so</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.060" end="00:42:44.110" style="s2">so we need to change what we&#39;re valuing</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.880" end="00:42:46.670" style="s2">from the capitalist materialistic greed</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.110" end="00:42:48.290" style="s2">culture which we have justified for a</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.670" end="00:42:49.940" style="s2">whole host of different reasons some of</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.290" end="00:42:52.520" style="s2">which natural science in its</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.940" end="00:42:55.760" style="s2">self-centered referential control system</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.520" end="00:42:57.710" style="s2">as legitimized in an unjustified way</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.760" end="00:43:00.590" style="s2">because we&#39;re a lot more communal than</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.710" end="00:43:04.060" style="s2">Western science would suggest we need to</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.590" end="00:43:06.530" style="s2">shift so what I about sort of ok mass</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.060" end="00:43:08.030" style="s2">capital took care of the more or less</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.530" end="00:43:10.880" style="s2">started to take care of the first levels</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.030" end="00:43:12.770" style="s2">of Maslow but the back levels of Maslow</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.880" end="00:43:14.720" style="s2">needs serious attention and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.770" end="00:43:17.150" style="s2">come together as serious communities to</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.720" end="00:43:20.020" style="s2">cultivate our sense of relational value</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.150" end="00:43:22.750" style="s2">in the relational world to cultivate our</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.020" end="00:43:24.500" style="s2">embrace of wisdom traditions that enable</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.750" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">self-actualization transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.500" end="00:43:29.510" style="s2">whatever you want to call it but growth</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.000" end="00:43:33.490" style="s2">we need to come together and embrace our</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.510" end="00:43:35.900" style="s2">existential condition and and have</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.490" end="00:43:38.300" style="s2">conversations like this I think about</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.900" end="00:43:40.250" style="s2">this this is we get together it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.300" end="00:43:42.980" style="s2">cost us anything you know other than a</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.250" end="00:43:45.080" style="s2">zoom it cost us no carbon footprint you</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.980" end="00:43:47.390" style="s2">know we get to connect we get to learn</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.080" end="00:43:48.950" style="s2">we get to share you know it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.390" end="00:43:50.240" style="s2">Socrates wanted I mean he&#39;s wandering</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.950" end="00:43:51.890" style="s2">around think about what he had to deal</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.240" end="00:43:53.600" style="s2">with right I&#39;m in a leather chair</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.890" end="00:43:57.160" style="s2">bitching about well guys it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.600" end="00:43:57.160" style="s2">tough time and it&#39;s like well actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.510" end="00:44:07.310" style="s2">everything&#39;s fine I&#39;m like I&#39;m biting my</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.740" end="00:44:12.140" style="s2">nails can I cope a couple of things to</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.310" end="00:44:13.790" style="s2">say to that one is people will they</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.140" end="00:44:17.260" style="s2">historically they will take a hit to</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.790" end="00:44:18.710" style="s2">their standard of living if they get</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.260" end="00:44:21.770" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.710" end="00:44:23.750" style="s2">sense that they&#39;re gonna get an increase</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.770" end="00:44:30.170" style="s2">in meaning in life people will reliably</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.750" end="00:44:34.310" style="s2">do that and I&#39;m wondering if the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.170" end="00:44:36.140" style="s2">the virus crisis makes that now apparent</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.310" end="00:44:39.320" style="s2">to people look you&#39;re actually taking</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.140" end="00:44:40.910" style="s2">significant hammering and again like you</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.320" end="00:44:41.960" style="s2">I do not want to be dismissive of people</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.910" end="00:44:43.339" style="s2">that are going through significant</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.960" end="00:44:44.030" style="s2">economic hardship right now that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.339" end="00:44:45.440" style="s2">real thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.030" end="00:44:50.030" style="s2">it&#39;s a real thing and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.440" end="00:44:53.930" style="s2">acknowledge it but right it&#39;s the note</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.030" end="00:44:56.060" style="s2">you know the realization I suppose that</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.930" end="00:45:00.050" style="s2">outside of impoverishing people which we</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.060" end="00:45:03.700" style="s2">have to avoid right covering people we</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.050" end="00:45:06.070" style="s2">can actually do with so much less if we</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.700" end="00:45:09.290" style="s2">right if that actually creates a space</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.070" end="00:45:11.330" style="s2">drives us into making more meaning which</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.290" end="00:45:12.650" style="s2">is what&#39;s happening right now right and</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.330" end="00:45:14.180" style="s2">Socrates used to wander into the</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.650" end="00:45:17.359" style="s2">marketplace and say look at all the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.180" end="00:45:19.070" style="s2">things I don&#39;t need as a way of trying</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.359" end="00:45:23.150" style="s2">to exemplify that and of course then</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.070" end="00:45:25.490" style="s2">Diogenes took it much much further so I</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.150" end="00:45:28.280" style="s2">think that&#39;s a that&#39;s exactly right in</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.490" end="00:45:30.470" style="s2">the sense that you know there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.280" end="00:45:33.980" style="s2">opportunity here to realize in the deep</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.470" end="00:45:36.380" style="s2">sense of the word you know how that how</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.980" end="00:45:38.869" style="s2">much we can reduce the pursuit of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.380" end="00:45:41.359" style="s2">lower levels of Maslow&#39;s hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.869" end="00:45:44.060" style="s2">how we can transfer a lot of that effort</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.359" end="00:45:45.830" style="s2">into the higher levels I think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.060" end="00:45:48.770" style="s2">real opportunity we have right now of</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.830" end="00:45:50.420" style="s2">realizing that&#39;s exactly well that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.770" end="00:45:52.609" style="s2">that&#39;s a wonderful summary of what I</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.420" end="00:45:55.670" style="s2">think are the silver is the silver</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.609" end="00:45:58.070" style="s2">lining in this if they&#39;re you know and</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.670" end="00:46:00.260" style="s2">and and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve actually said</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.070" end="00:46:01.369" style="s2">you know again not minimizing what</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.260" end="00:46:02.750" style="s2">people have to go through but the fact</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.369" end="00:46:03.410" style="s2">of the matter is it&#39;s actually very well</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.750" end="00:46:05.330" style="s2">placed</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.410" end="00:46:07.280" style="s2">you know this virus is in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.330" end="00:46:10.810" style="s2">ironically very well-placed to</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.280" end="00:46:15.140" style="s2">potentially help us to wake up to how to</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.810" end="00:46:17.540" style="s2">reevaluate our value system and start</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.140" end="00:46:20.119" style="s2">the processes by which we can live lives</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.540" end="00:46:22.790" style="s2">in ways that are much more sustainable</p>

<p begin="00:46:22.790" end="00:46:28.820" style="s2">things like that yeah I like the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.810" end="00:46:31.460" style="s2">idea of that it&#39;s it&#39;s almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.820" end="00:46:32.490" style="s2">rock-bottom realization they can wake</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.460" end="00:46:37.380" style="s2">somebody up other</p>

<p begin="00:46:39.780" end="00:46:43.950" style="s2">frames and one of the things that I saw</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.730" end="00:46:46.980" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly you know we&#39;re we get</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.950" end="00:46:48.600" style="s2">addicted to our materialistic standards</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.980" end="00:46:50.610" style="s2">of living and that&#39;s what and and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.600" end="00:46:52.200" style="s2">we would be afraid of change and indeed</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.610" end="00:46:53.840" style="s2">now change is coming there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.200" end="00:46:55.920" style="s2">reasons that some of us are you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.840" end="00:46:57.390" style="s2">hell I&#39;m in pretty good spent and I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:47:01.530" end="00:47:05.760" style="s2">inevitable that&#39;s part of what changes</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.210" end="00:47:08.250" style="s2">if we can keep the heads about us if we</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.760" end="00:47:09.630" style="s2">can build the kinds of clarity of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.250" end="00:47:10.920" style="s2">valued outcomes that we have through</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.630" end="00:47:13.650" style="s2">this thing on the other side of this</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.920" end="00:47:15.270" style="s2">thing I really do believe that you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.650" end="00:47:16.980" style="s2">five years from now ten years from now</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.270" end="00:47:19.320" style="s2">you look back and it&#39;s like actually wow</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.980" end="00:47:21.000" style="s2">we are are much more coherent were much</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.320" end="00:47:22.590" style="s2">more resilient we&#39;re much more on a</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.000" end="00:47:25.860" style="s2">sustainable path we learned a lot from</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.590" end="00:47:30.180" style="s2">that and actually that we&#39;re better off</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.860" end="00:47:31.470" style="s2">for yeah that&#39;s so part of it had to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.180" end="00:47:33.540" style="s2">with getting the three peas back</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.470" end="00:47:35.310" style="s2">together that you pointed to as being</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.540" end="00:47:37.590" style="s2">separated from each other you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.310" end="00:47:41.340" style="s2">reintegrating the psychotherapy with the</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.590" end="00:47:44.490" style="s2">pedagogy with the phyleus sophia we have</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.340" end="00:47:48.180" style="s2">to come back together again in a really</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.490" end="00:47:50.550" style="s2">powerful way if we&#39;re going to make a</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.180" end="00:47:54.080" style="s2">fundamental transformation in what we</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.550" end="00:47:56.250" style="s2">care about and how we care about it</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.080" end="00:47:57.810" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right in fact that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.250" end="00:47:59.910" style="s2">that&#39;s really what the passion of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.810" end="00:48:01.740" style="s2">unified framework and tree theory and</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.910" end="00:48:05.030" style="s2">knowledge thing that I built is about is</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.740" end="00:48:06.690" style="s2">is although my first focus was on</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.030" end="00:48:08.250" style="s2">psychotherapy you know that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.690" end="00:48:10.109" style="s2">encountered the spiritual encounter of</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.250" end="00:48:12.210" style="s2">the psychotherapy room and then wanted</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.109" end="00:48:13.859" style="s2">to bring the best of but I could to from</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.210" end="00:48:15.390" style="s2">all the various perspectives and I sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.859" end="00:48:17.460" style="s2">of backed into well how do you put all</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.390" end="00:48:18.869" style="s2">these things together and then I woke up</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.460" end="00:48:21.030" style="s2">to the fragmentation of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.869" end="00:48:23.369" style="s2">problem you know which you know wake up</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.030" end="00:48:25.680" style="s2">to in terms of you know capital C s</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.369" end="00:48:28.020" style="s2">cognitive science right it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.680" end="00:48:29.900" style="s2">there&#39;s a real problem of our language</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.020" end="00:48:33.060" style="s2">systems not talking to each other</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.900" end="00:48:35.070" style="s2">they&#39;re siloed they have anchor points</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.060" end="00:48:36.420" style="s2">and but they&#39;re really at a macro level</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.070" end="00:48:38.040" style="s2">they&#39;re really basically pre</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.420" end="00:48:39.690" style="s2">paradigmatic in the way they relate to</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.040" end="00:48:41.850" style="s2">each other they fragmented in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.690" end="00:48:44.160" style="s2">profession I make the crap out of us you</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.850" end="00:48:46.030" style="s2">know and they certainly they fragment</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.160" end="00:48:49.210" style="s2">you and I in the Academy</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.030" end="00:48:51.460" style="s2">yeah you know and and and then they</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.210" end="00:48:54.190" style="s2">can&#39;t translate into society obviously</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.460" end="00:48:56.980" style="s2">if you and I have trouble as academics</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.190" end="00:48:59.350" style="s2">talking to each other Jesus well you get</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.980" end="00:49:01.810" style="s2">that out and the dinner-table kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.350" end="00:49:03.820" style="s2">stuff so if we can yoke if we can build</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.810" end="00:49:05.910" style="s2">frameworks realize relevant information</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.820" end="00:49:09.540" style="s2">necessary to pull together you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.910" end="00:49:11.110" style="s2">level philosophy pedagogy the</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.540" end="00:49:13.480" style="s2">psychological knowledge that we learn</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.110" end="00:49:15.610" style="s2">for the 21st century then we can unify</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.480" end="00:49:17.560" style="s2">our knowledge systems in particular way</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.610" end="00:49:20.230" style="s2">build practices that are engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.560" end="00:49:21.700" style="s2">that and that&#39;s that&#39;s an integrated</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.230" end="00:49:23.980" style="s2">coherent society there will be a lot</p>
