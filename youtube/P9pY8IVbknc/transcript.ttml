<p begin="00:00:00.240" end="00:00:05.310" style="s2">hi there um just before I get into the</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.300" end="00:00:06.870" style="s2">content of this video I want to respond</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.310" end="00:00:10.230" style="s2">to a couple of comments I&#39;ve had on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.870" end="00:00:11.910" style="s2">last one along the lines of you can</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.230" end="00:00:13.170" style="s2">never really get rid of rival richness</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.910" end="00:00:13.849" style="s2">there&#39;s always going to be things which</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.170" end="00:00:16.440" style="s2">are scarce</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.849" end="00:00:18.420" style="s2">rival versus is not only rooted in</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.440" end="00:00:19.859" style="s2">scarcity this kind of thing and and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.420" end="00:00:23.279" style="s2">agree with all of that I&#39;m not taking</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.859" end="00:00:26.210" style="s2">issue the point I was trying to make was</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.279" end="00:00:28.199" style="s2">that rival richness has torn apart</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.210" end="00:00:31.260" style="s2">civilizations in the past right and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.199" end="00:00:33.210" style="s2">unless gain be can address the question</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.260" end="00:00:36.980" style="s2">of rivalries dynamics in the society and</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.210" end="00:00:38.969" style="s2">figure out a way of effectively</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.980" end="00:00:40.860" style="s2">incentivizing non-rival brisant</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.969" end="00:00:42.300" style="s2">anti-bible risk behavior then the</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.860" end="00:00:43.260" style="s2">civilizational self-terminate for</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.300" end="00:00:45.090" style="s2">exactly the same reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.260" end="00:00:45.960" style="s2">civilizations in the past are terminated</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.090" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">and for the reasons that I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.960" end="00:00:51.390" style="s2">gone into so you know it&#39;s not uh wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:53.399" style="s2">trying to suggest for a moment that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.390" end="00:00:54.780" style="s2">easy or that there&#39;s a readi solution</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.399" end="00:00:56.340" style="s2">out there there anyone could just snap</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.780" end="00:00:57.629" style="s2">their fingers and get rid of rivalries</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.340" end="00:00:59.250" style="s2">dynamics I wasn&#39;t trying to suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.629" end="00:01:01.770" style="s2">for a moment all I was trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.250" end="00:01:04.680" style="s2">what is it if it is not addressed if a</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.770" end="00:01:06.750" style="s2">solution is not found then it won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.680" end="00:01:08.850" style="s2">gained B it will simply be the next</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.750" end="00:01:11.310" style="s2">iteration of game 8 now of course how we</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.850" end="00:01:14.010" style="s2">go about doing that is another matter</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.310" end="00:01:16.500" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of what the subject of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.010" end="00:01:20.540" style="s2">the video this video today&#39;s video is</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.500" end="00:01:23.070" style="s2">about the formation of decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.540" end="00:01:25.820" style="s2">collective intelligence distributed</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.070" end="00:01:28.439" style="s2">sense making networks which have the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.820" end="00:01:30.600" style="s2">capabilities to be way more effective</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.439" end="00:01:32.880" style="s2">and responsive than the existing</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.600" end="00:01:34.909" style="s2">top-down broadcast structures that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.880" end="00:01:34.909" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.799" end="00:01:41.229" style="s2">so in this video I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.780" end="00:01:44.470" style="s2">the difference between the broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.229" end="00:01:47.649" style="s2">top-down modality of game A&#39;s decision</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.470" end="00:01:49.990" style="s2">making and sense making processes versus</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.649" end="00:01:51.509" style="s2">the opposite of that which is what my</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.990" end="00:01:54.340" style="s2">game beat might look like so</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.509" end="00:01:56.560" style="s2">decentralized distributed networks of</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.340" end="00:01:59.229" style="s2">intelligence of sense making of decision</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.560" end="00:02:02.049" style="s2">making and so as I said in the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.229" end="00:02:03.820" style="s2">video the broadcast modality that exists</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.049" end="00:02:07.240" style="s2">in game a and as always existed in game</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.820" end="00:02:10.479" style="s2">a is basically a top-down thing so a few</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.240" end="00:02:13.230" style="s2">people at the top have the right for</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.479" end="00:02:16.360" style="s2">whatever reason to make decisions and to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.230" end="00:02:17.560" style="s2">evaluate information around and make</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.360" end="00:02:18.910" style="s2">sense of what&#39;s going on the world make</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.560" end="00:02:20.560" style="s2">decisions accordingly and then pass</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.910" end="00:02:22.000" style="s2">those decisions down and everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.560" end="00:02:24.040" style="s2">is expected to follow those and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.000" end="00:02:25.630" style="s2">and this structure you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.040" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">just the government or the Emperor or</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.630" end="00:02:29.250" style="s2">the king or whatever at the top is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:32.260" style="s2">that structure exists all the way down</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.250" end="00:02:33.970" style="s2">and so you know you follows instructions</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.260" end="00:02:35.830" style="s2">from people above you and you pass</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.970" end="00:02:37.630" style="s2">instructions on to the people below you</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.830" end="00:02:39.400" style="s2">and so on and so on and so on and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.630" end="00:02:41.560" style="s2">you see microcosm that this structure</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.400" end="00:02:45.700" style="s2">exists everywhere I mean I was a teacher</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.560" end="00:02:47.350" style="s2">for nearly 20 years and the education</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.700" end="00:02:49.750" style="s2">system the education system is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.350" end="00:02:51.100" style="s2">like that you have one teacher standing</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.750" end="00:02:52.750" style="s2">at the front of the really have rows of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.100" end="00:02:54.250" style="s2">children front the teacher imparts</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.750" end="00:02:56.739" style="s2">knowledge the children absorb knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.250" end="00:02:59.260" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s broadcast the teacher</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.739" end="00:03:01.540" style="s2">is broadcasting to their students and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.260" end="00:03:03.910" style="s2">is the students job to tune into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.540" end="00:03:06.880" style="s2">broadcast listen carefully and then be</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.910" end="00:03:09.750" style="s2">able to repeat it and respond according</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.880" end="00:03:12.190" style="s2">to the rules that they&#39;ve been given and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.750" end="00:03:14.049" style="s2">to a degree this is fine I mean it works</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.190" end="00:03:17.980" style="s2">right it&#39;s worked for a long time so you</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.049" end="00:03:20.680" style="s2">know it&#39;s not entirely invalid it starts</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.980" end="00:03:22.359" style="s2">to break down when the people handing</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.680" end="00:03:24.549" style="s2">you and the people who are qualified to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.359" end="00:03:26.680" style="s2">speak and are telling everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.549" end="00:03:28.569" style="s2">what to do are not doing so in good</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.680" end="00:03:30.549" style="s2">faith or are not doing so in the light</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.569" end="00:03:33.790" style="s2">of the best possible information and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.549" end="00:03:36.549" style="s2">things like that and until relatively</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.790" end="00:03:39.010" style="s2">recently we as ordinary members of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.549" end="00:03:40.600" style="s2">society all we could do really was tune</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.010" end="00:03:42.850" style="s2">into the TV or read the paper or would</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.600" end="00:03:45.010" style="s2">ever receive the received wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.850" end="00:03:47.919" style="s2">that was reality right that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.010" end="00:03:49.390" style="s2">journalism and television and school and</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.919" end="00:03:51.730" style="s2">so on they made sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.390" end="00:03:53.860" style="s2">world for us and we acted on that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.730" end="00:03:56.709" style="s2">information and acted accordingly now</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.860" end="00:03:59.410" style="s2">however with the Internet we have access</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.709" end="00:04:00.850" style="s2">at an individual level to a huge</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.410" end="00:04:04.209" style="s2">plethora of information and this has</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.850" end="00:04:06.490" style="s2">changed everything and so the old sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.209" end="00:04:08.410" style="s2">making networks the news networks the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.490" end="00:04:11.200" style="s2">established newspapers this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.410" end="00:04:12.370" style="s2">thing you know they&#39;re there people are</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.200" end="00:04:14.410" style="s2">not listening to them anymore and for</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.370" end="00:04:15.970" style="s2">very good reason because they have as</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.410" end="00:04:17.739" style="s2">they&#39;ve been losing market share in</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.970" end="00:04:19.299" style="s2">order to try and keep hold of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.739" end="00:04:20.919" style="s2">market share they become more and more</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.299" end="00:04:23.050" style="s2">and more polarized more and more and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.919" end="00:04:25.090" style="s2">more outrageous and less and less sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.050" end="00:04:27.280" style="s2">actually comes out of them and so people</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.090" end="00:04:30.010" style="s2">have started looking elsewhere so this</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.280" end="00:04:31.870" style="s2">decentralized sense-making has actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.010" end="00:04:34.810" style="s2">already started I mean this is very much</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.870" end="00:04:37.780" style="s2">in the process of happening this shift</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.810" end="00:04:39.850" style="s2">away from big central information</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.780" end="00:04:42.010" style="s2">distribution distribution networks to</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.850" end="00:04:44.140" style="s2">you know small YouTube channels and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.010" end="00:04:45.880" style="s2">blogs and so on this is already well</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.140" end="00:04:47.590" style="s2">underway if you think about it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.880" end="00:04:49.030" style="s2">broadcast modality we&#39;re only a few</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.590" end="00:04:51.070" style="s2">people get to make sense of the world to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.030" end="00:04:53.979" style="s2">make decisions there&#39;s a shocking waste</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.070" end="00:04:55.419" style="s2">of possibility right I mean there are</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.979" end="00:04:58.570" style="s2">potentially millions of people who could</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.419" end="00:05:00.580" style="s2">be contributing to a thought pool on any</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.570" end="00:05:04.030" style="s2">particular idea or problem or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.580" end="00:05:07.360" style="s2">it might be and so the decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.030" end="00:05:10.930" style="s2">networks would be able to potentially</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.360" end="00:05:13.000" style="s2">employ a far greater range of human</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.930" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">potential than the broadcast network</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.000" end="00:05:17.169" style="s2">than the broadcast modality of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.560" end="00:05:19.840" style="s2">possibly could Jordan Peterson has</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.169" end="00:05:21.640" style="s2">likened this change in the media</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.840" end="00:05:23.979" style="s2">landscape as nothing short of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.640" end="00:05:25.300" style="s2">Gutenberg type revolution you know the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.979" end="00:05:27.280" style="s2">invention of the printing press and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.300" end="00:05:30.479" style="s2">think he&#39;s absolutely right but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.280" end="00:05:32.560" style="s2">also very much in its infancy you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.479" end="00:05:34.210" style="s2">nobody really knows yet what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.560" end="00:05:36.520" style="s2">shape it&#39;s going to end up taking I</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.210" end="00:05:37.900" style="s2">think I think it was Jordan Hall I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.520" end="00:05:39.400" style="s2">pretty sure I heard him referring to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.900" end="00:05:42.340" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like an infant right you</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.400" end="00:05:43.870" style="s2">know this new emerging intelligence this</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.340" end="00:05:45.340" style="s2">new emerging collective intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.870" end="00:05:46.450" style="s2">like an infant you know he can&#39;t hold</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.340" end="00:05:48.700" style="s2">his head up straight you can&#39;t focus</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.450" end="00:05:51.370" style="s2">sighs I can&#39;t grab hold of anything bar</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.700" end="00:05:53.890" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely bursting with potential</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.370" end="00:05:55.390" style="s2">and I think to some people at least</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.890" end="00:05:57.700" style="s2">watching this video the fact that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.390" end="00:05:59.530" style="s2">can&#39;t sort of just lay out this is how</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.700" end="00:06:00.669" style="s2">these centralized networks are going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.530" end="00:06:02.050" style="s2">be constructed and this is what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.669" end="00:06:03.759" style="s2">going to do and so on</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.050" end="00:06:07.000" style="s2">I can&#39;t is lay them out in clear turns</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.759" end="00:06:09.430" style="s2">is is is somewhat frustration but if I</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.000" end="00:06:11.080" style="s2">may suggest this is a product of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.430" end="00:06:13.060" style="s2">fact that we have been brought up to</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.080" end="00:06:16.090" style="s2">respond to broadcast we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.060" end="00:06:17.770" style="s2">presented with a ready-made solution and</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.090" end="00:06:21.300" style="s2">be able to just act on those</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.770" end="00:06:24.669" style="s2">instructions right rather than</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.300" end="00:06:27.569" style="s2">contending with the idea that if the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.669" end="00:06:30.009" style="s2">important thing is to create the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.569" end="00:06:32.020" style="s2">sense-making apparatus that can come up</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.009" end="00:06:33.729" style="s2">with the solutions and that until you</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.020" end="00:06:35.919" style="s2">come up with the sense-making apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.729" end="00:06:36.879" style="s2">and there is no you know the solutions</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.919" end="00:06:38.139" style="s2">would emerge from that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.879" end="00:06:41.379" style="s2">knowing what those solutions are going</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.139" end="00:06:42.490" style="s2">to be because they&#39;re complex and this</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.379" end="00:06:43.810" style="s2">is what the next video is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.490" end="00:06:45.310" style="s2">about is the complex is it&#39;s complicated</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.810" end="00:06:48.219" style="s2">but the solutions that will emerge from</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.310" end="00:06:50.680" style="s2">these decentralized networks are going</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.219" end="00:06:53.669" style="s2">to be complex in nature because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.680" end="00:06:58.000" style="s2">emerged from the interaction of</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.669" end="00:07:00.009" style="s2">complexity so yeah nobody can see in in</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.000" end="00:07:01.449" style="s2">advance what they&#39;re going to be and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.009" end="00:07:03.969" style="s2">that can be a frustration but as I said</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.449" end="00:07:05.710" style="s2">just a moment ago this is a product of</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.969" end="00:07:09.039" style="s2">the fact that we&#39;ve been brought up in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.710" end="00:07:10.539" style="s2">broadcast environment and all we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.039" end="00:07:12.099" style="s2">been trained to do is receive</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.539" end="00:07:15.669" style="s2">instructions and act on them right and</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.099" end="00:07:19.060" style="s2">so the decentralized networks require of</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.669" end="00:07:20.919" style="s2">us as individuals that we are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.060" end="00:07:24.909" style="s2">shoulder a certain degree of</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.919" end="00:07:27.520" style="s2">responsibility for truthful</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.909" end="00:07:30.190" style="s2">communication and earnest communication</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.520" end="00:07:34.060" style="s2">and nonrival risk communication all</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.190" end="00:07:35.650" style="s2">feeds into this and it also leads I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.060" end="00:07:37.419" style="s2">gonna make a whole separate video on</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.650" end="00:07:38.740" style="s2">this because I think is I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.419" end="00:07:40.960" style="s2">really really really important because</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.740" end="00:07:42.490" style="s2">it actually tackles all three of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.960" end="00:07:45.879" style="s2">things I&#39;m talking about in this video</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.490" end="00:07:48.849" style="s2">rival richness broadcast modality and</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.879" end="00:07:52.560" style="s2">complexity it gets a hand on all three</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.849" end="00:07:55.090" style="s2">of these things it&#39;s a really concrete</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.560" end="00:07:57.039" style="s2">attainable protocol that everybody can</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.090" end="00:08:00.099" style="s2">can start to practice namely rule Omega</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.039" end="00:08:02.169" style="s2">and so the idea of rule Omega is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.099" end="00:08:04.029" style="s2">everybody has valid perspective to</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.169" end="00:08:06.250" style="s2">contribute to a particular problem you</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.029" end="00:08:10.719" style="s2">know if they&#39;re interested in it and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.250" end="00:08:13.479" style="s2">these collective intelligences will be</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.719" end="00:08:15.940" style="s2">able to be far more responsive far more</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.479" end="00:08:18.430" style="s2">creative than the exist</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.940" end="00:08:20.740" style="s2">in static top-down institutional</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.430" end="00:08:26.190" style="s2">structures that currently exist in game</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.740" end="00:08:30.460" style="s2">a game B&#39;s sense making apparatus is</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.190" end="00:08:32.169" style="s2">likely to consist of this emerging type</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.460" end="00:08:33.490" style="s2">of intelligence where people all around</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.169" end="00:08:36.099" style="s2">the world who are interested in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.490" end="00:08:37.719" style="s2">particular area whatever it might be can</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.099" end="00:08:40.650" style="s2">communicate with each other and refine</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.719" end="00:08:40.650" style="s2">and own ideas</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.650" end="00:08:46.990" style="s2">so given their much greater flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.169" end="00:08:50.140" style="s2">and possibility for creativity these</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.990" end="00:08:52.029" style="s2">decentralized distributed intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.140" end="00:08:54.510" style="s2">networks could potentially come up with</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.029" end="00:08:57.250" style="s2">solutions to how to for example</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.510" end="00:08:59.110" style="s2">incentivize anti rivalries behavior in</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.250" end="00:09:00.279" style="s2">society where as you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.110" end="00:09:03.720" style="s2">solutions to things like this have</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.279" end="00:09:05.950" style="s2">eluded us in the past this decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.720" end="00:09:08.890" style="s2">modality as well affords the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.950" end="00:09:11.380" style="s2">to experiment on small scales you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.890" end="00:09:14.470" style="s2">and if a new social construction or any</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.380" end="00:09:15.850" style="s2">whatever you don&#39;t have to have roll it</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.470" end="00:09:18.520" style="s2">out across the whole world all at once</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.850" end="00:09:20.650" style="s2">right it can be it can be contained in</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.520" end="00:09:22.690" style="s2">in one place and and when it goes wrong</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.650" end="00:09:27.940" style="s2">the mess can be cleared up and and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.690" end="00:09:30.339" style="s2">the damage limited so you know the whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.940" end="00:09:31.900" style="s2">idea of one small group besides and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.339" end="00:09:34.180" style="s2">everybody has to do it you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.900" end="00:09:36.760" style="s2">dangerous when bad decisions are made so</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.180" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">this decentralized thing also has the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.760" end="00:09:42.370" style="s2">huge advantage of allowing small-scale</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.240" end="00:09:44.920" style="s2">experimentation to make sure things work</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.370" end="00:09:46.300" style="s2">before they get rolled out and once</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.920" end="00:09:47.709" style="s2">again just you know going back through</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.300" end="00:09:52.390" style="s2">the collapse of civilizations in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.709" end="00:09:54.880" style="s2">past corruption and rotting from within</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.390" end="00:09:56.830" style="s2">of the institutional structures again</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.880" end="00:09:58.360" style="s2">has been foundational to the collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.830" end="00:10:00.850" style="s2">every single civilization that has gone</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.360" end="00:10:02.500" style="s2">before and so once again if game B is to</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.850" end="00:10:04.900" style="s2">be truly different and transformative</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.500" end="00:10:07.420" style="s2">and enduring and resilient then it needs</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.900" end="00:10:08.800" style="s2">to tackle this thing which has come up</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.420" end="00:10:11.529" style="s2">again and again and again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.800" end="00:10:14.500" style="s2">again namely that top-down broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.529" end="00:10:17.110" style="s2">networks collapse under the weight of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.500" end="00:10:21.310" style="s2">their own bureaucracy and corruption in</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.110" end="00:10:23.410" style="s2">the long run every time and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.310" end="00:10:26.440" style="s2">that&#39;s about all I have to say in this</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.410" end="00:10:30.160" style="s2">broadcast versus distributed networks</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.440" end="00:10:32.920" style="s2">but in the fifth one of these I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.160" end="00:10:34.570" style="s2">do an episode on all Omega which is all</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.920" end="00:10:37.570" style="s2">about how those networks could actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.570" end="00:10:40.529" style="s2">function okay thanks very much for</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.570" end="00:10:40.529" style="s2">watching see you next time</p>
