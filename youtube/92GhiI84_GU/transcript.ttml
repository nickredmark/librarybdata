<p begin="00:00:00.060" end="00:00:06.240" style="s2">hi everyone this is Joe Brewer and</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.870" end="00:00:09.179" style="s2">wanted to give you another update on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.240" end="00:00:11.460" style="s2">way that I&#39;m thinking about designing a</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.179" end="00:00:14.429" style="s2">training program and bioregional</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.460" end="00:00:17.160" style="s2">regeneration because a lot of learning</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.429" end="00:00:20.520" style="s2">is happening and there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.160" end="00:00:23.550" style="s2">interesting parts so first of all as you</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.520" end="00:00:25.980" style="s2">may know I am the capacity cultivator</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.550" end="00:00:30.029" style="s2">for the regenerative communities network</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.980" end="00:00:33.059" style="s2">which is a global network of bioregional</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.029" end="00:00:35.430" style="s2">projects where people in each region</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.059" end="00:00:38.610" style="s2">we&#39;re already coordinating their own</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.430" end="00:00:40.950" style="s2">activities to build regional scale</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.610" end="00:00:44.640" style="s2">economies based on environmental or</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.950" end="00:00:46.289" style="s2">ecological principles and so one thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.640" end="00:00:47.520" style="s2">that I&#39;m getting to learn from talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.289" end="00:00:49.649" style="s2">with people on these different regions</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.520" end="00:00:52.680" style="s2">is what&#39;s working and what&#39;s not working</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.649" end="00:00:55.050" style="s2">as they go about their work and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.680" end="00:00:58.500" style="s2">some really inspiring projects that that</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.050" end="00:01:01.699" style="s2">we can talk more about but also I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.500" end="00:01:05.010" style="s2">really thinking about how do we</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.699" end="00:01:07.710" style="s2">cultivate an ecosystem of learning</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.010" end="00:01:10.140" style="s2">within each bio region and across from</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.710" end="00:01:12.960" style="s2">bio region to bio region the thing I</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.140" end="00:01:15.509" style="s2">want to share today is how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.960" end="00:01:18.299" style="s2">thinking about an in-person immersive</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.509" end="00:01:20.340" style="s2">project-based program so we&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.299" end="00:01:23.189" style="s2">designing a 30 days certificate program</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.340" end="00:01:25.560" style="s2">in bioregional regeneration to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.189" end="00:01:27.180" style="s2">launched here at Rancho more goat now</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.560" end="00:01:31.170" style="s2">we&#39;ll teach people the basics of how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.180" end="00:01:33.630" style="s2">do design at a bio regional scale using</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.170" end="00:01:35.909" style="s2">regenerative principles and because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.630" end="00:01:38.159" style="s2">immersive and place-based you come here</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.909" end="00:01:40.170" style="s2">in practice and permaculture and visit</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.159" end="00:01:42.540" style="s2">field sites in the region while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.170" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">learning the program that there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.540" end="00:01:48.180" style="s2">an online component but it&#39;s done in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:49.380" style="s2">reverse of most webinars webinars are</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.180" end="00:01:50.579" style="s2">usually that the majority of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.380" end="00:01:52.770" style="s2">students are spread out around the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.579" end="00:01:54.060" style="s2">and the facilitator speaks to them</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.770" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">online and they&#39;re all on their</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.060" end="00:01:57.840" style="s2">computers what we&#39;re doing instead is</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:02:00.180" style="s2">creating an immersive in-person</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:02.250" style="s2">educational experience with different</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.180" end="00:02:04.979" style="s2">kinds of experts that we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.250" end="00:02:06.869" style="s2">relationships to that will dial in and</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.979" end="00:02:09.330" style="s2">speak to our students all of whom are</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.869" end="00:02:11.819" style="s2">located here at the ranch so we might</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.330" end="00:02:13.500" style="s2">have John Fullerton call in and talk to</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.819" end="00:02:16.440" style="s2">the students about regenerative finding</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.500" end="00:02:18.570" style="s2">for example or Daniel Vall call in and</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.440" end="00:02:20.880" style="s2">talk about how to design regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.570" end="00:02:22.740" style="s2">cultures we have a lot of people with</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.880" end="00:02:24.840" style="s2">this depth of knowledge and expertise</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.740" end="00:02:28.020" style="s2">who would be very happy to share their</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.840" end="00:02:30.140" style="s2">knowledge in this way and so we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.020" end="00:02:32.910" style="s2">this capacity to create an in-person</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.140" end="00:02:35.190" style="s2">educational experience with the benefit</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.910" end="00:02:38.700" style="s2">of online but in the pedagogy of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.190" end="00:02:40.550" style="s2">immersive project-based learning now one</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.700" end="00:02:43.260" style="s2">of the challenges of this is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.550" end="00:02:45.330" style="s2">normally if you bring a lot of teachers</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.260" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">together to teach students then you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.330" end="00:02:49.470" style="s2">to pay the teachers and it costs a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:51.989" style="s2">of money that means that the price of</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.470" end="00:02:53.790" style="s2">the program is really high now we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.989" end="00:02:56.520" style="s2">want this to be an expensive program we</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.790" end="00:02:59.100" style="s2">want it to be an inexpensive program we</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.520" end="00:03:01.920" style="s2">want people to feel like they can afford</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.100" end="00:03:04.410" style="s2">to pay the tuition and come for a month</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:06.180" style="s2">and really dedicate themselves and so in</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.410" end="00:03:09.630" style="s2">the beginning we won&#39;t be able to pay</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.180" end="00:03:11.700" style="s2">we&#39;ll have an honorary like thank you</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.630" end="00:03:13.980" style="s2">for calling in as an expert to teach</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.700" end="00:03:16.050" style="s2">with us but if we replicate the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.980" end="00:03:18.810" style="s2">curriculum across three generative</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.050" end="00:03:20.760" style="s2">campuses where an increasing number of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.810" end="00:03:23.310" style="s2">bioregional learning centers in</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.760" end="00:03:26.459" style="s2">different bioregions offer the same 30</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.310" end="00:03:28.769" style="s2">day course and they each have their own</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.459" end="00:03:31.019" style="s2">cohort of students doing project-based</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.769" end="00:03:33.360" style="s2">immersive learning then they can all</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.019" end="00:03:35.790" style="s2">dial in for the same webinar instruction</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.360" end="00:03:38.220" style="s2">with the same set of experts and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.790" end="00:03:41.100" style="s2">grows in size with the number of bio</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.220" end="00:03:43.320" style="s2">regions that are involved so thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.100" end="00:03:47.070" style="s2">this way we can help create more</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.320" end="00:03:50.370" style="s2">cohesion and shared learning within bio</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.070" end="00:03:52.890" style="s2">regions and across bio regions by making</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.370" end="00:03:55.170" style="s2">the curriculum open source and freely</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.890" end="00:03:57.090" style="s2">available structuring it so that it can</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.170" end="00:03:59.700" style="s2">be shared from one bio region to another</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.090" end="00:04:02.730" style="s2">and that the things that are in common</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.700" end="00:04:05.459" style="s2">are the elements about how do you design</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.730" end="00:04:07.739" style="s2">a bio region and that&#39;ll include topics</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.459" end="00:04:10.230" style="s2">like how do you set up a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.739" end="00:04:13.620" style="s2">multi-stakeholder collaboration how do</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.230" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">you run effective scenarios and do</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.620" end="00:04:17.669" style="s2">scenario planning how do you create a</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:20.100" style="s2">shared agenda about the future based on</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.669" end="00:04:22.380" style="s2">the scenarios that you see and how do</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.100" end="00:04:25.080" style="s2">you evaluate your progress as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.380" end="00:04:26.380" style="s2">moving toward it while also implementing</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.080" end="00:04:28.600" style="s2">regenerative economic</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.380" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">principles and putting in place the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.600" end="00:04:33.930" style="s2">metrics and evaluation tools that ensure</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:36.460" style="s2">that you are indeed being regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.930" end="00:04:39.790" style="s2">so there are these pieces of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.460" end="00:04:41.920" style="s2">that would be useful in any bioregion at</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.790" end="00:04:43.450" style="s2">the same time there&#39;s a global context</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.920" end="00:04:45.730" style="s2">that we need a shared understanding</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.450" end="00:04:47.530" style="s2">about now we have a planetary boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.730" end="00:04:50.950" style="s2">framework developed by the Stockholm</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.530" end="00:04:53.590" style="s2">resilience Center now it shows us what</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.950" end="00:04:55.060" style="s2">the thresholds are that humanity has</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.590" end="00:04:58.720" style="s2">already crossed in the global system</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.060" end="00:05:00.280" style="s2">that place our future in jeopardy so</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.720" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">that as we set these region to region</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.280" end="00:05:05.290" style="s2">metrics we can move toward global goals</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:07.360" style="s2">that oppress them and regenerate toward</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.290" end="00:05:09.460" style="s2">pulling ourselves back within those</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.360" end="00:05:11.470" style="s2">boundaries and stabilizing the planet</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.460" end="00:05:14.170" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a set of tools like</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.470" end="00:05:16.210" style="s2">planetary boundaries or the donut</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.170" end="00:05:19.030" style="s2">economic framework that cater a weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.210" end="00:05:20.860" style="s2">developed or the economy for the common</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.030" end="00:05:22.780" style="s2">good framework that Christian caliber</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.860" end="00:05:25.030" style="s2">developed there are a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.780" end="00:05:28.930" style="s2">metrics like this that our tool sets</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.030" end="00:05:30.850" style="s2">that should be standardized so that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.930" end="00:05:32.980" style="s2">each bioregion people are aware of them</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.850" end="00:05:34.360" style="s2">and know how to use them so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.980" end="00:05:36.820" style="s2">doing is designing a thirty-day</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.360" end="00:05:38.680" style="s2">bioregional design program with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.820" end="00:05:42.130" style="s2">standardized curriculum that can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.680" end="00:05:44.860" style="s2">replicated in place to place so we will</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.130" end="00:05:47.260" style="s2">share with the global network and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.860" end="00:05:49.300" style="s2">we will invite experts to call in and</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.260" end="00:05:50.980" style="s2">speak with the students so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.300" end="00:05:54.160" style="s2">benefits of being in the program is</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.980" end="00:05:56.440" style="s2">access to these experts another benefit</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.160" end="00:05:58.750" style="s2">will be the Learning Center itself in</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.440" end="00:06:01.150" style="s2">our case for the first one Rancho Mar go</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.750" end="00:06:04.150" style="s2">to northern Costa Rica but eventually a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.150" end="00:06:06.130" style="s2">whole network of them so that people can</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.150" end="00:06:08.410" style="s2">go and learn at the Learning Center for</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.130" end="00:06:09.910" style="s2">their own region or they can travel to</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.410" end="00:06:12.370" style="s2">another region if there isn&#39;t one in</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.910" end="00:06:14.710" style="s2">their own region and then over time this</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.370" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">becomes a way of accumulating knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.710" end="00:06:20.050" style="s2">and practices that can spread across the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:21.700" style="s2">planet so this is a key piece of how</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.050" end="00:06:23.380" style="s2">we&#39;re designing this curriculum in</p>
