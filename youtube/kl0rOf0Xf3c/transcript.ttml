<p begin="00:00:11.429" end="00:00:17.430" style="s2">sense of direction directionality in</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.599" end="00:00:18.990" style="s2">your life and and I also want to know</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.430" end="00:00:20.730" style="s2">about your boyhood when you were younger</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.990" end="00:00:24.359" style="s2">and then and I want to go back to chess</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.730" end="00:00:26.580" style="s2">a little bit because because it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.359" end="00:00:28.529" style="s2">have been what well I was when I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.580" end="00:00:30.210" style="s2">reading the book I was thinking about in</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.529" end="00:00:33.180" style="s2">one sense it&#39;s the form of ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.210" end="00:00:35.940" style="s2">escapism and and the other sense it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.180" end="00:00:40.230" style="s2">form of actually going deeper into life</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.940" end="00:00:44.219" style="s2">and that kind of that kind of that kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.230" end="00:00:48.300" style="s2">of comes back to what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.219" end="00:00:50.879" style="s2">about about retreat and versus let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.300" end="00:00:53.250" style="s2">action or or being being away from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.879" end="00:00:54.870" style="s2">world versus you know going out into the</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.250" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">world and doing something activism</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.870" end="00:01:07.860" style="s2">versus meditation there&#39;s my question</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.520" end="00:01:12.270" style="s2">clear here try so and well as I say in</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.860" end="00:01:14.729" style="s2">the book chess was initially just a</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.270" end="00:01:17.310" style="s2">family pursuit like any other like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.729" end="00:01:21.689" style="s2">game like like football like monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.310" end="00:01:25.020" style="s2">just something we did but then somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.689" end="00:01:28.890" style="s2">along the way I got good enough assets</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.020" end="00:01:31.320" style="s2">to begin to feel it was a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.890" end="00:01:35.759" style="s2">meaningful than that that it was a kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.320" end="00:01:38.250" style="s2">of hmm cultural practice of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.759" end="00:01:43.020" style="s2">that I was taking part in a tradition of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.250" end="00:01:45.060" style="s2">some kind there were art also as well</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.020" end="00:01:48.630" style="s2">but something but there was a structured</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.060" end="00:01:50.280" style="s2">form of life in a way that you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.630" end="00:01:51.780" style="s2">maybe tiddlywinks wasn&#39;t or you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.280" end="00:01:54.540" style="s2">there was a sort of sense of being part</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.780" end="00:01:56.009" style="s2">of an institution or tradition and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.540" end="00:01:58.229" style="s2">then I got to meet some grownups a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.009" end="00:02:00.030" style="s2">report of that world and I kind of quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.229" end="00:02:04.040" style="s2">liked them and I was very curious about</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.030" end="00:02:07.049" style="s2">the the world they were in and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.040" end="00:02:11.099" style="s2">various things happen to my family my my</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.049" end="00:02:13.310" style="s2">father&#39;s mental illness became worse my</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.099" end="00:02:17.990" style="s2">parents split up my brother</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.310" end="00:02:19.910" style="s2">well I buried my head in books for for</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.990" end="00:02:22.819" style="s2">school to some extent but the main</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.910" end="00:02:24.830" style="s2">coping mechanism was chess hmm and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.819" end="00:02:27.350" style="s2">was a field of life where I was in</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.830" end="00:02:29.209" style="s2">control where I was independent mostly I</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.350" end="00:02:32.090" style="s2">mean actually thoroughly dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.209" end="00:02:33.680" style="s2">others in some ways families who drive</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.090" end="00:02:35.239" style="s2">or determine sand people who would feed</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.680" end="00:02:37.180" style="s2">me and people who would pay the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.239" end="00:02:39.800" style="s2">tournament entry fee but still</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.180" end="00:02:41.390" style="s2">psychologically fairly independent it</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.800" end="00:02:43.250" style="s2">was some kind of suffering and even</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.390" end="00:02:44.900" style="s2">reckoning with death which goes along</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.250" end="00:02:47.530" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about which kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.900" end="00:02:51.500" style="s2">gave you that direction yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.530" end="00:02:54.590" style="s2">there was a lot of stuff of me mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.500" end="00:02:58.910" style="s2">going on sorry so yeah certain demands</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.590" end="00:03:00.560" style="s2">up okay a certain amount of escapism Bob</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.910" end="00:03:02.590" style="s2">in the book I write about this is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.560" end="00:03:05.150" style="s2">whole chapter on escapism in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.590" end="00:03:06.890" style="s2">and I call it the chapter this our</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.150" end="00:03:10.730" style="s2">lesson of the chapter each chapter has a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.890" end="00:03:13.300" style="s2">kind of take away idea and this one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.730" end="00:03:16.700" style="s2">we have to make peace with our struggle</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.300" end="00:03:20.079" style="s2">mmm I think that&#39;s for me what chess was</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.700" end="00:03:22.489" style="s2">about it was it wasn&#39;t wishing away</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.079" end="00:03:25.160" style="s2">wanting to be a different family or</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.489" end="00:03:27.620" style="s2">wanting to be another person but it</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.160" end="00:03:29.180" style="s2">wasn&#39;t way of sort of reenacting Andrea</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.620" end="00:03:32.209" style="s2">experiencing the struggle I was going</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.180" end="00:03:34.310" style="s2">through and to some extent overcoming it</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.209" end="00:03:36.590" style="s2">because I kept on facing this resistance</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.310" end="00:03:37.940" style="s2">and these battles getting better and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.590" end="00:03:42.799" style="s2">better and better and fitting myself</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.940" end="00:03:49.000" style="s2">growing in autonomy in mastery and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.799" end="00:03:49.000" style="s2">was a kind of relief and also a way of</p>

<p begin="00:03:50.739" end="00:03:58.310" style="s2">we were feeling safe in a sense rather</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.790" end="00:04:00.160" style="s2">than trying to retreat from the world it</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.310" end="00:04:04.730" style="s2">was sort of deeper into the fight and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.160" end="00:04:07.579" style="s2">winning it&#39;s almost like you need to you</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.730" end="00:04:10.519" style="s2">need to do battle in an imagined an</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.579" end="00:04:13.340" style="s2">imaginative realm before you can do</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.519" end="00:04:14.660" style="s2">battle in in in the real world something</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.340" end="00:04:16.729" style="s2">of that although remember we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.660" end="00:04:18.470" style="s2">about a young boy here who now have</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.729" end="00:04:22.880" style="s2">children of a similar age when I started</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.470" end="00:04:24.260" style="s2">playing chess and they don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.880" end="00:04:26.170" style="s2">much power you might think they do you</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.260" end="00:04:28.530" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.170" end="00:04:30.910" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t it was something about</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.530" end="00:04:35.490" style="s2">experiencing through the game what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.910" end="00:04:37.870" style="s2">couldn&#39;t experience or feel properly</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.490" end="00:04:42.130" style="s2">access the feelings I have to feel and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.870" end="00:04:44.830" style="s2">we run chats and that sense it was very</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.130" end="00:04:46.480" style="s2">important and also there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.830" end="00:04:48.820" style="s2">other thing I was thinking about as I</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.480" end="00:04:51.460" style="s2">was reading your book was it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.820" end="00:04:55.120" style="s2">it&#39;s such a it&#39;s also in one level it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.460" end="00:04:57.670" style="s2">a game it&#39;s fun it&#39;s completely it</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.120" end="00:04:59.410" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a meaning to it except in</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.670" end="00:05:01.720" style="s2">and then a game so there&#39;s this paradox</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.410" end="00:05:05.110" style="s2">between it being deadly serious and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.720" end="00:05:07.360" style="s2">being just absurd play right absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.110" end="00:05:09.460" style="s2">so I love that and and all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.360" end="00:05:12.970" style="s2">characters that you met who played chess</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.460" end="00:05:16.390" style="s2">in and these maverick figures and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.970" end="00:05:19.300" style="s2">like an alternative universe or but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.390" end="00:05:22.660" style="s2">also very real and and more real than</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.300" end="00:05:24.510" style="s2">real Ansari absolutely and so it speaks</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.660" end="00:05:27.340" style="s2">to life in general in that sense and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.510" end="00:05:29.830" style="s2">what you just mentioned there is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.340" end="00:05:32.590" style="s2">version of that and the rights were</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.830" end="00:05:35.620" style="s2">George Steiner whom I believe you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.590" end="00:05:38.920" style="s2">New York for The New Yorker at least in</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.620" end="00:05:41.950" style="s2">many other places but he described chess</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.920" end="00:05:45.970" style="s2">and ultimately insignificant but</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.950" end="00:05:48.100" style="s2">enormous a meaningful significant or</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.970" end="00:05:51.340" style="s2">meaningful and that is true to my</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.100" end="00:05:52.720" style="s2">experience yeah and I suppose I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.340" end="00:05:55.750" style="s2">the book because both things seem</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.720" end="00:05:58.570" style="s2">equally true and in some ways it was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.750" end="00:06:01.510" style="s2">way of it was a way of processing what</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.570" end="00:06:02.860" style="s2">that had been about and by the end of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.510" end="00:06:06.520" style="s2">you know how it ends with the poem and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.860" end="00:06:11.080" style="s2">everything I sort of feel it a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.520" end="00:06:12.760" style="s2">bit more of the feeling both ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.080" end="00:06:14.920" style="s2">insignificant and almost an enormous de</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.760" end="00:06:16.090" style="s2">meaningful yeah I managed to feel at</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.920" end="00:06:19.180" style="s2">peace with it being elsewhere the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.090" end="00:06:21.730" style="s2">insignificant without losing the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.180" end="00:06:23.980" style="s2">so maybe the the the work of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.730" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">articulating not in your book because a</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.980" end="00:06:29.200" style="s2">lot of people have a sport or have a you</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:31.210" style="s2">know something they do that they excel</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.200" end="00:06:34.330" style="s2">at but they don&#39;t have the gift of</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.210" end="00:06:35.620" style="s2">articulating that at the same time so</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.330" end="00:06:38.470" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of interesting that you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.620" end="00:06:39.719" style="s2">articulate that in such a way they took</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.470" end="00:06:43.210" style="s2">a long time</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.719" end="00:06:44.949" style="s2">you know writing a book is a big big</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.210" end="00:06:47.050" style="s2">commitment but if I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.949" end="00:06:49.030" style="s2">lovely line by Ted Hughes the poet who</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.050" end="00:06:51.400" style="s2">says that we write to take fuller</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.030" end="00:06:53.650" style="s2">possession of our periods that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.400" end="00:06:56.129" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s how it feels you know I</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.650" end="00:06:58.840" style="s2">feel as though in developmental terms</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.129" end="00:07:00.969" style="s2">previously sort of chess had me for many</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.840" end="00:07:02.139" style="s2">years but now through the puzzles of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.969" end="00:07:04.569" style="s2">writing the groups with a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.139" end="00:07:06.669" style="s2">I have chest it&#39;s still there but I&#39;m no</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.569" end="00:07:08.770" style="s2">longer lost in it somehow you&#39;re no</p>

<p begin="00:07:08.770" end="00:07:14.020" style="s2">for you to move into all these other</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.810" end="00:07:17.169" style="s2">things that matter to you hmm</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.020" end="00:07:20.789" style="s2">wonderful in terms of the other question</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.169" end="00:07:23.139" style="s2">you asked about direction I&#39;m quite</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.789" end="00:07:25.810" style="s2">pleasantly bemused by that in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.139" end="00:07:27.310" style="s2">that okay I I don&#39;t you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.810" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">obviously recognize myself in that</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.310" end="00:07:32.050" style="s2">however I suppose we gonna look like</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:35.319" style="s2">that retrospectively like our lives</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.050" end="00:07:37.060" style="s2">teachers who we are and the return they</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.319" end="00:07:38.620" style="s2">some lean years where I spent two or</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.060" end="00:07:41.050" style="s2">three years do nothing in particular</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.620" end="00:07:43.599" style="s2">with some kind of gesture is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.050" end="00:07:45.610" style="s2">cover story for that oh that&#39;s great I</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.599" end="00:07:47.860" style="s2">love that because it looks like you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.610" end="00:07:49.900" style="s2">all this like direction but you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.860" end="00:07:52.830" style="s2">much of the learning is just fooling</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.900" end="00:07:55.389" style="s2">around it&#39;s just in between things</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.830" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">traveling around and just fooling around</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.389" end="00:07:59.819" style="s2">and centralized along the way of what am</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:02.770" style="s2">i doing you know film applications</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.819" end="00:08:05.440" style="s2">readers attempted languages begun and</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.440" end="00:08:09.460" style="s2">businesses but but you know when you</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.990" end="00:08:12.370" style="s2">look back I don&#39;t really regret any of</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.460" end="00:08:15.009" style="s2">it you know it&#39;s I&#39;m quite glad for all</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.370" end="00:08:17.409" style="s2">those different false rules and full</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.009" end="00:08:20.110" style="s2">starts you sort of need them somehow</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.409" end="00:08:22.389" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s everybody&#39;s life nobody</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.110" end="00:08:24.159" style="s2">has it has a sort of it all figured out</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.389" end="00:08:25.930" style="s2">and a plan and then they follow this</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.159" end="00:08:27.279" style="s2">plan okay very good</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.930" end="00:08:30.099" style="s2">well let&#39;s start with Peterson let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.279" end="00:08:32.800" style="s2">let&#39;s get that over with because I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.099" end="00:08:34.959" style="s2">this article a long time ago just kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.800" end="00:08:37.659" style="s2">of a critique of your article about</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.959" end="00:08:38.829" style="s2">Peterson I also said in the article I</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.659" end="00:08:41.649" style="s2">thought it was probably the best</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.829" end="00:08:43.240" style="s2">critique of Peterson that I&#39;d read when</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.649" end="00:08:45.310" style="s2">I was also critiquing your critique and</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.240" end="00:08:49.149" style="s2">then when I saw you in Kiev I I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.310" end="00:08:50.770" style="s2">wanted to apologize for it but I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.149" end="00:08:52.790" style="s2">and I still don&#39;t know whether I should</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.770" end="00:08:55.190" style="s2">apologize for it or not</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.790" end="00:08:58.400" style="s2">think so no I am I think he thought he</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.190" end="00:09:01.100" style="s2">misread me maybe but uh I&#39;m sure I did</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.400" end="00:09:01.820" style="s2">it was just a blog post yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.100" end="00:09:04.040" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.820" end="00:09:04.760" style="s2">we get we take these things way too</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.040" end="00:09:09.890" style="s2">seriously</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.760" end="00:09:14.780" style="s2">I mean what I can say is that it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.890" end="00:09:17.360" style="s2">very very intense experience hmm coming</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.780" end="00:09:19.250" style="s2">and becoming aware of him we meet</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.360" end="00:09:21.200" style="s2">briefly meeting him being on the stage</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.250" end="00:09:26.840" style="s2">with him dealing with the fallout of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.200" end="00:09:29.270" style="s2">that and then the day after feeling hmm</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.840" end="00:09:31.850" style="s2">I hesitate to say possessed but</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.270" end="00:09:34.460" style="s2">something like the energy was still</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.850" end="00:09:36.080" style="s2">there you know they came the intensity</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.460" end="00:09:38.270" style="s2">of that encounter was still with me was</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.080" end="00:09:40.100" style="s2">psychoactive somehow yeah well I just</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.270" end="00:09:42.920" style="s2">want to say one more thing before you</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.100" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">you tell us you wrote a very big long</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.920" end="00:09:47.120" style="s2">essay about him and I wrote about him I</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:49.790" style="s2">was thinking probably the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.120" end="00:09:52.220" style="s2">words we wrote about him is equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.790" end="00:09:54.200" style="s2">except I wrote I wrote like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.220" end="00:09:55.790" style="s2">blog posts about him and I didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.200" end="00:09:58.280" style="s2">the discipline perhaps to put that into</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.790" end="00:10:00.890" style="s2">one essay it was just how I felt at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.280" end="00:10:03.050" style="s2">time and so so I think we were both</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.890" end="00:10:05.030" style="s2">possessed by speaking about and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.050" end="00:10:07.220" style="s2">about Peterson and you called that Peter</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.030" end="00:10:10.070" style="s2">Sohn at Peter Sony and itís Peter&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.220" end="00:10:12.950" style="s2">Peter tinnitus yeah okay don&#39;t go on I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.070" end="00:10:15.800" style="s2">well it was an industry period students</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.950" end="00:10:21.260" style="s2">always were speaking now by early 2018</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.800" end="00:10:24.220" style="s2">for me so two years ago funny and I just</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.260" end="00:10:26.270" style="s2">briefly mentioned of course I believe</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.220" end="00:10:28.190" style="s2">Jordan Peterson I&#39;m not sure quite what</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.270" end="00:10:30.350" style="s2">she called it but he am you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.190" end="00:10:31.820" style="s2">struggling at the moment and for what</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.350" end="00:10:33.800" style="s2">it&#39;s worth I wish him well and you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.820" end="00:10:35.030" style="s2">I met his I met his wife on the day and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.800" end="00:10:37.160" style="s2">you know they&#39;re human beings and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.030" end="00:10:39.500" style="s2">whatever else happens they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.160" end="00:10:42.580" style="s2">through very difficult times and I you</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.500" end="00:10:46.880" style="s2">know I don&#39;t wish that on anyone</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.580" end="00:10:48.680" style="s2">it was very intense because Peterson was</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.880" end="00:10:53.840" style="s2">sort of on the frontline of the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.680" end="00:10:55.340" style="s2">war yeah I was on the stage thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.840" end="00:10:58.610" style="s2">that I was being something like an</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.340" end="00:11:01.250" style="s2">honest broker trying to bring either</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.610" end="00:11:04.070" style="s2">what I knew was his real quality in</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.250" end="00:11:06.440" style="s2">certain spheres it was a there was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.070" end="00:11:10.250" style="s2">certain quality of psychological and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.440" end="00:11:13.370" style="s2">theological death and an intensity of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.250" end="00:11:15.080" style="s2">communication and a passion that I felt</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.370" end="00:11:17.180" style="s2">was missing in public life and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.080" end="00:11:18.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot going on here there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.180" end="00:11:21.170" style="s2">reason people are drawn to this person</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.830" end="00:11:22.630" style="s2">he has a certain prophetic quality that</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.170" end="00:11:24.650" style="s2">we&#39;re missing right</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.630" end="00:11:27.140" style="s2">especially my sort of liberal</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.650" end="00:11:29.120" style="s2">progressive chums who were just finding</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.140" end="00:11:30.680" style="s2">him you know we&#39;re just allergic we just</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.120" end="00:11:31.640" style="s2">couldn&#39;t seem to solve just see him saw</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.680" end="00:11:33.320" style="s2">mr. boogeyman</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.640" end="00:11:34.370" style="s2">how&#39;s the devil or something yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.320" end="00:11:37.580" style="s2">and I thought that wasn&#39;t the whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.370" end="00:11:38.990" style="s2">story another hand having tried to sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.580" end="00:11:41.960" style="s2">of elicit from him certainly more</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.990" end="00:11:46.490" style="s2">nuanced positions on for example climate</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.960" end="00:11:49.670" style="s2">change yeah and the way his his fans</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.490" end="00:11:53.200" style="s2">viewed that online was that I was just</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.670" end="00:11:56.570" style="s2">like cast as any other lefty you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.200" end="00:12:00.730" style="s2">there was even one particular YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.570" end="00:12:05.720" style="s2">video that I think said left his host</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.730" end="00:12:08.270" style="s2">was destroyed by Peterson it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.720" end="00:12:10.280" style="s2">instantly regret sitter yeah and these</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.270" end="00:12:11.840" style="s2">things were viewed in their millions you</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.280" end="00:12:14.420" style="s2">know like literally millions of times</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.840" end="00:12:16.520" style="s2">mmm and I was right at the center but</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.420" end="00:12:18.680" style="s2">and partly because of that you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.520" end="00:12:24.230" style="s2">walking around the streets my</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.680" end="00:12:26.930" style="s2">hairdresser my neighbor my people at my</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.230" end="00:12:29.690" style="s2">son&#39;s school they said are you know are</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.930" end="00:12:31.790" style="s2">you that guy was you know that&#39;s how big</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.690" end="00:12:34.910" style="s2">it was at the time so it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.790" end="00:12:36.470" style="s2">intense experience and actually took</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.910" end="00:12:38.330" style="s2">about two or three months I forget</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.470" end="00:12:40.400" style="s2">exactly how long to write that piece of</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.330" end="00:12:41.720" style="s2">meat there&#39;s no one medium yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.400" end="00:12:43.940" style="s2">thing that went wrong is that I thought</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.720" end="00:12:45.920" style="s2">because it&#39;s been so long in it I should</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.940" end="00:12:48.320" style="s2">try and publish it somewhere big and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.920" end="00:12:49.490" style="s2">know get more attention for it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.320" end="00:12:53.210" style="s2">gonna film what was going on was really</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.490" end="00:12:54.800" style="s2">important which was not so much what</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.210" end="00:12:56.210" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s saying because animal can</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.800" end="00:12:58.130" style="s2">read the books or watch the videos and</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.210" end="00:13:00.800" style="s2">make their judgment yeah but not so much</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.130" end="00:13:03.830" style="s2">really the cultural we have a word in</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.800" end="00:13:07.190" style="s2">Scots from Ashe like mess bangle</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.830" end="00:13:10.760" style="s2">confusion that was a fallout from that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.190" end="00:13:13.400" style="s2">about Peterson yes or no right also felt</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.760" end="00:13:15.380" style="s2">a bit lame you know like media culture</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.400" end="00:13:17.420" style="s2">that obliges us to pick a side like</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.380" end="00:13:19.550" style="s2">truly we can learn</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.420" end="00:13:22.190" style="s2">than that and find the active</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.550" end="00:13:25.160" style="s2">ingredients the insights without buying</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.190" end="00:13:26.660" style="s2">into someone wholesale and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.160" end="00:13:28.820" style="s2">polarization is such that that was</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.660" end="00:13:30.710" style="s2">difficult and so what I was reading</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.820" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">about is what do you do in that context</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.710" end="00:13:36.290" style="s2">yeah I think having absorbed so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:37.910" style="s2">his material having gone through a</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.290" end="00:13:39.560" style="s2">little bit of the culture war and not</p>

<p begin="00:13:43.340" end="00:13:49.010" style="s2">ourselves trying to think well what can</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.070" end="00:13:52.820" style="s2">I say about Petersons of any volume yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.010" end="00:13:55.490" style="s2">and I tried as you know you were right I</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.820" end="00:13:57.140" style="s2">think in some ways that I was maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.490" end="00:13:59.150" style="s2">there was a little part of me that was</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.140" end="00:14:00.320" style="s2">trying to be smarter than Peterson he</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.150" end="00:14:03.140" style="s2">does a little part of me that was trying</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.320" end="00:14:04.970" style="s2">to beat him at his own game and nuance</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.140" end="00:14:07.520" style="s2">the professor and maybe there was a</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.970" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">little bit of hubris in that yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.520" end="00:14:12.680" style="s2">are probably right in your critique of</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.920" end="00:14:14.840" style="s2">Mia as being trying to monopolize the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.680" end="00:14:17.540" style="s2">situation to get people to pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.840" end="00:14:19.790" style="s2">to my articles I mean I just have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.540" end="00:14:22.670" style="s2">write something about Peterson too even</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.790" end="00:14:25.340" style="s2">today and and you know I&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.670" end="00:14:29.620" style="s2">thousands of people that will read it so</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.340" end="00:14:29.620" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s temptation no</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.800" end="00:14:36.860" style="s2">suffice to say that I think that essay</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.570" end="00:14:38.990" style="s2">might still be one of the best things</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.860" end="00:14:41.480" style="s2">I&#39;ve written because it was so important</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.990" end="00:14:44.240" style="s2">for me to process what I&#39;d gone through</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.480" end="00:14:46.130" style="s2">to be right at the heart of that culture</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.240" end="00:14:48.320" style="s2">war it wasn&#39;t really about him at all</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.130" end="00:14:50.620" style="s2">you know not really it was about what he</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.320" end="00:14:53.960" style="s2">signified about where we are and our</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.620" end="00:14:56.950" style="s2">inability to speak coherently in this</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.960" end="00:15:00.200" style="s2">somewhat contaminated cultural context</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.950" end="00:15:02.660" style="s2">and yet to bring to bear the things that</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.200" end="00:15:04.640" style="s2">were forgotten like what is your answer</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.660" end="00:15:06.920" style="s2">to the climate collapse yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.640" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">where are you an inequality what is</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.920" end="00:15:11.480" style="s2">happening to democracy where are those</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:14.660" style="s2">questions in this to me and can you</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.480" end="00:15:17.540" style="s2">listen to what he&#39;s saying without just</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.660" end="00:15:19.820" style="s2">watching those little fragmented clips</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.540" end="00:15:21.260" style="s2">that show you in your filter bubble what</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.820" end="00:15:23.570" style="s2">you want to see oh sure</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.260" end="00:15:29.050" style="s2">well the funny thing for me is that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.570" end="00:15:31.760" style="s2">was characterized as a sort of Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.050" end="00:15:34.430" style="s2">fanboy that was just support</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.760" end="00:15:37.040" style="s2">but I actually had some criticisms in my</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.430" end="00:15:39.800" style="s2">articles of him and you work you you are</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.040" end="00:15:44.210" style="s2">characterized as you know attacking</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.800" end="00:15:46.910" style="s2">Peterson and a progressive you know so</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.210" end="00:15:49.340" style="s2">social justice warrior but you actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.910" end="00:15:52.220" style="s2">had some appreciation for suffered for</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.340" end="00:15:54.710" style="s2">certain aspects of his thinking so so</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.220" end="00:15:57.920" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s funny like we got pushed on</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.710" end="00:16:01.160" style="s2">this other side whereas whereas only now</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:16:03.200" style="s2">I guess we&#39;re having a well this is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.160" end="00:16:07.010" style="s2">thing about open conversation about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.200" end="00:16:08.930" style="s2">right and I mean you know it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.010" end="00:16:12.410" style="s2">him it&#39;s not about us it&#39;s about you</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.930" end="00:16:15.170" style="s2">know the predicament which is how do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.410" end="00:16:17.930" style="s2">speak of contentious matters in a way</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.170" end="00:16:19.640" style="s2">that goes beyond picking a side and how</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.930" end="00:16:21.050" style="s2">do you get beyond tribal affiliation</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.640" end="00:16:23.690" style="s2">there&#39;s your primary reference point to</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.050" end="00:16:25.280" style="s2">a public conversation and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.690" end="00:16:27.880" style="s2">Peterson brought into the public square</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.280" end="00:16:32.090" style="s2">it was like okay here is this very</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.880" end="00:16:37.160" style="s2">intense somewhat toxic for many very</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.090" end="00:16:38.360" style="s2">inspiring cultural warrior who also did</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.160" end="00:16:39.920" style="s2">another thing you know he signified</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.360" end="00:16:42.500" style="s2">expertise but he didn&#39;t always speak</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.920" end="00:16:47.660" style="s2">about his area of expertise</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.500" end="00:16:49.310" style="s2">he played off that and yet he would</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.660" end="00:16:51.440" style="s2">often be very speculative on political</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.310" end="00:16:53.210" style="s2">matters and people would only hear that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.440" end="00:16:55.880" style="s2">but not here where he really was quite</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.210" end="00:17:00.230" style="s2">profound I mean all of that was going on</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.880" end="00:17:03.170" style="s2">so it was a kind of epistemic what was</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.230" end="00:17:07.430" style="s2">it thunderstorm really it was a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.170" end="00:17:09.680" style="s2">epistemic thunderstorm in which no one</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.430" end="00:17:14.209" style="s2">really knew how to orient themselves</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.680" end="00:17:16.699" style="s2">adequately some just became fanboys or</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.209" end="00:17:19.449" style="s2">fangirls mostly fanboys of course some</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.699" end="00:17:22.689" style="s2">just thought this is just a misogynist</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.449" end="00:17:25.640" style="s2">who&#39;s into himself he&#39;s a performer and</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.689" end="00:17:27.199" style="s2">those two worlds didn&#39;t weren&#39;t part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.640" end="00:17:28.510" style="s2">the same world they were watching their</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.199" end="00:17:30.850" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.510" end="00:17:32.470" style="s2">versions of reality and then they were</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.850" end="00:17:34.180" style="s2">attacking each other and the attack was</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.470" end="00:17:36.850" style="s2">part of why the reality perpetuated</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.180" end="00:17:38.830" style="s2">itself and so I could feel both sides of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.850" end="00:17:42.940" style="s2">that because I because of the networks</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.830" end="00:17:43.870" style="s2">that I&#39;m in and you know I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.940" end="00:17:46.900" style="s2">conflicted</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.870" end="00:17:49.090" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t think he was a the good</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.900" end="00:17:50.440" style="s2">guy be or be the bad guy or see</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.090" end="00:17:54.010" style="s2">somewhere in between I thought something</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.440" end="00:17:56.380" style="s2">else was going on so I what was going on</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.010" end="00:18:00.090" style="s2">can we look at that now like what what</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.380" end="00:18:04.570" style="s2">for me I&#39;m I think he blew open a huge</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.090" end="00:18:06.640" style="s2">you know possibility uh-huh where is</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.570" end="00:18:09.160" style="s2">there there are some problematic aspects</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.640" end="00:18:10.810" style="s2">of his thinking but at the same time I</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.160" end="00:18:12.910" style="s2">see him as blowing up this huge</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.810" end="00:18:15.790" style="s2">possibility and now disappearing like</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.910" end="00:18:19.960" style="s2">he&#39;s not there anymore he&#39;s he&#39;s gone he</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.790" end="00:18:21.970" style="s2">just he was so present on some level at</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.960" end="00:18:24.250" style="s2">least if you were a person who spent any</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.970" end="00:18:28.300" style="s2">time online and now he&#39;s just he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.250" end="00:18:30.040" style="s2">gone well conversation about him is</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.300" end="00:18:32.620" style="s2">almost over or something and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.040" end="00:18:36.010" style="s2">he&#39;s just dead or so I mean right I</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.620" end="00:18:37.270" style="s2">don&#39;t want to do it it&#39;s very it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.010" end="00:18:40.870" style="s2">odd sorry</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.270" end="00:18:42.490" style="s2">well you might say it&#39;s all I look for</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.870" end="00:18:44.140" style="s2">many this was always on the cards he</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.490" end="00:18:46.630" style="s2">looked like a shooting star somehow oh</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.140" end="00:18:48.540" style="s2">sure this is straw and Richard yet to</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.630" end="00:18:52.480" style="s2">read that couldn&#39;t continue itself and</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.540" end="00:18:55.240" style="s2">but I mean my answer to what was going</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.480" end="00:18:57.550" style="s2">on is my I forget how long it was there</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.240" end="00:19:00.190" style="s2">was roughly about 10,000 words mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.550" end="00:19:03.540" style="s2">two or three months of work trying to</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.190" end="00:19:03.540" style="s2">process that I think it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.960" end="00:19:08.110" style="s2">cultural in digestion what we learned</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.580" end="00:19:11.980" style="s2">and failed to learn from Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.110" end="00:19:13.210" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s rise to fame and as you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.980" end="00:19:15.730" style="s2">there I go through 12 different</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.210" end="00:19:17.230" style="s2">perspectives on him some of which were</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.730" end="00:19:19.390" style="s2">about his thoughts some of which were</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.230" end="00:19:20.770" style="s2">about the reaction to him some of which</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.390" end="00:19:25.750" style="s2">were about critique some of which were</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.770" end="00:19:27.190" style="s2">about kind of appraisal and and it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.750" end="00:19:29.500" style="s2">no accident that people like for example</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.190" end="00:19:33.820" style="s2">Ken Wilber highlighted that he was onto</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.500" end="00:19:36.610" style="s2">something important but equally he was</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.820" end="00:19:40.380" style="s2">he was partial you know he was true but</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.610" end="00:19:43.059" style="s2">partial he was tapping into the lost</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.380" end="00:19:46.870" style="s2">spiritual dimension of our</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.059" end="00:19:49.960" style="s2">he was critiquing liberalism indirectly</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.870" end="00:19:51.820" style="s2">by saying look he was also critiquing</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.960" end="00:19:54.059" style="s2">certain aspects of post-modernism more</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.820" end="00:19:57.070" style="s2">than perhaps caricature in them too a</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.059" end="00:19:58.809" style="s2">lot was going on he was he was prismatic</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.070" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2">I think there was one of the words I</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.809" end="00:20:05.650" style="s2">used to make sense of him he was also</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:07.299" style="s2">really I called a multi phrenic because</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.650" end="00:20:09.460" style="s2">unlike schizophrenia which is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.299" end="00:20:13.450" style="s2">disorder he could move between the kind</p>

<p begin="00:22:36.230" end="00:22:40.820" style="s2">mean for what it&#39;s worth in may I see</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.420" end="00:22:44.150" style="s2">the first symptom of Peterson itis I</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.820" end="00:22:46.250" style="s2">described as mesmerised intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.150" end="00:22:49.160" style="s2">excitement at the spectacle of</p>

<p begin="00:22:49.160" end="00:22:57.740" style="s2">and what exactly is being said and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.990" end="00:23:00.470" style="s2">that&#39;s um and then I then I have moral</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.740" end="00:23:02.090" style="s2">done finding arising from the intuition</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.470" end="00:23:04.040" style="s2">that Peterson is wrong in important ways</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.090" end="00:23:07.730" style="s2">even when his reasoning is persuasive</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.040" end="00:23:10.640" style="s2">and then finally and slightly and you</p>

<p begin="00:23:21.070" end="00:23:27.860" style="s2">you know these videos that were watched</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.420" end="00:23:31.010" style="s2">by and shared so widely but suffice to</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.860" end="00:23:35.780" style="s2">say that I think as a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.010" end="00:23:37.520" style="s2">phenomenon he was very important because</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.780" end="00:23:39.680" style="s2">he spoke to people in a way others were</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.520" end="00:23:41.270" style="s2">not speaking to know the comparison I</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.680" end="00:23:44.120" style="s2">used in the intro actually was non</p>

<p begin="00:23:44.120" end="00:23:48.530" style="s2">people on this order but he&#39;s like don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.400" end="00:23:51.370" style="s2">Chomsky on some level you&#39;re saying what</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.530" end="00:23:53.630" style="s2">is the sentence that you inspired</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.370" end="00:23:56.600" style="s2">thousands of a particular kind of out</p>

<p begin="00:23:56.600" end="00:24:00.860" style="s2">in the culture at the time to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.940" end="00:24:03.170" style="s2">of something Chomsky was moral about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.860" end="00:24:05.960" style="s2">military-industrial complex and you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.170" end="00:24:08.299" style="s2">abuse worried about you know just</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.960" end="00:24:09.950" style="s2">your shit together yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.299" end="00:24:11.899" style="s2">Chomsky&#39;s kind of abuses of power look</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.950" end="00:24:14.570" style="s2">more deeply systems see how corrupt it</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.899" end="00:24:16.279" style="s2">is see how hold power to account in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.570" end="00:24:18.950" style="s2">right way and that was needed at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.279" end="00:24:20.539" style="s2">time because it&#39;s more like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.950" end="00:24:21.860" style="s2">happened to the meaning of life you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.539" end="00:24:28.039" style="s2">people are like yeah that&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.860" end="00:24:29.570" style="s2">where is that yeah so yeah I&#39;m glad to</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.039" end="00:24:33.770" style="s2">be honest after writing that piece I</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.570" end="00:24:35.330" style="s2">felt it was like an exorcism of sorts</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.770" end="00:24:36.890" style="s2">you know it was like that no I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.330" end="00:24:41.179" style="s2">thought about him for the last two years</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.890" end="00:24:45.200" style="s2">hardly at all but I&#39;m glad I went</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.179" end="00:24:50.960" style="s2">through it you know I was it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.200" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">an experience yeah hmm yeah so it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.960" end="00:24:56.059" style="s2">very personal for you like I think that</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:58.730" style="s2">what my critique of your article was</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.059" end="00:25:00.500" style="s2">that it was you were saying that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.730" end="00:25:02.270" style="s2">were not being personal where it seemed</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.500" end="00:25:04.549" style="s2">to me a very personal article on some</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.270" end="00:25:06.350" style="s2">level right I mean seemed to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.549" end="00:25:08.990" style="s2">something very personal in it to you</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.350" end="00:25:18.080" style="s2">uh-huh well it&#39;s personal because I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.990" end="00:25:19.539" style="s2">there with him and first of all because</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.080" end="00:25:23.630" style="s2">of where I am in my career as well</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.539" end="00:25:26.210" style="s2">perspective is up to it is partly about</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.630" end="00:25:28.549" style="s2">trying to bring to bear fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.210" end="00:25:30.700" style="s2">questions of meaning and purpose into</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.549" end="00:25:33.620" style="s2">the public realm in a way that informs</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.700" end="00:25:36.380" style="s2">debates about things like the economy in</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.620" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">society and democracy and Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.380" end="00:25:40.250" style="s2">seemed to be doing that so in the one</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:41.950" style="s2">hand he was like an ally another hand he</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.250" end="00:25:45.950" style="s2">was doing it in a way that was quite</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.950" end="00:25:47.510" style="s2">reactionary and quite you know get back</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.950" end="00:25:48.830" style="s2">to basic stop trying to think you could</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.510" end="00:25:51.320" style="s2">change the world just tie to your room</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.830" end="00:25:53.779" style="s2">and so I was conflicted between on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.320" end="00:25:55.940" style="s2">one hand it was a huge ally bringing to</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.779" end="00:25:57.919" style="s2">bear the right kinds of questions but I</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.940" end="00:25:59.419" style="s2">was also very ambivalent because he was</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.919" end="00:26:01.880" style="s2">doing it in such a way that he was</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.419" end="00:26:04.490" style="s2">antagonizing the kinds of people I felt</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.880" end="00:26:06.590" style="s2">needed to hear at most mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.490" end="00:26:08.750" style="s2">it was personal in that professional</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.590" end="00:26:11.360" style="s2">sense it might have been more than that</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.750" end="00:26:14.450" style="s2">it was it was also that I felt I could</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.360" end="00:26:15.740" style="s2">see where he was correct and where he</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.450" end="00:26:18.809" style="s2">wasn&#39;t and I wanted to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.740" end="00:26:19.889" style="s2">that but to be honest you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.809" end="00:26:23.460" style="s2">there was a little bit with hindsight</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.889" end="00:26:26.039" style="s2">our motivated reasoning in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.460" end="00:26:27.629" style="s2">trying to sort of be the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.039" end="00:26:28.399" style="s2">insight at the Peterson there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.629" end="00:26:32.700" style="s2">certain hubris</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.399" end="00:26:34.259" style="s2">and finally well I kind of think what</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.700" end="00:26:36.389" style="s2">Nietzsche says that everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.259" end="00:26:40.830" style="s2">philosophy is very personal on some</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.389" end="00:26:41.999" style="s2">level so I just say philosophy is a very</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.830" end="00:26:44.820" style="s2">personal and I think thing about</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.999" end="00:26:48.450" style="s2">Peterson that wasn&#39;t said enough is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.820" end="00:26:53.340" style="s2">he has a very bleak fairly dark outlook</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.450" end="00:26:55.340" style="s2">on life and and it&#39;s informed by the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.340" end="00:26:57.389" style="s2">readings of souls in its skin and</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.340" end="00:27:00.269" style="s2">reflecting on the Soviet Union and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.389" end="00:27:01.740" style="s2">gulag and for him those were like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.269" end="00:27:03.090" style="s2">where reality is that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.740" end="00:27:03.570" style="s2">battle that must be fought of one at all</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.090" end="00:27:06.690" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.570" end="00:27:11.100" style="s2">that&#39;s you know the first noble truth</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.690" end="00:27:13.049" style="s2">but not the other ones right but this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.100" end="00:27:16.619" style="s2">not a Buddhist personable truth this was</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.049" end="00:27:17.730" style="s2">something more like the monster at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.619" end="00:27:19.860" style="s2">gates at all times</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.730" end="00:27:24.119" style="s2">that has to be waiting to come and eat</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.860" end="00:27:26.220" style="s2">you it&#39;s less about too much of a mono</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.119" end="00:27:30.779" style="s2">myth or something that&#39;s that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.220" end="00:27:33.090" style="s2">feel and I suppose I when I read some on</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.779" end="00:27:35.519" style="s2">the back of Peterson experience I read a</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.090" end="00:27:37.860" style="s2">bit more souls in its skin and I got to</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.519" end="00:27:40.259" style="s2">know life of the Gulag and I think for</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.860" end="00:27:42.869" style="s2">Peterson liking the good life is very</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.259" end="00:27:44.999" style="s2">important reference point yes like it</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.869" end="00:27:46.259" style="s2">could be so much worse and he&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.999" end="00:27:47.820" style="s2">and we don&#39;t realize that enough and</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.259" end="00:27:50.519" style="s2">with the Chimera virus at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.820" end="00:27:52.710" style="s2">come back to that we&#39;re sensing that</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.519" end="00:27:54.360" style="s2">right well I think that&#39;s was the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.710" end="00:27:57.809" style="s2">important part of his message in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.360" end="00:28:00.419" style="s2">census like as I kind of kind of look at</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.809" end="00:28:02.879" style="s2">look at the potential for for you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.419" end="00:28:05.730" style="s2">what what you could be or you could be</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.879" end="00:28:09.289" style="s2">the camp guard at ostrich and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.730" end="00:28:12.869" style="s2">there&#39;s the shadow issue but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.289" end="00:28:16.230" style="s2">he maybe wasn&#39;t sufficiently clear ass</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.869" end="00:28:18.269" style="s2">yes life is actually pretty peachy</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.230" end="00:28:20.850" style="s2">compared to how it could be in the gulag</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.269" end="00:28:22.470" style="s2">but there was a sense in which he always</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.850" end="00:28:25.769" style="s2">felt the gulag was somehow the human</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.470" end="00:28:27.509" style="s2">default but somehow that was our natural</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.769" end="00:28:29.190" style="s2">inclination to revere that way</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.509" end="00:28:32.159" style="s2">mmm-hmm we didn&#39;t win the ideological</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.190" end="00:28:33.780" style="s2">battle on the right way</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.159" end="00:28:35.460" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure we ever quite won that</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.780" end="00:28:36.870" style="s2">argument that was always more his</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.460" end="00:28:41.270" style="s2">personal stuff than something he</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.870" end="00:28:46.320" style="s2">actually convinced people out okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.270" end="00:28:48.630" style="s2">okay yeah sure that&#39;s that&#39;s great I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.320" end="00:28:51.960" style="s2">glad we had that conversation I again I</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.630" end="00:28:53.640" style="s2">I think I&#39;ve also exercised Peterson out</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.960" end="00:28:57.419" style="s2">of my system through writing about him a</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.640" end="00:29:01.080" style="s2">lot and and I I don&#39;t have much more to</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.419" end="00:29:03.570" style="s2">say about it I I move on in good or in</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.080" end="00:29:05.460" style="s2">other areas right I was glad I started</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.570" end="00:29:09.150" style="s2">to write about John Verve a key I</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.460" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">started to study that you know and I and</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.150" end="00:29:16.799" style="s2">I I didn&#39;t really want to be typecast it</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:20.070" style="s2">as being you know sure somebody who you</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.799" end="00:29:21.929" style="s2">know cuz because yeah because I you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.070" end="00:29:25.140" style="s2">study Buddhism for years I have all</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.929" end="00:29:26.640" style="s2">these other interests so it was just it</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.140" end="00:29:29.640" style="s2">was it was a period it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.640" end="00:29:32.520" style="s2">intense period I thought and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.640" end="00:29:37.140" style="s2">think we need to feel any great regret</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.520" end="00:29:38.460" style="s2">about being part of it and it passed a</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.140" end="00:29:42.120" style="s2">lot of people by you know some people</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.460" end="00:29:44.370" style="s2">never heard something some yeah some of</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.120" end="00:29:46.169" style="s2">some think who&#39;s this guy yes my friend</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.370" end="00:29:48.530" style="s2">Neil says those were real scholars in</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.169" end="00:29:50.820" style="s2">the kind of the main people like exact</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.530" end="00:29:53.340" style="s2">just wasn&#39;t that impressed it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.820" end="00:29:54.539" style="s2">that impressed you know let it go on so</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.340" end="00:29:57.330" style="s2">they&#39;re people who didn&#39;t get caught up</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.539" end="00:30:00.150" style="s2">in it for me it was a very good group</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.330" end="00:30:06.510" style="s2">experience to go through it and process</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.150" end="00:30:09.419" style="s2">it okay why don&#39;t we why don&#39;t we why</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.510" end="00:30:11.700" style="s2">don&#39;t you talk about you what you what</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.419" end="00:30:15.030" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to achieve a perspective</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.700" end="00:30:18.510" style="s2">a-- and what are your future projects</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.030" end="00:30:22.309" style="s2">and goals and you know what what are you</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.510" end="00:30:27.840" style="s2">looking towards well honestly i&#39;m we</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.309" end="00:30:29.250" style="s2">basis well it&#39;s a lot of question right</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.840" end="00:30:37.770" style="s2">now because everything kind of stopped</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.250" end="00:30:39.150" style="s2">but yeah well there&#39;s a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.770" end="00:30:41.669" style="s2">genesis story to make sense of this</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.150" end="00:30:43.360" style="s2">which is that as I mentioned the de</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.669" end="00:30:45.549" style="s2">spirituality project</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.360" end="00:30:49.270" style="s2">not society right to London and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.549" end="00:30:53.940" style="s2">began around 2000 and let me get this</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.270" end="00:30:58.150" style="s2">right twelve and went on until about</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.940" end="00:31:01.110" style="s2">2014 15 and around the same time I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.150" end="00:31:03.760" style="s2">also working on climate change and</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.110" end="00:31:05.380" style="s2">before that climate change project I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.760" end="00:31:08.260" style="s2">working on behavior change so these were</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.380" end="00:31:10.450" style="s2">the three main so formative influences</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.260" end="00:31:13.679" style="s2">around my professional life it was a lot</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.450" end="00:31:16.049" style="s2">of chess there was a there was a</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.679" end="00:31:20.169" style="s2">philosophy politics and economics degree</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.049" end="00:31:21.910" style="s2">there was a mind brain and education</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.169" end="00:31:23.770" style="s2">degree that got me into psychology a bit</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.910" end="00:31:25.600" style="s2">more and then there was a PhD on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.770" end="00:31:27.040" style="s2">idea of wisdom so that was kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.600" end="00:31:29.440" style="s2">the background I kind of few medical</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.040" end="00:31:31.030" style="s2">psychology philosophy with a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.440" end="00:31:32.919" style="s2">of politics and economics thrown in that</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.030" end="00:31:34.780" style="s2">was my kind of information and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.919" end="00:31:36.549" style="s2">there was chess and then I got to this</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.780" end="00:31:37.660" style="s2">job at the RSA anywhere basically if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.549" end="00:31:40.270" style="s2">raised you on funds</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.660" end="00:31:43.020" style="s2">you could not quite do what you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.270" end="00:31:45.640" style="s2">but it was a fairly porous environment I</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.020" end="00:31:49.059" style="s2">mentioned that because my work on</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.640" end="00:31:50.500" style="s2">climate change was a kind of I hesitate</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.059" end="00:31:53.410" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna sound a bit self</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.500" end="00:31:55.559" style="s2">congratulatory but I would see an</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.410" end="00:31:58.990" style="s2">introduction to political consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.559" end="00:32:00.700" style="s2">sense that I began climate change</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.990" end="00:32:04.570" style="s2">thinking that how do I get people at</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.700" end="00:32:06.790" style="s2">home to travel or to change their diet</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.570" end="00:32:07.840" style="s2">or a fly less or whatever and quite</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.790" end="00:32:09.220" style="s2">quickly when I looked into that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.840" end="00:32:10.900" style="s2">thought hang on this is not going to cut</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.220" end="00:32:13.720" style="s2">it there are these macroeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.900" end="00:32:15.179" style="s2">influences that affecting our lives</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.720" end="00:32:17.410" style="s2">there are these forms of advertising</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.179" end="00:32:19.390" style="s2">there are these political structures</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.410" end="00:32:21.010" style="s2">which have vested interests as part of</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.390" end="00:32:23.200" style="s2">them then there&#39;s this global problem</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.010" end="00:32:25.510" style="s2">and whatever we do here the work that</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.200" end="00:32:26.740" style="s2">what happens in China or India and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.510" end="00:32:29.620" style="s2">there are these supply chains that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.740" end="00:32:31.120" style="s2">not part of the metrics and meanwhile</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.620" end="00:32:33.460" style="s2">the scientists are not really being</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.120" end="00:32:35.590" style="s2">listened to and people are afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.460" end="00:32:38.799" style="s2">their deaths and and the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.590" end="00:32:40.660" style="s2">began to look like multiple things so</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.799" end="00:32:42.840" style="s2">climate changes are kind of waking up to</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.660" end="00:32:45.340" style="s2">the interconnected nature not just the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.840" end="00:32:47.860" style="s2">different features of a problem but</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.340" end="00:32:50.950" style="s2">different ways of knowing so climate</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.860" end="00:32:52.419" style="s2">change was at once a kind of climate</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.950" end="00:32:53.820" style="s2">change denial being connected the death</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.419" end="00:32:56.590" style="s2">denial for example</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.820" end="00:33:01.510" style="s2">consumerism being a kind of self</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.590" end="00:33:02.559" style="s2">formation issue identity issue so all</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.510" end="00:33:04.210" style="s2">that was going on and then there was</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.559" end="00:33:06.160" style="s2">like okay well what&#39;s for the economics</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.210" end="00:33:08.380" style="s2">of this and where my own carbon taxes</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.160" end="00:33:08.860" style="s2">where am i so all of these questions are</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.380" end="00:33:11.559" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.860" end="00:33:12.910" style="s2">you know they happen at once and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.559" end="00:33:15.460" style="s2">led to a project called the seven</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.910" end="00:33:16.690" style="s2">dimensions of climate change which I did</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.460" end="00:33:19.750" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t really familiar with at the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.690" end="00:33:21.940" style="s2">time an integral language and met some</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.750" end="00:33:23.410" style="s2">modern language and stuff but I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.940" end="00:33:24.250" style="s2">was laying site and seven dimensions of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.410" end="00:33:26.370" style="s2">climate change</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.250" end="00:33:28.570" style="s2">combined with the spirituality project</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.370" end="00:33:32.080" style="s2">would have been like a kind of entry</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.570" end="00:33:32.919" style="s2">card into that community on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.080" end="00:33:37.480" style="s2">quite deeply</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.919" end="00:33:38.110" style="s2">neck&#39;s essentially but also yeah across</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.480" end="00:33:40.150" style="s2">contexts</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.110" end="00:33:41.770" style="s2">well you mentioned Ken Wilber and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.150" end="00:33:47.290" style="s2">think Ken Wilber had a big effect on me</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.770" end="00:33:50.130" style="s2">as well and I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.290" end="00:33:53.890" style="s2">yeah this this I guess an integral model</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.130" end="00:33:56.350" style="s2">right so I guess we I guess what</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.890" end="00:33:58.210" style="s2">happened is he wasn&#39;t a big formative</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.350" end="00:34:01.090" style="s2">influence I was aware of him right</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.210" end="00:34:02.440" style="s2">nobody laterally actually me as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.090" end="00:34:04.090" style="s2">trying to make sense of what I was doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.440" end="00:34:05.650" style="s2">people said all the signs of it like</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.090" end="00:34:08.440" style="s2">this local guy you know that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.650" end="00:34:10.179" style="s2">caught up with that later on and but</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.440" end="00:34:11.940" style="s2">what happened was the spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.179" end="00:34:15.550" style="s2">project and the climate change work</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.940" end="00:34:17.740" style="s2">around that time I met Thomas Bjorkman</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.550" end="00:34:20.619" style="s2">who was very who&#39;s a Swedish</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.740" end="00:34:22.210" style="s2">entrepreneur and also philosopher he had</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.619" end="00:34:24.429" style="s2">rented all of my material and said there</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.210" end="00:34:26.919" style="s2">aren&#39;t many people in public policy work</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.429" end="00:34:29.710" style="s2">trying to connect human development and</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.919" end="00:34:31.119" style="s2">spiritual questions but in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.710" end="00:34:33.340" style="s2">at the Club of Rome this is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.119" end="00:34:34.659" style="s2">what people need to hear to help them</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.340" end="00:34:38.290" style="s2">with their economic thinking and their</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.659" end="00:34:39.669" style="s2">societal right and he said you want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.290" end="00:34:41.260" style="s2">try it you know we can talk about how we</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.669" end="00:34:43.450" style="s2">do this and I said well look at me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.260" end="00:34:44.830" style="s2">at a bit of an allpass of my career I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.450" end="00:34:47.139" style="s2">had six years here I&#39;d like to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.830" end="00:34:49.530" style="s2">something else and so he gave me the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.139" end="00:34:52.510" style="s2">seed funding to create this organization</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.530" end="00:34:55.690" style="s2">called perspectiva he was a cool finder</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.510" end="00:34:58.119" style="s2">he remains you know trusty and he set it</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.690" end="00:35:01.240" style="s2">up and it gave the early funds to make</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.119" end="00:35:02.710" style="s2">it possible for me to quit my job I was</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.240" end="00:35:05.770" style="s2">how expecting my second son of the time</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.710" end="00:35:07.270" style="s2">so it was a very busy period but then it</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.770" end="00:35:07.790" style="s2">was like okay what is the survive man</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.270" end="00:35:09.290" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.790" end="00:35:12.380" style="s2">what is the organizational mission and</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.290" end="00:35:14.080" style="s2">purpose and we came quite quickly on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.380" end="00:35:16.760" style="s2">connection between three main things</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.080" end="00:35:17.900" style="s2">which for those who studied Wilbur will</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.760" end="00:35:21.350" style="s2">again look very familiar</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.900" end="00:35:24.260" style="s2">and we decided partly based on called</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.350" end="00:35:26.150" style="s2">popper partly based on GU Atari and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.260" end="00:35:29.030" style="s2">laterally we realized Wilbur a few</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.150" end="00:35:32.510" style="s2">others but our tagline is systems souls</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.030" end="00:35:35.720" style="s2">and society so it&#39;s about the connection</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.510" end="00:35:39.490" style="s2">between complex systems of various kinds</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.720" end="00:35:42.890" style="s2">both natural and social and ecological</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.490" end="00:35:44.300" style="s2">mmm-hmm and the inner life of human</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.890" end="00:35:46.880" style="s2">beings and all its complexity the</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.300" end="00:35:48.530" style="s2">totality of our life both the question</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.880" end="00:35:51.920" style="s2">of how we grow and change and develop</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.530" end="00:35:53.690" style="s2">how we cultivate virtue maybe but also</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.920" end="00:35:55.280" style="s2">spiritual experience and meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.690" end="00:35:57.830" style="s2">purpose and what it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.280" end="00:35:59.870" style="s2">and then finally society and that sort</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.830" end="00:36:01.460" style="s2">of where that Peterson essay I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.870" end="00:36:03.200" style="s2">comes in a little bit how do we talk</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.460" end="00:36:07.550" style="s2">about this stuff how do we connect these</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.200" end="00:36:09.710" style="s2">worlds I&#39;ll be kind of it again to bring</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.550" end="00:36:11.750" style="s2">in another model in an Wilbur&#39;s terms</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.710" end="00:36:13.280" style="s2">it was connecting the sort of left-hand</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.750" end="00:36:15.350" style="s2">side of the quadrants about the inner</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.280" end="00:36:18.260" style="s2">life from the shared inner life the</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.350" end="00:36:22.160" style="s2">culture and the psychology with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.260" end="00:36:25.070" style="s2">systems of you know machine</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.160" end="00:36:27.110" style="s2">now the machine yeah if you like health</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.070" end="00:36:29.210" style="s2">and education and economy and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.110" end="00:36:32.030" style="s2">and also with the biology you know what</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.210" end="00:36:34.450" style="s2">kind of an organism are we yeah so that</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.030" end="00:36:36.770" style="s2">was this an origin story and then I</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.450" end="00:36:38.630" style="s2">spent a few years trying to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.770" end="00:36:40.940" style="s2">of what it&#39;s a buyer we raise some funds</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.630" end="00:36:42.290" style="s2">from other places we have a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.940" end="00:36:45.830" style="s2">valued partnership with the Fetzer</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.290" end="00:36:47.780" style="s2">Institute who how does their mission to</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.830" end="00:36:50.360" style="s2">create a spiritual foundation for a</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.780" end="00:36:51.650" style="s2">loving world and we do it you know cuz</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.360" end="00:36:52.670" style="s2">I&#39;ve written spiritualizing it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.650" end="00:36:55.820" style="s2">what I&#39;ve thought about spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.670" end="00:36:57.370" style="s2">foundations a bit but not yet you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.820" end="00:37:00.980" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot like things work it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.370" end="00:37:03.170" style="s2">finished project and and let me start a</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.980" end="00:37:05.720" style="s2">few things about activism how do we</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.170" end="00:37:08.390" style="s2">become wiser activists we have something</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.720" end="00:37:11.750" style="s2">about project called the digital Eagle</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.390" end="00:37:13.460" style="s2">which is about you know how do we how do</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.750" end="00:37:16.210" style="s2">we make sense of what the egos doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.460" end="00:37:18.260" style="s2">when it&#39;s online how do we improve that</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.210" end="00:37:20.090" style="s2">and we also have a very important</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.260" end="00:37:22.340" style="s2">project for the transformative education</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.090" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">alliance</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.340" end="00:37:27.840" style="s2">perhaps if we talk again we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:29.970" style="s2">more about education because I think I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.840" end="00:37:31.050" style="s2">love to talk to you more about that and</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.970" end="00:37:32.700" style="s2">then just briefly to finish that off</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.050" end="00:37:34.320" style="s2">that&#39;s yeah lesson sort of main body</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.700" end="00:37:37.320" style="s2">worker and we also have a little</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.320" end="00:37:38.940" style="s2">publishing arm perspectiva press which</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.320" end="00:37:41.790" style="s2">is creating we&#39;re trying to specialize</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.940" end="00:37:44.460" style="s2">in short roots especially and</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.790" end="00:37:47.730" style="s2">particularly books that help sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.460" end="00:37:51.060" style="s2">activist scholars get their work done</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.730" end="00:37:53.220" style="s2">because books are cultural artifacts and</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.060" end="00:37:56.580" style="s2">kind of symbols of authority as much as</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.220" end="00:37:58.440" style="s2">bodies of content right so we we have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.580" end="00:38:00.180" style="s2">role to play there in helping people do</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.440" end="00:38:03.000" style="s2">their work and finally as you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.180" end="00:38:05.070" style="s2">because you were there in Kiev there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.000" end="00:38:09.960" style="s2">the emerge which is kind of our social</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.070" end="00:38:11.370" style="s2">network emerges you know it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.960" end="00:38:13.290" style="s2">same as perspectiva it has his own</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.370" end="00:38:16.380" style="s2">autonomy but it&#39;s we have quite a big</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.290" end="00:38:19.230" style="s2">role in directing habits when it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.380" end="00:38:22.890" style="s2">and how it will evolve over time mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.230" end="00:38:25.920" style="s2">right yeah so that&#39;s I mean what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.890" end="00:38:27.740" style="s2">trying to do honestly get through the</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.920" end="00:38:30.900" style="s2">day makes sense of it the best I can</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.740" end="00:38:33.630" style="s2">stay soft and employ some people build</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.900" end="00:38:36.720" style="s2">some interesting projects not quite hope</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.630" end="00:38:39.060" style="s2">for the best but at the moment I am</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.720" end="00:38:41.310" style="s2">working towards a clearer sense of plan</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.060" end="00:38:44.360" style="s2">and mission but we&#39;re also in a world</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.310" end="00:38:46.170" style="s2">where planning looks a bit silly so</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.360" end="00:38:49.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.170" end="00:38:50.760" style="s2">sensing my way and I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.080" end="00:38:53.160" style="s2">transformative education and making</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.760" end="00:38:56.280" style="s2">sense of what that means is very</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.160" end="00:38:58.860" style="s2">important if there&#39;s one quotation that</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.280" end="00:38:59.400" style="s2">haunts me at the moment it&#39;s a by Thomas</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.860" end="00:39:01.710" style="s2">Metzinger</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.400" end="00:39:03.840" style="s2">the German philosopher he wrote a great</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.710" end="00:39:06.240" style="s2">essay called spirituality and</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.840" end="00:39:08.150" style="s2">intellectual honesty and he has a line</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.240" end="00:39:10.980" style="s2">in there which says words of the effect</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.150" end="00:39:12.740" style="s2">but over the next few years as the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.980" end="00:39:17.700" style="s2">effects of anthropogenic climate change</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.740" end="00:39:21.720" style="s2">hit home we will increasingly experience</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.700" end="00:39:25.140" style="s2">ourselves as failing beings because this</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.720" end="00:39:28.260" style="s2">first truly man-made planetary problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.140" end="00:39:31.290" style="s2">appears to exceed and this is acute the</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.260" end="00:39:33.150" style="s2">key line appears to exceed the present</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.290" end="00:39:34.530" style="s2">cognitive and emotional capacity of our</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.150" end="00:39:36.840" style="s2">species</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.530" end="00:39:39.180" style="s2">that for me is the heart of the matter</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.840" end="00:39:40.890" style="s2">it&#39;s like what are those capacities what</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.180" end="00:39:44.160" style="s2">are the species cognitive and emotional</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.890" end="00:39:46.380" style="s2">capacities how do we work with them</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.160" end="00:39:48.990" style="s2">cultivate them you know it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.380" end="00:39:50.340" style="s2">not over till it&#39;s over so if a problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.990" end="00:39:52.830" style="s2">is that those capacities are not up to</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.340" end="00:39:54.570" style="s2">speed and we need to change them how</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.830" end="00:39:55.920" style="s2">what does that mean how do we do that</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.570" end="00:39:57.390" style="s2">which is where the educational</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.920" end="00:40:02.580" style="s2">imperative comes from well we have</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.390" end="00:40:04.560" style="s2">education without religio as genre Venki</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.580" end="00:40:06.290" style="s2">puts it and we don&#39;t mean religion but</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.560" end="00:40:08.940" style="s2">just this I guess spiritual education</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.290" end="00:40:13.080" style="s2">that we that we deeply need that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.940" end="00:40:15.120" style="s2">totally lacking from schools yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.080" end="00:40:16.830" style="s2">and also it&#39;s about what societies</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.120" end="00:40:18.570" style="s2">Forbes like I mentioned economic growth</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.830" end="00:40:20.730" style="s2">it&#39;s like if we&#39;re not trying to just</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.570" end="00:40:23.010" style="s2">get slightly richer every year what are</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.730" end="00:40:24.210" style="s2">we up to right and that&#39;s again where</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.010" end="00:40:25.710" style="s2">education comes in and says well we</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.210" end="00:40:27.930" style="s2">thought about the human being and what</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.710" end="00:40:32.700" style="s2">it might be what he or she might be poor</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.930" end="00:40:34.620" style="s2">or they met before and that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.700" end="00:40:36.360" style="s2">project but it&#39;s like flipping them on</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.620" end="00:40:38.400" style="s2">its head the purpose of society rather</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.360" end="00:40:40.920" style="s2">than having right and not economic</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.400" end="00:40:44.160" style="s2">growth but real growth natural growth</p>

<p begin="00:45:03.840" end="00:45:07.950" style="s2">rather focus on a few people and go into</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.450" end="00:45:09.900" style="s2">depth with those few people than just</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.950" end="00:45:11.610" style="s2">have a lot of people right now I&#39;m</p>
