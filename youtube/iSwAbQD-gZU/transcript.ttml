<p begin="00:00:02.700" end="00:00:06.359" style="s2">a meaning crisis in our society so this</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.069" end="00:00:08.790" style="s2">is work I do with Christopher master</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.359" end="00:00:10.019" style="s2">master Pietro and what we what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.790" end="00:00:11.969" style="s2">doing in a book were writing called</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.019" end="00:00:14.940" style="s2">science and the sages we talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.969" end="00:00:16.949" style="s2">we call the zombie zeitgeist that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.940" end="00:00:22.380" style="s2">going on right now is we&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.949" end="00:00:25.260" style="s2">proliferation of the presentation and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.380" end="00:00:27.170" style="s2">stories and movies and TV shows about</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.260" end="00:00:30.390" style="s2">zombies so you have the Walking Dead</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.170" end="00:00:32.579" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a movie right now doing a riff</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.390" end="00:00:34.829" style="s2">on Romeo and Juliet involving zombies</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.579" end="00:00:36.899" style="s2">we&#39;ve got World War Z coming which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.829" end="00:00:39.270" style="s2">about zombies and then you know Dawn of</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.899" end="00:00:41.160" style="s2">the Dead and Shaun of the Dead and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.270" end="00:00:42.840" style="s2">just got a proliferation and we actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.160" end="00:00:46.379" style="s2">track this and there&#39;s been sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.840" end="00:00:47.460" style="s2">exponential increase and all of this</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.379" end="00:00:49.260" style="s2">presentation but it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.460" end="00:00:50.670" style="s2">presentation people want to be they want</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.260" end="00:00:52.920" style="s2">to participate they want to be involved</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.670" end="00:00:54.840" style="s2">on it we have sort of zombie happenings</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.920" end="00:01:00.149" style="s2">people you know will suddenly you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.840" end="00:01:02.190" style="s2">dress up as zombies and and take on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.149" end="00:01:03.600" style="s2">the mannerisms of zombies there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.190" end="00:01:05.280" style="s2">know there was a discussion just in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.600" end="00:01:07.520" style="s2">Canadian Parliament about whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.280" end="00:01:10.470" style="s2">we should sort of use zombies to put to</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.520" end="00:01:12.299" style="s2">prepare ourselves for particular</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.470" end="00:01:14.159" style="s2">emergency situations now there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.299" end="00:01:17.549" style="s2">humorous aspect to this but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.159" end="00:01:20.040" style="s2">a deeply serious point and the deeply</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.549" end="00:01:22.740" style="s2">serious point is this culture is zeroing</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.040" end="00:01:25.890" style="s2">in on a mythology a mythic</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.740" end="00:01:27.900" style="s2">representation that is trying to give</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.890" end="00:01:30.270" style="s2">expression trying to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.900" end="00:01:33.060" style="s2">something that is going profoundly wrong</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.270" end="00:01:34.350" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to create an image we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.060" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">trying to create a narrative we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.350" end="00:01:41.280" style="s2">trying to give right speech and picture</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:44.040" style="s2">to something that is very pervasive very</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.280" end="00:01:47.009" style="s2">profound but very hard to articulate and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.040" end="00:01:48.600" style="s2">this is what Chris and I call the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.009" end="00:01:51.509" style="s2">growing meaning crisis because the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.600" end="00:01:54.329" style="s2">zombie represents a loss of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.509" end="00:01:57.170" style="s2">think about all the weird features about</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.329" end="00:02:00.750" style="s2">a zombie okay so first of all zombies</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.170" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">right have lost most of the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.750" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">meaning they can&#39;t speak anymore they</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:07.409" style="s2">can&#39;t generate meaning they&#39;ve dropped</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:10.470" style="s2">down to this very very basic level of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.409" end="00:02:13.530" style="s2">just wanting to eat and consume what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.470" end="00:02:15.330" style="s2">really odd is they they&#39;re it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.530" end="00:02:17.190" style="s2">kind of a hole because they want to eat</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.330" end="00:02:19.050" style="s2">the very organ that typically creates</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.190" end="00:02:21.840" style="s2">meaning they want to eat brains so they</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.050" end="00:02:24.830" style="s2">represent this fundamental loss of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.840" end="00:02:28.800" style="s2">meaning but the way they move they drift</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.830" end="00:02:31.470" style="s2">they drift around they represent again</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.800" end="00:02:33.300" style="s2">one of our pervasive metaphors for</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.470" end="00:02:36.660" style="s2">finding our lives meaningless that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.300" end="00:02:38.280" style="s2">adrift we&#39;re wandering aimlessly we</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.660" end="00:02:42.360" style="s2">don&#39;t know where we&#39;re going we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.280" end="00:02:46.519" style="s2">have a purpose notice also that zombies</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.360" end="00:02:49.680" style="s2">unlike you know Dracula or Frankenstein</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.519" end="00:02:52.980" style="s2">not only lacking in home but incapable</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.680" end="00:02:55.950" style="s2">of having a home and that again is a way</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.980" end="00:02:58.170" style="s2">in which people often express a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.950" end="00:03:02.069" style="s2">meaninglessness I have no home I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.170" end="00:03:04.230" style="s2">belong there&#39;s nowhere I should be but</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.069" end="00:03:06.380" style="s2">think about the weird other features</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.230" end="00:03:08.519" style="s2">about his arm zombies don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.380" end="00:03:10.800" style="s2">supernatural powers other than coming</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.519" end="00:03:13.890" style="s2">back from life coming back from the dead</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.800" end="00:03:16.410" style="s2">right they don&#39;t represent any important</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.890" end="00:03:18.510" style="s2">intervention from supernatural forces or</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.410" end="00:03:21.510" style="s2">divine agencies they&#39;re just this</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.510" end="00:03:24.120" style="s2">catastrophic failure that is being</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.510" end="00:03:29.280" style="s2">inflicted on the struggling remnants of</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.120" end="00:03:31.370" style="s2">humanity and they have this weird again</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.280" end="00:03:34.170" style="s2">twist in them the zombie is the only</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.370" end="00:03:36.959" style="s2">communal monster you don&#39;t get usually</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.170" end="00:03:39.959" style="s2">packs of vampires right you know but but</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.959" end="00:03:43.799" style="s2">the zombies hang out in herds it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.959" end="00:03:46.079" style="s2">they almost have community but they</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.799" end="00:03:48.030" style="s2">represent in fact that they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.079" end="00:03:50.609" style="s2">actually enter into community they long</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.030" end="00:03:52.829" style="s2">the way they they in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.609" end="00:03:56.370" style="s2">represent the longing we have to belong</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.829" end="00:03:57.900" style="s2">to each other they represent a loss of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.370" end="00:04:02.160" style="s2">how we belong to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.900" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">zombies unlike vampires or other right</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.160" end="00:04:08.070" style="s2">monsters zombies lack self-awareness by</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:11.549" style="s2">definition it&#39;s one of the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.070" end="00:04:12.750" style="s2">things a zombie in no way belongs to him</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.549" end="00:04:15.289" style="s2">or herself</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.750" end="00:04:17.760" style="s2">they&#39;ve lost this in a profound way and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.289" end="00:04:20.039" style="s2">even the narrative around the zombie</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.760" end="00:04:23.370" style="s2">points to the meaning crisis usually</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.039" end="00:04:26.650" style="s2">what&#39;s going on right in a supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.370" end="00:04:29.590" style="s2">story is there some answer or solution</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.650" end="00:04:32.169" style="s2">to the problem or if it&#39;s even if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.590" end="00:04:34.930" style="s2">tragedy like you know the tragedy of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.169" end="00:04:37.720" style="s2">Odysseus or something or the tragedy not</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.930" end="00:04:41.470" style="s2">the tragedy of Odysseus but the tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.720" end="00:04:44.919" style="s2">of Orpheus or the tragedy to piss wrecks</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.470" end="00:04:47.199" style="s2">right we know what&#39;s going on we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.919" end="00:04:50.100" style="s2">the answer but when we&#39;re watching a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.199" end="00:04:52.570" style="s2">zombie movie right that&#39;s missing</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.100" end="00:04:53.800" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no answer to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.570" end="00:04:56.830" style="s2">proper yeah you could kill some zombies</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.800" end="00:04:58.180" style="s2">but then what and we know that it you</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.830" end="00:04:59.590" style="s2">know there&#39;s an inevitable it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.180" end="00:05:01.090" style="s2">get worse and worse but we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.590" end="00:05:03.220" style="s2">any answer either as to what should be</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.090" end="00:05:06.250" style="s2">done I mean the answer is you know to</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.220" end="00:05:08.199" style="s2">create a meaningful civilization that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.250" end="00:05:10.210" style="s2">the actual response in a zombie</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.199" end="00:05:12.130" style="s2">situation but we don&#39;t know what that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.210" end="00:05:15.820" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what to do we&#39;re no better</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.130" end="00:05:17.860" style="s2">off and so it&#39;s not a tragedy it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.820" end="00:05:21.340" style="s2">like we have an insight into what the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.860" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">hero should be doing instead we sit</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.340" end="00:05:25.270" style="s2">there and we go through the zombie</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:27.039" style="s2">apocalypse but we&#39;re no better off than</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.270" end="00:05:29.410" style="s2">the people suffering in the film and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.039" end="00:05:32.110" style="s2">there&#39;s a weird sort of there&#39;s a weird</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.410" end="00:05:35.110" style="s2">sort of take in the genre that points to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.110" end="00:05:37.150" style="s2">the fact that you know there&#39;s this lack</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.110" end="00:05:39.580" style="s2">of self-awareness there&#39;s the the lack</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.150" end="00:05:41.919" style="s2">of our superiority because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.580" end="00:05:45.099" style="s2">weird things is it&#39;s one of the standard</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.919" end="00:05:47.770" style="s2">tropes of the zombie genre is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.099" end="00:05:51.220" style="s2">nobody uses the word zombie to describe</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.770" end="00:05:53.050" style="s2">the monsters in the movies now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.220" end="00:05:54.430" style="s2">some variation on it but in almost all</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.050" end="00:05:56.320" style="s2">the films you don&#39;t call thumbs up</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.430" end="00:05:57.610" style="s2">they&#39;re called the walkers or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.320" end="00:06:00.070" style="s2">called this or they&#39;re called that</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.610" end="00:06:03.520" style="s2">because that&#39;s a reflection of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.070" end="00:06:06.159" style="s2">that we right really don&#39;t have right</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.520" end="00:06:08.349" style="s2">any kind of participatory superiority</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.159" end="00:06:09.970" style="s2">over the poor folks that are in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.349" end="00:06:11.710" style="s2">zombie apocalypse yeah we know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.970" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">called the zombie they never say that</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.710" end="00:06:15.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s a way of saying like we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:19.080" style="s2">offer them anything we can&#39;t help them</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.760" end="00:06:22.570" style="s2">it&#39;s useless we have this profound</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.080" end="00:06:24.880" style="s2">symbol that&#39;s becoming pervasive and</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.570" end="00:06:28.270" style="s2">almost magnetic in its attractiveness</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.880" end="00:06:30.639" style="s2">for the fact that our culture is facing</p>
