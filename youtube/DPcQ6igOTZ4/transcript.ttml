<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>

<p begin="00:00:17.470" end="00:00:22.699" style="s2">so I guess I&#39;ll just kind of dive in I</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.840" end="00:00:23.869" style="s2">hope that we&#39;re not catching things at</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.699" end="00:00:26.770" style="s2">too much velocity because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.869" end="00:00:26.770" style="s2">certainly moving pretty quickly</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.220" end="00:00:32.180" style="s2">first order I think is to just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.840" end="00:00:34.070" style="s2">have a an awareness of the notion of how</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.180" end="00:00:35.960" style="s2">to be able to hold multiple difference</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.070" end="00:00:37.879" style="s2">in areas in your head so I&#39;ll be using</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.960" end="00:00:40.250" style="s2">language that has a bit of a Bayesian</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.879" end="00:00:41.780" style="s2">construct which is to say that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.250" end="00:00:44.690" style="s2">whole bunch of possibilities of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.780" end="00:00:46.250" style="s2">actually going on right now and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.690" end="00:00:48.250" style="s2">quite clear exactly what I mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.250" end="00:00:52.940" style="s2">is both it&#39;s not quite clear exactly</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.250" end="00:00:55.370" style="s2">what information is is accurate it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.940" end="00:00:56.809" style="s2">quite clear exactly how to understand of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.370" end="00:00:58.699" style="s2">the information that you have what it</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.809" end="00:01:00.739" style="s2">implies in terms of what the state of</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.699" end="00:01:03.559" style="s2">the larger system is now and what it</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.739" end="00:01:05.619" style="s2">like it will look like in the future so</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.559" end="00:01:08.659" style="s2">everything has to be held in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.619" end="00:01:12.909" style="s2">probability construct with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.659" end="00:01:12.909" style="s2">probability of certain events pardon me</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.220" end="00:01:19.270" style="s2">nobody Oh a lot more talking than my</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.060" end="00:01:22.000" style="s2">voice box is used to so the highest</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.270" end="00:01:25.299" style="s2">confidence model that I&#39;m operating with</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.000" end="00:01:27.909" style="s2">right now is one where where is about a</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.299" end="00:01:29.619" style="s2">forty percent confidence so I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.909" end="00:01:30.940" style="s2">anything above fifty percent but the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.619" end="00:01:33.039" style="s2">highest confidence model and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.940" end="00:01:36.789" style="s2">offering right now is the right now in</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.039" end="00:01:41.950" style="s2">the middle of a multi systemic cascade</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.789" end="00:01:43.570" style="s2">failure so what that means is if you if</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.950" end="00:01:46.810" style="s2">you imagine you&#39;ve got a bucket full of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.570" end="00:01:49.300" style="s2">water and you&#39;re carrying it and and if</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.810" end="00:01:51.240" style="s2">you walk in a certain speed the sloshing</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.300" end="00:01:55.330" style="s2">of the water doesn&#39;t come over the top</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.240" end="00:01:57.039" style="s2">but then you trip and so you lurch</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.330" end="00:01:59.470" style="s2">forward a little bit and so the sloshing</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.039" end="00:02:01.990" style="s2">comes out and that&#39;s that&#39;s a systemic</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.470" end="00:02:03.670" style="s2">feedback loop or your your the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.990" end="00:02:05.679" style="s2">environment you&#39;re walking through leads</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.670" end="00:02:07.840" style="s2">to a perturbation effect that&#39;s larger</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.679" end="00:02:09.340" style="s2">than the containment environment of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.840" end="00:02:11.350" style="s2">particular subdomain which happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.340" end="00:02:12.910" style="s2">the water in the bucket moves the water</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.350" end="00:02:15.100" style="s2">out of the bucket spillover</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.910" end="00:02:16.690" style="s2">okay now Matt imagine if instead of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.100" end="00:02:18.640" style="s2">being water in the bucket happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.690" end="00:02:20.350" style="s2">oil in the bucket and so when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.640" end="00:02:21.760" style="s2">spilled it didn&#39;t spill just water it</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.350" end="00:02:23.560" style="s2">spilled oil all over your feet in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.760" end="00:02:26.829" style="s2">ground you&#39;re walking on so now your</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.560" end="00:02:29.470" style="s2">next step step increases your next up is</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.829" end="00:02:31.030" style="s2">slippery and so the likelihood of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.470" end="00:02:33.310" style="s2">spilling oil goes up so now you have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.030" end="00:02:34.930" style="s2">systemic feedback loop where a cascade</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.310" end="00:02:38.320" style="s2">effects actually feed back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.930" end="00:02:39.519" style="s2">between different system dynamics so let</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.320" end="00:02:43.359" style="s2">me give you a more concrete example of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.519" end="00:02:46.510" style="s2">where we are right now trivially we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.359" end="00:02:48.850" style="s2">the example of this the the perturbation</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.510" end="00:02:52.420" style="s2">effective of the virus had a</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.850" end="00:02:55.000" style="s2">characteristic of uncertainty multiplied</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.420" end="00:02:59.060" style="s2">by a velocity that led to a really big</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.000" end="00:03:00.349" style="s2">impact so by uncertainty what I mean is</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.060" end="00:03:03.240" style="s2">this I think is legitimately true</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.349" end="00:03:04.590" style="s2">although there are certainly some</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.240" end="00:03:06.810" style="s2">intentionality questions we need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.590" end="00:03:09.870" style="s2">answer but as the information I what was</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.810" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">going on in China began to show up there</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.870" end="00:03:13.430" style="s2">really was a what the heck is this don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.760" end="00:03:15.900" style="s2">what&#39;s happening what is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.430" end="00:03:18.060" style="s2">epidemiology what&#39;s the impact what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.900" end="00:03:20.760" style="s2">the reality of it and because we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.060" end="00:03:23.040" style="s2">the notion of asymptomatic carriers we</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.760" end="00:03:26.340" style="s2">have a situation where even as early as</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.040" end="00:03:28.320" style="s2">beginning of March the reality of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.340" end="00:03:30.120" style="s2">degree of the number of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.320" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">infected and it&#39;s are not was just a big</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.120" end="00:03:35.370" style="s2">question mark but as we&#39;ve discovered</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:36.840" style="s2">the velocity of that is actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.370" end="00:03:38.760" style="s2">high I think right now I heard from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.840" end="00:03:40.620" style="s2">WHS there as they&#39;re me and modeling</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.760" end="00:03:42.780" style="s2">globally two point five day doubling</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.620" end="00:03:44.460" style="s2">rate which is actually higher then the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.780" end="00:03:45.720" style="s2">most models had seen but that&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.460" end="00:03:48.930" style="s2">course global so we&#39;re looking at places</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.720" end="00:03:50.160" style="s2">where reporting is not the data that</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.930" end="00:03:51.300" style="s2">we&#39;re getting on reporting is not very</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.160" end="00:03:52.470" style="s2">good because we know testing is really</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.300" end="00:03:53.700" style="s2">really poor so they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.470" end="00:03:55.770" style="s2">actually get a sense of what is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.700" end="00:03:58.200" style="s2">call it really working backwards from</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.770" end="00:04:00.660" style="s2">the data that we have so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.200" end="00:04:03.960" style="s2">uncertainty plus in plus velocity ended</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.660" end="00:04:05.520" style="s2">up hitting our systems in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.960" end="00:04:07.140" style="s2">different places and hitting them kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.520" end="00:04:09.060" style="s2">of hard so it&#39;s that bucket sloshing</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.140" end="00:04:12.140" style="s2">well one of the places where it sloshed</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.060" end="00:04:14.040" style="s2">over was a feedback loop between</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.140" end="00:04:15.870" style="s2">unstable or fragile I have political</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.040" end="00:04:19.830" style="s2">choice making systems at a combination</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.870" end="00:04:21.450" style="s2">of bureaucracies that have been sitting</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.830" end="00:04:22.980" style="s2">in a level of complacency for a long</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.450" end="00:04:24.690" style="s2">time so they just weren&#39;t ready willing</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.980" end="00:04:27.630" style="s2">or able to move out of complacency into</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.690" end="00:04:30.630" style="s2">choice making political situations where</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.630" end="00:04:33.390" style="s2">the amount of fighting between political</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.630" end="00:04:34.740" style="s2">groups infighting was very very high so</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.390" end="00:04:36.090" style="s2">they weren&#39;t willing to step back and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.740" end="00:04:39.260" style="s2">put their knives way to actually look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.090" end="00:04:41.550" style="s2">the problem over there and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.260" end="00:04:42.990" style="s2">technocratic operating models were the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.550" end="00:04:44.970" style="s2">way of making sense of the environment</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.990" end="00:04:47.340" style="s2">was locked into particular ways of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.970" end="00:04:48.690" style="s2">thinking that weren&#39;t able to slow down</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.340" end="00:04:51.210" style="s2">look around and say oh or was it</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.690" end="00:04:52.470" style="s2">thinking other things need to change so</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.210" end="00:04:54.540" style="s2">as a consequence when end up happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.470" end="00:04:57.270" style="s2">was is that the whole system instead of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.540" end="00:04:59.580" style="s2">actually shifting to a way of responding</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.270" end="00:05:03.000" style="s2">to the to the new environment actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.580" end="00:05:06.450" style="s2">started to lurch in a very dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.000" end="00:05:08.880" style="s2">coordinated way which is to say we ended</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.450" end="00:05:12.540" style="s2">up like say the UK they lurched into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.880" end="00:05:15.150" style="s2">direction of defaulting to political</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.540" end="00:05:16.770" style="s2">divisiveness originally so let&#39;s focus</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.150" end="00:05:19.770" style="s2">on a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.770" end="00:05:22.530" style="s2">the people inside whatever it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.770" end="00:05:25.139" style="s2">the Prime Minister&#39;s office originally</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.530" end="00:05:27.870" style="s2">the original default was don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.139" end="00:05:30.509" style="s2">the panic data focus on protecting the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.870" end="00:05:32.310" style="s2">economy that kind of it&#39;s thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.509" end="00:05:34.380" style="s2">and then by the way a counter-reaction</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.310" end="00:05:35.759" style="s2">inside the political structure which was</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.380" end="00:05:38.250" style="s2">activated a whole bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.759" end="00:05:39.509" style="s2">constructs that said oh no no lurks back</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.250" end="00:05:41.039" style="s2">in the other direction but now we</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.509" end="00:05:42.810" style="s2">actually have to do a big shelter in</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.039" end="00:05:44.850" style="s2">place and the reason why I&#39;m bringing up</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.810" end="00:05:46.800" style="s2">that that kind of choice making tissue</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.850" end="00:05:48.539" style="s2">is that&#39;s the communications layer</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.800" end="00:05:50.490" style="s2">between one domain and another domain so</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.539" end="00:05:52.470" style="s2">what happened was is that we had a big</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.490" end="00:05:55.199" style="s2">impact but instead of the effect of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.470" end="00:05:57.599" style="s2">impact actually being mitigated and not</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.199" end="00:05:59.370" style="s2">not increasing our choice making</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.599" end="00:06:01.410" style="s2">structures actually increase the impact</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.370" end="00:06:03.030" style="s2">of that on the financial system in the</p>

<p begin="00:06:04.590" end="00:06:08.820" style="s2">which then turned off the flow of the</p>

<p begin="00:06:19.530" end="00:06:24.330" style="s2">is the spreading of the locust plague</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.599" end="00:06:26.070" style="s2">entering into Africa so we now have a</p>

<p begin="00:07:09.570" end="00:07:12.810" style="s2">beginning to percolate out so we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:07:47.690" end="00:07:51.420" style="s2">another direction it&#39;s going to have is</p>

<p begin="00:07:55.410" end="00:07:59.430" style="s2">they go in the direction of exploding at</p>

<p begin="00:07:59.430" end="00:08:03.330" style="s2">metric that&#39;s starting to show up is</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.080" end="00:08:05.370" style="s2">crime so crime rates are beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.330" end="00:08:08.040" style="s2">build and crime rates are being build</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.370" end="00:08:09.540" style="s2">both in terms of of n number so number</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.040" end="00:08:11.430" style="s2">of crimes happen in particular urban</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.540" end="00:08:13.980" style="s2">environments are going up but also in</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.430" end="00:08:15.660" style="s2">intensity so property crimes are</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.980" end="00:08:17.430" style="s2">beginning to move into like just</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.660" end="00:08:19.980" style="s2">breaking into shops and stealing things</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.430" end="00:08:21.300" style="s2">not quite rampant looting but the story</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.980" end="00:08:23.250" style="s2">on the ground is that that&#39;s going up</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.300" end="00:08:25.290" style="s2">and violent crimes are also beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.250" end="00:08:26.580" style="s2">grow up like for example a big one to</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.290" end="00:08:28.830" style="s2">track if you&#39;re looking at data is</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.580" end="00:08:30.660" style="s2">something called home invasions so</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.830" end="00:08:32.760" style="s2">people actually just going straight into</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.660" end="00:08:34.290" style="s2">homes and holding everybody a gunpoint</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.760" end="00:08:35.910" style="s2">and doing whatever it is they choose to</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.290" end="00:08:39.180" style="s2">do at that moment which varies across</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.910" end="00:08:41.190" style="s2">the violent crime metric now if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.180" end="00:08:43.230" style="s2">notice the implications of that that has</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.190" end="00:08:45.690" style="s2">cascade effects in terms of people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.230" end="00:08:47.310" style="s2">willingness to sit to sit back and hope</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.690" end="00:08:49.860" style="s2">that the the existing political</p>

<p begin="00:08:49.860" end="00:08:53.790" style="s2">governance will take care of them at a</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.350" end="00:08:55.830" style="s2">certain point they stopped believing in</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.790" end="00:08:57.330" style="s2">that that means they move into an</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.830" end="00:09:00.030" style="s2">environment of trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.330" end="00:09:02.190" style="s2">they&#39;re going to do it&#39;s unlikely that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.030" end="00:09:05.040" style="s2">then choices being made by people on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.190" end="00:09:07.110" style="s2">ground in an uncoordinated driven larger</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.040" end="00:09:11.610" style="s2">by fear of personal safety are going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.110" end="00:09:12.930" style="s2">be very very good so so that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.610" end="00:09:16.530" style="s2">situational assessment at the high level</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.930" end="00:09:19.170" style="s2">is my highest confidence model which</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.530" end="00:09:20.820" style="s2">again is only about a 40% is that in</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.170" end="00:09:22.350" style="s2">somewhere between four and twelve weeks</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.820" end="00:09:24.030" style="s2">it was actually pretty large window</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.350" end="00:09:25.800" style="s2">given how much time how fast things are</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.030" end="00:09:29.700" style="s2">changing we&#39;ll be moving into a</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.800" end="00:09:31.200" style="s2">situation of very high liminality and</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.700" end="00:09:34.590" style="s2">what I mean by that if you guys remember</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.200" end="00:09:36.150" style="s2">I think in some other location sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.590" end="00:09:38.580" style="s2">can&#39;t say that I know if it happened in</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.150" end="00:09:40.080" style="s2">this group so the metaphor of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.580" end="00:09:41.520" style="s2">about system dynamics that I was using</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.080" end="00:09:43.860" style="s2">at some point was the notion of like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.520" end="00:09:48.240" style="s2">heavy ball rolling in a groove</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.860" end="00:09:51.150" style="s2">on like a glass table and the groove has</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.240" end="00:09:54.210" style="s2">a deep holds the ball so the balls can</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.150" end="00:09:56.400" style="s2">just follow the groove but as the groove</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.210" end="00:09:57.930" style="s2">gets shallower the possibility of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.400" end="00:09:59.670" style="s2">ball popping out of the groove room or</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.930" end="00:10:01.620" style="s2">shifting out and coming back in just</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.670" end="00:10:03.840" style="s2">goes up in a certain point if the groove</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.620" end="00:10:05.850" style="s2">is completely flat the future state of</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.840" end="00:10:07.740" style="s2">the ball now it&#39;s completely undecidable</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.850" end="00:10:09.210" style="s2">and any energy will cause it to move</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.740" end="00:10:11.520" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing that holds it in place</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.210" end="00:10:13.800" style="s2">and so when I say a point of high</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.520" end="00:10:16.320" style="s2">liminality what I mean is that the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.800" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">table becomes very flat and you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.320" end="00:10:20.610" style="s2">think of that about that at almost a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:24.030" style="s2">year personal as an individual neither</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.610" end="00:10:27.720" style="s2">what that means is something like your</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.030" end="00:10:29.280" style="s2">your psychological inertia the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.720" end="00:10:32.010" style="s2">which the choices that you make in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.280" end="00:10:33.960" style="s2">future are determined by the context</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.010" end="00:10:36.480" style="s2">that you&#39;ve been in the past drops to</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.960" end="00:10:39.090" style="s2">zero and that would be the maximum level</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.480" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">of flatness so that your future choice</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.090" end="00:10:48.450" style="s2">is undetermined by identity structures</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.680" end="00:10:50.040" style="s2">by psychological models by commitments</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.450" end="00:10:51.810" style="s2">that you&#39;ve made in the past and just</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.040" end="00:10:54.180" style="s2">kind of opens up to anything could</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.810" end="00:10:55.740" style="s2">happen now I doubt we&#39;ll look at that</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.180" end="00:10:59.430" style="s2">point because in the abstract that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.740" end="00:11:05.400" style="s2">extremely high degree of liminality but</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.430" end="00:11:07.110" style="s2">call it even 15% or 30% inertial has an</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.400" end="00:11:09.810" style="s2">enormous number of future states and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.110" end="00:11:12.600" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.810" end="00:11:15.030" style="s2">imagine all the planets orbiting the Sun</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.600" end="00:11:17.520" style="s2">so you know how a gravity well works and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.030" end="00:11:20.840" style="s2">that holds the planets in order imagine</p>

<p begin="00:11:20.970" end="00:11:24.420" style="s2">where do the planets go that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.950" end="00:11:27.570" style="s2">what my model says we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.420" end="00:11:28.680" style="s2">looking at in four to twelve weeks so</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.570" end="00:11:31.530" style="s2">the question is where does it go and</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.680" end="00:11:33.710" style="s2">that probably that the inquiry into that</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.530" end="00:11:37.230" style="s2">question I think is the is the the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.710" end="00:11:40.290" style="s2">relevant though by no means the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.230" end="00:11:42.450" style="s2">salient inquiry for anybody who&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.290" end="00:11:46.350" style="s2">to actually respond to the real depth of</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.450" end="00:11:49.430" style="s2">the crisis that we find ourselves in by</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.350" end="00:11:51.840" style="s2">my lights there&#39;s effectively three</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.430" end="00:11:56.360" style="s2">kinds of directions that it goes from</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.840" end="00:12:01.610" style="s2">there two of which are bad broad-brush</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.360" end="00:12:04.290" style="s2">one is vectoring in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.610" end="00:12:06.990" style="s2">atomization balkanization and</p>

<p begin="00:12:25.560" end="00:12:29.700" style="s2">so that&#39;s a case study</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.490" end="00:12:32.280" style="s2">watch the EU Serbia exited the EU and</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.700" end="00:12:33.810" style="s2">everything but named Hungary just exited</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.280" end="00:12:35.520" style="s2">the EU and everything but name and</p>

<p begin="00:12:38.160" end="00:12:40.860" style="s2">and by the way it&#39;s not always clear</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.450" end="00:12:42.270" style="s2">exactly what the in-group is in</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.860" end="00:12:44.940" style="s2">Hungary&#39;s case maybe it&#39;s hungry maybe</p>

<p begin="00:12:44.940" end="00:12:50.160" style="s2">not quite clear the opposite direction</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.580" end="00:12:52.140" style="s2">of that vector is the authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.160" end="00:12:55.350" style="s2">direction instead of two degree to which</p>

<p begin="00:12:55.350" end="00:13:01.560" style="s2">of breaking up solidify and increase</p>

<p begin="00:13:05.010" end="00:13:09.200" style="s2">these are mutually reinforcing meaning</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.140" end="00:13:12.330" style="s2">that as the energy of balkanization</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.200" end="00:13:14.010" style="s2">increases the pressure on top-down</p>

<p begin="00:13:14.010" end="00:13:17.970" style="s2">authoritarian control increases and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.170" end="00:13:19.350" style="s2">basically these two forces co-evolved</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.970" end="00:13:21.090" style="s2">until one of the other takes over</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.350" end="00:13:22.710" style="s2">alright so if the balkanization forces</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.090" end="00:13:24.690" style="s2">win in a certain domain the top-down</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.710" end="00:13:26.460" style="s2">system just breaks apart and then it</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.690" end="00:13:27.960" style="s2">becomes obligate then everybody all the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.460" end="00:13:29.550" style="s2">energy has to move here because you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.960" end="00:13:32.190" style="s2">no longer rely on top-down structures</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.550" end="00:13:34.070" style="s2">and vice-versa so both of those are</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.190" end="00:13:35.420" style="s2">natural forks</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.070" end="00:13:37.640" style="s2">this kind of environment by the way just</p>

<p begin="00:13:37.640" end="00:13:42.170" style="s2">and you&#39;ll see that that tends to be how</p>

<p begin="00:13:42.170" end="00:13:47.690" style="s2">something that goes up the Third Way is</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.180" end="00:13:49.160" style="s2">some capacity to utilize the possibility</p>

<p begin="00:14:30.050" end="00:14:37.190" style="s2">anything so I kind of wanted you to keep</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.140" end="00:14:38.990" style="s2">on going so let&#39;s let&#39;s turn it to Q&amp;A</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.190" end="00:14:41.090" style="s2">then if you have a question for Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.990" end="00:14:44.870" style="s2">right in the chat box if you want me to</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.090" end="00:14:46.460" style="s2">read on your behalf let you know I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.870" end="00:14:48.590" style="s2">curious how you are personally</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.460" end="00:14:50.030" style="s2">sense-making in this environment Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.590" end="00:14:51.440" style="s2">like you you come with that number forty</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.030" end="00:14:53.480" style="s2">percent how did you come to that number</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.440" end="00:14:54.740" style="s2">and how do you see other entities since</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.480" end="00:15:00.170" style="s2">making in this environment like the glue</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.740" end="00:15:04.130" style="s2">Church or whatnot ah great so the first</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.170" end="00:15:05.720" style="s2">answer has to do with yeah I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.130" end="00:15:07.310" style="s2">actually just kind of run full speed</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.720" end="00:15:09.050" style="s2">here so I&#39;m gonna be saying things that</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.310" end="00:15:10.460" style="s2">it may be difficult to track because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.050" end="00:15:12.350" style="s2">using a whole lot of metaphors to</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.460" end="00:15:16.670" style="s2">describe things that are not easy to to</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.350" end="00:15:18.620" style="s2">describe so since making in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.670" end="00:15:20.990" style="s2">contemporary environment involves taking</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.620" end="00:15:22.250" style="s2">any in the past you may have seen me use</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.990" end="00:15:25.430" style="s2">refer to something that&#39;s going to quote</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.250" end="00:15:28.850" style="s2">my sense maker and what I mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.430" end="00:15:32.360" style="s2">is a graph and a set a set of</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.850" end="00:15:36.770" style="s2">relationships that that graph is</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.360" end="00:15:39.230" style="s2">composed of two kinds of things one is</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.770" end="00:15:41.990" style="s2">that the edge or the bond on that graph</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.230" end="00:15:45.300" style="s2">and the second is the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.990" end="00:15:47.760" style="s2">epistemological perspective</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.300" end="00:15:50.130" style="s2">that is connected through that note so</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.760" end="00:15:52.080" style="s2">we&#39;ll use Daniel Smackdown burger as an</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.130" end="00:15:55.230" style="s2">example Daniels attached to my sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.080" end="00:15:58.440" style="s2">maker that bond is strong I know Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.230" end="00:16:00.300" style="s2">very well I know I trust his perspective</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.440" end="00:16:02.100" style="s2">I trust his good faith I have a deep</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.300" end="00:16:04.440" style="s2">understanding of his methodologies and</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.100" end="00:16:06.240" style="s2">the where he will have blind spots and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.440" end="00:16:08.100" style="s2">where he&#39;ll have strong input so you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.240" end="00:16:10.170" style="s2">think of that as a you know a nice big</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.100" end="00:16:13.079" style="s2">thick pipe made out of carbon fiber a</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.170" end="00:16:15.480" style="s2">lot of stuff can flow through that and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.079" end="00:16:17.610" style="s2">know that he if I double-click on him he</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.480" end="00:16:19.589" style="s2">has a really big graph there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.610" end="00:16:20.940" style="s2">capacity on the other side of that node</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.589" end="00:16:23.220" style="s2">that capacity in terms of both</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.940" end="00:16:25.709" style="s2">relationality he&#39;s connected to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.220" end="00:16:28.170" style="s2">surface area in perspective that can</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.709" end="00:16:29.640" style="s2">receive a lot of stuff and he has a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.170" end="00:16:30.810" style="s2">rich and mature epistemology which</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.640" end="00:16:32.010" style="s2">allows him to make sense of his</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.810" end="00:16:34.050" style="s2">environment effectively right so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.010" end="00:16:37.430" style="s2">got a sense maker Daniel connected to me</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.050" end="00:16:37.430" style="s2">which is my sense maker</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.520" end="00:16:42.410" style="s2">that&#39;s it right iterate relationships</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.130" end="00:16:44.029" style="s2">combined with sense-making capacities</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.410" end="00:16:45.290" style="s2">that have high degrees of discernment</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.029" end="00:16:46.370" style="s2">you know what you&#39;re dealing with so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.290" end="00:16:48.470" style="s2">can actually convert that into</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.370" end="00:16:50.839" style="s2">higher-quality sense and recursion right</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.470" end="00:16:52.910" style="s2">so it&#39;s not one-way trip I&#39;m connected</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.839" end="00:16:55.580" style="s2">Daniel Daniel is connected to me right</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.910" end="00:16:57.500" style="s2">I provide input to him from the totality</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.580" end="00:16:58.190" style="s2">of my sense inator maker modulated</p>

<p begin="00:16:58.190" end="00:17:01.700" style="s2">he has a way of understanding what that</p>

<p begin="00:17:01.700" end="00:17:04.819" style="s2">likely to be coming through me that&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.200" end="00:17:06.980" style="s2">right that&#39;s good sense and what&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.819" end="00:17:08.630" style="s2">sense he puts that into his sense making</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.980" end="00:17:10.189" style="s2">he percolates that back out through his</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.630" end="00:17:11.900" style="s2">relationality into the set of</p>

<p begin="00:17:11.900" end="00:17:15.260" style="s2">you get a feedback back and forth but it</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.760" end="00:17:17.209" style="s2">flows back and forth the whole system in</p>

<p begin="00:17:53.570" end="00:17:56.450" style="s2">right now one end because I kind of know</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.950" end="00:17:57.620" style="s2">all of you but certainly with three or</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.450" end="00:17:58.760" style="s2">four ends in terms of actual</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.620" end="00:18:00.470" style="s2">relationships they have real energy</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.760" end="00:18:01.640" style="s2">flowing through them so the challenge is</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.470" end="00:18:03.880" style="s2">to figure out how to actually upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.640" end="00:18:05.900" style="s2">the fabric of that sense-making graph</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.880" end="00:18:06.860" style="s2">find the relationship that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.900" end="00:18:09.230" style="s2">working with that have the highest</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.860" end="00:18:11.809" style="s2">strongest bonds strengthen them in terms</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.230" end="00:18:13.309" style="s2">of both the quality of trust and it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.809" end="00:18:15.050" style="s2">just to say intimacy and vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.309" end="00:18:17.900" style="s2">of honesty and integrity flowing across</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.050" end="00:18:20.090" style="s2">that bond and the discernment real</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.900" end="00:18:21.710" style="s2">serious hey I noticed it in the past</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.090" end="00:18:23.150" style="s2">you&#39;ve said things that had a high</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.710" end="00:18:24.950" style="s2">confidence but sometimes weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.150" end="00:18:26.630" style="s2">actually true I&#39;m gonna mean I need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.950" end="00:18:27.800" style="s2">call you on that and ask harder harder</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.630" end="00:18:29.360" style="s2">questions so that the next time</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.800" end="00:18:31.550" style="s2">something comes through you&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.360" end="00:18:32.510" style="s2">better job at your end and by the way do</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.550" end="00:18:33.950" style="s2">the same thing for me because we</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.510" end="00:18:35.420" style="s2">actually got to really get better at</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.950" end="00:18:36.890" style="s2">knowing what we know as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.420" end="00:18:39.309" style="s2">drawing inferences based upon</p>

<p begin="00:18:44.540" end="00:18:48.620" style="s2">current sense maker has been upgraded by</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.220" end="00:18:50.460" style="s2">probably a factor of 50 over the past</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.620" end="00:18:52.080" style="s2">eight weeks</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.460" end="00:18:54.180" style="s2">because a whole bunch of people are just</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.080" end="00:18:55.590" style="s2">being willing to make risks and jump out</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.180" end="00:18:56.940" style="s2">of context where they weren&#39;t willing to</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.590" end="00:18:58.260" style="s2">share information where they are willing</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.940" end="00:19:00.330" style="s2">to share information a lot of it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.260" end="00:19:01.800" style="s2">first person or second person so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.330" end="00:19:03.510" style="s2">direct hands-on with things that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.800" end="00:19:05.730" style="s2">actually happening so you can get much</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.510" end="00:19:07.310" style="s2">higher octane conversations the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.730" end="00:19:09.840" style="s2">one is that graphs are coming together</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.310" end="00:19:13.070" style="s2">focusing on centers of gravity so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.840" end="00:19:17.130" style="s2">say for example mr. score like a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.070" end="00:19:18.720" style="s2">prosaic technology like detection what</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.130" end="00:19:22.350" style="s2">are the underlying technologies for</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.720" end="00:19:24.510" style="s2">detecting the presence of virus well</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.350" end="00:19:26.310" style="s2">ordinarily we actually do frankly a</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.510" end="00:19:28.380" style="s2">terrible job at that because it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.310" end="00:19:29.610" style="s2">complex question but what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.380" end="00:19:31.260" style="s2">now is there&#39;s actually a center of</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.610" end="00:19:33.390" style="s2">gravity on that what I mean is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.260" end="00:19:34.590" style="s2">place where there is a domain what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.390" end="00:19:36.810" style="s2">answer to the notion of detection</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.590" end="00:19:37.860" style="s2">there&#39;s a collection of people who could</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.810" end="00:19:39.510" style="s2">read who know what the they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.860" end="00:19:41.310" style="s2">talking about who are now gathering</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.510" end="00:19:43.980" style="s2">together and they&#39;re increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.310" end="00:19:46.410" style="s2">effectively sharing their information in</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.980" end="00:19:48.360" style="s2">the fashion that has one agenda which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.410" end="00:19:49.440" style="s2">to get to the truth now by the way that</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.360" end="00:19:50.790" style="s2">ain&#39;t the whole story there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.440" end="00:19:52.890" style="s2">folks of multiple agendas that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.790" end="00:19:55.050" style="s2">critics noise in the environment but</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.890" end="00:19:56.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a fusion cell a gathering</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.050" end="00:19:58.020" style="s2">together of different capacities and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.640" end="00:20:00.060" style="s2">different perspectives that are unifying</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.020" end="00:20:01.740" style="s2">any way of making sense of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.060" end="00:20:04.110" style="s2">environment and as that becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.740" end="00:20:06.450" style="s2">sensible and if you connect to that node</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.110" end="00:20:09.330" style="s2">you&#39;re no actually getting very high</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.450" end="00:20:11.790" style="s2">quality reality on what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.330" end="00:20:13.650" style="s2">possibility in that domain or stand you</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.790" end="00:20:15.930" style="s2">can propagate out to other environments</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.650" end="00:20:18.660" style="s2">so that evolution of fusion cells in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.930" end="00:20:22.680" style="s2">larger environment which gives higher</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.660" end="00:20:25.380" style="s2">quality reality modeling is another big</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.680" end="00:20:28.440" style="s2">piece of the story for me but the short</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.380" end="00:20:32.040" style="s2">answer is I&#39;m increasing my the quality</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.440" end="00:20:35.280" style="s2">of my trust I&#39;m adding a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.040" end="00:20:37.380" style="s2">new people in chunks to the network and</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.280" end="00:20:39.810" style="s2">a lot of people are doing this and</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.380" end="00:20:46.800" style="s2">dropping previous agendas and just</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.810" end="00:20:48.930" style="s2">focusing on what is real all right my</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.800" end="00:20:50.250" style="s2">next question no one was actually oh I</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.930" end="00:20:52.110" style="s2">apologize you want me to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.250" end="00:20:54.000" style="s2">blue church here or not yeah yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.110" end="00:20:56.190" style="s2">would be good the blue church right now</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.000" end="00:20:57.420" style="s2">is in the process of having two things</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.190" end="00:20:58.650" style="s2">happen simultaneously and this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.420" end="00:21:00.150" style="s2">actually this happens all this is how it</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.650" end="00:21:02.700" style="s2">always happens</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.150" end="00:21:05.160" style="s2">so the blue church has a a Cronos</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.700" end="00:21:07.140" style="s2">structure which is to say a formal</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.160" end="00:21:09.330" style="s2">hierarchy hierarchy based upon</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.140" end="00:21:12.150" style="s2">bureaucratic commitments that is weak</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.330" end="00:21:14.160" style="s2">bonds I it has a lot of inertia that</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.150" end="00:21:15.540" style="s2">under ordinary circumstances people talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.160" end="00:21:16.800" style="s2">to the guy who they&#39;re supposed to talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.540" end="00:21:19.680" style="s2">to using the formal structures they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.800" end="00:21:22.800" style="s2">supposed to use but they&#39;re weak because</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.680" end="00:21:24.300" style="s2">they nobody actually gives a right</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.800" end="00:21:26.340" style="s2">at the end of the day they don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.300" end="00:21:28.020" style="s2">don&#39;t really care you only care because</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.340" end="00:21:29.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing you do doesn&#39;t get you</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.020" end="00:21:31.470" style="s2">fire to get you out you know it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.880" end="00:21:33.990" style="s2">of like covalent bonds instead of ionic</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.470" end="00:21:35.130" style="s2">bond but it&#39;s got a lot of inertia so</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.990" end="00:21:37.890" style="s2">what&#39;s happening right now is the blue</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.130" end="00:21:39.210" style="s2">church is beginning to notice which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.890" end="00:21:41.250" style="s2">to say the individual human beings who</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.210" end="00:21:43.020" style="s2">actually make that up that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.250" end="00:21:45.450" style="s2">structures that they are operating in</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.020" end="00:21:47.370" style="s2">can&#39;t respond to the circumstance that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.450" end="00:21:49.200" style="s2">happening and so vertical one and</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.370" end="00:21:49.950" style="s2">vertical two clearly are getting blinds</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.200" end="00:21:52.110" style="s2">that they&#39;re getting blindsided</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.950" end="00:21:53.640" style="s2">constantly and they notice they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.110" end="00:21:55.380" style="s2">actually have the conversation they need</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.640" end="00:21:56.990" style="s2">to have across so what&#39;s happening is</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.380" end="00:22:00.660" style="s2">people in those environments are just</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.990" end="00:22:02.580" style="s2">dropping the formality and just jumping</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.660" end="00:22:04.940" style="s2">out and connecting and that&#39;s creating a</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.580" end="00:22:07.650" style="s2">mesh network inside the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.940" end="00:22:10.020" style="s2">transverse to existing hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.650" end="00:22:12.060" style="s2">transverse to existing processes by</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.020" end="00:22:13.020" style="s2">individuals for basically saying it</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.060" end="00:22:14.790" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna actually try to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.020" end="00:22:17.550" style="s2">to do the right thing and begin to form</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.790" end="00:22:19.110" style="s2">a cross across - I should say by the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.550" end="00:22:20.580" style="s2">that&#39;s how it always happens that can we</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.110" end="00:22:22.080" style="s2">actually look at these kinds of dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.580" end="00:22:24.120" style="s2">and any structure he&#39;s about formal</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.080" end="00:22:26.490" style="s2">vertical structures to jump into crisis</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.120" end="00:22:28.890" style="s2">what always happens is the individual</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.490" end="00:22:30.900" style="s2">nodes pop out of the formal structure</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.890" end="00:22:32.460" style="s2">look around for anybody else who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.900" end="00:22:34.260" style="s2">actually showing up as effective and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.460" end="00:22:36.510" style="s2">begin to reweave into some kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.260" end="00:22:37.740" style="s2">mesh which then actually supports the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.510" end="00:22:39.480" style="s2">formal structure is now you&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.740" end="00:22:40.770" style="s2">got information is flown that&#39;s relevant</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.480" end="00:22:42.840" style="s2">and the formal structure can actually be</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.770" end="00:22:44.640" style="s2">directed towards more effective choices</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.840" end="00:22:47.720" style="s2">so both of those moves are happening</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.640" end="00:22:47.720" style="s2">simultaneously in the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.960" end="00:22:54.510" style="s2">okay so uh no can you unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.150" end="00:22:56.160" style="s2">and ask her to your question sure so</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.510" end="00:22:58.890" style="s2">speaking you&#39;ve already spoken a little</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.160" end="00:23:00.900" style="s2">bit more the third option and somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.890" end="00:23:03.210" style="s2">stern to as what turned out to be my</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.900" end="00:23:05.490" style="s2">question so then I could be given the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.210" end="00:23:07.590" style="s2">four to twelve week time line what</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.490" end="00:23:09.630" style="s2">challenge is what kinds of challenges do</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.590" end="00:23:13.049" style="s2">you see that will be the ones that will</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.630" end="00:23:14.790" style="s2">go here for people who are already kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.049" end="00:23:18.390" style="s2">of working within this the paradigm of</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.790" end="00:23:20.730" style="s2">this third option like one one thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.390" end="00:23:22.710" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed was the masks for all and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.730" end="00:23:25.530" style="s2">how that kind of developed over the last</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.710" end="00:23:29.429" style="s2">month and it changed what was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.530" end="00:23:32.160" style="s2">the top-down approach and I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.429" end="00:23:33.960" style="s2">if that gives us any hints and generally</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.160" end="00:23:44.059" style="s2">what you&#39;ve been seeing and what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.960" end="00:23:44.059" style="s2">things to expect okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.450" end="00:23:50.750" style="s2">the way it the way it looks to me is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.610" end="00:23:50.750" style="s2">little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.090" end="00:23:58.630" style="s2">doing like a compression wave at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.940" end="00:24:04.480" style="s2">edge of salience that generates a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.630" end="00:24:07.510" style="s2">energy and so for masks for all masks</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.480" end="00:24:11.140" style="s2">the the fact of that there was a need</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.510" end="00:24:13.990" style="s2">for and an absence of masks was a simple</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.140" end="00:24:17.289" style="s2">simple thing it landed people like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.990" end="00:24:20.350" style="s2">get that and my energy of desiring to</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.289" end="00:24:22.960" style="s2">help or act could land on something that</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.350" end="00:24:24.070" style="s2">was a was a real problem and a simple</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.960" end="00:24:25.480" style="s2">problem in the sense that you could make</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.070" end="00:24:27.159" style="s2">sense of it it wasn&#39;t hard to understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.480" end="00:24:29.049" style="s2">what the a mask was and why it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.159" end="00:24:30.760" style="s2">important so everybody tried to figure</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.049" end="00:24:31.990" style="s2">out how to address it using their local</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.760" end="00:24:35.080" style="s2">knowledge and capacity so you got this</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.990" end="00:24:36.309" style="s2">huge spinning up of energy and that huge</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.080" end="00:24:38.169" style="s2">spinning up of energy was like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.309" end="00:24:40.029" style="s2">compression wave kind of pop people</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.169" end="00:24:42.130" style="s2">where they were you started seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.029" end="00:24:43.179" style="s2">creation of new bonds people getting up</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.130" end="00:24:44.649" style="s2">and saying hey how do I help and they</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.179" end="00:24:45.789" style="s2">grabbed their friends they found</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.649" end="00:24:47.679" style="s2">connections that they didn&#39;t know they</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.789" end="00:24:48.820" style="s2">had their network they began to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.679" end="00:24:50.980" style="s2">Search Search Search Search Search</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.820" end="00:24:52.539" style="s2">looking up figuring out changing</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.980" end="00:24:55.870" style="s2">operating method up methodologies</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.539" end="00:24:57.700" style="s2">alright now in many cases that actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.870" end="00:24:59.200" style="s2">added a lot of chaos to the situation</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.700" end="00:25:00.850" style="s2">you know you&#39;ve got to start getting you</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.200" end="00:25:01.779" style="s2">know people pulling masks out of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.850" end="00:25:04.510" style="s2">environments that would&#39;ve been better</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.779" end="00:25:06.010" style="s2">handled by a different path or peeing</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.510" end="00:25:07.840" style="s2">each other so rapidly that people got</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.010" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">overwhelmed with with sort of requests</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.840" end="00:25:11.200" style="s2">for help or opportunities to help etc</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:12.520" style="s2">etcetera right so many kids is actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.200" end="00:25:15.340" style="s2">created a lot of chaos the environment</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.520" end="00:25:18.039" style="s2">but two good things came out one good</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.340" end="00:25:19.630" style="s2">thing was it actually did in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.039" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">it&#39;s called almost instantaneously it</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.630" end="00:25:24.880" style="s2">were creative like two weeks an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:27.490" style="s2">amount of capacity from an unprecedent</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.880" end="00:25:29.890" style="s2">number of different modalities showed up</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.490" end="00:25:32.169" style="s2">to began to actually solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.890" end="00:25:34.690" style="s2">like so it&#39;s almost like capillary</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.169" end="00:25:36.490" style="s2">action and we had one big artery plug</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.690" end="00:25:38.679" style="s2">plugged into the tissue and suddenly ten</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.490" end="00:25:41.500" style="s2">thousand capillaries just went and</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.679" end="00:25:43.840" style="s2">every cell about connected and from my</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.500" end="00:25:45.669" style="s2">perspective right now the masked problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.840" end="00:25:47.320" style="s2">is more or less a solved problem which</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.669" end="00:25:49.570" style="s2">is to say we aren&#39;t there yet but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.320" end="00:25:53.200" style="s2">the momentum is now moving downhill and</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.570" end="00:25:56.049" style="s2">in ten days or so most mask problems</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.200" end="00:26:00.070" style="s2">will actually be solved okay that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.049" end="00:26:05.409" style="s2">good thing two more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.070" end="00:26:07.539" style="s2">was that the invariant of that action so</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.409" end="00:26:09.340" style="s2">what the did we just do what</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.539" end="00:26:11.470" style="s2">happened just then what did it look like</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.340" end="00:26:14.320" style="s2">for us to suddenly jump up out of our</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.470" end="00:26:16.210" style="s2">inertial frames into how do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.320" end="00:26:19.450" style="s2">figure things out in this entirely new</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.210" end="00:26:21.759" style="s2">modality that also upgraded like a</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.450" end="00:26:23.950" style="s2">consciousness-raising event of oh wait</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.759" end="00:26:25.539" style="s2">hold on if I behave in this way and</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.950" end="00:26:27.700" style="s2">here&#39;s the things that didn&#39;t work and</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.539" end="00:26:29.440" style="s2">here&#39;s the things that did work oh wait</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.700" end="00:26:31.299" style="s2"> here comes another compression wave</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.440" end="00:26:32.619" style="s2">with a different name you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.299" end="00:26:34.899" style="s2">the next compression wave was called</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.619" end="00:26:36.369" style="s2">ventilators but the next compression</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.899" end="00:26:39.519" style="s2">wave was called something else right as</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.369" end="00:26:42.269" style="s2">the systemic crisis as this sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.519" end="00:26:45.849" style="s2">scary story I just unfurled rolls out</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.269" end="00:26:48.970" style="s2">new events emerged they continued to put</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.849" end="00:26:51.759" style="s2">pressure on where we are and create</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.970" end="00:26:54.700" style="s2">energy to drive people to put their own</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.759" end="00:26:56.859" style="s2">to take risks and to challenge</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.700" end="00:26:59.799" style="s2">themselves to develop to grow into this</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.859" end="00:27:01.570" style="s2">new possibility and and that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.799" end="00:27:03.970" style="s2">right it&#39;s like we&#39;re surfing the wave</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.570" end="00:27:05.529" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to find where&#39;s the pocket</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.970" end="00:27:07.029" style="s2">of the energy of that wave and just</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.529" end="00:27:09.309" style="s2">stick with it as hard as possible</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.029" end="00:27:11.080" style="s2">recognizing that the situation is</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.309" end="00:27:13.720" style="s2">actually changing so by the time you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.080" end="00:27:14.799" style="s2">actually done the concrete thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.720" end="00:27:17.259" style="s2">worth as many people right now who</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.799" end="00:27:19.960" style="s2">actually like to say makers who tried to</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.259" end="00:27:22.179" style="s2">spin up ways of printing face shields a</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.960" end="00:27:23.769" style="s2">lot of those efforts just were waste of</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.179" end="00:27:25.269" style="s2">time it turns out that they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.769" end="00:27:26.470" style="s2">figure it out and or by the time they</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.269" end="00:27:28.840" style="s2">came to a solution a better solution</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.470" end="00:27:31.720" style="s2">already been created and that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.840" end="00:27:33.399" style="s2">because the underlying meta structure of</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.720" end="00:27:35.649" style="s2">how they went about responding now</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.399" end="00:27:37.299" style="s2">becomes core infrastructure for them and</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.649" end="00:27:39.789" style="s2">everyone else that&#39;s how you respond to</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.299" end="00:27:41.019" style="s2">these kinds of crises in general so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.789" end="00:27:45.090" style="s2">the next set of sleep I tell you what</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.019" end="00:27:46.440" style="s2">right now I&#39;m telling you in two months</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.090" end="00:27:47.700" style="s2">we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.440" end="00:27:50.340" style="s2">to figure out how to feed a</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.700" end="00:27:52.320" style="s2">billion people we don&#39;t have a clue how</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.340" end="00:27:53.549" style="s2">to do that so getting ahead of the curve</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.320" end="00:27:55.529" style="s2">and thinking okay how do we take the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.549" end="00:27:58.169" style="s2">learnings we just learned on how to</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.529" end="00:28:00.899" style="s2">produce a bunch of masks how do we apply</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.169" end="00:28:02.909" style="s2">that globally to figuring out how to get</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.899" end="00:28:04.379" style="s2">food into places that right now we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.909" end="00:28:07.740" style="s2">even have high-quality connections with</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.379" end="00:28:08.970" style="s2">across socio technological dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.740" end="00:28:10.110" style="s2">where maybe we even have political and</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.970" end="00:28:12.480" style="s2">ambitions about how we&#39;re gonna go about</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.110" end="00:28:14.129" style="s2">doing existing NGOs are going to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.480" end="00:28:15.179" style="s2">some degree of efficacy but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.129" end="00:28:16.470" style="s2">gonna be able to solve the problem so</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.179" end="00:28:19.649" style="s2">that&#39;s an example of something which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.470" end="00:28:21.570" style="s2">a event that is coming that if we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.649" end="00:28:23.909" style="s2">start looking at how we solving problems</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.570" end="00:28:26.250" style="s2">now as the events happen now it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.909" end="00:28:28.529" style="s2">that wave is passing through our social</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.250" end="00:28:30.090" style="s2">environment every time it passes through</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.529" end="00:28:31.919" style="s2">it leads behind it for those who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.090" end="00:28:34.769" style="s2">paying the closest attention more</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.919" end="00:28:37.350" style="s2">structure of the new form and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.769" end="00:28:39.960" style="s2">that that meeting of the new challenges</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.350" end="00:28:41.460" style="s2">with new possibilities actualized as the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.960" end="00:28:43.559" style="s2">wave of energy actually passes through</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.460" end="00:28:46.500" style="s2">is the key element that&#39;s that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.559" end="00:28:52.139" style="s2">the key the the biggest possibility and</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.500" end="00:28:59.789" style="s2">challenge all right um Nicholas you had</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.139" end="00:29:01.590" style="s2">a question yeah hi Jordan so when so you</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.789" end="00:29:04.080" style="s2">were talking about the first vector</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.590" end="00:29:07.409" style="s2">atomization and then and then the second</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.080" end="00:29:09.330" style="s2">one you know it&#39;s more governance and</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.409" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">then the Third Way which is the one we</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.330" end="00:29:14.580" style="s2">all hope for but then you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:18.629" style="s2">sense making and and getting to truth</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.580" end="00:29:20.129" style="s2">the relationship right and we&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.629" end="00:29:22.710" style="s2">only people doing that right that</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.129" end="00:29:25.409" style="s2">they&#39;re doing that there as well in</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.710" end="00:29:27.509" style="s2">these two vectors so once they get a</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.409" end="00:29:30.509" style="s2">better sense of the truth couldn&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.509" end="00:29:32.490" style="s2">abuse it to to go into you know their</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.509" end="00:29:37.110" style="s2">their directions and is there a way of I</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.490" end="00:29:39.720" style="s2">guess it&#39;s like it&#39;s not inevitable that</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.110" end="00:29:44.279" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna go our Third Way right so</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.720" end="00:29:46.409" style="s2">how sorry I&#39;m sorry if I gave that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.279" end="00:29:48.120" style="s2">impression I would say that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.409" end="00:29:50.789" style="s2">really lucky chance if it pulls out that</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.120" end="00:29:52.139" style="s2">way it&#39;s exactly the opposite of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.789" end="00:29:53.610" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s definitely not inevitable I</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.139" end="00:29:56.460" style="s2">would say right now the likelihood of</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.610" end="00:29:58.259" style="s2">that is about 0.1% exactly so I guess my</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.460" end="00:30:00.000" style="s2">question is okay what what can we do now</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.259" end="00:30:01.350" style="s2">to really get that going</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.000" end="00:30:03.570" style="s2">right I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s like an emergency</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.350" end="00:30:05.700" style="s2">almost so I guess I wanted more concrete</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.570" end="00:30:07.590" style="s2">advice I was just on a call with with</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.700" end="00:30:09.960" style="s2">Jim talking about this right and and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.590" end="00:30:11.820" style="s2">then my mind goes on okay what is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.960" end="00:30:15.090" style="s2">practicality in all this like what can</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.820" end="00:30:18.360" style="s2">we actually do because yeah that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.090" end="00:30:22.770" style="s2">question yeah there&#39;s that a shared</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.360" end="00:30:25.410" style="s2">question you cannot if it&#39;s thumbs up</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.770" end="00:30:27.750" style="s2">because it&#39;s the it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.410" end="00:30:29.700" style="s2">hard question so let&#39;s see so when I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.750" end="00:30:31.650" style="s2">just talking about I was I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.700" end="00:30:33.450" style="s2">describe the answer to your question so</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.650" end="00:30:35.700" style="s2">if you kind of rewind back a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.450" end="00:30:40.680" style="s2">and listen to what I said that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.700" end="00:30:42.960" style="s2">answer so it&#39;s something like ah so</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.680" end="00:30:44.460" style="s2">think about trying to like imagine it</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.960" end="00:30:47.010" style="s2">like when those video games where</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.460" end="00:30:49.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch like Mario we&#39;re jumping</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.010" end="00:30:52.460" style="s2">through a landscape now Trane&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.350" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">transition this to the notion of like</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.460" end="00:30:57.480" style="s2">n-dimensional Park or through mystery</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:30:59.130" style="s2">space we don&#39;t know how to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.480" end="00:31:01.590" style="s2">problem what we do know is that every</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.130" end="00:31:03.600" style="s2">once in a while some platform pops up</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.590" end="00:31:04.890" style="s2">some structure pops up that has an</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.600" end="00:31:07.470" style="s2">energy against it what you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.890" end="00:31:08.940" style="s2">pop you can leap to it and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.470" end="00:31:11.880" style="s2">figure out a leap to the next piece so</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.940" end="00:31:13.590" style="s2">the actualization of the solution to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.880" end="00:31:15.510" style="s2">problem of how to actually solve n95</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.590" end="00:31:16.050" style="s2">masks has nothing to do with in 95 maths</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.510" end="00:31:18.330" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.050" end="00:31:20.730" style="s2">it&#39;s actually an abstract concrete</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.330" end="00:31:23.370" style="s2">example of how we actually solve mystery</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.730" end="00:31:24.300" style="s2">problems in new modality space so okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.370" end="00:31:26.610" style="s2">look at it</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.300" end="00:31:27.960" style="s2">get in it get drive into a directive so</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.610" end="00:31:29.370" style="s2">you can an embodied experience what the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.960" end="00:31:31.320" style="s2">reality looks like it&#39;s okay reckless</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.370" end="00:31:33.090" style="s2">abandon just jump into it but recognize</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.320" end="00:31:34.380" style="s2">that&#39;s not the thing you&#39;re doing what</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.090" end="00:31:36.930" style="s2">you&#39;re actually doing is learning how</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.380" end="00:31:38.760" style="s2">that general pace operates all right</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.930" end="00:31:40.560" style="s2">what&#39;s the thing that shows up things</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.760" end="00:31:41.730" style="s2">that show up are how do you support a</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.560" end="00:31:43.170" style="s2">higher quality of sense making</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.730" end="00:31:44.310" style="s2">what do connections look like what do</p>

<p begin="00:31:44.310" end="00:31:47.760" style="s2">like in this kind of a context I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.960" end="00:31:48.960" style="s2">saying that in general right in all</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.760" end="00:31:50.850" style="s2">cases that kind of thing is going to</p>

<p begin="00:37:19.400" end="00:37:25.400" style="s2">oh absolutely yeah absolutely so let me</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.360" end="00:37:28.730" style="s2">see over backwards from the from the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.400" end="00:37:32.150" style="s2">right hand side of that so the the the</p>

<p begin="00:37:32.150" end="00:37:36.230" style="s2">bring those different dispositions and</p>

<p begin="00:37:38.600" end="00:37:43.550" style="s2">natural like really old-fashioned Stone</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.610" end="00:37:46.700" style="s2">Age tribes intrinsically must have all</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.550" end="00:37:48.200" style="s2">of those dispositions and therefore all</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.700" end="00:37:49.580" style="s2">of those perspectives as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.200" end="00:37:51.310" style="s2">tribe that&#39;s how we were selected for us</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.580" end="00:37:54.730" style="s2">why those dispositions exist</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.310" end="00:37:59.060" style="s2">differentially in in human populations</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.730" end="00:38:03.530" style="s2">so the integration of groups of</p>

<p begin="00:38:03.530" end="00:38:08.030" style="s2">into new holes is is almost like what</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.830" end="00:38:09.770" style="s2">happens when we get rid of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.030" end="00:38:11.090" style="s2">artificial constraints we naturally</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.770" end="00:38:12.830" style="s2">begin to Rico here in that fashion</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.090" end="00:38:14.270" style="s2">because that&#39;s our more natural state</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.830" end="00:38:15.740" style="s2">and by the way it&#39;s the way that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.270" end="00:38:18.110" style="s2">actually able to achieve consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.740" end="00:38:20.630" style="s2">as a group because that gives us the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.110" end="00:38:22.340" style="s2">net-net like we are obligate tribal we</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.630" end="00:38:25.160" style="s2">just have to get that as individuals we</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.340" end="00:38:27.530" style="s2">aren&#39;t real beings like our reality as</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.160" end="00:38:28.910" style="s2">humans is in groups that are coherent</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.530" end="00:38:30.380" style="s2">that&#39;s where we actually begin to feel</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.910" end="00:38:34.010" style="s2">the most fully real because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.380" end="00:38:36.170" style="s2">actually the reality of it and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.010" end="00:38:37.880" style="s2">a lot of junk starts to drop away when</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.170" end="00:38:39.740" style="s2">you actually begin to drop back now into</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.880" end="00:38:43.340" style="s2">into real relationship and right</p>

<p begin="00:38:47.600" end="00:38:52.220" style="s2">one of the things she said is this feels</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.430" end="00:38:54.380" style="s2">very scary to me as an introvert I said</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.220" end="00:38:56.330" style="s2">well that makes sense because because in</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.380" end="00:38:59.270" style="s2">your mind you think about it as you as</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.330" end="00:39:01.340" style="s2">an introvert but what should happen is</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.270" end="00:39:03.770" style="s2">you should find yourself in this context</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.340" end="00:39:06.530" style="s2">having extroverts who have relationality</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.770" end="00:39:07.730" style="s2">with you inviting you into this you</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.530" end="00:39:09.410" style="s2">don&#39;t have to become an extrovert to</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.730" end="00:39:10.580" style="s2">play this game extroverts will play the</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.410" end="00:39:11.690" style="s2">extrovert game and they will invite the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.580" end="00:39:13.070" style="s2">introverts and to play the introvert</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.690" end="00:39:14.090" style="s2">piece and suddenly everybody&#39;s holding</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.070" end="00:39:16.370" style="s2">the piece and they&#39;re supposed to hold</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.090" end="00:39:17.990" style="s2">at that level right so you&#39;ve got you</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.370" end="00:39:20.500" style="s2">know 50 different different dimensions</p>

<p begin="00:39:27.770" end="00:39:33.220" style="s2">think it&#39;s actually ended up really</p>

<p begin="00:41:24.870" end="00:41:28.680" style="s2">psychological thing to integrate right</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.670" end="00:41:29.910" style="s2">if I listen to these guys my everything</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.680" end="00:41:31.740" style="s2">I&#39;ve been listed been been</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.910" end="00:41:33.360" style="s2">psychologically preparing myself well</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.740" end="00:41:35.130" style="s2">for the past 20 years is every signal</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.360" end="00:41:38.340" style="s2">coming out of these guys must be false</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.130" end="00:41:39.900" style="s2">and this signal is the highest gain</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.340" end="00:41:41.820" style="s2">signal for me to actually believe is</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.900" end="00:41:43.740" style="s2">true I&#39;m in the middle of a paradox</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.820" end="00:41:45.870" style="s2">alright so the only way out of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.740" end="00:41:48.240" style="s2">paradox since I had to drop all of this</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.870" end="00:41:50.250" style="s2">or to invent an illusionary narrative</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.240" end="00:41:52.470" style="s2">right here allows me to maintain my it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.250" end="00:41:53.940" style="s2">pre-existing condition I think that</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.470" end="00:41:55.650" style="s2">happened across a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.940" end="00:41:57.060" style="s2">psychological domains I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.650" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">actually driving the law of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.060" end="00:42:00.810" style="s2">why we&#39;re seeing stuff happen so it ends</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:03.390" style="s2">up happening is that&#39;s like a giant plow</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.810" end="00:42:05.580" style="s2">tearing through the soil of our of our</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.390" end="00:42:07.230" style="s2">pre-existing psychological and</p>

<p begin="00:42:07.230" end="00:42:11.400" style="s2">and as the reality of the event hits</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.690" end="00:42:15.330" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing two movements one movement</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.400" end="00:42:18.600" style="s2">is an increasing like delusional</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.330" end="00:42:20.520" style="s2">hysteria increasingly manic and a</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.600" end="00:42:22.980" style="s2">slaughtering and breaking down in that</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.520" end="00:42:25.500" style="s2">fabric and a Rico hearin Civ people into</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.980" end="00:42:28.920" style="s2">whatever they wherever they land which</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.500" end="00:42:31.230" style="s2">if it&#39;s even vaguely healthy looks like</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.920" end="00:42:32.610" style="s2">new wholeness and because that&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.230" end="00:42:34.050" style="s2">that&#39;s so that&#39;s like a real natural</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.610" end="00:42:36.540" style="s2">place if you get the artificiality</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.050" end="00:42:38.220" style="s2">breaking apart and it&#39;s just super</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.540" end="00:42:39.720" style="s2">powerful and astounding in this invent</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.220" end="00:42:41.970" style="s2">is the degree to which people have been</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.720" end="00:42:44.280" style="s2">forced out of their comfortable context</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.970" end="00:42:47.100" style="s2">you just popped into an absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.280" end="00:42:49.530" style="s2">bizarre of circumstance where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.100" end="00:42:51.270" style="s2">not going to work for good or for bad</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.530" end="00:42:52.260" style="s2">right maybe you&#39;re happy not going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.270" end="00:42:53.790" style="s2">work because you got enough savings to</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.260" end="00:42:54.900" style="s2">actually call it a weird-ass vacation</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.790" end="00:42:57.630" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s real bad you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.900" end="00:42:58.980" style="s2">any savings and things get scary but if</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.630" end="00:43:01.080" style="s2">you&#39;re you know you&#39;re sitting with your</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.980" end="00:43:02.670" style="s2">parents and your kids and you&#39;re online</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.080" end="00:43:03.690" style="s2">all the time and everything is going</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.670" end="00:43:06.810" style="s2">around is mysterious there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.690" end="00:43:08.340" style="s2">really crazy like you can&#39;t it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.810" end="00:43:10.020" style="s2">fit your existing delusional narrative</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.340" end="00:43:10.650" style="s2">into this environment so it makes that</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.020" end="00:43:12.660" style="s2">delusional in there</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.650" end="00:43:16.610" style="s2">the shear forces that are powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.660" end="00:43:16.610" style="s2">so that&#39;s that bi-directional movement</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.090" end="00:43:28.800" style="s2">the other area you want to piggyback on</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.500" end="00:43:32.550" style="s2">that sure so basically my question was</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.800" end="00:43:34.460" style="s2">like I guess we&#39;re related to this idea</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.550" end="00:43:36.630" style="s2">of like why wholeness is more real than</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.460" end="00:43:37.890" style="s2">fragmentation like I was listening to</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.630" end="00:43:41.640" style="s2">your third scenario it seems pretty</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.890" end="00:43:43.620" style="s2">appealing good like re reconvene into</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.640" end="00:43:45.300" style="s2">some kind of good configuration and for</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.620" end="00:43:46.980" style="s2">12 weeks that unlocks all this latent</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.300" end="00:43:48.900" style="s2">potential but I&#39;m wondering whether</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.980" end="00:43:52.140" style="s2">maybe like the existing systems we have</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.900" end="00:43:53.730" style="s2">are so like calcified that the potential</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.140" end="00:43:55.920" style="s2">latent potential so deeply locked in</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.730" end="00:43:57.420" style="s2">that maybe a longer period of like</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.920" end="00:43:59.520" style="s2">destruction or creative destruction is</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.420" end="00:44:02.930" style="s2">necessary like basically could path one</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.520" end="00:44:02.930" style="s2">eventually lead to path 3 ah</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.020" end="00:44:07.700" style="s2">so when I say that wholeness is more</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.190" end="00:44:10.320" style="s2">real I don&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.700" end="00:44:15.360" style="s2">has more power in the contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.320" end="00:44:18.110" style="s2">environment I mean that it&#39;s more it has</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.360" end="00:44:23.070" style="s2">a deeper basis and therefore is more</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.110" end="00:44:26.190" style="s2">invariant other different conditions so</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.070" end="00:44:28.440" style="s2">that all things being equal it&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.190" end="00:44:29.460" style="s2">things would go but as you say all</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.440" end="00:44:32.640" style="s2">things ain&#39;t equal</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.460" end="00:44:34.590" style="s2">so now the question is it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.640" end="00:44:36.690" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a river and the rivers got a</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.590" end="00:44:40.010" style="s2">current is going in one direction and</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.690" end="00:44:42.150" style="s2">that&#39;s the only thing going on my little</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.010" end="00:44:45.180" style="s2">recall a cooler of beer is gonna go in</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.150" end="00:44:46.860" style="s2">that direction but at the same time I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.180" end="00:44:48.870" style="s2">got you know a guy with a motorboat</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.860" end="00:44:49.920" style="s2">who&#39;s got a rope tied around my cooler</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.870" end="00:44:51.720" style="s2">and he&#39;s pulling at the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.920" end="00:44:53.310" style="s2">direction there we go</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.720" end="00:44:55.470" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty good model for the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.310" end="00:44:58.350" style="s2">reality that we&#39;re in so what I would</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.470" end="00:45:01.770" style="s2">say is that in point of fact the</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.350" end="00:45:03.390" style="s2">feedback loop between 1 &amp; 2 that tension</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.770" end="00:45:05.820" style="s2">and the increasing intensity of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.390" end="00:45:08.010" style="s2">tension is actually what I&#39;m describing</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.820" end="00:45:10.140" style="s2">is giving rise to the space for path 3</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.010" end="00:45:11.610" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s going on right now the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.140" end="00:45:13.610" style="s2">conversation is just having with area</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.610" end="00:45:16.530" style="s2">one was was that right you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.610" end="00:45:18.270" style="s2">breaking up of the motorboats capacity</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.530" end="00:45:20.100" style="s2">because shits just like weirder than it</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.270" end="00:45:21.990" style="s2">thought or sherry oh I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.100" end="00:45:24.260" style="s2">not even area but in my universe you are</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.990" end="00:45:24.260" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.660" end="00:45:31.069" style="s2">but there&#39;s a point all right this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.759" end="00:45:32.450" style="s2">those this there&#39;s a lacunae there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.069" end="00:45:34.460" style="s2">point at which and you throw the ball</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.450" end="00:45:36.200" style="s2">into the air and as it&#39;s going up it</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.460" end="00:45:37.700" style="s2">slows down slows down slows down then it</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.200" end="00:45:39.829" style="s2">hits a singular point at the very top</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.700" end="00:45:42.549" style="s2">where suddenly a sort of no force of no</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.829" end="00:45:45.289" style="s2">velocity and then it comes back down</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.549" end="00:45:47.239" style="s2">that&#39;s where you want to catch it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.289" end="00:45:48.619" style="s2">where the possibility space of shifting</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.239" end="00:45:51.619" style="s2">things a different location or at its</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.619" end="00:45:52.910" style="s2">maximum but where other gravitational</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.619" end="00:45:54.109" style="s2">forces haven&#39;t already started pulling</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.910" end="00:45:56.059" style="s2">it I don&#39;t if you&#39;ve ever seen like</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.109" end="00:45:57.200" style="s2">those trapeze artists where they swing</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.059" end="00:45:59.660" style="s2">really hard and they swing back and</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.200" end="00:46:01.549" style="s2">forth and they let go and then they grab</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.660" end="00:46:02.749" style="s2">the person at the top well I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.549" end="00:46:04.430" style="s2">if you don&#39;t understand the physics of</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.749" end="00:46:05.930" style="s2">that but there&#39;s a very specific point</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.430" end="00:46:07.460" style="s2">where they can grab where the human the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.930" end="00:46:09.559" style="s2">strength of the human arm can actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.460" end="00:46:11.059" style="s2">hold if you grab them too early their</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.559" end="00:46:12.829" style="s2">velocity is to higher they&#39;re gonna pop</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.059" end="00:46:14.359" style="s2">right out we&#39;ve grabbed them too late</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.829" end="00:46:15.920" style="s2">gravity&#39;s now accelerated them they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.359" end="00:46:17.749" style="s2">gonna pop right out there&#39;s a spot right</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.920" end="00:46:19.549" style="s2">up in the middle or the air everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.749" end="00:46:20.809" style="s2">kind of up in the air and the ability</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.549" end="00:46:22.729" style="s2">for hands to grab each other and hold</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.809" end="00:46:24.739" style="s2">and bind it&#39;s strong enough to actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.729" end="00:46:25.999" style="s2">hold the whole thing together that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.739" end="00:46:27.200" style="s2">window you&#39;re targeting all right so</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.999" end="00:46:30.739" style="s2">what I&#39;m seeing is it&#39;s gonna look like</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.200" end="00:46:32.210" style="s2">this existing inertia is gonna break</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.739" end="00:46:33.950" style="s2">down it&#39;s gonna break down it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.210" end="00:46:36.739" style="s2">break down these differential forces are</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.950" end="00:46:38.930" style="s2">gonna break it apart a window will open</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.739" end="00:46:41.599" style="s2">in that window the possibility of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.930" end="00:46:43.519" style="s2">third attractor is at its maximum if the</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.599" end="00:46:45.519" style="s2">photo tractor just now to cohere with</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.519" end="00:46:48.349" style="s2">enough integrity and enough velocity</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.519" end="00:46:51.349" style="s2">then other forces will begin to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.349" end="00:46:52.549" style="s2">more pull and a trip attractor one and</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.349" end="00:46:54.619" style="s2">two will have the highest likelihood</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.549" end="00:46:56.059" style="s2">probability would begin to move more and</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.619" end="00:46:58.150" style="s2">more away from three and towards one and</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.059" end="00:46:58.150" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.680" end="00:47:03.460" style="s2">uh-huh so this might be the last</p>

<p begin="00:47:20.260" end="00:47:23.470" style="s2">aren&#39;t in this world</p>

<p begin="00:47:43.450" end="00:47:48.000" style="s2">word to use to come out of Daniels mouth</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.950" end="00:47:48.000" style="s2">before we worked on this thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.780" end="00:47:56.130" style="s2">principles and values why what how in</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.910" end="00:47:59.830" style="s2">that order</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.130" end="00:48:02.530" style="s2">if you speak to speak to wise and get</p>

<p begin="00:48:02.530" end="00:48:05.590" style="s2">the problem solved</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.460" end="00:48:08.050" style="s2">if people are oriented around the</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.590" end="00:48:09.250" style="s2">meaningfulness of something then you</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.050" end="00:48:12.040" style="s2">work with the direction of values</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.250" end="00:48:14.140" style="s2">principles and values and this is about</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.040" end="00:48:17.290" style="s2">what&#39;s now if you&#39;re speaking to</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.140" end="00:48:18.640" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s a former Vietnam veteran</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.290" end="00:48:20.200" style="s2">you need to kind of work from there in</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.640" end="00:48:22.120" style="s2">tier II or &#39;ti what are the what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.200" end="00:48:23.710" style="s2">resonate with them deeply where are the</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.120" end="00:48:25.570" style="s2">values that have been the driving force</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.710" end="00:48:27.820" style="s2">and their being in the world since the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.570" end="00:48:29.740" style="s2">day they were born and communicate this</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.820" end="00:48:32.800" style="s2">in the language that connects with that</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.740" end="00:48:34.660" style="s2">become their own sense making vehicle</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.800" end="00:48:37.060" style="s2">now you&#39;re not trying to explain your</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.660" end="00:48:39.250" style="s2">and you don&#39;t want to try even vaguely</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.060" end="00:48:40.750" style="s2">to cause their epistemology to look like</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.250" end="00:48:42.700" style="s2">your epistemology because that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.750" end="00:48:43.930" style="s2">waste of time what you want to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.700" end="00:48:46.210" style="s2">figure out how to actually get out of</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.930" end="00:48:47.740" style="s2">the fine grain structure epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.210" end="00:48:50.950" style="s2">and get to the coarse grain structure of</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.740" end="00:48:55.530" style="s2">values and principles so are we aligned</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.950" end="00:48:55.530" style="s2">on these can we agree that</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.210" end="00:49:04.850" style="s2">corruption is rampant and bad</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.430" end="00:49:06.290" style="s2">yep okay good that&#39;s we&#39;re on the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.850" end="00:49:08.090" style="s2">page now now the only question is</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.290" end="00:49:10.070" style="s2">exactly how do we begin to deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.090" end="00:49:11.810" style="s2">and if I jump too fast to the end state</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.070" end="00:49:13.460" style="s2">my solution to that is either gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.810" end="00:49:14.750" style="s2">dealing with stuff they don&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.460" end="00:49:17.000" style="s2">cuz I&#39;m focusing on things that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.750" end="00:49:18.590" style="s2">their world or my solutions could not</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.000" end="00:49:20.840" style="s2">make any sense it&#39;s kind of husband pull</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.590" end="00:49:22.130" style="s2">backs let&#39;s take it step by step you</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.840" end="00:49:23.540" style="s2">know what our area is so if I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.130" end="00:49:26.060" style="s2">to a Vietnam vet I&#39;m gonna talk about</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.540" end="00:49:27.110" style="s2">that for Navy admiral who got fired for</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.060" end="00:49:28.760" style="s2">doing the right thing I don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.110" end="00:49:29.960" style="s2">about that story but enraged a whole</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.760" end="00:49:31.790" style="s2">bunch of people because it&#39;s when they</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.960" end="00:49:33.110" style="s2">make sense in the world you can use</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.790" end="00:49:34.790" style="s2">examples of what&#39;s going on in the real</p>

<p begin="00:50:36.200" end="00:50:40.370" style="s2">this down if you just</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.630" end="00:50:42.230" style="s2">listen to the language he uses and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.370" end="00:50:43.970" style="s2">things he focused on an abstract out the</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.230" end="00:50:45.320" style="s2">detail because I&#39;m not doctor I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:50:45.320" end="00:50:48.290" style="s2">what his concerns are when I listen to</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.150" end="00:50:50.360" style="s2">the things he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.290" end="00:50:52.760" style="s2">I can transpose the things I understand</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.360" end="00:50:53.300" style="s2">and say yep I know exactly you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.760" end="00:50:55.700" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.300" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">great everybody has the same point of</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.700" end="00:50:59.510" style="s2">view now when I would say at a very high</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.920" end="00:51:01.670" style="s2">level is the primary shape of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.510" end="00:51:05.120" style="s2">problem we&#39;re dealing with it&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.670" end="00:51:07.430" style="s2">things one we got a system that Orient&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.120" end="00:51:08.570" style="s2">people towards making bad choices all</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.430" end="00:51:10.490" style="s2">right so we have to feel it deal with</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.570" end="00:51:12.860" style="s2">that at a systemic level how do we</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.490" end="00:51:14.150" style="s2">liberate people to make choices how do</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.860" end="00:51:16.250" style="s2">we put people in a corner where they</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.150" end="00:51:17.330" style="s2">have to actually make choices for the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.250" end="00:51:19.370" style="s2">first time in quite a while</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.330" end="00:51:20.390" style="s2">the virus is helping us on that front</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.370" end="00:51:23.660" style="s2">and there&#39;s more things we can put in</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.390" end="00:51:25.220" style="s2">place to do it - the classic distinction</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.660" end="00:51:26.390" style="s2">right more or less we are struggling</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.220" end="00:51:28.010" style="s2">with the fact that there&#39;s a small</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.390" end="00:51:30.620" style="s2">number of malevolent men and a very</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.010" end="00:51:31.070" style="s2">large number of weak men all right fair</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.620" end="00:51:33.020" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.070" end="00:51:34.550" style="s2">we need to put weak men into a context</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.020" end="00:51:35.870" style="s2">where they actually have to be forced to</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.550" end="00:51:38.090" style="s2">use their weakness to make a choices</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.870" end="00:51:39.470" style="s2">that are good choices and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.090" end="00:51:40.670" style="s2">have to find it exactly this malevolent</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.470" end="00:51:43.850" style="s2">men arm we&#39;ve got to get him out of</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.670" end="00:51:45.440" style="s2">equation so something on the lines of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.850" end="00:51:46.790" style="s2">message coming through from the top and</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.440" end="00:51:48.950" style="s2">from the bottom the justice will be</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.790" end="00:51:50.660" style="s2">returned and then we&#39;re coming no matter</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.950" end="00:51:52.340" style="s2">what happens that&#39;s a big part of this</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.660" end="00:51:53.660" style="s2">third attractor and there&#39;s a strength</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.340" end="00:51:54.890" style="s2">and an energy to it you got to get the</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.660" end="00:51:57.830" style="s2">weak men realizing it&#39;s the right choice</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.890" end="00:51:59.420" style="s2">right now is to stop making passive</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.830" end="00:52:01.160" style="s2">choices that are hurting everybody and</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.420" end="00:52:03.200" style="s2">to either let go and let other people</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.160" end="00:52:04.910" style="s2">take over or begin to actually recover</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.200" end="00:52:06.770" style="s2">their courage and do the right thing and</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.910" end="00:52:08.960" style="s2">you got to put on notice that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.770" end="00:52:10.700" style="s2">malevolent men the days of malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.960" end="00:52:12.290" style="s2">are over all right we&#39;re all gonna</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.700" end="00:52:14.150" style="s2">figure out how to solve this problem</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.290" end="00:52:15.500" style="s2">right now come hell or high water we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.150" end="00:52:17.540" style="s2">gonna figure it out together but when</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.500" end="00:52:18.920" style="s2">it&#39;s done we&#39;re gonna burn this</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.540" end="00:52:20.840" style="s2"> to the ground and we were</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.920" end="00:52:23.330" style="s2">going to restore justice on a global</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.840" end="00:52:24.980" style="s2">basis and it can be done by the way the</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.330" end="00:52:26.390" style="s2">third attractor by no question can do</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.980" end="00:52:28.730" style="s2">that so it&#39;s just a matter</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.390" end="00:52:31.300" style="s2">our teeth to the bit and making sure we</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.730" end="00:52:31.300" style="s2">make that happen</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.090" end="00:52:41.870" style="s2">I feel the intensity flowing through my</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.090" end="00:52:43.250" style="s2">body right now so we&#39;ll end here I&#39;ll</p>
