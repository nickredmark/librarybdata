<p begin="00:08:12.180" end="00:08:15.680" style="s2">to skip 2w take any other action that</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.339" end="00:08:19.800" style="s2">the tribunal determines is appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.680" end="00:08:23.129" style="s2">now you you&#39;ve got that they&#39;ve actually</p>

<p begin="00:08:30.779" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2">absurd or I would say that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.019" end="00:08:38.219" style="s2">absurd but it&#39;s by no means trivial and</p>

<p begin="00:09:11.339" end="00:09:14.850" style="s2">fundamentally now there are some other</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.230" end="00:09:16.529" style="s2">things to consider notice that these</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.850" end="00:09:18.120" style="s2">tribunals including the Ontario Human</p>

<p begin="00:09:20.250" end="00:09:25.860" style="s2">tribunals now that&#39;s not an accident</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.459" end="00:09:28.260" style="s2">consider what that means the term social</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.860" end="00:09:29.639" style="s2">justice is a code for political</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.260" end="00:09:31.560" style="s2">correctness and equity oriented</p>

<p begin="00:10:04.380" end="00:10:08.490" style="s2">well it&#39;s rooted in politically correct</p>
