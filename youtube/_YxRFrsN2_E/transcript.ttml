<p begin="00:02:10.739" end="00:02:17.340" style="s2">been here for Wow it&#39;ll be 20</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.710" end="00:02:21.210" style="s2">three years this August</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.340" end="00:02:25.350" style="s2">about three years ago I began to notice</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.210" end="00:02:29.580" style="s2">the work of jordan peterson and more</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.350" end="00:02:33.060" style="s2">like four years ago now now three and i</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.580" end="00:02:36.810" style="s2">became interested in him i had always</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.060" end="00:02:39.900" style="s2">used a blog as sort of a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.810" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">partner i&#39;m a solo pastor of a small</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.900" end="00:02:46.110" style="s2">church and so finding people to talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:49.530" style="s2">about the kinds of things I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.110" end="00:02:51.930" style="s2">in wasn&#39;t always easy so via a blog and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.530" end="00:02:53.370" style="s2">listservs and some other groups I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.930" end="00:02:55.560" style="s2">always look for conversation partners</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.370" end="00:02:57.480" style="s2">and then when Jordan Peterson arose</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.560" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">there are a lot of interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.480" end="00:03:02.280" style="s2">about his work that I wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:06.210" style="s2">about I had difficulty getting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.280" end="00:03:09.840" style="s2">other pastors interested in talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.210" end="00:03:11.970" style="s2">about it and I was also reading Neil</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.840" end="00:03:13.530" style="s2">postman at that time thinking about his</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.970" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">book amusing ourselves to death and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.530" end="00:03:19.530" style="s2">thinking about the medium of YouTube and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:22.230" style="s2">so I decided to make a youtube video and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.530" end="00:03:24.660" style="s2">whereas I had blogged for years and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.230" end="00:03:26.370" style="s2">know there might my blog would usually</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.660" end="00:03:32.070" style="s2">get maybe two or three hundred hits a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.370" end="00:03:34.830" style="s2">day the and that wasn&#39;t per that was the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.070" end="00:03:37.590" style="s2">entire blog ice began getting more</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.830" end="00:03:39.930" style="s2">traffic to my YouTube channel and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.590" end="00:03:43.470" style="s2">because I&#39;m a pastor people wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.930" end="00:03:43.920" style="s2">talk to me and one thing would lead to</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.470" end="00:03:45.420" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.920" end="00:03:47.100" style="s2">I found that sharing some of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.420" end="00:03:49.890" style="s2">conversations when appropriate was</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.100" end="00:03:52.530" style="s2">helpful for people and the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.890" end="00:03:54.660" style="s2">just continued to bloom along the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.530" end="00:03:57.450" style="s2">and he&#39;s in the he&#39;s in the chat I</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.660" end="00:04:01.740" style="s2">noticed here I can never quite say his</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.450" end="00:04:03.330" style="s2">name right strong strong was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.740" end="00:04:04.890" style="s2">people that was listening to me and he</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.330" end="00:04:06.960" style="s2">would send me emails and he would send</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.890" end="00:04:09.180" style="s2">me teas cut and paste these long</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.960" end="00:04:12.150" style="s2">sections from Wikipedia about this</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.180" end="00:04:14.220" style="s2">philosopher that philosopher and and he</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.150" end="00:04:15.780" style="s2">was he was really working hard to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.220" end="00:04:17.340" style="s2">colonize me and he said well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.780" end="00:04:19.980" style="s2">this guy this other professor at</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.340" end="00:04:21.420" style="s2">University of Toronto whose who has some</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.980" end="00:04:27.690" style="s2">videos and you really have to watch his</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.420" end="00:04:29.490" style="s2">videos and so that was John and I okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.690" end="00:04:30.840" style="s2">but a lot of people send me videos and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.490" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">so it&#39;s always hard to know what&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.840" end="00:04:35.820" style="s2">sort of get to the top of the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:37.110" style="s2">salience hierarchy but I watched some of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.820" end="00:04:39.270" style="s2">them and the sound was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.110" end="00:04:41.010" style="s2">annoyingly bad which I really don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.270" end="00:04:42.450" style="s2">reason to point point fingers have</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.010" end="00:04:46.140" style="s2">there&#39;s bad sound and plenty of my</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.450" end="00:04:48.120" style="s2">videos but I there was there was enough</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.140" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">there that really caught my interest and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.120" end="00:04:53.460" style="s2">I had used him a couple of times in some</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:55.350" style="s2">of my videos trying to feel out who he</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.460" end="00:04:58.890" style="s2">is at a very low resolution idea of who</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.350" end="00:05:00.930" style="s2">he was and then he started doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.890" end="00:05:02.730" style="s2">awakening from the meaning crisis where</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.930" end="00:05:06.090" style="s2">the sound was for the most part very</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.730" end="00:05:10.050" style="s2">good and he was laying out things in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.090" end="00:05:13.470" style="s2">systematic form and I began following</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.050" end="00:05:16.530" style="s2">him in a more disciplined way and really</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.470" end="00:05:19.260" style="s2">discovered some some really helpful</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.530" end="00:05:22.080" style="s2">ideas and terminology just helped me</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.260" end="00:05:25.050" style="s2">understand philosophy better and figure</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.080" end="00:05:29.640" style="s2">out what cognitive science was learn all</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.050" end="00:05:31.560" style="s2">of this stuff better and then John you</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.640" end="00:05:33.300" style="s2">know I noticed had been made some</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.560" end="00:05:36.930" style="s2">comments and some of the videos that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.300" end="00:05:38.940" style="s2">had commented on him and he had sent me</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.930" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">an email and said you know I&#39;d like I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.940" end="00:05:44.880" style="s2">love to do a conversation and I said</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:48.570" style="s2">that&#39;d be great and so that sort of has</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.880" end="00:05:50.490" style="s2">has continued on and yeah a friendship I</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.570" end="00:05:51.990" style="s2">you know as he offer he says I have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.490" end="00:05:54.600" style="s2">lot of affection for Palo I have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.990" end="00:05:57.390" style="s2">of affection for John and we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.600" end="00:05:59.730" style="s2">been able to meet in person yet that</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.390" end="00:06:04.110" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve chatted online and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.730" end="00:06:06.990" style="s2">chatted via email so I&#39;m I&#39;m fearful</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.110" end="00:06:09.450" style="s2">that the much-anticipated conference</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.990" end="00:06:11.310" style="s2">coming up in fun planned for Thunder</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.450" end="00:06:15.330" style="s2">battle Thunder Valley that&#39;s a casino</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.310" end="00:06:18.030" style="s2">here Thunder Bay Ontario where myself</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.330" end="00:06:19.800" style="s2">and Jonathan pezzo and John Verve a key</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.030" end="00:06:20.669" style="s2">could all get together and have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.800" end="00:06:23.460" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.669" end="00:06:27.770" style="s2">I fear because of Koba that might not</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.460" end="00:06:31.290" style="s2">happen but I very much a Lord willing</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.770" end="00:06:34.380" style="s2">anticipate meeting John in person at</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.290" end="00:06:36.710" style="s2">some point and hopefully our friendship</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.380" end="00:06:41.400" style="s2">over the years can deepen I owe him a</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.710" end="00:06:46.020" style="s2">tremendous debt the the longer ice</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.400" end="00:06:47.580" style="s2">with his with his work awakening from</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.020" end="00:06:48.570" style="s2">the meaning crisis the more I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.580" end="00:06:52.590" style="s2">impressed by it</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.570" end="00:06:53.850" style="s2">the deeper my learning comes you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.590" end="00:06:56.639" style="s2">one of the things that you quickly</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.850" end="00:06:59.520" style="s2">realize as you open up your circles to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.639" end="00:07:01.110" style="s2">bigger vein like YouTube there are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.520" end="00:07:02.580" style="s2">of smart people out there and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.110" end="00:07:06.449" style="s2">necessarily at the top of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.580" end="00:07:08.300" style="s2">and ideas take time to sink in it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.449" end="00:07:11.460" style="s2">fairly difficult to colonize a</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.729" end="00:07:21.630" style="s2">up and as he&#39;s often said he one of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.430" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">things he did with awakening from the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.630" end="00:07:25.800" style="s2">meeting crisis is he at least in this</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:28.860" style="s2">little corner of the Internet has helped</p>

<p begin="00:08:41.760" end="00:08:47.070" style="s2">that I&#39;ll just throw one last question</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.150" end="00:08:52.770" style="s2">so so you&#39;re you&#39;re a Christian pastor</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.070" end="00:08:54.390" style="s2">and John is a non theist who&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.770" end="00:08:54.850" style="s2">talking about creating the religion</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.390" end="00:08:57.459" style="s2">that&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.850" end="00:09:00.160" style="s2">religion and so that makes it an</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.459" end="00:09:02.079" style="s2">interesting contrast how what are your</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.160" end="00:09:03.670" style="s2">feelings about what are your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.079" end="00:09:06.720" style="s2">about the religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.670" end="00:09:08.470" style="s2">and how do you how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.720" end="00:09:12.069" style="s2">what do you think of it how do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.470" end="00:09:16.149" style="s2">integrated into your thinking and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.069" end="00:09:20.980" style="s2">know how do you do is there a conflict</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.149" end="00:09:22.690" style="s2">there between yeah did you do you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.980" end="00:09:26.860" style="s2">any cop conflicting thoughts about it</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.690" end="00:09:30.279" style="s2">well I I think Mary cohan who runs a</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.860" end="00:09:32.440" style="s2">channel she&#39;s a for a while she was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.279" end="00:09:38.139" style="s2">Jehovah&#39;s Witness and she became a Roman</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.440" end="00:09:40.089" style="s2">Catholic um very smart woman who is</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.139" end="00:09:42.730" style="s2">doing some videos on Joseph Ratzinger</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.089" end="00:09:45.190" style="s2">and chickens and a bunch of other things</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.730" end="00:09:46.690" style="s2">I think in one of her she&#39;s had a number</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.190" end="00:09:49.839" style="s2">of conversations with John as well as</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.690" end="00:09:52.389" style="s2">well as JP Marceau who was a friend of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.839" end="00:09:53.709" style="s2">it was a friend of Jonathan pezzo and</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.389" end="00:09:56.410" style="s2">quite active in his community</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.709" end="00:10:03.339" style="s2">he&#39;s a pan cyclist and a Roman Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.410" end="00:10:05.350" style="s2">and so for me my my vistas have simply</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.339" end="00:10:08.050" style="s2">been broadened by all of this</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.350" end="00:10:09.759" style="s2">interchange now you know before when</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.050" end="00:10:11.560" style="s2">before we started the thing and we got</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.759" end="00:10:13.959" style="s2">together and you called John an atheist</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.560" end="00:10:17.380" style="s2">I sort of tried to gently correct you</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.959" end="00:10:19.180" style="s2">he&#39;s a non theists and I I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.380" end="00:10:21.779" style="s2">of what&#39;s been helpful about John&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.180" end="00:10:26.139" style="s2">he&#39;s up to the resolution on our</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.779" end="00:10:26.740" style="s2">conversations and an on and you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.139" end="00:10:29.230" style="s2">through my</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.740" end="00:10:31.209" style="s2">to three years my whole project has just</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.230" end="00:10:34.329" style="s2">really been a learning project for me</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.209" end="00:10:37.240" style="s2">and I&#39;ve gotten better acquainted with</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.329" end="00:10:40.029" style="s2">some of the philosophical history with</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.240" end="00:10:43.540" style="s2">Christian theology it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.029" end="00:10:47.019" style="s2">to me the amount of distance between</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.540" end="00:10:50.529" style="s2">John&#39;s non-theism especially with his</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.019" end="00:10:55.389" style="s2">interest and knowledge of neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.529" end="00:10:59.620" style="s2">of Augustan versus my theism that gap</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.389" end="00:11:03.579" style="s2">might not be as small as we it might not</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.620" end="00:11:05.769" style="s2">be as large as we think it&#39;s and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.579" end="00:11:07.600" style="s2">of my conversations with John and in</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.769" end="00:11:08.570" style="s2">fact a video I&#39;m planning to make this</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.600" end="00:11:11.450" style="s2">afternoon</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.570" end="00:11:13.220" style="s2">probably post it tomorrow has a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.450" end="00:11:17.420" style="s2">do with this idea of person what is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.220" end="00:11:20.510" style="s2">person and strong can of course talk a</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.420" end="00:11:23.600" style="s2">lot about that but in a lot of ways the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.510" end="00:11:25.880" style="s2">the theism and non-theism gets down to</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.600" end="00:11:27.230" style="s2">this question of personhood and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.880" end="00:11:30.710" style="s2">the what&#39;s the nature of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.230" end="00:11:32.750" style="s2">where does consciousness fit in now</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.710" end="00:11:37.910" style="s2">John&#39;s religion that&#39;s not a religion I</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.750" end="00:11:40.850" style="s2">think is a recognition that throughout</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.910" end="00:11:43.690" style="s2">history religious structures and</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.850" end="00:11:47.150" style="s2">practices and communities and</p>

<p begin="00:12:06.200" end="00:12:10.520" style="s2">differences let&#39;s say between John&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.790" end="00:12:12.920" style="s2">perspective and let&#39;s say the other</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.520" end="00:12:14.750" style="s2">little side of Arc the the bisection of</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.920" end="00:12:16.670" style="s2">our little corner of the internet say</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.750" end="00:12:20.990" style="s2">that where Jonathan Pozzo and I reside</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.670" end="00:12:23.600" style="s2">is that John is skeptical that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.990" end="00:12:27.830" style="s2">Ecology&#39;s of practice and the community</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.600" end="00:12:33.020" style="s2">structures and the worldviews and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.830" end="00:12:40.130" style="s2">philosophy of Christianity can continue</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.020" end="00:12:44.150" style="s2">to let&#39;s say not just endure or or face</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.130" end="00:12:46.660" style="s2">a declining retreating posture in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.150" end="00:12:50.110" style="s2">corners of culture but can in fact</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.660" end="00:12:53.540" style="s2">energize and continue to be vital and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.110" end="00:12:55.910" style="s2">going into the future and I completely</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.540" end="00:12:58.970" style="s2">understand John&#39;s perspective on this</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.910" end="00:13:01.940" style="s2">because there have been many ways in</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.970" end="00:13:05.630" style="s2">which the last 200 or so years certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.940" end="00:13:10.040" style="s2">aspects of Christianity have been under</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.630" end="00:13:12.050" style="s2">crisis stressed retreating sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.040" end="00:13:18.320" style="s2">this is phrased as Charles Taylor does</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.050" end="00:13:21.560" style="s2">as a subtraction story that and and John</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.320" end="00:13:22.350" style="s2">is sophisticated enough and honest</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.560" end="00:13:26.340" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.350" end="00:13:30.090" style="s2">not to you know pull any fast moves or</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.340" end="00:13:33.420" style="s2">low blows or cheap shots and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.090" end="00:13:35.880" style="s2">things that you immediately begin to see</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.420" end="00:13:39.980" style="s2">if you interact with John is he is a man</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.880" end="00:13:43.200" style="s2">of integrity and he is he does have</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.980" end="00:13:45.000" style="s2">conversations in good faith and his</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.200" end="00:13:48.930" style="s2">whole project centers around the idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.000" end="00:13:53.580" style="s2">that people with differences of opinions</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.930" end="00:13:55.380" style="s2">can have a deal logos with each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.580" end="00:13:57.360" style="s2">see I&#39;m using these fancy Verve a</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.380" end="00:14:00.210" style="s2">keywords as Jobe calls them could have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.360" end="00:14:03.870" style="s2">deal logos with each other and both come</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.210" end="00:14:08.160" style="s2">away from the conversation better for it</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.870" end="00:14:10.050" style="s2">even if you know a significant aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.160" end="00:14:13.830" style="s2">their kind of their disagreement let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.050" end="00:14:18.290" style="s2">say theism versus non theism endures and</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.830" end="00:14:21.060" style="s2">so John I Anjaana have found just a a</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.290" end="00:14:25.230" style="s2">wonderful conversation partner and</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.060" end="00:14:30.900" style="s2">teacher who has showed me so much and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.230" end="00:14:33.450" style="s2">his as Mary Kohan said hey um would I</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.900" end="00:14:35.880" style="s2">like people to come to Christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.450" end="00:14:38.280" style="s2">use Christian practices and worldview in</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.880" end="00:14:40.860" style="s2">theology absolutely that&#39;s part of my</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.280" end="00:14:43.230" style="s2">profession it&#39;s part of my tradition</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.860" end="00:14:47.160" style="s2">it&#39;s part of my Creed but I recognize</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.230" end="00:14:49.350" style="s2">that at least in the short term that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.160" end="00:14:52.590" style="s2">probably not going to happen and will</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.350" end="00:14:55.440" style="s2">people find will people find rest for</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.590" end="00:14:59.070" style="s2">their souls in some of the practices and</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.440" end="00:15:01.440" style="s2">communities and ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.070" end="00:15:03.120" style="s2">that he is promoting well it&#39;s not in my</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.440" end="00:15:05.880" style="s2">power to stop that and I don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.120" end="00:15:07.980" style="s2">interest in stopping it and so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.880" end="00:15:11.040" style="s2">continue the dialogue and let&#39;s continue</p>

<p begin="00:15:22.290" end="00:15:29.430" style="s2">and I agree with Mary so we&#39;ll have some</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.590" end="00:15:33.000" style="s2">differences but I&#39;m I&#39;m very interested</p>

<p begin="00:17:34.170" end="00:17:37.530" style="s2">I&#39;m just trying to derail your question</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.390" end="00:17:40.500" style="s2">because you&#39;re probably gonna ask me a</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.530" end="00:17:42.240" style="s2">stumper so go right ahead no I thought I</p>

<p begin="00:17:46.740" end="00:17:53.610" style="s2">join yeah I haven&#39;t participated in it</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:56.670" style="s2">much.i that&#39;s just been sort of a matter</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.610" end="00:17:59.700" style="s2">of both economy of time and salience</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.670" end="00:18:01.950" style="s2">hierarchy I owe a debt I think to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.700" end="00:18:04.560" style="s2">bridges of meaning server and so that</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.950" end="00:18:06.450" style="s2">tends to be where I hang out more but I</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.560" end="00:18:09.270" style="s2">haven&#39;t really spent a lot of time here</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.450" end="00:18:14.430" style="s2">to sort of poke around and I don&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.270" end="00:18:17.760" style="s2">discord to be a terribly easy interface</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.430" end="00:18:19.800" style="s2">and so we&#39;ve been talking with my frie</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.760" end="00:18:23.250" style="s2">do a Friday question and answer over at</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.800" end="00:18:24.840" style="s2">the bridges of meaning and we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.250" end="00:18:28.790" style="s2">about a week II or do some other things</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.840" end="00:18:31.740" style="s2">to try to organize some of this so that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.790" end="00:18:33.510" style="s2">when people come in they can have</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.740" end="00:18:36.420" style="s2">something what part of why I like the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.510" end="00:18:39.960" style="s2">and then growing an appreciation for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.420" end="00:18:44.760" style="s2">discord servers is that they do tend to</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.960" end="00:18:48.570" style="s2">facilitate community in a cyber way that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.760" end="00:18:51.930" style="s2">if the culture is healthy you know I</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.570" end="00:18:54.090" style="s2">people sort of begin by they might see</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.930" end="00:18:56.940" style="s2">me on YouTube they might watch a video</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.090" end="00:18:59.430" style="s2">they might want a level of community and</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.940" end="00:19:02.910" style="s2">I want there to be a place where they</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.430" end="00:19:06.540" style="s2">can go now as a Christian pastor in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.910" end="00:19:08.760" style="s2">practice in meatspace there&#39;s a church</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.540" end="00:19:10.740" style="s2">and so if I meet somebody and we have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.760" end="00:19:12.630" style="s2">good conversation I can say well you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.740" end="00:19:14.670" style="s2">come to my church and meet more people</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.630" end="00:19:17.220" style="s2">now since the jordan peterson thing i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.670" end="00:19:19.260" style="s2">say come to my local meetup and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.220" end="00:19:21.450" style="s2">been trying to help other meetups start</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.260" end="00:19:23.580" style="s2">here on the west coast and in the united</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.450" end="00:19:25.800" style="s2">states and canada but of course Kovan</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.580" end="00:19:26.430" style="s2">has sort of sort of put a damper on that</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.800" end="00:19:32.010" style="s2">for now</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.430" end="00:19:35.550" style="s2">so yes i but it all depends on time so</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.010" end="00:19:37.590" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of where I&#39;m at yeah I will</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.550" end="00:19:39.930" style="s2">say we&#39;ve also put quite a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.590" end="00:19:42.870" style="s2">thought into how we can arrange this</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.930" end="00:19:45.420" style="s2">discord server so that it functions due</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.870" end="00:19:47.130" style="s2">to both the community so yeah maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.420" end="00:19:50.280" style="s2">can actually network on only ideas there</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.130" end="00:19:54.030" style="s2">if we can&#39;t convey some wisdom anyway</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.280" end="00:19:58.140" style="s2">thanks Paul yep and and it&#39;s really hard</p>

<p begin="00:20:24.149" end="00:20:30.299" style="s2">an element to the the community here</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.429" end="00:20:32.279" style="s2">that I&#39;d love to see unfold where it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.299" end="00:20:34.470" style="s2">more easy and comfortable for us to</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.279" end="00:20:36.360" style="s2">maneuver through these various spots and</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.470" end="00:20:38.340" style="s2">these various modes of thinking and try</p>

<p begin="00:20:43.309" end="00:20:48.299" style="s2">to give us their perspective on the</p>

<p begin="00:20:48.299" end="00:20:52.590" style="s2">communities and they that like these</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.730" end="00:20:55.860" style="s2">kinds of conversations could happen</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.590" end="00:20:57.360" style="s2">spontaneously and be as profitable and</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.860" end="00:21:00.750" style="s2">it&#39;s enriching as we could make them</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.360" end="00:21:02.519" style="s2">because I it truly is I think as you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:24:37.130" end="00:24:44.030" style="s2">and the idea was that these communities</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.790" end="00:24:46.130" style="s2">could continue to grow and develop and</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.030" end="00:24:48.650" style="s2">hopefully be in conversation with each</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.130" end="00:24:53.060" style="s2">other now kuiper also had the</p>

<p begin="00:24:53.060" end="00:24:59.360" style="s2">would call the antithesis which would</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.610" end="00:25:00.590" style="s2">very much emphasize that word of Jesus I</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.360" end="00:25:02.210" style="s2">am the way the truth of the life no one</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.590" end="00:25:04.880" style="s2">comes to the Father except by me and</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.210" end="00:25:07.600" style="s2">bring the antithesis way down into</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.880" end="00:25:11.390" style="s2">theology into some very narrow ways and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.600" end="00:25:14.420" style="s2">so with kuiper you had this sort of both</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.390" end="00:25:16.960" style="s2">and which both attempted to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.420" end="00:25:20.600" style="s2">the antithetical nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.960" end="00:25:24.460" style="s2">either/or but also began to appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.600" end="00:25:27.800" style="s2">and leave space for both and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.460" end="00:25:30.560" style="s2">even though in the United States outside</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.800" end="00:25:32.720" style="s2">of let&#39;s say Dutch Reformed and even</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.560" end="00:25:35.180" style="s2">some neo evangelical circles</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:44.000" style="s2">who would recognize the name of Abram</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.180" end="00:25:45.410" style="s2">kuiper that has led to a posture in the</p>

<p begin="00:25:45.410" end="00:25:49.480" style="s2">Reformed Church I think in some ways has</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.000" end="00:25:54.230" style="s2">really tried to hold both sides of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.480" end="00:25:56.930" style="s2">dialectic together where okay we we</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.230" end="00:25:58.330" style="s2">believe what Jesus says is true and on</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.930" end="00:26:01.899" style="s2">the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.330" end="00:26:03.850" style="s2">understand that by virtue of let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.899" end="00:26:07.090" style="s2">Calvinist appreciation for total</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.850" end="00:26:10.899" style="s2">depravity none of us see clearly and</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.090" end="00:26:13.059" style="s2">what that means is that I get many more</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.899" end="00:26:16.390" style="s2">things wrong than I get right I should</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.059" end="00:26:17.919" style="s2">afford that same generosity towards my</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.390" end="00:26:21.820" style="s2">neighbors and the people with whom I</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.919" end="00:26:24.309" style="s2">want to have conversation so this sort</p>

<p begin="00:26:24.309" end="00:26:30.639" style="s2">freedom of religion and so it&#39;s I am NOT</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.039" end="00:26:32.409" style="s2">interested in you know burning John</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.639" end="00:26:35.260" style="s2">verve a key at the stake because he&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:26:40.720" end="00:26:48.159" style="s2">the bridges of meaning so let&#39;s continue</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.409" end="00:26:52.440" style="s2">to talk together and appreciate what we</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.159" end="00:26:55.899" style="s2">can about what other sides get right and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.440" end="00:26:58.539" style="s2">let&#39;s have this deal logos and learn</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.899" end="00:27:01.090" style="s2">from each other and I think Jesus also</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.539" end="00:27:05.289" style="s2">bears witness to this in the way in</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.090" end="00:27:07.750" style="s2">which he promoted and pursued his goals</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.289" end="00:27:10.960" style="s2">and my favourite example of that is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.750" end="00:27:13.659" style="s2">unauthorized exec Exorcist which I often</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.960" end="00:27:15.429" style="s2">like in Jordan Peterson to where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.659" end="00:27:18.070" style="s2">this guy running around delivering</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.429" end="00:27:19.630" style="s2">people from demons in Jesus name and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.070" end="00:27:23.049" style="s2">disciples want to enforce their</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.630" end="00:27:25.299" style="s2">intellectual property and say Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.049" end="00:27:28.769" style="s2">should we make him stop and Jesus says</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.299" end="00:27:31.450" style="s2">leave him alone and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.769" end="00:27:35.350" style="s2">Christians should on one hand be the</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.450" end="00:27:37.330" style="s2">most secure in what they believe but on</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.350" end="00:27:40.929" style="s2">the other hand also the most generous</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.330" end="00:27:45.700" style="s2">and and that generosity flows out of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.929" end="00:27:47.889" style="s2">security and my questions about other</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.700" end="00:27:51.940" style="s2">things that God allows in other ways</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.889" end="00:27:54.490" style="s2">that God works flows out of the security</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.940" end="00:27:57.630" style="s2">that I am in his hand and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.490" end="00:28:01.980" style="s2">these things that are feel some ways</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.630" end="00:28:01.980" style="s2">antithetical actually work together</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.120" end="00:28:06.880" style="s2">that&#39;s great thank you Paul you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.610" end="00:28:08.560" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.880" end="00:28:10.960" style="s2">reminds me a little bit of Chester&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.560" end="00:28:13.870" style="s2">tins orthodoxy and talking he talks a</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.960" end="00:28:16.090" style="s2">lot about her did paradoxes and how they</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.870" end="00:28:19.210" style="s2">actually kind of fit together um I</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.090" end="00:28:22.780" style="s2">bought my name is Eric Mike I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.210" end="00:28:25.600" style="s2">thinking a lot about what draws people</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.780" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">to religion and like what needs do they</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.600" end="00:28:30.040" style="s2">want filled from it and I was talking to</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:32.140" style="s2">my dad this weekend he was a Mormon</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.040" end="00:28:34.080" style="s2">missionary for two years and so he</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.140" end="00:28:37.210" style="s2">talked to a lot of people about this and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.080" end="00:28:38.470" style="s2">he came up with these like five</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.210" end="00:28:40.030" style="s2">different reasons I&#39;m curious to hear</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.470" end="00:28:41.380" style="s2">your take on them one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.030" end="00:28:44.110" style="s2">community I think that one&#39;s talked</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.380" end="00:28:48.190" style="s2">about a lot one of them is like the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.110" end="00:28:50.280" style="s2">ritual and then there&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.190" end="00:28:56.650" style="s2">putting your trust in some authority</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.280" end="00:29:00.520" style="s2">there&#39;s the kind of having a logical</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.650" end="00:29:04.180" style="s2">understanding of what the cosmos is it</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.520" end="00:29:07.810" style="s2">and what our place is in it and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.180" end="00:29:10.120" style="s2">fifth one was spirituality and I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.810" end="00:29:12.970" style="s2">curious if your what your take is on my</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.120" end="00:29:15.280" style="s2">feeling that most mainstream Christians</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.970" end="00:29:16.870" style="s2">and religions in general don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.280" end="00:29:20.130" style="s2">actually address the spirituality they</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.870" end="00:29:25.780" style="s2">just mostly address the other aspects</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.130" end="00:29:29.230" style="s2">that&#39;s a great list I just I just I just</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.780" end="00:29:32.010" style="s2">typed it and I&#39;m gonna keep it and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.230" end="00:29:32.010" style="s2">gonna use it</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.650" end="00:29:37.540" style="s2">pastors are thieves and if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.470" end="00:29:39.280" style="s2">trot a really good idea out in front of</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.540" end="00:29:43.630" style="s2">one he&#39;s gonna take it and run with it</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.280" end="00:29:46.570" style="s2">so I hope I hope you I hope you see that</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.630" end="00:29:51.400" style="s2">as the highest form of flattery for your</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.570" end="00:29:57.130" style="s2">father&#39;s idea I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.400" end="00:30:00.760" style="s2">a great list and I think well here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.130" end="00:30:02.800" style="s2">here&#39;s a so spirituality I actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.760" end="00:30:04.060" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be the topic of I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.800" end="00:30:06.630" style="s2">go into that quite a bit in the video</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.060" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">that I hope to record this afternoon</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.630" end="00:30:13.770" style="s2">what do we mean by spirit well I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:17.170" style="s2">in some ways one of the areas in which</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.770" end="00:30:20.320" style="s2">the word has not been fragmented and</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.170" end="00:30:20.890" style="s2">degraded is if we use it for an example</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.320" end="00:30:24.010" style="s2">like school</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.890" end="00:30:26.830" style="s2">spirit we all understand that when you</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.010" end="00:30:29.620" style="s2">were in school when you you had class</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.830" end="00:30:30.160" style="s2">spirit your own class had a spirit about</p>

<p begin="00:30:30.160" end="00:30:34.870" style="s2">that the teachers knew oh the class of</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.990" end="00:30:37.330" style="s2">2018 is this way the class of 2019 was</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.870" end="00:30:39.700" style="s2">that way individuals participated in</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.330" end="00:30:41.860" style="s2">that spirit nobody controlled that</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.700" end="00:30:46.059" style="s2">spirit that spirit was subject to</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.860" end="00:30:48.160" style="s2">influence and and again so much of Verve</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.059" end="00:30:51.700" style="s2">akise work I found helpful this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.160" end="00:30:53.799" style="s2">opponent processing ideas all of John&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.700" end="00:30:55.929" style="s2">work is sort of this middle space</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.799" end="00:30:58.660" style="s2">between you know between heaven and</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.929" end="00:31:00.250" style="s2">earth let&#39;s say and here I&#39;m gonna rip</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.660" end="00:31:03.910" style="s2">off and Christianize bunch of John&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.250" end="00:31:05.770" style="s2">work and I&#39;d find it nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.910" end="00:31:06.070" style="s2">flattering if he does the same thing to</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.770" end="00:31:08.470" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.070" end="00:31:11.799" style="s2">so spirituality has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.470" end="00:31:14.890" style="s2">question what makes the what makes the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.799" end="00:31:18.850" style="s2">tree move when I can&#39;t see the wind and</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.890" end="00:31:22.390" style="s2">and Jesus Jesus uses this and uses this</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.850" end="00:31:24.040" style="s2">illustration in John 3 where nobody</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.390" end="00:31:25.750" style="s2">knows where the spirit comes from and</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.040" end="00:31:30.730" style="s2">where the spirit blows what we we just</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.750" end="00:31:34.150" style="s2">sort of see its effects now I think the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.730" end="00:31:36.120" style="s2">LDS Church the apart of the reason it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.150" end="00:31:39.070" style="s2">been enormous ly successful</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.120" end="00:31:41.860" style="s2">evangelistically is because it gets a</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.070" end="00:31:45.130" style="s2">bunch of these things right community</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.860" end="00:31:48.210" style="s2">ritual Authority now I&#39;d have some</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.130" end="00:31:52.059" style="s2">disagreements with it on world view but</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.210" end="00:31:56.490" style="s2">spirituality has to do with what are the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.059" end="00:32:01.150" style="s2">what are the what are the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.490" end="00:32:05.980" style="s2">we influence and participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.150" end="00:32:07.900" style="s2">molding of this layer of reality that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.980" end="00:32:11.710" style="s2">can&#39;t fully control</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.900" end="00:32:14.980" style="s2">we&#39;re subject to its influence we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.710" end="00:32:21.750" style="s2">influence within it but in that way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.980" end="00:32:27.490" style="s2">sort of a space and I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.750" end="00:32:30.460" style="s2">churches do better or worse and churches</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.490" end="00:32:33.160" style="s2">do better or worse in this space and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.460" end="00:32:34.600" style="s2">think the rise of Pentecostalism</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.160" end="00:32:39.309" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.600" end="00:32:41.500" style="s2">a is a reaction both it&#39;s a reaction to</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.309" end="00:32:44.830" style="s2">the meaning crisis it&#39;s a reaction to</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.500" end="00:32:46.720" style="s2">modernity but if Luke from the bridges</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.830" end="00:32:50.320" style="s2">of meaning channel we&#39;re here and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.720" end="00:32:54.100" style="s2">randos it&#39;s also a reaction to as I</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.320" end="00:32:59.039" style="s2">think Jonathan or John has noted many</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.100" end="00:33:01.960" style="s2">times the out the imbalance of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.039" end="00:33:05.220" style="s2">propositional in terms of the four PS as</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.960" end="00:33:09.909" style="s2">they&#39;re working in religions and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.220" end="00:33:11.500" style="s2">spirituality so you have got in</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.909" end="00:33:12.760" style="s2">Christianity and the Trinity of God the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.500" end="00:33:17.909" style="s2">Father God the Son and God the Holy</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.760" end="00:33:20.890" style="s2">Spirit the Spirit is often for modernist</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.909" end="00:33:24.159" style="s2">theologians the most difficult member of</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.890" end="00:33:26.409" style="s2">the Trinity to talk about and whereas</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.159" end="00:33:31.150" style="s2">even with a theologian like John Calvin</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.409" end="00:33:34.419" style="s2">who actually places a great deal of</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.150" end="00:33:37.539" style="s2">emphasis on the work of the Holy Spirit</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.419" end="00:33:43.390" style="s2">the Holy Spirit is vital in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.539" end="00:33:46.570" style="s2">John Calvin&#39;s many have noted that well</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.390" end="00:33:48.340" style="s2">Calvinist churches at least until John</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.570" end="00:33:52.470" style="s2">Wimber and the vineyard movement</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.340" end="00:33:57.070" style="s2">Calvinists churches did really poorly at</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.470" end="00:34:01.840" style="s2">manifesting or appreciating the work of</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.070" end="00:34:06.539" style="s2">this spirit so I think as modernism</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.840" end="00:34:10.869" style="s2">continues to ebb we&#39;re going to see</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.539" end="00:34:14.080" style="s2">probably continued growth in this area</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.869" end="00:34:15.490" style="s2">and in terms of the LDS tradition you</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.080" end="00:34:18.359" style="s2">know that one of the things that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.490" end="00:34:21.940" style="s2">about the LDS tradition is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.359" end="00:34:25.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a prophetic tradition in which so a</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.940" end="00:34:26.649" style="s2">lot of what I know about the elder law</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.000" end="00:34:28.659" style="s2">church Jesus Christ of latter-day saints</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.649" end="00:34:31.960" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned from this homeless man that</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.659" end="00:34:33.580" style="s2">sleeps outside my door who there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.960" end="00:34:34.929" style="s2">restraining order against but that are</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.580" end="00:34:36.850" style="s2">you that from me but from the church</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.929" end="00:34:39.270" style="s2">building so anyway that&#39;s a long story</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.850" end="00:34:42.070" style="s2">but you know he was a dyed-in-the-wool</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.270" end="00:34:45.429" style="s2">Mormon and I&#39;ve learned a ton from him</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.070" end="00:34:47.889" style="s2">about LDS Church in its history and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.429" end="00:34:48.460" style="s2">the role that prophecy plays and so on</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.889" end="00:34:51.700" style="s2">that said</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.460" end="00:34:54.399" style="s2">the LDS Church in terms of that list of</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.700" end="00:34:58.480" style="s2">five things is probably more open to</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.399" end="00:35:05.760" style="s2">spirituality than let&#39;s say my tradition</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.480" end="00:35:09.190" style="s2">of Calvinism thanks</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.760" end="00:35:12.210" style="s2">very interesting would you um so just to</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.190" end="00:35:14.470" style="s2">clarify would you do you associate</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.210" end="00:35:16.359" style="s2">spirituality with the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.470" end="00:35:18.400" style="s2">knowing or with a more of a balance</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.359" end="00:35:20.460" style="s2">between them all oh that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.400" end="00:35:20.460" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.859" end="00:35:35.320" style="s2">definitely participatory definitely</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.960" end="00:35:42.880" style="s2">procedural definitely perspectival and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.320" end="00:35:44.830" style="s2">think I think probably Wade I we get</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:47.530" style="s2">into a lot of trouble and and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.830" end="00:35:50.589" style="s2">noticed this and this is this is this</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.530" end="00:35:52.060" style="s2">has shaped a lot of my life and I got</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.589" end="00:35:54.730" style="s2">this from my father because my father</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.060" end="00:35:57.250" style="s2">was also very high in openness but like</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.730" end="00:36:00.310" style="s2">me born into a conservative dutch</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.250" end="00:36:02.320" style="s2">reformed tradition and and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.310" end="00:36:05.920" style="s2">things I learned from my father was he</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.320" end="00:36:11.740" style="s2">always said you know be careful about</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.920" end="00:36:14.369" style="s2">saying more than you know now this when</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.740" end="00:36:16.780" style="s2">he uses knowledge in that sense are</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.369" end="00:36:18.790" style="s2">traditionally we very much tie that to</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.780" end="00:36:20.560" style="s2">propositional and in a modernist</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.790" end="00:36:23.250" style="s2">framework you know when you listen to</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.560" end="00:36:25.990" style="s2">sam harris talk he&#39;s very he&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.250" end="00:36:26.950" style="s2">propositional and so i think in some</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.990" end="00:36:34.349" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.950" end="00:36:37.270" style="s2">yeah spirituality is this really nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.349" end="00:36:39.940" style="s2">this nuanced dance between the other</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.270" end="00:36:43.359" style="s2">three and the propositional sort of has</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.940" end="00:36:48.640" style="s2">to mind its place where the other three</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.359" end="00:36:54.839" style="s2">are dancing in that way oh my god thanks</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.640" end="00:36:57.310" style="s2">for time yep hi hello Paul</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.839" end="00:37:00.700" style="s2">who&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.310" end="00:37:02.400" style="s2">it&#39;s pilgrim okay Pedro nice to meet you</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.700" end="00:37:06.690" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.400" end="00:37:09.450" style="s2">to meet you too you know I was raised a</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.690" end="00:37:12.540" style="s2">Christian but with time I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.450" end="00:37:17.460" style="s2">drifted away from it and my question to</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.540" end="00:37:20.880" style="s2">you is what is a way you would advise</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.460" end="00:37:24.800" style="s2">someone to rediscover Christianity are</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.880" end="00:37:27.600" style="s2">there readings you would advise and</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.800" end="00:37:34.380" style="s2">spiritual practices something like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.600" end="00:37:36.150" style="s2">I you know CS Lewis for me has I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.380" end="00:37:37.740" style="s2">taking notes now so I can because I</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.150" end="00:37:41.970" style="s2">think this conversation goes well I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.740" end="00:37:45.660" style="s2">probably use it for my channel CS Lewis</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.970" end="00:37:51.120" style="s2">for me has been sort of a mentor and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.660" end="00:37:54.960" style="s2">think in many ways CS Lewis walked the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.120" end="00:37:58.710" style="s2">paths that we are walking almost a</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:38:00.930" style="s2">hundred years before us because he was</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.710" end="00:38:04.740" style="s2">raised in the Anglican Church his mother</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.930" end="00:38:05.640" style="s2">died when he was six he by the time he</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.740" end="00:38:09.720" style="s2">was a teenager</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.640" end="00:38:12.510" style="s2">he was an angry atheist and his is</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.720" end="00:38:15.270" style="s2">running through Anglican boarding</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.510" end="00:38:18.990" style="s2">schools did not help him but hurt him</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.270" end="00:38:22.050" style="s2">and he in many way that he went through</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.990" end="00:38:24.750" style="s2">World War one survived it I mean he had</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.050" end="00:38:27.360" style="s2">one heck of a meaning crisis and he had</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.750" end="00:38:29.610" style="s2">to find his way out of it and so as</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.360" end="00:38:31.830" style="s2">Jonathan pazzo pazzo said you know in</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.610" end="00:38:33.990" style="s2">terms of great storytellers in the West</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.830" end="00:38:36.980" style="s2">at least in the in the english-speaking</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.990" end="00:38:40.170" style="s2">world we&#39;ve got Tolkien and Lewis</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.980" end="00:38:41.490" style="s2">Tolkien never left the faith although</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.170" end="00:38:43.320" style="s2">someone mentioned in the comment that</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.490" end="00:38:45.720" style="s2">his parents were Methodists so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.320" end="00:38:50.250" style="s2">interesting that you know he went back</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.720" end="00:38:53.130" style="s2">towards a more sacramental tradition</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.250" end="00:38:56.760" style="s2">Lewis tried to talk about mere</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.130" end="00:38:58.980" style="s2">christianity where he said you know all</p>

<p begin="00:38:58.980" end="00:39:03.750" style="s2">this hallway and each of the traditions</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.720" end="00:39:06.720" style="s2">are rooms off of it i I think for</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.750" end="00:39:08.070" style="s2">someone who as you&#39;ve described and</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.720" end="00:39:10.320" style="s2">obviously if we had a longer</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.070" end="00:39:11.640" style="s2">conversation we&#39;d go further into the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.320" end="00:39:13.230" style="s2">details which is why I do these</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.640" end="00:39:15.060" style="s2">conversations on my channel although I</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.230" end="00:39:19.770" style="s2">don&#39;t have time for it</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.060" end="00:39:22.440" style="s2">I think I think you have to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.770" end="00:39:24.540" style="s2">follow your salience Lance Lance you</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.440" end="00:39:30.030" style="s2">know your salience landscape and I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.540" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">and and because your mind is you are</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.030" end="00:39:34.380" style="s2">working on stuff that your conscious</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:36.900" style="s2">self doesn&#39;t know about and I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.380" end="00:39:40.380" style="s2">peterson spoke eloquently about a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.900" end="00:39:44.760" style="s2">these dynamics and and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.380" end="00:39:48.000" style="s2">figure out well what what ideas what</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.760" end="00:39:51.860" style="s2">corners of my consciousness congress</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.000" end="00:39:57.150" style="s2">need addressing now i think finding a</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.860" end="00:40:00.330" style="s2">church finding a member of the clergy or</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.150" end="00:40:02.730" style="s2">a small group or a friend or a mentor</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.330" end="00:40:05.520" style="s2">would be tremendously helpful in this</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.730" end="00:40:06.720" style="s2">and I think mentors can be found dead or</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.520" end="00:40:09.330" style="s2">alive</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.720" end="00:40:12.060" style="s2">and so CS Lewis for me as a mentor tole</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.330" end="00:40:14.250" style="s2">keen as a mentor I think John Verve a</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.060" end="00:40:17.640" style="s2">key in many ways is a mentor for me he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.250" end="00:40:21.270" style="s2">taught me so many things there are also</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.640" end="00:40:23.700" style="s2">been pastors in my life my father of</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.270" end="00:40:26.040" style="s2">course one but Dave Beale and it was a</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.700" end="00:40:28.500" style="s2">pastor of mine and in college and</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.040" end="00:40:30.990" style="s2">seminary taught me a ton Dante Venegas</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.500" end="00:40:33.630" style="s2">and so I think look around for</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.990" end="00:40:37.160" style="s2">communities and groups and mentors who</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.630" end="00:40:40.800" style="s2">can and and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.160" end="00:40:43.110" style="s2">follow your interests because something</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.800" end="00:40:46.020" style="s2">is is coming up on your salience</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.110" end="00:40:48.740" style="s2">landscape for a reason well figure out</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.020" end="00:40:52.460" style="s2">what that reason is and pursue it and</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.740" end="00:40:57.630" style="s2">but I think there&#39;s no substitute for</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.460" end="00:41:00.330" style="s2">finding a church and and be and I often</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.630" end="00:41:02.840" style="s2">frame that as training the elephant so</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.330" end="00:41:04.530" style="s2">you&#39;re so kind of the Jonathan height</p>

<p begin="00:41:30.150" end="00:41:36.420" style="s2">have been ways in which people have we</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.220" end="00:42:06.600" style="s2">mentor right now and you know I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.880" end="00:42:10.110" style="s2">explore the works of CS Lewis definitely</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.600" end="00:42:14.210" style="s2">to start and well I really appreciate I</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.110" end="00:42:14.210" style="s2">really appreciate it thank you thank you</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.350" end="00:42:25.410" style="s2">um sure it&#39;s about you know when I</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.380" end="00:42:27.930" style="s2">listen to John&#39;s talks it seems like his</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.410" end="00:42:29.850" style="s2">core axiom is this idea that we can no</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.930" end="00:42:32.160" style="s2">longer live in the two worlds mythology</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.850" end="00:42:34.230" style="s2">and I haven&#39;t listened to all your</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.160" end="00:42:36.390" style="s2">videos unfortunately but I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.230" end="00:42:39.270" style="s2">that&#39;s a door like how you address that</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.390" end="00:42:41.340" style="s2">because I think that&#39;s you know if if I</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.270" end="00:42:44.640" style="s2">were to have a criticism of John that</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.340" end="00:42:46.350" style="s2">would be I&#39;m the core obvious one he</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.640" end="00:42:48.060" style="s2">starts from that premise and moves</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.350" end="00:42:51.470" style="s2">everything forward so I just wondered</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.060" end="00:42:54.600" style="s2">what your thoughts were on that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.470" end="00:42:59.520" style="s2">well you know two worlds mythology is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.600" end="00:43:07.470" style="s2">fairly low-resolution term that maps on</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.520" end="00:43:11.700" style="s2">to a lot and I am also suspicious that</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.470" end="00:43:15.710" style="s2">the two worlds mythology isn&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.700" end="00:43:21.240" style="s2">be easily dispensed with now I</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.710" end="00:43:23.400" style="s2">appreciate John&#39;s work in this area and</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.240" end="00:43:25.650" style="s2">again his point I mean the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.400" end="00:43:27.810" style="s2">the D key difference between sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.650" end="00:43:30.570" style="s2">the way our corner of the Internet has</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.810" end="00:43:32.810" style="s2">been bisected between let&#39;s say theists</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.570" end="00:43:32.810" style="s2">and non-vegans</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.320" end="00:43:40.760" style="s2">that the point that he makes about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.450" end="00:43:42.390" style="s2">vigor in which the modernist scientific</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.760" end="00:43:48.289" style="s2">achievements have</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.390" end="00:43:51.599" style="s2">undermined previous theologies and</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.289" end="00:43:55.019" style="s2">philosophies and spiritualities of</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.599" end="00:43:59.579" style="s2">Christianity there&#39;s too it&#39;s simply</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.019" end="00:44:02.339" style="s2">dishonest to under appreciate that truth</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.579" end="00:44:06.299" style="s2">because one feels timid or insecure</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.339" end="00:44:11.640" style="s2">about the the sunk costs in their own</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.299" end="00:44:15.140" style="s2">religious tribe okay but to world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.640" end="00:44:18.990" style="s2">mythologies perfect in the imperfect</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.140" end="00:44:22.099" style="s2">antithetical verses of binary versus</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.990" end="00:44:25.769" style="s2">analog there are all these dualities</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.099" end="00:44:28.829" style="s2">some of which so nicely map on to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.769" end="00:44:33.539" style="s2">two worlds mythology and the tube the</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.829" end="00:44:37.950" style="s2">world&#39;s mythology is simply so handy at</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.539" end="00:44:42.089" style="s2">at migrating so many of these dualisms</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.950" end="00:44:45.119" style="s2">um I think it&#39;s just gonna be so darn</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.089" end="00:44:46.799" style="s2">handy we can&#39;t get rid of it it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.119" end="00:44:50.240" style="s2">like there&#39;s this somebody in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.799" end="00:44:53.759" style="s2">bridges of meaning server put this</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.240" end="00:44:57.000" style="s2">cartoon Morty and whatever I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.759" end="00:45:00.269" style="s2">that&#39;s not versed in these guys but um</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.000" end="00:45:02.549" style="s2">Marty but anyway it&#39;s this this guy in</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.269" end="00:45:05.519" style="s2">this kid and this kid was using a level</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.549" end="00:45:07.440" style="s2">and the guys like flat you know you</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.519" end="00:45:09.390" style="s2">don&#39;t know flat and then he goes and he</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.440" end="00:45:11.849" style="s2">you know does all this stuff to create a</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.390" end="00:45:15.089" style="s2">space in his floor that is perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.849" end="00:45:17.460" style="s2">flat because gosh that level that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.089" end="00:45:20.430" style="s2">know water and a bubble and a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.460" end="00:45:23.009" style="s2">lines you&#39;re gonna judge level by that</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.430" end="00:45:25.109" style="s2">well I think in many ways to low to</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.009" end="00:45:27.630" style="s2">world&#39;s mythology is the bubble and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.109" end="00:45:31.769" style="s2">water and the lines and it&#39;s just too</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.630" end="00:45:34.799" style="s2">darn handy for regular people to use and</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.769" end="00:45:38.130" style="s2">to map so many things on so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.799" end="00:45:40.140" style="s2">think it&#39;s going away and you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.130" end="00:45:43.529" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s going away it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.140" end="00:45:46.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like the level it might be a low</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.529" end="00:45:51.170" style="s2">resolution instrument but it&#39;s so darn</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.200" end="00:45:54.150" style="s2">handy it&#39;s gonna keep finding usefulness</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.170" end="00:45:55.980" style="s2">wow that was a really good answer yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.150" end="00:45:59.010" style="s2">sort of dude it is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.980" end="00:46:01.220" style="s2">in the Jesus and sneaking in the science</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.010" end="00:46:03.960" style="s2">myself but actually I like your</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.220" end="00:46:06.990" style="s2">conception better of it as a tool that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.960" end="00:46:09.109" style="s2">already adaptive and and it just has a</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.990" end="00:46:13.140" style="s2">deeper meaning than what we&#39;re giving it</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.109" end="00:46:16.490" style="s2">short to call it you know to world</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.140" end="00:46:16.490" style="s2">mythology thank you</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.240" end="00:46:31.859" style="s2">so Paul on that subject of the Holy</p>

<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:03.650" style="s2">this space between the infinite and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.650" end="00:49:05.900" style="s2">finite this and in my last conversation</p>

<p begin="00:49:05.900" end="00:49:14.330" style="s2">versus suchness right in that space we</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.100" end="00:49:18.290" style="s2">begin to taste glory but what glory is I</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.330" end="00:49:20.660" style="s2">think in some ways is is where it all</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.290" end="00:49:23.990" style="s2">comes together when we&#39;re right over at</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.660" end="00:49:29.120" style="s2">that edge staring into the infinite and</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.990" end="00:49:32.960" style="s2">we get the sense of wow and and so when</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.120" end="00:49:35.840" style="s2">the when the when the Tom Brady and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.960" end="00:49:37.400" style="s2">supermodel hook up there&#39;s like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.840" end="00:49:39.200" style="s2">something there we all envy and hate</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.400" end="00:49:40.790" style="s2">them perhaps and maybe they&#39;re jerks but</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.200" end="00:49:44.390" style="s2">there&#39;s something there and when the</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.790" end="00:49:46.880" style="s2">history teacher nerd somehow teaches</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.390" end="00:49:49.610" style="s2">history in such a way that people come</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.880" end="00:49:52.010" style="s2">out of that class wanting wanting more</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.610" end="00:49:54.310" style="s2">and the beautiful thing about history is</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.010" end="00:49:58.040" style="s2">that we keep making more of it well</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.310" end="00:50:01.100" style="s2">there&#39;s you know glory is in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.040" end="00:50:04.610" style="s2">where the morning and the suchness meet</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.100" end="00:50:09.590" style="s2">and we get an inkling of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.610" end="00:50:11.000" style="s2">combinatorial explosiveness okay so here</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.590" end="00:50:13.820" style="s2">we have the holy spirit which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.000" end="00:50:16.220" style="s2">something we&#39;re not going to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.820" end="00:50:16.880" style="s2">anytime soon so it&#39;s gonna be worlds of</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.220" end="00:50:19.790" style="s2">fuzziness</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.880" end="00:50:22.730" style="s2">and we have glory which is where more</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.790" end="00:50:24.920" style="s2">nests and suchness meet and</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.730" end="00:50:27.560" style="s2">you know why is glory always connected</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.920" end="00:50:29.780" style="s2">with light well what is light light is</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.560" end="00:50:32.300" style="s2">when all of you know we use a prism to</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.780" end="00:50:34.730" style="s2">refract light and see its components</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.300" end="00:50:36.980" style="s2">well white light is when all of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.730" end="00:50:40.220" style="s2">components are there and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.980" end="00:50:41.750" style="s2">there integrated and harmoniously and we</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.220" end="00:50:44.480" style="s2">get a sense with light that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.750" end="00:50:46.310" style="s2">overwhelming to us because our eyes can</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.480" end="00:50:48.710" style="s2">only take so much of it and our being</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.310" end="00:50:50.300" style="s2">can only take so much of it so now we</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.710" end="00:50:52.760" style="s2">have glory now we have the holy spirit</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.300" end="00:50:56.140" style="s2">and now you want to talk about grace</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.760" end="00:51:02.060" style="s2">well grace is in some ways the space</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.140" end="00:51:07.430" style="s2">where tiny creatures can taste glory and</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.060" end="00:51:09.320" style="s2">not have it overwhelm us and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.430" end="00:51:12.100" style="s2">Christianity has worked this in lots of</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.320" end="00:51:16.370" style="s2">different ways but the word grace</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.100" end="00:51:21.380" style="s2">encompasses the more nests and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.370" end="00:51:23.450" style="s2">suchness to you and that&#39;s where let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.380" end="00:51:26.870" style="s2">say now I&#39;ll do some riffing on John</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.450" end="00:51:30.310" style="s2">Calvin&#39;s theology for John Calvin the</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.870" end="00:51:35.750" style="s2">the Holy Spirit was the applier and</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.310" end="00:51:40.250" style="s2">grace was that which was applied so that</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.750" end="00:51:43.220" style="s2">glory can be seen and tasted and what</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.250" end="00:51:47.510" style="s2">that does in us is instill within us a</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.220" end="00:51:51.530" style="s2">motivation and a crisis because what</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.510" end="00:51:55.010" style="s2">glory does is on one hand gosh I want</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.530" end="00:51:58.970" style="s2">more on the other hand oh I can&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.010" end="00:52:03.610" style="s2">it and if you go back and you I think it</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.970" end="00:52:06.070" style="s2">was well I was at Charles Finney or no</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.610" end="00:52:10.340" style="s2">what&#39;s the what&#39;s the conservative</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.070" end="00:52:13.340" style="s2">school and anyway he was a he was a</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.340" end="00:52:14.810" style="s2">Christian who Christians every now and</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.340" end="00:52:16.520" style="s2">then and I&#39;m not going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.810" end="00:52:18.080" style="s2">others because I don&#39;t know and I used</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.520" end="00:52:21.860" style="s2">the Jordan Peterson move</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.080" end="00:52:24.790" style="s2">I know Christianity okay and there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.860" end="00:52:31.130" style="s2">moments when Christians are in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.790" end="00:52:33.200" style="s2">visited by God and and you know Pascal</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.130" end="00:52:36.470" style="s2">had this and after he died they found</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.200" end="00:52:39.080" style="s2">sewn in one of his favorite pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.470" end="00:52:42.410" style="s2">clothing this you know this thing about</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.080" end="00:52:43.160" style="s2">fire and it was moody I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.410" end="00:52:45.830" style="s2">Dwight Moody</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.160" end="00:52:48.770" style="s2">it was moody or Finny who had this</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.830" end="00:52:51.770" style="s2">experience once where God came upon him</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.770" end="00:52:54.950" style="s2">and and as so often happens with this</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.770" end="00:52:57.740" style="s2">people say Lord if you don&#39;t let off of</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.950" end="00:53:00.470" style="s2">me you&#39;ll destroy me well that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.740" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">when the Holy Spirit and glory and grace</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.470" end="00:53:05.960" style="s2">grace is in some ways the eyedropper</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:09.109" style="s2">that administers the exact right amount</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.960" end="00:53:14.030" style="s2">of the conjunction of Morna sand</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.109" end="00:53:16.910" style="s2">suchness to us so that it leads us on a</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.030" end="00:53:30.800" style="s2">path where we&#39;re going to go further up</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.910" end="00:53:36.340" style="s2">and further in hey Paul it&#39;s Jacob</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.800" end="00:53:38.960" style="s2">stalking you again I wanted to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.340" end="00:53:41.240" style="s2">specifically regarding the religion</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.960" end="00:53:43.099" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion like I think most</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.240" end="00:53:46.310" style="s2">people would say that central to</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.099" end="00:53:51.050" style="s2">religion is the idea of God what does</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.310" end="00:53:54.369" style="s2">the god idea add to all the non religion</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.050" end="00:54:00.970" style="s2">religions non-theistic philosophies that</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.369" end="00:54:03.500" style="s2">we&#39;ve been trying to find meaning in who</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.970" end="00:54:06.619" style="s2">and you know one of the things that over</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.500" end="00:54:09.260" style="s2">these last three years that I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.619" end="00:54:13.339" style="s2">a lot about has been and really what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.260" end="00:54:18.020" style="s2">what was exposed in my theological and</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.339" end="00:54:19.670" style="s2">philosophical deficiencies was what do</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.020" end="00:54:25.670" style="s2">we mean by this little three-letter word</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.670" end="00:54:29.230" style="s2">god that that you know the the Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.670" end="00:54:38.869" style="s2">tradition quite rightly warned us</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.230" end="00:54:42.109" style="s2">against taking lightly I sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.869" end="00:54:45.980" style="s2">what I said about the two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.109" end="00:54:48.470" style="s2">mythology I think the same way about the</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.980" end="00:54:52.849" style="s2">God idea it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.470" end="00:54:54.230" style="s2">- darn handy and if there&#39;s one and John</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.849" end="00:54:59.090" style="s2">and I have talked about this and John</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.230" end="00:55:04.460" style="s2">has mentioned it as a pastor who now is</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.090" end="00:55:06.430" style="s2">third-generation practitioner in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.460" end="00:55:09.050" style="s2">meaning crisis is a very old thing I</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.430" end="00:55:13.119" style="s2">think it comes in waves</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.050" end="00:55:15.440" style="s2">so third-generation practitioner in</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.119" end="00:55:19.940" style="s2">working on the front lines of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.440" end="00:55:25.390" style="s2">meaning crisis I think the idea of God</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.940" end="00:55:29.300" style="s2">is simply too useful and scalable an</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.390" end="00:55:31.099" style="s2">idea that it&#39;s simply not going to be</p>

<p begin="00:55:42.349" end="00:55:50.200" style="s2">it or or imagine the absence of it but I</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.730" end="00:55:55.630" style="s2">think what we&#39;re seeing in real time is</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.200" end="00:55:58.760" style="s2">that philosophers are only a small</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.630" end="00:56:02.290" style="s2">segment of godsgarden of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.760" end="00:56:05.630" style="s2">and if you&#39;re actually going to</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.290" end="00:56:09.040" style="s2">religions for as long as we&#39;ve known</p>

<p begin="00:56:48.710" end="00:56:53.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason you know when I was</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.140" end="00:56:54.950" style="s2">reading I started looking at Plato&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.510" end="00:56:57.619" style="s2">Republic because I was reading the</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.950" end="00:56:59.810" style="s2">divine conspiracy Dallas Willard&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.619" end="00:57:02.390" style="s2">Dallas Willard was a professor of</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.810" end="00:57:05.599" style="s2">philosophy at University of Southern</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.390" end="00:57:08.000" style="s2">and he was making some connections</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.599" end="00:57:10.549" style="s2">between play-doh and the Sermon on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.000" end="00:57:12.619" style="s2">Mount so I I wanted to look at Plato&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.549" end="00:57:16.819" style="s2">Republic in the Greek and so I bought it</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.619" end="00:57:18.920" style="s2">and then I began to notice that Plato</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.819" end="00:57:24.200" style="s2">had Socrates talk about the gods and</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.920" end="00:57:27.079" style="s2">talk about God and it&#39;s like what does</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.200" end="00:57:29.660" style="s2">Plato mean when he uses God</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.079" end="00:57:32.539" style="s2">singular what did Plato mean what he</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.660" end="00:57:36.140" style="s2">used when contemporary editors would</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.539" end="00:57:39.890" style="s2">rightly use gods with a lowercase G and</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.140" end="00:57:47.329" style="s2">God with a capital G it ain&#39;t going away</p>

<p begin="00:59:29.640" end="00:59:48.060" style="s2">two hours worth of questions you talked</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.690" end="00:59:52.490" style="s2">about sin as a future versus of think</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.060" end="00:59:54.810" style="s2">about these religions without religion</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.490" end="00:59:58.800" style="s2">does it strike you they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.810" end="01:00:04.440" style="s2">adjust the human iniquity or dissonance</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.800" end="01:00:07.080" style="s2">as future well it&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.440" end="01:00:08.460" style="s2">question see there&#39;s a reason pastors</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.080" end="01:00:10.350" style="s2">don&#39;t do these question and answers</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.460" end="01:00:13.160" style="s2">because you ask us really hard questions</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.350" end="01:00:13.160" style="s2">they can get us in trouble</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.630" end="01:00:52.470" style="s2">I think in Christianity ultimately it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.710" end="01:00:52.470" style="s2">God that deals with sin and sin is both</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.400" end="01:01:04.350" style="s2">transgression which is like rebellion</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.140" end="01:01:11.370" style="s2">and can sometimes be missing the mark</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.350" end="01:01:16.300" style="s2">which is you know perhaps not so willful</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.370" end="01:01:22.600" style="s2">failing to achieve the potential that</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.300" end="01:01:25.770" style="s2">God gave us and desires for us the the</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.600" end="01:01:34.420" style="s2">line between those two things is</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.770" end="01:01:36.190" style="s2">obviously a normative line now one of</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.420" end="01:01:38.760" style="s2">the things I&#39;m deeply indebted to dr.</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.190" end="01:01:41.850" style="s2">Jim the cardiologist from Idaho was</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.760" end="01:01:43.630" style="s2">introducing me to Wilfrid Sellars and</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.850" end="01:01:45.940" style="s2">Daniel bond evacs</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.630" end="01:01:47.620" style="s2">video where he lays out the difference</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.940" end="01:01:53.840" style="s2">between the manifest and the scientific</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.620" end="01:01:55.460" style="s2">image the different</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.840" end="01:01:59.660" style="s2">between the manifest of the scientific</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.460" end="01:02:01.910" style="s2">image in some ways maps on to this</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.660" end="01:02:05.270" style="s2">question because the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.910" end="01:02:09.440" style="s2">them is normativity science can tell you</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.270" end="01:02:13.250" style="s2">what is the manifest image says what</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.440" end="01:02:17.150" style="s2">should be and this weird space of this</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.250" end="01:02:21.860" style="s2">is gonna get strong so excited this</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.150" end="01:02:26.960" style="s2">weird space of potential and not meeting</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.860" end="01:02:31.580" style="s2">up with one&#39;s potential it&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.960" end="01:02:33.440" style="s2">clear where to map that on to in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.580" end="01:02:38.170" style="s2">manifest versus scientific image</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.440" end="01:02:41.300" style="s2">framework and and whenever you have</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.170" end="01:02:44.960" style="s2">items like this that can&#39;t be easily</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.300" end="01:02:50.660" style="s2">mapped on to them they cause dissonance</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.960" end="01:02:52.610" style="s2">and so one of the now so a religion</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.660" end="01:02:56.030" style="s2">that&#39;s a religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.610" end="01:02:58.580" style="s2">is a really clever way of trying to get</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.030" end="01:03:02.150" style="s2">at some things well what are we trying</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.580" end="01:03:04.250" style="s2">to get at and now over my videos over</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.150" end="01:03:06.080" style="s2">the last few weeks a couple of months</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.250" end="01:03:10.760" style="s2">I&#39;ve been really working on this</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.080" end="01:03:13.970" style="s2">question of religiosity and so when when</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.760" end="01:03:18.260" style="s2">John Verve a key says an economy of an</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.970" end="01:03:21.470" style="s2">ecology of practice well a religious II</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.260" end="01:03:24.770" style="s2">word for that is ritual and when we talk</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.470" end="01:03:29.150" style="s2">about community a religious a religious</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.770" end="01:03:32.270" style="s2">E word for that is church and so okay so</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.150" end="01:03:36.800" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to create something that</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.270" end="01:03:42.860" style="s2">will not have the observed deficiencies</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.800" end="01:03:47.770" style="s2">and limitations of the items that are</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.860" end="01:03:51.860" style="s2">already on the spirituality market and</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.770" end="01:03:53.630" style="s2">and so you know in this way you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.860" end="01:03:55.850" style="s2">whereas someone might come to me and say</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.630" end="01:03:58.070" style="s2">Oh Paul you should be you shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.850" end="01:04:01.070" style="s2">down for John&#39;s work with this religion</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.070" end="01:04:03.920" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion no because I</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.070" end="01:04:07.759" style="s2">understand this the good faith in which</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.920" end="01:04:10.729" style="s2">John is practicing and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.759" end="01:04:13.429" style="s2">what John learns when when John</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.729" end="01:04:16.909" style="s2">addresses the deficiencies that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.429" end="01:04:18.619" style="s2">seen in religion well look at my first</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.909" end="01:04:20.299" style="s2">video with John who is John reveille</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.619" end="01:04:22.880" style="s2">Qian what is he and what is the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.299" end="01:04:25.009" style="s2">crisis you know why do I when I</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.880" end="01:04:29.179" style="s2">interview people want to take some time</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.009" end="01:04:31.459" style="s2">to dig into their story because the more</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.179" end="01:04:34.429" style="s2">nests and the suchness of John verve a</p>

<p begin="01:04:34.429" end="01:04:41.569" style="s2">the crazy thing about human beings is</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.219" end="01:04:45.319" style="s2">very little is wasted and if you expand</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.569" end="01:04:49.669" style="s2">this into Christian ecclesiology I might</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.319" end="01:04:51.729" style="s2">argue that perhaps theoretically oh gosh</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.669" end="01:04:57.019" style="s2">now I have just triggered universalism</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.729" end="01:05:01.239" style="s2">very little is wasted in terms of you</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.019" end="01:05:04.729" style="s2">know John&#39;s story and his the the</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.239" end="01:05:08.899" style="s2">reasons why he looks at religion and</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.729" end="01:05:11.359" style="s2">says ah I can&#39;t go there I can&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.899" end="01:05:14.479" style="s2">there&#39;s there there&#39;s too much there and</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.359" end="01:05:18.319" style="s2">and I want to go out and I want to get</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.479" end="01:05:20.269" style="s2">it I want to I want to do it better that</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.319" end="01:05:23.119" style="s2">when you listen to John and when you</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.269" end="01:05:28.459" style="s2">look at his passion yeah this is part of</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.119" end="01:05:34.639" style="s2">things I love about him he&#39;s he he wants</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.459" end="01:05:38.829" style="s2">glory he wants grace he wants it all and</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.639" end="01:05:41.449" style="s2">he wants to start tasting it now amen</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.829" end="01:05:44.509" style="s2">that drive is something that I as a</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.449" end="01:05:51.199" style="s2">Christian minister appreciate in a world</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.509" end="01:05:53.419" style="s2">of um settling for crap and so when I</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.199" end="01:05:55.729" style="s2">look at John Verve a key and I look at</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.419" end="01:05:57.409" style="s2">church planters I don&#39;t see a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.729" end="01:06:00.079" style="s2">difference because church planters go</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.409" end="01:06:04.099" style="s2">out there and say I&#39;ve seen problems in</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.079" end="01:06:07.219" style="s2">the church and it&#39;s been a disaster I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.099" end="01:06:10.059" style="s2">gonna finally get church right and they</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.219" end="01:06:12.949" style="s2">all fail every one of them</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.059" end="01:06:15.229" style="s2">John Verve a key says I want a religion</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.949" end="01:06:18.889" style="s2">that isn&#39;t a religion I want to I want</p>

<p begin="01:06:40.780" end="01:06:50.170" style="s2">I&#39;m coming with you John me too because</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.970" end="01:06:55.510" style="s2">sin is a feature and a bug it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:06:58.930" end="01:07:04.080" style="s2">and church planters like what I&#39;ve had</p>

<p begin="01:07:40.960" end="01:07:45.490" style="s2">should listen to them but then he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.090" end="01:07:46.930" style="s2">paying attention to what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.490" end="01:07:49.630" style="s2">the culture and I&#39;m doing that with John</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.930" end="01:07:51.730" style="s2">John&#39;s read books I&#39;ll never read John&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.630" end="01:07:54.190" style="s2">dumb things and dabbled with things and</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.730" end="01:07:57.100" style="s2">practice things I&#39;ll never practice I</p>

<p begin="01:08:00.070" end="01:08:12.580" style="s2">and so get this by listening to John I</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.250" end="01:08:15.160" style="s2">can benefit from his sin oh oh am I</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.580" end="01:08:17.950" style="s2">saying John&#39;s the center yes me too I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.160" end="01:08:19.990" style="s2">probably a worst one I I would think</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.950" end="01:08:23.859" style="s2">most definitely cuz I know my sins I</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.990" end="01:08:28.630" style="s2">don&#39;t know his but here&#39;s the thing sins</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.859" end="01:08:31.600" style="s2">of both John&#39;s um transgressions as I</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.630" end="01:08:33.700" style="s2">would call them but also his failure to</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.600" end="01:08:35.290" style="s2">reach his potential and John is an</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.700" end="01:08:37.240" style="s2">honest guy that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.290" end="01:08:38.740" style="s2">don&#39;t think I&#39;m saying anything that</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.240" end="01:08:40.750" style="s2">would offend him and again this is part</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.740" end="01:08:44.500" style="s2">of the reason I love him as a</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.750" end="01:08:46.180" style="s2">conversation partner because now John is</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.500" end="01:08:48.160" style="s2">so much more gracious than I am and he</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.180" end="01:08:50.440" style="s2">would you would be couching these things</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.160" end="01:08:52.660" style="s2">and all of his you know all of the great</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.440" end="01:08:54.370" style="s2">ways that he does that and I&#39;m I&#39;m an</p>

<p begin="01:08:58.569" end="01:09:05.850" style="s2">bad pastor bad youtuber but I can learn</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.470" end="01:09:10.450" style="s2">from John sins if I listen to him</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.850" end="01:09:12.460" style="s2">both these categories of sin and so and</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.450" end="01:09:14.859" style="s2">I can learn from John&#39;s religion that</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.460" end="01:09:17.350" style="s2">isn&#39;t a religion if I listen to him in</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.859" end="01:09:20.980" style="s2">humility because my practice of</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.350" end="01:09:23.980" style="s2">Christianity is full of sin both the</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.980" end="01:09:26.890" style="s2">lack of potential and the rebellion that</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.980" end="01:09:32.980" style="s2">is in me so I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="01:09:47.680" end="01:09:51.069" style="s2">how do you characterize and</p>

<p begin="01:09:51.069" end="01:09:56.620" style="s2">design such as natural selection and</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.530" end="01:09:59.580" style="s2">central pattern generators versus more</p>

<p begin="01:10:21.970" end="01:10:25.870" style="s2">because John in a sense and I are</p>

<p begin="01:10:34.800" end="01:10:41.020" style="s2">John Verve a key is coming at it from</p>

<p begin="01:10:41.020" end="01:10:46.960" style="s2">discipline and again there&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.440" end="01:10:48.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned from John it&#39;s discipline</p>

<p begin="01:10:48.970" end="01:10:55.390" style="s2">terminology don&#39;t equivocate I can hear</p>

<p begin="01:11:10.300" end="01:11:19.360" style="s2">deeply can we penetrate this conundrum</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.010" end="01:11:22.120" style="s2">well here&#39;s the thing I</p>

<p begin="01:11:50.080" end="01:11:55.480" style="s2">question this is a video I did in 2019</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.540" end="01:11:57.400" style="s2">is personhood detection merely the</p>

<p begin="01:12:14.290" end="01:12:18.580" style="s2">what I saw in the god number one God</p>

<p begin="01:12:54.790" end="01:13:00.190" style="s2">encapsulated what he said it&#39;s better if</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.570" end="01:13:01.660" style="s2">there is no God because if there is a</p>

<p begin="01:13:05.980" end="01:13:13.810" style="s2">with all due respect to the atheists and</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.530" end="01:13:19.030" style="s2">the non theists well gosh the the extent</p>

<p begin="01:13:50.890" end="01:13:58.330" style="s2">Christians have known this question for</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.890" end="01:14:01.780" style="s2">a very long time and weighed it and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.330" end="01:14:06.070" style="s2">answer they always come up with is sort</p>

<p begin="01:14:10.180" end="01:14:17.830" style="s2">into this lines that I think you nicely</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.780" end="01:14:19.660" style="s2">laid out how do you characterize and</p>

<p begin="01:24:15.219" end="01:24:19.330" style="s2">and budding into their conversations I</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.020" end="01:24:22.960" style="s2">see this I see John verb a key sporting</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.330" end="01:24:25.270" style="s2">this and I say I can use that I can that</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.960" end="01:24:27.820" style="s2">can that can help me understand glory</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.270" end="01:24:32.410" style="s2">and we just put this together this</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.820" end="01:24:34.510" style="s2">morning gosh I want to I want to talk to</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.410" end="01:24:37.930" style="s2">John Verve a key there&#39;s common Grace</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.510" end="01:24:40.090" style="s2">and John Verve a key but the antithesis</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.930" end="01:24:42.790" style="s2">is still real because the antithesis</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.090" end="01:24:46.510" style="s2">provides power for the systems as well</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.790" end="01:24:49.590" style="s2">and so I think you said it really well</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.510" end="01:24:54.239" style="s2">Nick I want I have my whole life long</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.590" end="01:24:58.020" style="s2">have you earned to see churches handle</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.239" end="01:25:04.719" style="s2">disagreement and Liat not lose focus on</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.020" end="01:25:08.429" style="s2">antithetical things so you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.719" end="01:25:10.960" style="s2">I don&#39;t think you could have honored me</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.429" end="01:25:13.179" style="s2">in any greater way Nick than the way</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.960" end="01:25:14.540" style="s2">that you framed this question because in</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.179" end="01:25:17.480" style="s2">many ways</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.540" end="01:25:21.340" style="s2">it&#39;s the work of my life I want to on</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.480" end="01:25:26.240" style="s2">one hand I want us to be honest and</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.340" end="01:25:27.860" style="s2">truthful about our sin and and we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.240" end="01:25:29.780" style="s2">be honest and truthful about all our sin</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.860" end="01:25:33.380" style="s2">it&#39;s not appropriate that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.780" end="01:25:38.180" style="s2">way the world works but sin is a</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.380" end="01:25:40.100" style="s2">function of the antithesis but my</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.180" end="01:25:45.830" style="s2">Calvinist upbringing says we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.100" end="01:25:50.060" style="s2">sinners and in some ways I&#39;m gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.830" end="01:25:52.790" style="s2">more to answer for on Judgment Day then</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.060" end="01:25:56.830" style="s2">John Verve a key because I&#39;m a Christian</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.790" end="01:26:02.330" style="s2">teacher and I have to own that but I</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.830" end="01:26:04.070" style="s2">want a community where people who for</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.330" end="01:26:05.920" style="s2">one reason or another say I can&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.070" end="01:26:11.750" style="s2">can&#39;t get on board with the god thing</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.920" end="01:26:15.920" style="s2">okay I still want to talk to you Jesus</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.750" end="01:26:18.260" style="s2">who founded my religion says love your</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.920" end="01:26:23.510" style="s2">neighbor up to and including your rivals</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.260" end="01:26:26.270" style="s2">and your enemies now Christians have not</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.510" end="01:26:31.450" style="s2">done well with that well they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.270" end="01:26:36.830" style="s2">alone in that but that&#39;s a standard</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.450" end="01:26:39.230" style="s2">Jesus calls me to and so what does that</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.830" end="01:26:40.910" style="s2">look like in the midst of this meaning</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.230" end="01:26:43.280" style="s2">crisis in the midst of our little corner</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.910" end="01:26:45.650" style="s2">of the internet after listening to</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.280" end="01:26:49.880" style="s2">Jordan Peterson and watching lights go</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.650" end="01:26:51.560" style="s2">on because of that that means going into</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.880" end="01:26:54.740" style="s2">spaces like this and creating spaces</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.560" end="01:26:56.720" style="s2">like this where where Sam can come in</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.740" end="01:26:59.660" style="s2">and say I&#39;m not so sure about that</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.720" end="01:27:02.180" style="s2">Trinity thing boy I think it was harder</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.660" end="01:27:04.910" style="s2">for people welcoming Sam than whelping</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.180" end="01:27:07.910" style="s2">at welcoming atheists but we&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.910" end="01:27:09.890" style="s2">that and we&#39;re talking to Sam and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.910" end="01:27:12.530" style="s2">learning things from Sam and Sam&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.890" end="01:27:15.170" style="s2">learning things from us and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.530" end="01:27:19.010" style="s2">gonna burn them at the stake there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.170" end="01:27:21.980" style="s2">little spoiler alert so yeah you come in</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.010" end="01:27:26.210" style="s2">if you become my friend you run the risk</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.980" end="01:27:27.929" style="s2">of becoming an illustration and poor</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.210" end="01:27:30.809" style="s2">Nick knows that too for</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.929" end="01:27:32.579" style="s2">cult Nick but uh you know I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.809" end="01:27:35.400" style="s2">little bit of Donald Trump in me too cuz</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.579" end="01:27:38.630" style="s2">you know he started as a Frisian Dutch</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.400" end="01:27:42.179" style="s2">Reformed guy - so there we have it</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.630" end="01:27:43.459" style="s2">Paul banter clean and Donald Trump part</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.179" end="01:27:48.119" style="s2">of the same family</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.459" end="01:27:49.559" style="s2">boy that&#39;ll make some people upset boy</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.119" end="01:27:58.739" style="s2">this recording just got a whole lot</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.559" end="01:28:02.639" style="s2">spicier well well said Paul Doe very</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.739" end="01:28:05.459" style="s2">well son I think that essentially this</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.639" end="01:28:07.469" style="s2">this feeling that can come from from</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.459" end="01:28:09.869" style="s2">trusting community is what so many</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.469" end="01:28:12.389" style="s2">people are missing and whatever routes</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.869" end="01:28:16.110" style="s2">and avenues we can come to approach that</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.389" end="01:28:18.539" style="s2">and remember it and make it sacred and</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.110" end="01:28:22.439" style="s2">and that real sense I think is is what</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.539" end="01:28:25.199" style="s2">we have to to enact right to feel a</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.439" end="01:28:28.170" style="s2">calling to it and not be afraid to</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.199" end="01:28:30.420" style="s2">approach and yeah so for that I greatly</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.170" end="01:28:32.519" style="s2">appreciate all this motion that people</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.420" end="01:28:34.079" style="s2">are emotions that people are making here</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.519" end="01:28:36.479" style="s2">not just yourself but although all the</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.079" end="01:28:38.670" style="s2">wonderful people that gather and in</p>

<p begin="01:29:46.690" end="01:29:53.770" style="s2">certainly to me how how john vicki has</p>

<p begin="01:29:53.770" end="01:29:59.140" style="s2">I think probably vice versa that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.700" end="01:30:01.450" style="s2">beauty of this right that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
