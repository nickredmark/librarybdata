<p begin="00:00:31.840" end="00:00:39.080" style="s2">hello Vancouver thank you hello all</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.700" end="00:00:41.960" style="s2">right so we have an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.080" end="00:00:44.030" style="s2">situation here obviously this is part</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.960" end="00:00:46.390" style="s2">two and a few of you were here for what</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.030" end="00:00:49.190" style="s2">took place last night</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.390" end="00:00:51.559" style="s2">we are going to find a way to catch you</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.190" end="00:00:53.840" style="s2">all up pretty quick on what took place</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.559" end="00:00:57.019" style="s2">but before we do that I thought it might</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.840" end="00:00:59.180" style="s2">make sense to talk to you about where we</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.019" end="00:01:01.070" style="s2">are in this discussion and why it</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.180" end="00:01:02.750" style="s2">matters and it matters not just for</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.070" end="00:01:05.509" style="s2">those of us on stage but it matters very</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.750" end="00:01:07.729" style="s2">much for you all in the audience the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.509" end="00:01:10.369" style="s2">point is basically this we&#39;ve arrived at</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.729" end="00:01:12.530" style="s2">a place in history where the sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.369" end="00:01:14.000" style="s2">making apparatus that usually helps us</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.530" end="00:01:16.850" style="s2">figure out what to think about things</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.000" end="00:01:19.670" style="s2">has obviously begun to come apart</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.850" end="00:01:21.410" style="s2">the political parties the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.670" end="00:01:23.500" style="s2">universities journalism all of these</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.410" end="00:01:26.090" style="s2">things have stopped making sense an</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.500" end="00:01:29.720" style="s2">alternative sense making networks have</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.090" end="00:01:32.000" style="s2">begun to rise and the one that we end up</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.720" end="00:01:35.110" style="s2">being a part of seems to be beating the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.000" end="00:01:38.240" style="s2">odds with respect to staying alive and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.110" end="00:01:41.689" style="s2">being a vibrant part of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.240" end="00:01:44.600" style="s2">but that depends on something it depends</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.689" end="00:01:48.860" style="s2">on our ability to upgrade what we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.600" end="00:01:51.500" style="s2">discuss and navigate and Sam and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.860" end="00:01:54.409" style="s2">have run afoul of each other in the past</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.500" end="00:01:56.119" style="s2">as you all know and so our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.409" end="00:01:58.310" style="s2">upgrade the conversations such that</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.119" end="00:01:59.990" style="s2">they&#39;re able to to find common ground</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.310" end="00:02:02.900" style="s2">and for us to move forward together is</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.990" end="00:02:05.210" style="s2">potentially very important a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.900" end="00:02:07.520" style="s2">important upgrade now that upgrade in</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.210" end="00:02:10.369" style="s2">the modern era includes you all because</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.520" end="00:02:12.920" style="s2">our conversation and your conversations</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.369" end="00:02:15.910" style="s2">are all now linked through the internet</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.920" end="00:02:18.890" style="s2">so the ground rules for tonight involve</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.910" end="00:02:20.930" style="s2">you not filming what takes place on</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.890" end="00:02:23.630" style="s2">stage tonight and the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.930" end="00:02:25.910" style="s2">because what takes place on stage</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.630" end="00:02:29.540" style="s2">tonight has consequences and the freer</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.910" end="00:02:31.970" style="s2">that Sam and Jordan feel to use new</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.540" end="00:02:33.799" style="s2">tools to try out positions that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.970" end="00:02:36.830" style="s2">they haven&#39;t explored before the more</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.799" end="00:02:38.810" style="s2">likely we are to succeed so please don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.830" end="00:02:39.220" style="s2">film but that does not mean that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.810" end="00:02:41.200" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.220" end="00:02:42.640" style="s2">you talking about what was discussed</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.200" end="00:02:44.950" style="s2">here tonight in fact we&#39;re very excited</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.640" end="00:02:49.330" style="s2">to see what you all make of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.950" end="00:02:51.430" style="s2">conversation and where it heads so in an</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.330" end="00:02:53.950" style="s2">effort to to get you up to speed on</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.430" end="00:02:56.550" style="s2">where we got yesterday and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.950" end="00:02:58.930" style="s2">evidence is strong we all felt and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.550" end="00:03:01.210" style="s2">discussion online suggests that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.930" end="00:03:04.480" style="s2">actually accomplished quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.210" end="00:03:06.820" style="s2">yesterday that we made headway in an</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.480" end="00:03:08.740" style="s2">effort to attempt to keep that momentum</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.820" end="00:03:11.020" style="s2">going but we are going to do is we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.740" end="00:03:13.780" style="s2">going to have Sam and Jordan Steelman</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.020" end="00:03:15.700" style="s2">each other&#39;s points from last night so</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.780" end="00:03:25.480" style="s2">that you can hear what that sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.700" end="00:03:27.910" style="s2">now for those of you who have ever tried</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.480" end="00:03:29.560" style="s2">steel Manning somebody&#39;s point with whom</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.910" end="00:03:32.470" style="s2">you have a severe disagreement you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.560" end="00:03:35.020" style="s2">just how hard this is so let&#39;s give them</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.470" end="00:03:42.730" style="s2">some leeway Sam would you be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.020" end="00:03:44.620" style="s2">start sure sure yeah thank you okay well</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.730" end="00:03:46.870" style="s2">first let me just make the the obvious</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.620" end="00:03:49.570" style="s2">point that that probably isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.870" end="00:03:51.760" style="s2">obvious unless you take the time to put</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.570" end="00:03:56.080" style="s2">yourself in our shoes but just imagine</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.760" end="00:03:58.510" style="s2">how surreal it is for us to be who we</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.080" end="00:04:00.910" style="s2">are simply having a conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.510" end="00:04:02.830" style="s2">ideas and to be able to put a date on</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.910" end="00:04:04.959" style="s2">the calendar and have all of you show up</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.830" end="00:04:08.850" style="s2">for this it&#39;s just an amazing privilege</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.959" end="00:04:08.850" style="s2">and thank you for coming out</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.930" end="00:04:19.220" style="s2">so so here is what I think Jordan things</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.110" end="00:04:20.450" style="s2">I&#39;m getting wrong I think that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.220" end="00:04:25.790" style="s2">grammatically correct maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.450" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">another note in there but clearly I</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.790" end="00:04:33.610" style="s2">don&#39;t understand how valuable stories</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.840" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">are how deep they go the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.610" end="00:04:39.500" style="s2">stories encode not only the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.520" end="00:04:42.290" style="s2">our ancestors but quite possibly the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.500" end="00:04:44.720" style="s2">wisdom born of the hard knocks of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.290" end="00:04:46.550" style="s2">evolution of the species right so</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.720" end="00:04:49.100" style="s2">there&#39;s no telling how deep the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.550" end="00:04:52.250" style="s2">significance of the information encoded</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.100" end="00:04:54.350" style="s2">in stories goes and there&#39;s a class of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.250" end="00:04:55.610" style="s2">stories that are religious stories and</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.350" end="00:04:57.350" style="s2">they&#39;re religious for a reason because</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.610" end="00:04:58.940" style="s2">they&#39;re dealing with the the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.350" end="00:05:01.220" style="s2">questions in human life they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.940" end="00:05:03.200" style="s2">questions about what constitutes a good</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.220" end="00:05:08.240" style="s2">life what&#39;s worth living for what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.200" end="00:05:12.410" style="s2">worth dying for these are things that if</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.240" end="00:05:14.450" style="s2">each individual just thrust from on to</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.410" end="00:05:16.970" style="s2">the stage of his own life</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.450" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">not knowing where he is and tasked with</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.970" end="00:05:25.040" style="s2">figuring out how to live all on his own</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:27.890" style="s2">or even in a in a collection of others</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.040" end="00:05:31.340" style="s2">who are similarly unguided by ancient</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.890" end="00:05:34.730" style="s2">wisdom that this is not knowledge we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.340" end="00:05:40.550" style="s2">we can recapitulate for ourselves easily</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.730" end="00:05:42.890" style="s2">and so we we edit or ignore the these</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.550" end="00:05:44.870" style="s2">ancient stories at our peril at some</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.890" end="00:05:46.280" style="s2">minimum at some considerable risk</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.870" end="00:05:48.770" style="s2">because we don&#39;t know how much we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.280" end="00:05:51.980" style="s2">really know what baby is in the bath</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.770" end="00:05:58.570" style="s2">water and so we should have immense</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.980" end="00:05:58.570" style="s2">respect for these traditions and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.390" end="00:06:06.020" style="s2">this is well this is have to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.220" end="00:06:10.490" style="s2">discovered tonight I&#39;m still not quite</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.020" end="00:06:12.920" style="s2">clear about how this links up with with</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.490" end="00:06:15.140" style="s2">more metaphysical propositions about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.920" end="00:06:17.800" style="s2">origins of these of certain of these</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.140" end="00:06:21.669" style="s2">stories but at minimum</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.800" end="00:06:25.270" style="s2">my criticism of religion because it</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.669" end="00:06:28.120" style="s2">tends to focus on the the most obvious</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.270" end="00:06:30.069" style="s2">case of zero-sum contest between</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.120" end="00:06:34.830" style="s2">religious dogmatism and you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.069" end="00:06:39.009" style="s2">scientific open-ended discussion is</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.830" end="00:06:41.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t address this core issue of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.009" end="00:06:45.819" style="s2">significance of religious thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.560" end="00:06:47.979" style="s2">religious narrative because I am for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.819" end="00:06:51.940" style="s2">most part just shooting fish in a barrel</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.979" end="00:06:53.919" style="s2">criticizing fundamentalists and the kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.940" end="00:06:56.349" style="s2">of God that the fundamentalists believe</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.919" end="00:06:58.870" style="s2">in the God who&#39;s an invisible person who</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.349" end="00:07:01.720" style="s2">hates homosexuals obviously that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.870" end="00:07:05.919" style="s2">the the deep the deepest version of</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.720" end="00:07:08.770" style="s2">these religious this or this what is a</p>

<p begin="00:07:08.770" end="00:07:12.729" style="s2">life in the cosmos so maybe I&#39;ll leave</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.050" end="00:07:15.180" style="s2">it there but that&#39;s I think what Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.729" end="00:07:15.180" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.490" end="00:07:27.740" style="s2">before you steal man Sam&#39;s point how did</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.819" end="00:07:35.479" style="s2">you feel about his encapsulation of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.740" end="00:07:37.069" style="s2">yours know what I mean well I got a</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.479" end="00:07:38.650" style="s2">couple of things to say about it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.069" end="00:07:43.689" style="s2">like first of all I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.650" end="00:07:46.099" style="s2">accurate concise fair I also think that</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.689" end="00:07:47.779" style="s2">this is a more technical note in some</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.099" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">sense is that if if you ever want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.779" end="00:07:51.620" style="s2">think about something that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:53.060" style="s2">what you have to do right you want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.620" end="00:07:54.529" style="s2">take arguments that are against your</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.060" end="00:07:56.330" style="s2">perspective and you want to make them as</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.529" end="00:07:58.279" style="s2">strong as you possibly can so that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.330" end="00:07:59.389" style="s2">can fortify your arguments against them</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.279" end="00:08:02.360" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to make them weak because</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.389" end="00:08:04.279" style="s2">that just makes you weak and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.360" end="00:08:06.110" style="s2">Sam and I are both scientists and it</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.279" end="00:08:07.430" style="s2">really is the case that what scientists</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.110" end="00:08:08.389" style="s2">are trying to do and I think what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.430" end="00:08:11.029" style="s2">actually trying to do in this</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.389" end="00:08:13.009" style="s2">conversation genuinely is to try to find</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.029" end="00:08:15.789" style="s2">out if there&#39;s something that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.009" end="00:08:18.319" style="s2">thinking that&#39;s stupid you know because</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.789" end="00:08:20.569" style="s2">when when I&#39;m laying out the arguments</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.319" end="00:08:24.259" style="s2">that Sam just summarized so well I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.569" end="00:08:26.300" style="s2">tried to generate a bunch of opposition</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.259" end="00:08:28.460" style="s2">to them in my own imagination and their</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.300" end="00:08:30.469" style="s2">arguments I put forward are ones I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.460" end="00:08:33.500" style="s2">undermine but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.469" end="00:08:36.199" style="s2">right it doesn&#39;t mean that at all and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.500" end="00:08:37.490" style="s2">if someone comes along who&#39;s and this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.199" end="00:08:38.930" style="s2">certainly the case if you&#39;re a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.490" end="00:08:40.190" style="s2">who&#39;s worth his or her salt if someone</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.930" end="00:08:41.510" style="s2">comes along and says hey look you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.190" end="00:08:43.669" style="s2">made a mistake in this fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.510" end="00:08:45.709" style="s2">proposition it&#39;s like yes great that</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.669" end="00:08:48.529" style="s2">means I can make progress towards a more</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.709" end="00:08:49.820" style="s2">solid theory of being so and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.529" end="00:08:51.260" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do and I do think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.820" end="00:08:51.920" style="s2">working and so I thought that was just</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.260" end="00:08:53.660" style="s2">fine</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.920" end="00:08:56.360" style="s2">exactly dead-on and I hope I can do</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.660" end="00:08:58.490" style="s2">justice to your position as well so okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.360" end="00:09:01.040" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna summarize Sam&#39;s argument</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.490" end="00:09:03.079" style="s2">briefly and then I&#39;m gonna tell them</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.040" end="00:09:06.170" style="s2">late late let you guys know why he</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.079" end="00:09:11.060" style="s2">thinks I&#39;m things of what things I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.170" end="00:09:12.890" style="s2">taking into account so Sam believes that</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.060" end="00:09:15.519" style="s2">there are two fundamental dangers to</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.890" end="00:09:18.290" style="s2">psychological and social stability</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:20.839" style="s2">religious fundamentalism essentially on</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.290" end="00:09:24.079" style="s2">the right and moral relativism and</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.839" end="00:09:26.720" style="s2">nihilism on the left and so the danger</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.079" end="00:09:28.880" style="s2">of the right wing position is that it</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.720" end="00:09:31.940" style="s2">enables people to arbitrarily establish</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.880" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">certain revealed axioms as indisputable</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.940" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">truths and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:37.100" style="s2">to tyrannize themselves and other people</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:40.010" style="s2">with the claims that those are divine</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.100" end="00:09:41.300" style="s2">revelations and he sees that as part of</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.010" end="00:09:43.280" style="s2">the danger of religious fundamentalism</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.300" end="00:09:44.830" style="s2">and maybe religious thinking in general</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.280" end="00:09:47.570" style="s2">but also is something that characterizes</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.830" end="00:09:49.790" style="s2">secular totalitarian states that also</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.570" end="00:09:51.470" style="s2">has a religious aspect so that&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.790" end="00:09:53.330" style="s2">right and then on the left well the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.470" end="00:09:55.850" style="s2">problem with the with the moral</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.330" end="00:09:57.680" style="s2">relativism nihilism position is that it</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.850" end="00:10:00.410" style="s2">leaves us with no orientation and it</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.680" end="00:10:02.510" style="s2">also flies in the face of common sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.410" end="00:10:04.430" style="s2">observations that there are ways to live</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.510" end="00:10:05.960" style="s2">that are bad and that there are ways to</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.430" end="00:10:08.150" style="s2">live that are good that people can</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.960" end="00:10:10.370" style="s2">generally agree on and that statements</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.150" end="00:10:13.340" style="s2">about those general agreements about how</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.370" end="00:10:15.230" style="s2">to live can be considered factual now so</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.340" end="00:10:17.270" style="s2">and and then the next part of Sam&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.230" end="00:10:19.550" style="s2">argument is that we require a value</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.270" end="00:10:22.130" style="s2">system that allows us to escape these</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.550" end="00:10:23.840" style="s2">twin dangers one stultified us and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.130" end="00:10:26.480" style="s2">other leaves us hopeless let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.840" end="00:10:28.880" style="s2">that value system has to be grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.480" end="00:10:30.920" style="s2">something real and the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.880" end="00:10:33.710" style="s2">he can see that actually constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.920" end="00:10:35.090" style="s2">real in any provable sense and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.710" end="00:10:36.770" style="s2">certain amount of historical and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.090" end="00:10:39.410" style="s2">conceptual weight behind this claim is</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.770" end="00:10:41.030" style="s2">the domain of empirical facts as they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.410" end="00:10:42.260" style="s2">been manifested in the sciences and</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.030" end="00:10:44.450" style="s2">technologies that have made us</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.260" end="00:10:46.550" style="s2">incredibly powerful and increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.450" end="00:10:48.710" style="s2">able to flourish in the world and so we</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.550" end="00:10:50.270" style="s2">need to ground our value propositions in</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.710" end="00:10:53.300" style="s2">something that we&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.270" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">determine has genuine solidity to so</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.300" end="00:10:56.720" style="s2">that we can so that we can orient</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:10:58.400" style="s2">ourselves properly so that we can make</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.720" end="00:11:00.830" style="s2">moral claims and that we can avoid these</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.400" end="00:11:03.590" style="s2">to in dangers we can begin with some</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.830" end="00:11:05.120" style="s2">basic facts that we can identify as I</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.590" end="00:11:07.220" style="s2">mentioned breathe briefly what</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.120" end="00:11:10.070" style="s2">constitutes a bad life endless pain</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.220" end="00:11:11.870" style="s2">suffering anxiety tremendous amount of</p>

<p begin="00:11:11.870" end="00:11:15.710" style="s2">all the things that no one would choose</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.370" end="00:11:17.120" style="s2">voluntarily for themselves if if we</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.710" end="00:11:20.240" style="s2">would all agree that they were thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.120" end="00:11:22.190" style="s2">in a healthy manner and we can contrast</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.240" end="00:11:24.530" style="s2">that sort of domain of horror with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.190" end="00:11:26.240" style="s2">good life which might involve while</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.530" end="00:11:28.790" style="s2">certainly freedom from privation and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:30.590" style="s2">want and undue threat and anxiety and</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.790" end="00:11:32.450" style="s2">hope for the future and all of that and</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.590" end="00:11:34.910" style="s2">that we can agree that those are poles</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.450" end="00:11:38.540" style="s2">good bad and good and that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.910" end="00:11:40.340" style="s2">factual claim so he Sam also claims that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.540" end="00:11:42.230" style="s2">we can define the good life this is an</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.340" end="00:11:44.180" style="s2">extension of it with reference to</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.230" end="00:11:45.889" style="s2">flourishing and well-being and that that</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.180" end="00:11:48.259" style="s2">can actually be measured</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.889" end="00:11:49.489" style="s2">we should and can&#39;t inform the idea of</p>

<p begin="00:11:49.489" end="00:11:55.179" style="s2">empirical data having said all that he</p>

<p begin="00:11:55.999" end="00:12:01.069" style="s2">what would a domain of inquiry open that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.480" end="00:12:02.569" style="s2">would be centered on the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.069" end="00:12:04.850" style="s2">that some of the ideas that have been</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.569" end="00:12:07.100" style="s2">encapsulated in religious phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.850" end="00:12:08.769" style="s2">if not in religious dogma might be worth</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.100" end="00:12:11.419" style="s2">pursuing as well that there might be</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.769" end="00:12:14.899" style="s2">wisdom that can practically be applied</p>

<p begin="00:12:18.769" end="00:12:23.779" style="s2">they become ensconced in dogma and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.139" end="00:12:28.429" style="s2">that&#39;s Sam&#39;s position and then his</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.779" end="00:12:31.999" style="s2">criticism of my ideas he would say that</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.429" end="00:12:33.589" style="s2">it&#39;s facts not stories that constitute</p>

<p begin="00:12:33.589" end="00:12:38.629" style="s2">well-being and that we don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.350" end="00:12:40.850" style="s2">connected to stories ancient stories in</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.629" end="00:12:43.449" style="s2">particular to thrive and the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.850" end="00:12:45.350" style="s2">that are that these ancient stories are</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.449" end="00:12:47.149" style="s2">pathological in certain details</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.350" end="00:12:49.489" style="s2">especially in the specific claims they</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.149" end="00:12:51.199" style="s2">make up which which look outrageous in</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.489" end="00:12:53.689" style="s2">some sense from a modern moral</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.199" end="00:12:55.639" style="s2">perspective and he believes that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.689" end="00:12:58.369" style="s2">hand-waving to ignore those specific</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.639" end="00:13:00.110" style="s2">topics and with a you know with of what</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.369" end="00:13:03.949" style="s2">would you call it an optimistic overview</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.110" end="00:13:06.350" style="s2">of the entire context that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.949" end="00:13:10.309" style="s2">they&#39;re dangerously outdated now if they</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.350" end="00:13:13.639" style="s2">ever were useful that they&#39;re subject to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.309" end="00:13:16.069" style="s2">too many potential interpretations for</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.639" end="00:13:18.829" style="s2">any modern usage to be reliably derived</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.069" end="00:13:21.649" style="s2">and so he believes that attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.829" end="00:13:24.919" style="s2">interpret these stories let&#39;s say are</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.649" end="00:13:27.139" style="s2">rife with so many potential errors of</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.919" end="00:13:29.509" style="s2">bias and interpretation and subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.139" end="00:13:31.879" style="s2">that all the interpretations in some</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.509" end="00:13:34.309" style="s2">sense are unreliable and perhaps equally</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.879" end="00:13:36.350" style="s2">unreliable that they&#39;re dated that worse</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.309" end="00:13:39.559" style="s2">than that not only are they unreliable</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.350" end="00:13:42.319" style="s2">but they&#39;re dangerous insofar as the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.559" end="00:13:44.119" style="s2">claims they lay out are pose a threat to</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.319" end="00:13:46.309" style="s2">scientific and enlightenment values</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.119" end="00:13:48.350" style="s2">which are the true saviors of humanity</p>

<p begin="00:13:49.819" end="00:13:54.400" style="s2">and that they&#39;re also susceptible to the</p>

<p begin="00:13:58.540" end="00:14:04.690" style="s2">a claim to revealed truth and so I would</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.900" end="00:14:08.020" style="s2">say that Sam&#39;s argument and his and his</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.690" end="00:14:11.610" style="s2">criticisms of my position so ok so you</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.020" end="00:14:11.610" style="s2">write my next book I&#39;ll write yours</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.470" end="00:14:20.490" style="s2">Sam how do you feel about that</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.320" end="00:14:22.570" style="s2">characterization of your position</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.490" end="00:14:23.710" style="s2">certainly close enough to get the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.570" end="00:14:26.410" style="s2">conversation started I mean there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.710" end="00:14:28.720" style="s2">few the grounding stuff where we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.410" end="00:14:33.550" style="s2">yet to talk about and I&#39;m not as I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.720" end="00:14:35.560" style="s2">as much a stickler for materialistic</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.550" end="00:14:37.780" style="s2">scientific empiricism as I heard implied</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.560" end="00:14:40.030" style="s2">there but we can we can come okay so</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.780" end="00:14:42.580" style="s2">hold on yep I think from the point of</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.030" end="00:14:44.920" style="s2">view of the audience this is a this is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.580" end="00:14:47.610" style="s2">good barometer of where we got to last</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.920" end="00:14:50.680" style="s2">night and I think actually the gains are</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.610" end="00:14:52.450" style="s2">really impressive which I have to say is</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.680" end="00:14:55.270" style="s2">spooking me because of something called</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.450" end="00:14:57.100" style="s2">regression to the mean now if I catch</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.270" end="00:14:58.660" style="s2">either one of you regressing to the mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.100" end="00:15:01.840" style="s2">tonight I will hunt you down and I will</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.660" end="00:15:06.130" style="s2">ridicule you on Twitter tomorrow so you</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.840" end="00:15:08.770" style="s2">have been warned okay all right so do</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.130" end="00:15:10.240" style="s2">either one of you want to now talk about</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.770" end="00:15:12.970" style="s2">what was missing from the other</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.240" end="00:15:15.610" style="s2">characterization or how do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.970" end="00:15:19.120" style="s2">move I think we should touch this issue</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.610" end="00:15:22.150" style="s2">of metaphorical truth because I think it</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.120" end="00:15:25.270" style="s2">still gets that the distance between us</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.150" end="00:15:27.550" style="s2">sure and say and it&#39;s and happily yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.270" end="00:15:28.840" style="s2">this is your phrase that you have you</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.550" end="00:15:32.410" style="s2">might want to do you want to prop up</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.840" end="00:15:34.090" style="s2">this phrase why not so the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.410" end="00:15:36.220" style="s2">metaphorical truth which I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.090" end="00:15:38.860" style="s2">actually is the reconciliation between</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.220" end="00:15:41.500" style="s2">at least the points that you guys each</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.860" end="00:15:44.620" style="s2">started out with is the idea that there</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.500" end="00:15:46.990" style="s2">are concepts which are literally false</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.620" end="00:15:50.410" style="s2">that we can falsify in a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.990" end="00:15:52.690" style="s2">rational sense but that if you behave as</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.410" end="00:15:54.940" style="s2">if they were true you come out ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.690" end="00:15:57.339" style="s2">where you were if you behave according</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.940" end="00:16:00.040" style="s2">to the fact that they are false and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.339" end="00:16:02.950" style="s2">to call these things simply false is an</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.040" end="00:16:05.320" style="s2">error in effect the universe has left</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.950" end="00:16:07.300" style="s2">them true in some sense other than a</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.320" end="00:16:09.070" style="s2">purely literal one and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.300" end="00:16:11.020" style="s2">religions would then according to</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.070" end="00:16:13.720" style="s2">actually what you heard from both Sam</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.020" end="00:16:15.780" style="s2">and Jordan religions would fall into</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.720" end="00:16:20.430" style="s2">this class of things these are</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.780" end="00:16:22.600" style="s2">encapsulations of stories and</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.430" end="00:16:24.490" style="s2">prescriptions that if you follow them</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.600" end="00:16:27.480" style="s2">irrespective of whether they literally</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.490" end="00:16:29.910" style="s2">describe the universe you end up with</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.480" end="00:16:31.560" style="s2">advantages that you may not know why</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.910" end="00:16:33.839" style="s2">they are there but nonetheless you you</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.560" end="00:16:35.579" style="s2">are ahead of your you you&#39;re ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.839" end="00:16:37.860" style="s2">your position if you were to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.579" end="00:16:40.680" style="s2">just simply on your your perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.860" end="00:16:42.690" style="s2">that&#39;s the concept yes I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.680" end="00:16:45.269" style="s2">good analogy that you and I stumbled</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.690" end="00:16:48.000" style="s2">onto after we did a podcast together you</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.269" end="00:16:50.040" style="s2">had a an analogy about a porcupine that</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.000" end="00:16:52.860" style="s2">could shoot its quills which many people</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.040" end="00:16:55.519" style="s2">balked at but a listener gave us a</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.860" end="00:16:59.820" style="s2">better one which was the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.519" end="00:17:02.279" style="s2">anyone has worked with guns at all must</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.820" end="00:17:05.309" style="s2">have heard this admonishment to treat</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.279" end="00:17:08.240" style="s2">every gun as if it is loaded right and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.309" end="00:17:11.280" style="s2">you actually when I last night when I</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.240" end="00:17:13.439" style="s2">allege that you believed in God you</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:15.689" style="s2">corrected me said no you live as if God</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.439" end="00:17:20.010" style="s2">exists right and so this seems like</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.689" end="00:17:21.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a connection here so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.010" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">if you know if I had a gun here that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.750" end="00:17:26.910" style="s2">wanted to show Brett if I know anything</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:28.740" style="s2">about guns I&#39;m going to make damn sure</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.910" end="00:17:29.910" style="s2">that it&#39;s unloaded right I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.740" end="00:17:31.350" style="s2">pull back the slide I&#39;m going to drop</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.910" end="00:17:34.530" style="s2">the magazine pull back the slide check</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.350" end="00:17:36.900" style="s2">the chamber and do this in a redundant</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.530" end="00:17:38.250" style="s2">fashion that that really looks like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.900" end="00:17:41.880" style="s2">suffering from obsessive-compulsive</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.250" end="00:17:43.470" style="s2">disorder maybe it is truly redundant and</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.880" end="00:17:45.450" style="s2">then I&#39;ll hand it to Brad and if Brett</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.470" end="00:17:48.150" style="s2">knows anything about guns he will do the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.450" end="00:17:51.419" style="s2">same thing having just seen me do it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.150" end="00:17:53.070" style="s2">if he hands it back to me again I will</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.419" end="00:17:55.650" style="s2">do the same thing even though there may</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.070" end="00:17:58.679" style="s2">be no ammunition around right so it</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.650" end="00:18:00.480" style="s2">really is crazy at the level of our</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.679" end="00:18:03.750" style="s2">explicit knowledge of a situation and</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.480" end="00:18:08.640" style="s2">yet absolutely necessary to do and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.750" end="00:18:10.590" style="s2">it&#39;s not merely its it runs very deep I</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.640" end="00:18:12.600" style="s2">mean I would have bent that whole time</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.590" end="00:18:14.669" style="s2">you you&#39;re careful not to point the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.600" end="00:18:17.910" style="s2">barrel of the gun at anything you would</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.669" end="00:18:20.250" style="s2">be afraid to shoot and when people fail</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.910" end="00:18:22.440" style="s2">to live this way around guns they with</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.250" end="00:18:23.880" style="s2">some unnerving frequency actually shoot</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.440" end="00:18:27.330" style="s2">themselves or people close to them by</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.880" end="00:18:31.410" style="s2">accident so it is really the only proper</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.330" end="00:18:36.929" style="s2">hedge against just the the odds of being</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.410" end="00:18:39.500" style="s2">in proximity to loaded weapons and yet</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.929" end="00:18:41.549" style="s2">if someone in the middle of this</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.500" end="00:18:42.929" style="s2">operation came up to us and said you</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.549" end="00:18:45.210" style="s2">know actually there&#39;s a casino that just</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.929" end="00:18:47.490" style="s2">opened across the street that will take</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.210" end="00:18:49.140" style="s2">your bets about whether or not guns are</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.490" end="00:18:51.480" style="s2">loaded would you like to bet a million</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.140" end="00:18:53.040" style="s2">dollars as to whether or not this gun is</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.480" end="00:18:55.110" style="s2">loaded well of course I would bet those</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.040" end="00:18:57.120" style="s2">million dollars every time that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.110" end="00:18:58.650" style="s2">loaded because I know it&#39;s not loaded</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.120" end="00:19:02.040" style="s2">right so there&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.650" end="00:19:04.500" style="s2">literal truth and a a metaphorical truth</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.040" end="00:19:06.990" style="s2">well you know otherwise known as a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.500" end="00:19:09.929" style="s2">useful fiction which in this case is</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.990" end="00:19:12.150" style="s2">actually more useful than the truth</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.929" end="00:19:17.460" style="s2">right but the only way I can understand</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.150" end="00:19:19.230" style="s2">its utility is and and even utter the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.460" end="00:19:21.390" style="s2">phrase metaphorical truth in a way</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.230" end="00:19:23.790" style="s2">that&#39;s comprehensible is in the context</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.390" end="00:19:25.290" style="s2">of distinguishing it from literal truth</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.790" end="00:19:28.110" style="s2">and yep</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.290" end="00:19:30.659" style="s2">this is fascinating Sam actually this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.110" end="00:19:32.309" style="s2">this is I think next Jason I&#39;m a little</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.659" end="00:19:37.230" style="s2">worried by how excited you are about</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.309" end="00:19:39.000" style="s2">this so I have a little story that might</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.230" end="00:19:40.440" style="s2">be helpful about that and so on you</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.000" end="00:19:42.150" style="s2">could you could tell me what what you</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.440" end="00:19:46.799" style="s2">think about okay think about this okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.150" end="00:19:48.540" style="s2">so so one of the things that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.799" end="00:19:51.419" style="s2">reconsidering since we talked last night</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.540" end="00:19:52.679" style="s2">is is the nature of our dispute about</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.419" end="00:19:55.409" style="s2">the relationship between facts and</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.679" end="00:19:57.799" style="s2">values because I I think I can make a</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.409" end="00:20:00.179" style="s2">case that what I&#39;ve been trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.799" end="00:20:02.790" style="s2">especially in my first book was to</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.179" end="00:20:04.830" style="s2">ground values in facts but I&#39;m not doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.790" end="00:20:07.140" style="s2">it the same way that you are exactly so</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.830" end="00:20:09.480" style="s2">so I don&#39;t want to make that a point of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.140" end="00:20:11.429" style="s2">contention so and I&#39;ll get to that in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.480" end="00:20:13.320" style="s2">moment but with regards to this metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.429" end="00:20:16.080" style="s2">truth let me tell you something you tell</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.320" end="00:20:17.700" style="s2">me what you think about this so one of</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.080" end="00:20:19.710" style="s2">the things that&#39;s been observed by</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.700" end="00:20:22.500" style="s2">anthropologists worldwide is that human</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.710" end="00:20:24.419" style="s2">beings tend to make sacrifices so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.500" end="00:20:28.080" style="s2">gonna spend two minutes three minutes</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.419" end="00:20:30.299" style="s2">laying out a sacrificial story and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.080" end="00:20:32.130" style="s2">reason I want to do it is because see</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.299" end="00:20:34.650" style="s2">what I think happened with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.130" end="00:20:37.320" style="s2">the origin of these profound stories is</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.650" end="00:20:39.659" style="s2">that people first started to behave in</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.320" end="00:20:43.639" style="s2">certain ways that had survival</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.659" end="00:20:47.929" style="s2">significance and that was selected for</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.639" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">and as a consequence of the standard</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.929" end="00:20:52.700" style="s2">selection practices and so that was</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:54.590" style="s2">instantiated in behavior and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.700" end="00:20:56.450" style="s2">because we can observe ourselves because</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.590" end="00:20:59.389" style="s2">we&#39;re self-conscious creatures that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.450" end="00:21:01.159" style="s2">started to make representations of those</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.389" end="00:21:03.019" style="s2">patterns and dramatize them and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.159" end="00:21:04.999" style="s2">encapsulate them in stories so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.019" end="00:21:07.970" style="s2">bottom up from from me so it would be</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.999" end="00:21:09.559" style="s2">sort of like chimpanzees or wolves</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.970" end="00:21:11.480" style="s2">become aware of their dominance</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.559" end="00:21:13.610" style="s2">hierarchy structures and the strategies</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.480" end="00:21:14.989" style="s2">that they use so a wolf for example if</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.610" end="00:21:18.230" style="s2">two wolves are having a dominance</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.989" end="00:21:20.419" style="s2">dispute one the wolf that gives up first</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.230" end="00:21:21.950" style="s2">lays down puts his neck open so the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.419" end="00:21:23.869" style="s2">other wolf can tear it out and then the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.950" end="00:21:25.759" style="s2">other wolf doesn&#39;t and you could say</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.869" end="00:21:28.190" style="s2">well it&#39;s as if a wolf is following a</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.759" end="00:21:30.350" style="s2">rule about not killing a weaker member</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.190" end="00:21:32.779" style="s2">of the pack of course wolves don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.350" end="00:21:35.480" style="s2">rules they have behavioral patterns but</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.779" end="00:21:37.489" style="s2">a self-conscious wolf would watch what</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.480" end="00:21:39.679" style="s2">the Wolves were doing and then say well</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.489" end="00:21:41.480" style="s2">it&#39;s as if we&#39;re acting out the idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.679" end="00:21:43.700" style="s2">that each wolf in the pack has intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.480" end="00:21:44.809" style="s2">value and then that starts to be any</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.700" end="00:21:47.480" style="s2">maybe the wolves would have a little</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.809" end="00:21:49.279" style="s2">story about that the heroic forbearing</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.480" end="00:21:50.720" style="s2">wolf that doesn&#39;t tear out the neck of</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.279" end="00:21:52.580" style="s2">its opponents and that that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.720" end="00:21:55.159" style="s2">wolf well that&#39;s good wolf ethics and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.580" end="00:21:57.559" style="s2">and and so but it&#39;s grounded but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.159" end="00:21:59.330" style="s2">grounded in the actual behavior okay so</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.559" end="00:22:01.940" style="s2">let&#39;s we&#39;ll put that aside for a second</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.330" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">now here&#39;s the sacrificial story so</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.940" end="00:22:05.570" style="s2">human beings have made sacrifices it</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:07.369" style="s2">seems to be a standard practice all</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.570" end="00:22:09.350" style="s2">around the world and in the biblical</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.369" end="00:22:11.480" style="s2">narratives they would often sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.350" end="00:22:15.799" style="s2">something of value like like a valuable</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.480" end="00:22:17.629" style="s2">animal like a child startling look look</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.799" end="00:22:19.249" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m not making light of this I</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.629" end="00:22:22.489" style="s2">know that human sacrifice was a part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.249" end="00:22:24.769" style="s2">this but that&#39;s again to just to just to</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.489" end="00:22:28.940" style="s2">give you a crib on where my mind goes</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.769" end="00:22:31.429" style="s2">here&#39;s human human sacrifice is as old a</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.940" end="00:22:33.739" style="s2">religious precept as we know about yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.429" end="00:22:36.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a cultural Universal the the other</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.739" end="00:22:39.440" style="s2">sacrifices are derivation from it and</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.320" end="00:22:42.190" style="s2">circumcision is a surrogate for the far</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.440" end="00:22:46.639" style="s2">more barbaric act of human sacrifice and</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.190" end="00:22:48.679" style="s2">you know it answers every test you would</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.639" end="00:22:52.330" style="s2">put to it with respect to its archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.679" end="00:22:54.880" style="s2">significance it&#39;s it&#39;s compelling</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.330" end="00:22:58.750" style="s2">presence in stories across all cultures</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.880" end="00:23:00.910" style="s2">but the horror is that it actually has</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.750" end="00:23:05.140" style="s2">taken place in all these cultures based</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.910" end="00:23:07.780" style="s2">on licit beliefs in the presence of just</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.140" end="00:23:09.700" style="s2">just right Arthur casts of scientific</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.780" end="00:23:11.410" style="s2">ignorant Arthur Kessler used that as the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.700" end="00:23:13.540" style="s2">argument for the essential insanity of</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.410" end="00:23:15.070" style="s2">humanity we have know but it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.540" end="00:23:17.410" style="s2">the insanity of humanity it&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.070" end="00:23:19.060" style="s2">misapprehension of the causal structure</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.410" end="00:23:20.710" style="s2">of the cosmos that you don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.060" end="00:23:22.510" style="s2">Naturals the weather you don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.710" end="00:23:24.970" style="s2">people get sick you think your neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.510" end="00:23:26.800" style="s2">is capable of casting magic spells on</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.970" end="00:23:29.080" style="s2">you you&#39;re ignorant of everything and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.800" end="00:23:31.480" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to force some order on</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.080" end="00:23:33.730" style="s2">things and so when you don&#39;t in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.480" end="00:23:36.310" style="s2">absence of engineers and you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.730" end="00:23:38.380" style="s2">why bill certain buildings fall down you</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.310" end="00:23:40.300" style="s2">actually can agree with your neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.380" end="00:23:43.180" style="s2">that maybe you should bury your</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.300" end="00:23:45.730" style="s2">firstborn child into every post hole of</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.180" end="00:23:49.210" style="s2">this new building which in fact has took</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.730" end="00:23:51.460" style="s2">place and it&#39;s the consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.210" end="00:23:54.430" style="s2">ignorance and so that the problem is if</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.460" end="00:23:56.200" style="s2">you&#39;re only going to talk about purifies</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.430" end="00:23:58.690" style="s2">notion of sacrifice very strange</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.200" end="00:24:00.520" style="s2">consequence of ignorance like wait it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.690" end="00:24:03.130" style="s2">the notion that we&#39;re in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.520" end="00:24:05.320" style="s2">invisible others that can that can</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.130" end="00:24:08.020" style="s2">mistreat us based on a lot having</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.320" end="00:24:09.880" style="s2">offered enough where we are but not not</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.020" end="00:24:11.770" style="s2">precisely those others well but we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.880" end="00:24:14.680" style="s2">relationship to the invisible others who</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.770" end="00:24:16.390" style="s2">will judge us in the future okay but</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.680" end="00:24:18.490" style="s2">you&#39;re changing you&#39;re changing the noun</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.390" end="00:24:20.200" style="s2">in important ways no but I&#39;m also trying</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.490" end="00:24:22.090" style="s2">to understand and I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.200" end="00:24:24.730" style="s2">argue against the horror of child</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.090" end="00:24:26.830" style="s2">sacrifice no I would never imagine I</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.730" end="00:24:28.840" style="s2">know I know unless but I&#39;m also yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.830" end="00:24:31.160" style="s2">I&#39;m also trying but my work would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.840" end="00:24:34.430" style="s2">much easier if you did that hahaha</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.160" end="00:24:42.500" style="s2">yes yes yes and the work of journalists</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.430" end="00:24:44.000" style="s2">as well we&#39;ve tried that right so right</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.500" end="00:24:45.470" style="s2">that would be that would even be worse</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.000" end="00:24:49.970" style="s2">than enforced monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.470" end="00:24:51.530" style="s2">hypothetical oh so okay so see I&#39;m let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.970" end="00:24:53.330" style="s2">say that I&#39;m trying to give the devil</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.530" end="00:24:55.310" style="s2">his due and I&#39;m trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.330" end="00:24:57.230" style="s2">from an evolutionary perspective like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.310" end="00:24:59.030" style="s2">cognitive behavioral evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.230" end="00:25:01.160" style="s2">perspective let&#39;s say why that</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.030" end="00:25:02.900" style="s2">particular set of ideas would emerge and</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.160" end="00:25:04.910" style="s2">in many many many places perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.900" end="00:25:06.770" style="s2">autonomously or once having emerged</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.910" end="00:25:08.660" style="s2">would spread like wildfire it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.770" end="00:25:10.940" style="s2">because I&#39;m not willing to only</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.660" end="00:25:13.040" style="s2">attribute it to ignorance now we could</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.940" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">attribute it to ignorance no problem man</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.040" end="00:25:16.790" style="s2">but but there&#39;s more going on there</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:18.140" style="s2">because it is a human Universal and like</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.790" end="00:25:20.660" style="s2">there&#39;s all sorts of things that happen</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.140" end="00:25:22.370" style="s2">in nature as a consequence of biological</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.660" end="00:25:25.040" style="s2">and evolutionary processes that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.370" end="00:25:28.460" style="s2">work out well for our current state of</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.040" end="00:25:29.570" style="s2">moral intuition okay so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.460" end="00:25:31.550" style="s2">things because I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.570" end="00:25:33.350" style="s2">this sacrificial motif for a very long</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.550" end="00:25:35.150" style="s2">time you&#39;re trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.350" end="00:25:38.090" style="s2">that what what the hell&#39;s the idea here</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.150" end="00:25:40.730" style="s2">exactly and so so here&#39;s one way of</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.090" end="00:25:42.680" style="s2">thinking about it if you give up</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.730" end="00:25:45.430" style="s2">something of value now you can gain</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.680" end="00:25:48.170" style="s2">something of more value in the future</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.430" end="00:25:50.780" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s think about that idea for</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.170" end="00:25:53.180" style="s2">a minute so the first thing is that&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.780" end="00:25:55.670" style="s2">that&#39;s a hell of an idea that&#39;s delay</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.180" end="00:25:58.970" style="s2">delay delay that&#39;s right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.670" end="00:26:00.650" style="s2">discovery of the future as well and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.970" end="00:26:03.230" style="s2">you might say well the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.650" end="00:26:05.450" style="s2">sacrifice is exactly the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.230" end="00:26:08.330" style="s2">the discovery of the future if we give</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.450" end="00:26:10.010" style="s2">up something we really value now we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.330" end="00:26:12.620" style="s2">make a pact with the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.010" end="00:26:15.170" style="s2">existence itself such that better things</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.620" end="00:26:17.780" style="s2">will happen to us in the future now okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.170" end="00:26:20.660" style="s2">now what&#39;s weird about this and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.780" end="00:26:22.700" style="s2">hard to understand is that it works so</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.660" end="00:26:25.100" style="s2">when I talk to my students for example</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.700" end="00:26:28.010" style="s2">and I say what did your parents</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.100" end="00:26:29.240" style="s2">sacrifice to send you to university many</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.010" end="00:26:31.790" style="s2">of them are children of first-generation</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.240" end="00:26:33.770" style="s2">immigrants and so like man they&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.790" end="00:26:34.940" style="s2">that story in a second right they know</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.770" end="00:26:37.130" style="s2">all sorts of things that their parents</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.940" end="00:26:38.830" style="s2">sacrificed and they&#39;re delaying</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.130" end="00:26:41.060" style="s2">gratification in the present for a</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.830" end="00:26:43.910" style="s2">radically delayed return in the future</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.060" end="00:26:46.580" style="s2">now you think animals general</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.910" end="00:26:48.440" style="s2">speaking they might act out the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.580" end="00:26:49.760" style="s2">delayed gratification as a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.440" end="00:26:51.650" style="s2">of running out their instincts but they</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:53.240" style="s2">don&#39;t conceptualize it it&#39;s not obvious</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.650" end="00:26:55.850" style="s2">that animals give up something they</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.240" end="00:26:57.500" style="s2">value right now in order to thrive in</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.850" end="00:26:59.990" style="s2">the future there&#39;s an old story about</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.500" end="00:27:01.910" style="s2">how to catch a monkey right so yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.990" end="00:27:03.500" style="s2">put a jar up with rocks in it then you</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.910" end="00:27:05.060" style="s2">put little candies and it&#39;s a narrow</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.500" end="00:27:07.040" style="s2">neck jar you put little candies on top</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.060" end="00:27:09.830" style="s2">of the rocks put a few candies in front</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.040" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">of the of the jar then the monkey comes</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.830" end="00:27:13.340" style="s2">along and picks up the candies puts his</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:15.260" style="s2">hand in the jar grabs the candies and</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.340" end="00:27:16.610" style="s2">can&#39;t get it out I still don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.260" end="00:27:18.620" style="s2">this actually works on monkeys or it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.610" end="00:27:19.430" style="s2">just a great story oh I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.620" end="00:27:20.870" style="s2">don&#39;t know either</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.430" end="00:27:23.120" style="s2">and then I&#39;ve heard I&#39;ve heard I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.870" end="00:27:24.740" style="s2">heard various claims but but but the</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.120" end="00:27:26.150" style="s2">point is you can go pick up the monkey</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.740" end="00:27:29.120" style="s2">he won&#39;t let go of the candidates now</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.150" end="00:27:31.310" style="s2">perhaps he would but the the the issue</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.120" end="00:27:32.960" style="s2">is is that it&#39;s not obvious that animals</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.310" end="00:27:35.750" style="s2">will forego an immediate gratification</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.960" end="00:27:37.550" style="s2">for a future gratification I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.750" end="00:27:39.080" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that&#39;s right actually and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.550" end="00:27:41.030" style="s2">actually one a-hole well the question is</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.080" end="00:27:43.760" style="s2">can will they do it consciously they</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.030" end="00:27:45.410" style="s2">might act it out they act it out that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.760" end="00:27:46.820" style="s2">not the issue it&#39;s very hard to know if</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.410" end="00:27:48.680" style="s2">it&#39;s conscious and so on to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.820" end="00:27:51.830" style="s2">questionnaires but I know I know and it</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.680" end="00:27:53.960" style="s2">and obviously the line between acting it</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.830" end="00:27:56.720" style="s2">out and becoming starting to consciously</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.960" end="00:27:58.280" style="s2">represent it is a tenuous one but what</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.720" end="00:28:02.180" style="s2">looks to me like what happened is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.280" end="00:28:04.090" style="s2">after we observed that people who were</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.180" end="00:28:06.620" style="s2">capable of delaying gratification</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.090" end="00:28:08.990" style="s2">sacrifice things that they valued in</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.620" end="00:28:11.360" style="s2">order to obtain a future goal and it</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.990" end="00:28:13.700" style="s2">worked that we started to codify that as</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.360" end="00:28:17.210" style="s2">a representation and then started to act</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.700" end="00:28:19.220" style="s2">it out and so so the story and and you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.210" end="00:28:21.140" style="s2">say well that produced strange variants</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.220" end="00:28:23.420" style="s2">but but there&#39;s a reason for that - as</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.140" end="00:28:26.690" style="s2">far as I can say so imagine this imagine</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.420" end="00:28:29.600" style="s2">that there&#39;s a rule of thumb sacrificing</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.690" end="00:28:32.210" style="s2">what you&#39;ve find valuable now will</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.600" end="00:28:35.210" style="s2">ensure certain benefits in the future</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.210" end="00:28:38.090" style="s2">well then the question becomes how good</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.210" end="00:28:39.920" style="s2">could those future benefits be and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.090" end="00:28:42.170" style="s2">that might be heavenly let&#39;s say in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.920" end="00:28:44.150" style="s2">archetypal extreme and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.170" end="00:28:46.310" style="s2">ultimate sacrifice that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.150" end="00:28:48.020" style="s2">perform and then I would say well the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.310" end="00:28:50.660" style="s2">child sacrifice it fits into that</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.020" end="00:28:52.460" style="s2">category and so it&#39;s it&#39;s as if those</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.660" end="00:28:53.930" style="s2">ideas were pushed to their radical</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.460" end="00:28:56.600" style="s2">extreme and you could say well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.930" end="00:28:57.490" style="s2">pathological extreme it&#39;s like well it</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.600" end="00:29:00.550" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.490" end="00:29:02.440" style="s2">is a pathological extreme but but I</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.550" end="00:29:05.050" style="s2">think we also have to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.440" end="00:29:06.730" style="s2">some of the things that we&#39;ve learned as</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.050" end="00:29:10.030" style="s2">we&#39;ve evolved towards our current state</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.730" end="00:29:11.200" style="s2">of wisdom such as it is is that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.030" end="00:29:13.600" style="s2">were learned in a very bloody and</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.200" end="00:29:16.059" style="s2">catastrophic way they were learning with</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.600" end="00:29:17.679" style="s2">incredible difficulty and delay of</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.059" end="00:29:19.090" style="s2">gratification was certainly one of those</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.679" end="00:29:20.530" style="s2">because it&#39;s a hell of a thing to learn</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.090" end="00:29:22.420" style="s2">when you&#39;re in conditions of privation</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.530" end="00:29:27.220" style="s2">okay yeah well I think that the issue</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.420" end="00:29:29.920" style="s2">here for me is that you don&#39;t need a</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.220" end="00:29:32.980" style="s2">conception of you don&#39;t need any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.920" end="00:29:36.309" style="s2">positive gloss on human sacrifice as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.980" end="00:29:39.490" style="s2">meme or as an archetype in order to form</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.309" end="00:29:41.170" style="s2">a coherent picture of the future that</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.490" end="00:29:44.590" style="s2">can motivate you so delayed delayed</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.170" end="00:29:49.140" style="s2">gratification is fully separable from a</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.590" end="00:29:53.620" style="s2">notion that it might ever be rational or</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.140" end="00:29:56.380" style="s2">good to sacrifice a child as an offering</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.620" end="00:29:57.700" style="s2">to an invisible other that doesn&#39;t how</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.380" end="00:29:59.500" style="s2">do you know it&#39;s separable because</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.700" end="00:30:01.450" style="s2">that&#39;s the developmental history as you</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.500" end="00:30:03.190" style="s2">said well that&#39;s a sacrifice even if I</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.450" end="00:30:05.440" style="s2">oh yeah I think it&#39;s I think it is in</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.190" end="00:30:06.820" style="s2">fact historically separable but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.440" end="00:30:10.240" style="s2">just say it&#39;s not let&#39;s just say as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.820" end="00:30:13.179" style="s2">matter of our origins they&#39;re united</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.240" end="00:30:17.320" style="s2">they&#39;re of a piece it&#39;s just it is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.179" end="00:30:21.179" style="s2">genetic fallacy to care about that</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.320" end="00:30:24.730" style="s2">origin I mean there are say that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.179" end="00:30:26.590" style="s2">that is the only path forward toward a</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.730" end="00:30:28.270" style="s2">notion of the future given where we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.590" end="00:30:31.480" style="s2">come from or that it&#39;s somehow necessary</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.270" end="00:30:33.730" style="s2">to venerate now or that it&#39;s good do we</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.480" end="00:30:35.500" style="s2">take that but we do venerate the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.730" end="00:30:37.870" style="s2">sacrifice now but I would say but I</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.500" end="00:30:40.120" style="s2">would say we do it to to the detriment</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.870" end="00:30:41.350" style="s2">of our moral intuitions in the religious</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.120" end="00:30:43.360" style="s2">context so for instance I think that</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.350" end="00:30:47.260" style="s2">that the notion that Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.360" end="00:30:48.880" style="s2">Christianity is actually a cult of human</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.260" end="00:30:50.800" style="s2">sacrifice a Christianity is not a</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.880" end="00:30:52.650" style="s2">religion that repudiates human sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.800" end="00:30:56.559" style="s2">Christianity is a religion that says</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.650" end="00:30:58.630" style="s2">actually no human sacrifice is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.559" end="00:31:00.220" style="s2">and there was only one that in fact was</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.630" end="00:31:04.020" style="s2">necessary and effective and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.220" end="00:31:08.950" style="s2">sacrifice of Jesus and I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.020" end="00:31:10.580" style="s2">when you dig into the details not only a</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.950" end="00:31:12.799" style="s2">morally</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.580" end="00:31:14.899" style="s2">interesting vision of our circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.799" end="00:31:16.850" style="s2">and how we are how we can be redeemed</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.899" end="00:31:18.260" style="s2">it&#39;s morally abhorrent</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.850" end="00:31:20.929" style="s2">right so I think there&#39;s a better</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.260" end="00:31:24.799" style="s2">version okay let me ask you a question</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.929" end="00:31:27.080" style="s2">about that so in in in in the moral</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.799" end="00:31:29.510" style="s2">landscape you lay out this pathway</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.080" end="00:31:31.669" style="s2">there&#39;s the bad life and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.510" end="00:31:33.169" style="s2">good life right and and you you</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.669" end="00:31:34.580" style="s2">described what they were and the bad</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.169" end="00:31:36.169" style="s2">life is a variation of hellish</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.580" end="00:31:37.730" style="s2">circumstances and the good life is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.169" end="00:31:39.350" style="s2">variant of hypothetically the life that</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.730" end="00:31:41.600" style="s2">we would like to lead and your</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.350" end="00:31:44.149" style="s2">conception is that and correct me if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:46.220" style="s2">wrong your conception is that the proper</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.149" end="00:31:48.649" style="s2">pathway forward so that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.220" end="00:31:51.019" style="s2">moral endeavor is to move away from the</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.649" end="00:31:53.830" style="s2">bad and towards the good okay and so far</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.019" end="00:31:56.149" style="s2">as we understand which way is up yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.830" end="00:32:00.200" style="s2">the basic claim is that we can be right</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.149" end="00:32:02.090" style="s2">or wrong with respect to we do we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.200" end="00:32:04.639" style="s2">necessarily know how to do that in an</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.090" end="00:32:07.580" style="s2">unerring manner and and we could subject</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.639" end="00:32:09.799" style="s2">that to approximation correction along</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.580" end="00:32:12.110" style="s2">the way and we should but we can outline</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.799" end="00:32:14.090" style="s2">the broad scheme you know just progress</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.110" end="00:32:16.970" style="s2">away from hell towards something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.090" end="00:32:19.399" style="s2">positive yes yes okay so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.970" end="00:32:22.220" style="s2">that there&#39;s an implicit claim in that</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.399" end="00:32:24.620" style="s2">that you should sacrifice everything in</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.220" end="00:32:26.600" style="s2">you that isn&#39;t serving that to that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.620" end="00:32:28.190" style="s2">I would say that that&#39;s essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.600" end="00:32:33.380" style="s2">same claim that&#39;s made in Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.190" end="00:32:39.860" style="s2">well again that is a I may understand</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.380" end="00:32:43.130" style="s2">the impulse to uplevel these barbaric</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.860" end="00:32:44.720" style="s2">ignorance derived beliefs right to</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.130" end="00:32:47.720" style="s2">something that is morally that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.720" end="00:32:50.480" style="s2">interesting and palatable in in in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.720" end="00:32:52.730" style="s2">current context and I understand you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.480" end="00:32:54.169" style="s2">do that my concern there is you can do</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.730" end="00:32:58.070" style="s2">that with everything I mean you could do</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.169" end="00:33:00.380" style="s2">it with witchcraft why not do the exact</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.070" end="00:33:02.029" style="s2">same thing you&#39;re doing with religion to</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.380" end="00:33:04.940" style="s2">the history of witchcraft witchcraft is</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.029" end="00:33:07.909" style="s2">as as as well water I just would do that</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.940" end="00:33:09.679" style="s2">so that&#39;s a perfectly yeah but so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.909" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">but it&#39;s say that should be of concern</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.679" end="00:33:14.059" style="s2">there&#39;s there are reasons why we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:16.519" style="s2">want to endorse martyrs which raft right</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.059" end="00:33:17.750" style="s2">absolutely and so so you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.519" end="00:33:19.730" style="s2">mean I&#39;m not talking in modern</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.750" end="00:33:20.669" style="s2">witchcraft currently exist I mean you go</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.730" end="00:33:21.989" style="s2">to Africa there</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.669" end="00:33:24.330" style="s2">there you know people are hunting</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.989" end="00:33:26.009" style="s2">albinos for their body parts because</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.330" end="00:33:27.989" style="s2">they believe in sympathetic magic and</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.009" end="00:33:30.179" style="s2">they and kids get killed as witches so</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.989" end="00:33:32.970" style="s2">this belief indoors in certain pockets</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.179" end="00:33:34.710" style="s2">of humanity and we&#39;re right too about</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.970" end="00:33:37.470" style="s2">just think at a certain point you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.710" end="00:33:41.369" style="s2">to acknowledge that some ideas are not</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.470" end="00:33:43.529" style="s2">only wrong but they&#39;re their effects or</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.369" end="00:33:45.450" style="s2">disastrous or have been disastrous or</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.529" end="00:33:47.700" style="s2">will likely be even if good and certain</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.450" end="00:33:50.039" style="s2">circumstances will likely be disastrous</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.700" end="00:33:52.919" style="s2">in the future and then we shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.039" end="00:33:54.749" style="s2">hostage to these these ancient memes we</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.919" end="00:33:57.720" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have to figure out how to make</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.749" end="00:34:00.570" style="s2">the most of the worst idea that anyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.720" end="00:34:03.859" style="s2">ever had which is you should maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.570" end="00:34:06.659" style="s2">should sacrifice your firstborn child to</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.859" end="00:34:07.980" style="s2">be a being you&#39;ve never seen hold on Sam</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.659" end="00:34:11.510" style="s2">I I want to hold your feet to the fire</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.980" end="00:34:13.889" style="s2">here look at it two points one</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.510" end="00:34:16.770" style="s2">interesting observation when you</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.889" end="00:34:20.069" style="s2">presented the example so on your podcast</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.770" end="00:34:21.720" style="s2">I had argued that believing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.069" end="00:34:23.790" style="s2">porcupines can throw their quills might</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.720" end="00:34:25.200" style="s2">protect you from a porcupine that might</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.790" end="00:34:27.990" style="s2">wheel around even though porcupines</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.200" end="00:34:30.569" style="s2">can&#39;t for other quills your listener</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.990" end="00:34:33.809" style="s2">sent the better example which was all</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.569" end="00:34:36.210" style="s2">guns are loaded when you presented it</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.809" end="00:34:38.520" style="s2">you didn&#39;t say all guns are loaded well</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.210" end="00:34:41.609" style="s2">you said treat all guns as if they are</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.520" end="00:34:44.119" style="s2">loaded which is I think the same reflex</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.609" end="00:34:46.020" style="s2">that you have faced with any</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.119" end="00:34:48.000" style="s2">metaphorical truth which is that it can</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.020" end="00:34:49.559" style="s2">always be unpacked but it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.000" end="00:34:51.629" style="s2">that&#39;s the way Jordan talks about</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.559" end="00:34:54.179" style="s2">believing in God as well right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.629" end="00:34:56.760" style="s2">actually so so this is but then if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.179" end="00:34:59.609" style="s2">take something like you so you say all</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.760" end="00:35:03.030" style="s2">right sacrifice of children is abhorrent</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.609" end="00:35:05.910" style="s2">let&#39;s say it is and then you say well</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.030" end="00:35:07.770" style="s2">Christianity hasn&#39;t forgone the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.910" end="00:35:10.200" style="s2">sacrifice of children in fact it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.770" end="00:35:13.650" style="s2">described one child who is sacrificed</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.200" end="00:35:15.750" style="s2">for everybody else but arguably that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.650" end="00:35:17.970" style="s2">an upgrade of some metaphorical truth</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.750" end="00:35:19.670" style="s2">that frees those who are adhering to</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.970" end="00:35:23.089" style="s2">this tradition from ever considering</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.670" end="00:35:27.210" style="s2">sacrificing a child and does is it</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.089" end="00:35:29.220" style="s2">provides a motivational structure that</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.210" end="00:35:31.740" style="s2">may in fact have very positive</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.220" end="00:35:33.369" style="s2">outgrowths though not literal the idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.740" end="00:35:37.329" style="s2">that someone would have said</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.369" end="00:35:40.240" style="s2">their own child for the benefit of</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.329" end="00:35:45.190" style="s2">everybody else not to have to that idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.240" end="00:35:48.609" style="s2">might engender a large amount of good</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.190" end="00:35:50.499" style="s2">work that would result as Jordans point</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.609" end="00:35:52.660" style="s2">let me just concede that the hardest</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.499" end="00:35:56.799" style="s2">case for me I met which I did up top</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.660" end="00:35:58.240" style="s2">just in defining when after you define</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.799" end="00:36:01.259" style="s2">metaphorical truth and I use the gun</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.240" end="00:36:04.960" style="s2">example there&#39;s certainly cases where</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.259" end="00:36:07.539" style="s2">the useful fiction is more useful than</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.960" end="00:36:09.400" style="s2">the truth I would grant that but you</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.539" end="00:36:11.829" style="s2">know I think those cases are few and far</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.400" end="00:36:13.720" style="s2">between but handling guns is one of them</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.829" end="00:36:15.579" style="s2">it&#39;s just not useful when when the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.720" end="00:36:17.230" style="s2">casino opens across the street and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.579" end="00:36:18.759" style="s2">can place a million-dollar bet right</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.230" end="00:36:20.200" style="s2">then you want you want to have some</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.759" end="00:36:22.749" style="s2">purchase on the literal truth so you</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.200" end="00:36:26.289" style="s2">want to be able to and and again this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.749" end="00:36:28.240" style="s2">psychologically interesting because and</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.289" end="00:36:30.490" style="s2">I keep coming back to the gun example</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.240" end="00:36:33.160" style="s2">because the one that that is viscerally</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.490" end="00:36:36.670" style="s2">real to me like if I have a real gun</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.160" end="00:36:39.910" style="s2">that I know to be unloaded I still</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.670" end="00:36:42.970" style="s2">emotionally can&#39;t treat it as a harmless</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.910" end="00:36:45.970" style="s2">object I can&#39;t point it at my child just</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.970" end="00:36:47.380" style="s2">for the fun of it because you know that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.970" end="00:36:49.989" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna play cops and robbers now</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.380" end="00:36:53.200" style="s2">with a real gun right this this yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.989" end="00:36:56.349" style="s2">have a I have a superstitious attachment</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.200" end="00:36:58.420" style="s2">to always be in safe with the gun right</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.349" end="00:37:00.190" style="s2">and it&#39;s and it&#39;s important it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.420" end="00:37:03.430" style="s2">important that that get ingrained and</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.190" end="00:37:05.019" style="s2">yet it is not strictly right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.430" end="00:37:08.079" style="s2">irrational because it has good effects</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.019" end="00:37:10.480" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s not actually in register</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.079" end="00:37:13.180" style="s2">with what I know to be true factually in</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.480" end="00:37:15.430" style="s2">each moment right so very low cost</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.180" end="00:37:17.650" style="s2">yes very it&#39;s very low cause it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.430" end="00:37:19.239" style="s2">divided in societies and causing people</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.650" end="00:37:21.910" style="s2">to go to war and if you were gonna teach</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.239" end="00:37:23.470" style="s2">a child gun safety you would want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.910" end="00:37:25.809" style="s2">encode this so that they would</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.470" end="00:37:28.119" style="s2">automatically know never to behave as if</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.809" end="00:37:30.009" style="s2">a gun is unloaded because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.119" end="00:37:32.440" style="s2">gets you into trouble as an adult every</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.009" end="00:37:34.269" style="s2">every gun owner recognizes the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.440" end="00:37:36.400" style="s2">distinction between the metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.269" end="00:37:39.789" style="s2">truth and the literal truth here but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.400" end="00:37:41.290" style="s2">guess what I suspect is going on here is</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.789" end="00:37:44.680" style="s2">that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.290" end="00:37:47.600" style="s2">mechanism for dealing with the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.680" end="00:37:49.460" style="s2">involves unpacking all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.600" end="00:37:51.320" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s highly productive but</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.460" end="00:37:53.510" style="s2">it also means that you have a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.320" end="00:37:55.400" style="s2">understanding why anybody would do</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.510" end="00:37:58.310" style="s2">anything different and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.400" end="00:38:00.830" style="s2">question is just because we can track</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.310" end="00:38:03.320" style="s2">fully the difference between guns</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.830" end="00:38:05.930" style="s2">actually all being loaded and behaving</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.320" end="00:38:07.880" style="s2">as if all guns are loaded right that one</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.930" end="00:38:09.740" style="s2">there&#39;s no leftover there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.880" end="00:38:11.510" style="s2">there&#39;s no mystery they&#39;re right but</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.740" end="00:38:13.940" style="s2">there may be many of these things for</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.510" end="00:38:15.560" style="s2">which there is some difficulty lining up</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.940" end="00:38:18.050" style="s2">the metaphorical truth with the literal</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.560" end="00:38:20.690" style="s2">truth and operating according to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.050" end="00:38:23.300" style="s2">metaphorical truth might have advantages</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.690" end="00:38:24.970" style="s2">which I think is what you&#39;re getting at</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.300" end="00:38:27.410" style="s2">so well so here&#39;s here&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.970" end="00:38:29.630" style="s2">situation because you know we have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.410" end="00:38:31.490" style="s2">remember what kind of catastrophic past</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.630" end="00:38:34.190" style="s2">we emerged from and how much privation</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.490" end="00:38:36.530" style="s2">ruled the world prior to 1895</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.190" end="00:38:38.270" style="s2">essentially and certainly the farther</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.530" end="00:38:41.810" style="s2">back you go the more bloody and horrible</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.270" end="00:38:43.910" style="s2">it was I mean how often do you think it</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.810" end="00:38:45.920" style="s2">was necessary and this is not obviously</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.910" end="00:38:47.750" style="s2">something I&#39;m in favor of and this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.920" end="00:38:49.340" style="s2">also one of these situations where we</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.750" end="00:38:52.070" style="s2">get to play with ideas that we might not</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.340" end="00:38:53.900" style="s2">otherwise play with how often do you</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.070" end="00:38:56.000" style="s2">think it was necessary for people in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.900" end="00:38:58.040" style="s2">past who had absolutely no access to</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.000" end="00:39:00.290" style="s2">birth control and who didn&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.040" end="00:39:04.010" style="s2">food to sacrifice a child for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.290" end="00:39:04.940" style="s2">survival of their family I mean god only</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.010" end="00:39:06.800" style="s2">knows yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.940" end="00:39:09.260" style="s2">and that&#39;s it well but that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.800" end="00:39:11.510" style="s2">thinking about it&#39;s like you know life</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.260" end="00:39:12.980" style="s2">is unbelievably cruel and difficult and</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.510" end="00:39:14.360" style="s2">one of the problems that comes when you</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.980" end="00:39:15.680" style="s2">discover the future is that you might</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.360" end="00:39:18.830" style="s2">have to make the most painful of</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.680" end="00:39:20.600" style="s2">sacrifices and lots of lots of archaic</p>

<p begin="00:39:23.780" end="00:39:28.490" style="s2">infants that they deemed too fragile to</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.730" end="00:39:30.440" style="s2">survive like so part of child sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.490" end="00:39:32.750" style="s2">and I know the literature on child</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.440" end="00:39:35.620" style="s2">sacrifice reasonably well part of child</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.750" end="00:39:38.720" style="s2">sacrifice seemed to emerge out of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.620" end="00:39:40.820" style="s2">observable necessity to leave someone</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.720" end="00:39:43.190" style="s2">behind so that everyone else didn&#39;t die</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.820" end="00:39:45.050" style="s2">and we don&#39;t know how often that had to</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.190" end="00:39:48.560" style="s2">happen in the past it might have had to</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.050" end="00:39:50.270" style="s2">happen a lot right now obviously just</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.560" end="00:39:52.910" style="s2">just in the interest of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.270" end="00:39:53.750" style="s2">conceptual clarity here human sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.910" end="00:39:56.150" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.750" end="00:39:58.880" style="s2">a larger horror than that so you have it</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.150" end="00:40:01.040" style="s2">was very common is the sacrificing of</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.880" end="00:40:03.050" style="s2">you know captive so you take the Aztec</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.040" end="00:40:04.580" style="s2">sacrifices where you you know if you now</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.050" end="00:40:06.470" style="s2">have slaves some of whom you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.580" end="00:40:08.690" style="s2">the Aztecs sacrificed about twenty five</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.470" end="00:40:10.760" style="s2">thousand people a year yeah yeah look I</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.690" end="00:40:12.740" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s clearly a bloody mess</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.760" end="00:40:13.970" style="s2">there&#39;s no doubt about that but you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.740" end="00:40:15.590" style="s2">one of the things that you see happening</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.970" end="00:40:17.510" style="s2">in the biblical narrative which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.590" end="00:40:19.400" style="s2">extraordinarily interesting is that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.510" end="00:40:20.870" style="s2">see echoes of child sacrifice at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.400" end="00:40:22.520" style="s2">beginning but what happens is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.870" end="00:40:24.500" style="s2">sacrificial notion gets increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.520" end="00:40:27.410" style="s2">psychologize Dazz the story progresses</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.500" end="00:40:29.900" style="s2">so you know you see that transition with</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.410" end="00:40:31.610" style="s2">abraham and isaac where that where the</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.900" end="00:40:33.350" style="s2">sacra the child sacrifice is actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.610" end="00:40:35.930" style="s2">forbidden although previously demanded</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.350" end="00:40:37.790" style="s2">by god and then you also see it as you</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.930" end="00:40:39.500" style="s2">already laid out in the substitution of</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.790" end="00:40:41.840" style="s2">the circumcision for the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.500" end="00:40:43.370" style="s2">sacrifice itself and then what seems to</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.840" end="00:40:44.570" style="s2">happen see I&#39;m trying to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.370" end="00:40:46.520" style="s2">these ideas develop psyche</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.570" end="00:40:48.350" style="s2">psychologically from their behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.520" end="00:40:50.240" style="s2">underpinnings is that eventually it</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.350" end="00:40:52.790" style="s2">becomes psychologize completely so you</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.240" end="00:40:55.190" style="s2">can say well we can we can conceptualize</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.790" end="00:40:56.900" style="s2">a sacrifice in the abstract so my</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.190" end="00:40:59.000" style="s2">parents can sacrifice to send me to</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.900" end="00:41:01.490" style="s2">university without anything or anyone</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.000" end="00:41:02.900" style="s2">having to die it transforms itself from</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.490" end="00:41:04.850" style="s2">something that&#39;s enacted out as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.900" end="00:41:07.010" style="s2">dramatic ritual into something that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.850" end="00:41:08.840" style="s2">psychological reality but all that blood</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.010" end="00:41:10.550" style="s2">and catastrophe along the way as part of</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.840" end="00:41:13.310" style="s2">the process by which the idea comes to</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.550" end="00:41:14.930" style="s2">emerge right definitely so what is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.310" end="00:41:19.070" style="s2">connection of all of this because yes so</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.930" end="00:41:22.820" style="s2">there is this history and I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.070" end="00:41:24.800" style="s2">we are busily trying to outgrow much of</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.820" end="00:41:26.540" style="s2">it if not most of it and whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.800" end="00:41:28.940" style="s2">evolutionary history or just might be</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.540" end="00:41:31.250" style="s2">ultra might be trying to transmute it so</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.940" end="00:41:33.470" style="s2">that it becomes we can we can maintain</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.250" end="00:41:35.210" style="s2">and as you suggested we do we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.470" end="00:41:36.470" style="s2">maintain what&#39;s useful in the tradition</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.210" end="00:41:38.210" style="s2">and throw out everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.470" end="00:41:41.830" style="s2">pathologic yes by the book we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.210" end="00:41:44.870" style="s2">constantly discovering a lack of fit</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.830" end="00:41:47.150" style="s2">between both our what we perceive in</p>

<p begin="00:41:49.940" end="00:41:53.780" style="s2">and daddy taught me was true right yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.190" end="00:41:58.490" style="s2">we have now every reason to believe</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.780" end="00:42:02.390" style="s2">might not be true and we&#39;re trying to</p>

<p begin="00:43:06.490" end="00:43:09.910" style="s2">mean one of the reasons why in in</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.380" end="00:43:11.530" style="s2">creation myths one of the variants of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.910" end="00:43:13.840" style="s2">creation myth is that the hero has to</p>

<p begin="00:43:15.760" end="00:43:20.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a metaphorical Restatement of the</p>

<p begin="00:43:30.640" end="00:43:34.660" style="s2">the problem that you&#39;re describing is</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.590" end="00:43:36.700" style="s2">the problem of a priori structure now</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.660" end="00:43:38.680" style="s2">some of that&#39;s textual but some of it</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.700" end="00:43:41.050" style="s2">isn&#39;t textual some of it resides in us</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.680" end="00:43:44.290" style="s2">as our psyche insofar salient the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.050" end="00:43:48.160" style="s2">problem I&#39;m describing here is that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.290" end="00:43:50.470" style="s2">have two categories of books in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.160" end="00:43:53.850" style="s2">case we have those written by people</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.470" end="00:43:57.340" style="s2">like ourselves just endlessly open for</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.850" end="00:44:01.150" style="s2">criticism and conjecture and those</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.340" end="00:44:02.650" style="s2">written by invisible omniscient and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.150" end="00:44:04.600" style="s2">would assume that if these religious</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.650" end="00:44:06.220" style="s2">systems weren&#39;t codified in books if</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.600" end="00:44:07.990" style="s2">they were still just enacted or</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.220" end="00:44:09.550" style="s2">dramatized you&#39;d have the same objection</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.990" end="00:44:11.020" style="s2">it&#39;s not the fact that they&#39;re in books</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.550" end="00:44:12.760" style="s2">that&#39;s relevant no but it is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.020" end="00:44:15.100" style="s2">dogmatism it&#39;s the fact right hand we</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.760" end="00:44:17.020" style="s2">can&#39;t jettison the bad part okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.100" end="00:44:17.440" style="s2">the dogmatism okay so to me that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:44:17.440" end="00:44:22.089" style="s2">the problem of structure now here here&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:44:24.130" end="00:44:27.400" style="s2">not saying it&#39;s wrong it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.200" end="00:44:29.770" style="s2">that this is a place where it needs to</p>

<p begin="00:45:13.720" end="00:45:19.540" style="s2">and so you know I&#39;m totally open to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.420" end="00:45:24.550" style="s2">possibility in fact certainty that there</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.540" end="00:45:25.690" style="s2">are different ways for similar minds and</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.550" end="00:45:29.560" style="s2">certainly different ways for different</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.690" end="00:45:32.079" style="s2">minds to be constellated so that they</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.560" end="00:45:33.010" style="s2">they have equivalent but irreconcilable</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.079" end="00:45:35.380" style="s2">Peaks</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.010" end="00:45:37.150" style="s2">on the bland scape so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.380" end="00:45:38.470" style="s2">well being over here and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.150" end="00:45:41.020" style="s2">of well being over here and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.470" end="00:45:42.730" style="s2">valley in between and so it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.020" end="00:45:44.440" style="s2">kind of moral relativism it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.730" end="00:45:46.599" style="s2">like oh this is this is great and this</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.440" end="00:45:48.130" style="s2">is great but these are irreconcilable</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.599" end="00:45:49.690" style="s2">right well I&#39;d like to see that made</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.130" end="00:45:51.520" style="s2">more concrete and I need to know how</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.690" end="00:45:53.079" style="s2">that fits in with your conception</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.520" end="00:45:54.790" style="s2">because one of the claims that you make</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.079" end="00:45:57.339" style="s2">in the moral landscape is that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.790" end="00:46:00.520" style="s2">distinction between the bad life and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.339" end="00:46:03.280" style="s2">good life is normally it&#39;s like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.520" end="00:46:06.099" style="s2">factual distinction yes it&#39;s universally</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.280" end="00:46:08.079" style="s2">it&#39;s universally apprehensible and true</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.099" end="00:46:10.599" style="s2">it&#39;s your I think it&#39;s your fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.079" end="00:46:12.040" style="s2">axiomatic claim and I don&#39;t see how</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.599" end="00:46:13.660" style="s2">that&#39;s commensurate with the position</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.040" end="00:46:17.440" style="s2">that you just put forward was it so</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.660" end="00:46:19.390" style="s2">here&#39;s the position and you can forget</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.440" end="00:46:20.920" style="s2">about morality as a concept for this man</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.390" end="00:46:22.869" style="s2">I think the mirtha the starting point is</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.920" end="00:46:24.880" style="s2">deeper than morality the starting point</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.869" end="00:46:27.440" style="s2">and this is all this is our starting</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.880" end="00:46:30.080" style="s2">point all of us right now in</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.440" end="00:46:32.660" style="s2">universe the starting point is we are</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.080" end="00:46:37.540" style="s2">conscious right we have a we have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.660" end="00:46:41.990" style="s2">circumstance that admits of qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.540" end="00:46:43.520" style="s2">experience and again this is true</p>

<p begin="00:46:46.790" end="00:46:50.170" style="s2">simulation this could be a dream you</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.920" end="00:46:52.490" style="s2">could be a brain-in-a-vat</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.170" end="00:46:54.290" style="s2">consciousness could just be the product</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.490" end="00:46:57.230" style="s2">of neuro chemistry or we could have</p>

<p begin="00:46:57.230" end="00:47:01.910" style="s2">somehow integrated with the brain</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.240" end="00:47:05.230" style="s2">whatever is true something seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.910" end="00:47:08.120" style="s2">happening and these Siemens can be</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.230" end="00:47:09.920" style="s2">really really bad or really really good</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.120" end="00:47:11.420" style="s2">we know yeah each one of us in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.920" end="00:47:13.820" style="s2">have experienced this range of</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.420" end="00:47:15.710" style="s2">possibility and yes there are caveats</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.820" end="00:47:18.020" style="s2">here there are hard and painful</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.710" end="00:47:19.190" style="s2">experiences that have a silver lining</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.020" end="00:47:21.080" style="s2">right that gives you some other capacity</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.190" end="00:47:21.950" style="s2">where you could say well you know that</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.080" end="00:47:23.840" style="s2">really sucked</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.950" end="00:47:25.490" style="s2">but I&#39;m a better person for it right and</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.840" end="00:47:26.480" style="s2">we can understand what it means to be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.490" end="00:47:29.510" style="s2">better person for it</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.480" end="00:47:31.190" style="s2">in terms again of this range of</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.510" end="00:47:33.770" style="s2">experience which I you know I&#39;m calling</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.190" end="00:47:36.560" style="s2">to subsuming all of this the positive</p>

<p begin="00:47:53.960" end="00:47:58.970" style="s2">intelligible within a context of an</p>

<p begin="00:47:58.970" end="00:48:04.070" style="s2">space of possible experience so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.910" end="00:48:05.480" style="s2">saying is forget about morality forget</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.070" end="00:48:09.860" style="s2">about right and wrong and good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.480" end="00:48:12.460" style="s2">what is undeniable is that what we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.860" end="00:48:15.920" style="s2">here is a navigation problem we have a</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.460" end="00:48:17.870" style="s2">space of possible experience and again</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:20.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not just a human problem this is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.870" end="00:48:23.240" style="s2">problem for any possible conscious mind</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.440" end="00:48:25.400" style="s2">we have a space of possible experience</p>

<p begin="00:48:25.400" end="00:48:30.860" style="s2">things can get excruciating and</p>

<p begin="00:48:35.330" end="00:48:40.490" style="s2">episode of madness that never ends</p>

<p begin="00:48:59.030" end="00:49:02.600" style="s2">well then it would only be rational to</p>

<p begin="00:49:09.680" end="00:49:14.990" style="s2">reality is is we&#39;re navigating in this</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.270" end="00:49:20.570" style="s2">space and morality and ethics are the</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.990" end="00:49:23.360" style="s2">terms we use for how we think about our</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.570" end="00:49:24.830" style="s2">behavior affecting one another&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.360" end="00:49:26.510" style="s2">experience so if you&#39;re in a moral</p>

<p begin="00:49:31.490" end="00:49:35.420" style="s2">need to worry about but well-being still</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.380" end="00:49:37.610" style="s2">is an ever-present issue it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.420" end="00:49:40.100" style="s2">to suffer and it&#39;s possible to to</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.610" end="00:49:43.430" style="s2">experience bliss and and something</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.100" end="00:49:46.640" style="s2">perhaps something beyond that and we the</p>

<p begin="00:49:46.640" end="00:49:52.010" style="s2">we will never fully expose explore very</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.000" end="00:49:53.660" style="s2">likely we don&#39;t know how good things can</p>

<p begin="00:49:53.660" end="00:49:58.720" style="s2">get but but that there&#39;s a spectrum here</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.850" end="00:50:02.570" style="s2">is undeniable and I would say that that</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.720" end="00:50:04.910" style="s2">my moral realism simply entails that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.570" end="00:50:06.560" style="s2">acknowledge that it&#39;s possible not to</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.910" end="00:50:08.960" style="s2">know what you&#39;re missing it&#39;s possible</p>

<p begin="00:51:36.830" end="00:51:42.230" style="s2">might have been encoded metaphorical oh</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.410" end="00:51:43.820" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s certainly possible and in</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.230" end="00:51:46.100" style="s2">fact you might even say it was a likely</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.820" end="00:51:48.260" style="s2">based on the fact that we have all of</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.100" end="00:51:50.180" style="s2">these systems still around right so but</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.260" end="00:51:53.180" style="s2">we still have the systems around in part</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.180" end="00:51:55.010" style="s2">because our like we still we still think</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.180" end="00:51:57.920" style="s2">in metaphor and we actually can&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.010" end="00:51:59.870" style="s2">it because half of our brain is oriented</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.920" end="00:52:03.880" style="s2">towards metaphor but what can I get you</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.870" end="00:52:06.230" style="s2">to clarify something now yes okay so you</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.880" end="00:52:08.840" style="s2">have argued and you&#39;ve actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.230" end="00:52:11.870" style="s2">surprised me by doing so you argued that</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.840" end="00:52:14.510" style="s2">the dogmatism is a bug and not a feature</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.870" end="00:52:16.490" style="s2">you argue no it&#39;s a began to feature</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.510" end="00:52:19.100" style="s2">okay it&#39;s a bug and a feature good so</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.490" end="00:52:23.030" style="s2">yeah but what what I thought I heard you</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.100" end="00:52:26.300" style="s2">say was that the resistance to update</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.030" end="00:52:27.470" style="s2">yes was a problem that effectively it</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.300" end="00:52:29.150" style="s2">was an obstacle yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.470" end="00:52:30.530" style="s2">so his lack of resistance dubbed it</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.150" end="00:52:33.260" style="s2">right okay there&#39;s problems everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.530" end="00:52:35.000" style="s2">man well it&#39;s there&#39;s a tension there is</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.260" end="00:52:37.040" style="s2">a tension there&#39;s a tendency terrible</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.000" end="00:52:39.500" style="s2">tension right well looking for by this</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.040" end="00:52:42.320" style="s2">way look at it this way most new ideas</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.500" end="00:52:44.240" style="s2">are stupid and dangerous but but most</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.320" end="00:52:46.370" style="s2">some of them are as well I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.240" end="00:52:48.050" style="s2">some of them are vital right and so we</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.370" end="00:52:50.420" style="s2">have we&#39;re screwed both ways it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.050" end="00:52:53.090" style="s2">well if we stay locked in our current</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.420" end="00:52:54.860" style="s2">mode of apprehension all hell&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.090" end="00:52:56.210" style="s2">break loose if we generate a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.860" end="00:52:57.070" style="s2">of new solutions most of them are going</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.210" end="00:52:59.860" style="s2">to be wrong and we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.070" end="00:53:01.990" style="s2">died and so what we need to do is and</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.860" end="00:53:03.820" style="s2">well it it&#39;s a Darwinian claim in some</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.990" end="00:53:05.410" style="s2">sense is that yep despite the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.820" end="00:53:07.600" style="s2">most new ideas are stupid and dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.410" end="00:53:08.860" style="s2">a subset of them are so vital that if we</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.600" end="00:53:11.080" style="s2">don&#39;t incorporate them we&#39;re all going</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.860" end="00:53:13.060" style="s2">to perish that&#39;s the bloody existential</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.080" end="00:53:15.490" style="s2">condition and so now and part of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.060" end="00:53:19.510" style="s2">issue here and see and I think that this</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.490" end="00:53:21.910" style="s2">is the problem is is that let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.510" end="00:53:23.470" style="s2">that the dogma idea okay so there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.910" end="00:53:24.670" style="s2">dogma incorporated in the books but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.470" end="00:53:26.290" style="s2">gonna throw away that looks because the</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.670" end="00:53:27.490" style="s2">dogma was there before the books and</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.290" end="00:53:30.130" style="s2">then the question is where it was the</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.490" end="00:53:32.920" style="s2">dogma and the answer was the dogma was</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.130" end="00:53:34.900" style="s2">in the cultural practices but and in and</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.920" end="00:53:36.610" style="s2">in the agreement that people made with</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.900" end="00:53:38.320" style="s2">regards to those cultural practices but</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.610" end="00:53:40.510" style="s2">it was also part and parcel of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.320" end="00:53:43.180" style="s2">intrapsychic structure that enables us</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.510" end="00:53:45.040" style="s2">to perceive the world as such now the</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.180" end="00:53:47.920" style="s2">problem is and I think this is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.040" end="00:53:49.900" style="s2">central place where we need to flesh out</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.920" end="00:53:51.910" style="s2">these ideas is that you cannot view the</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.900" end="00:53:53.800" style="s2">world without an a priori structure and</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.910" end="00:53:56.320" style="s2">that a priori structure has a dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.800" end="00:53:57.700" style="s2">element and so you can&#39;t just say well</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.320" end="00:53:59.230" style="s2">let&#39;s get rid of the dog Lent because</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.700" end="00:54:01.150" style="s2">you can&#39;t perceive the world without a</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.230" end="00:54:02.340" style="s2">struct it has an uninspected element</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.150" end="00:54:05.230" style="s2">this is if you&#39;re talking about just</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.340" end="00:54:07.180" style="s2">perceiving the world yes we have it we</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.230" end="00:54:09.720" style="s2">have perceptual structure that allows</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.180" end="00:54:12.850" style="s2">for us to perceive the world and we know</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.720" end="00:54:14.080" style="s2">that there are failure states right so</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.850" end="00:54:16.660" style="s2">we know we know for instance that we are</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.080" end="00:54:21.340" style="s2">we are we&#39;ve evolved to perceive in</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.660" end="00:54:23.530" style="s2">visual space based on a literally</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.340" end="00:54:25.120" style="s2">neurological expectation that light</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.530" end="00:54:26.260" style="s2">sources will be from above</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.120" end="00:54:29.070" style="s2">right as we know that we can produce</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.260" end="00:54:31.210" style="s2">visual illusions based on gaming that</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.070" end="00:54:37.090" style="s2">expectation right but that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.210" end="00:54:40.570" style="s2">same thing as a a Dogma subscribe to</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.090" end="00:54:43.330" style="s2">page 7 some subset of humanity that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.570" end="00:54:45.040" style="s2">antithetical to another Dogma subscribed</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.330" end="00:54:46.450" style="s2">to by another set of humanity that has</p>

<p begin="00:54:46.450" end="00:54:50.890" style="s2">that something that this change is so</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.580" end="00:54:53.260" style="s2">obvious well but it&#39;s changeable in real</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.890" end="00:54:55.240" style="s2">time but based on just conversations</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.260" end="00:54:57.430" style="s2">like this you know we could have you</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.240" end="00:55:00.700" style="s2">know I get emails from people who can</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.430" end="00:55:03.190" style="s2">point to this the paragraph where they</p>

<p begin="00:56:15.400" end="00:56:18.819" style="s2">gray area now here let me ask you a</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.530" end="00:56:21.190" style="s2">question so that this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.819" end="00:56:23.109" style="s2">things I&#39;ve been thinking about so this</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.190" end="00:56:25.180" style="s2">is this is designed to point out the</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.109" end="00:56:27.970" style="s2">different I&#39;m not making the claim that</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.180" end="00:56:30.250" style="s2">the idea that we should ground values in</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.970" end="00:56:31.900" style="s2">facts is wrong I&#39;m not gonna make that</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.250" end="00:56:33.930" style="s2">claim although I think it&#39;s way more</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.900" end="00:56:36.849" style="s2">complicated than we&#39;ve opened up so far</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.930" end="00:56:38.559" style="s2">but I would say is I can I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.849" end="00:56:40.990" style="s2">relatively easily demonstrate a</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.559" end="00:56:43.329" style="s2">situation in which you cannot find the</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.990" end="00:56:47.200" style="s2">value from the fact let&#39;s say you own an</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.329" end="00:56:48.609" style="s2">antique it&#39;s valuable and you think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.200" end="00:56:51.670" style="s2">gonna take this antique apart and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.609" end="00:56:53.290" style="s2">gonna find out where the value is good</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.670" end="00:56:55.450" style="s2">luck well it is it&#39;s not valuable in</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.290" end="00:56:57.339" style="s2">that sense well wait a second wait a</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.450" end="00:56:58.900" style="s2">second so we need to know so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.339" end="00:57:00.760" style="s2">right it&#39;s not valuable in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.900" end="00:57:02.890" style="s2">because the value of the antique is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.760" end="00:57:04.630" style="s2">social agreement about its position in a</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.890" end="00:57:06.460" style="s2">hierarchy it has nothing to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.630" end="00:57:09.550" style="s2">material substrate at the antique sure</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.460" end="00:57:11.890" style="s2">yeah but but not you can&#39;t it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.550" end="00:57:13.660" style="s2">sure is that your are you&#39;ve made the</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.890" end="00:57:15.430" style="s2">claim already that you can derive values</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.660" end="00:57:17.860" style="s2">from fats it&#39;s like then what are you</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.430" end="00:57:20.380" style="s2">willing to know these are facts about</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.860" end="00:57:22.870" style="s2">again so there are facts about the facts</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.380" end="00:57:24.970" style="s2">exist in inter subjective space right so</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.870" end="00:57:26.410" style="s2">if I if I tell you well this glass this</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.970" end="00:57:28.420" style="s2">isn&#39;t just an ordinary glass I know it</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.410" end="00:57:31.840" style="s2">looks just like that one but this is the</p>

<p begin="00:57:31.840" end="00:57:36.130" style="s2">last concert Yeah right right Rob so you</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.050" end="00:57:38.530" style="s2">know what do you want to pay me for it</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.130" end="00:57:40.090" style="s2">right right yeah it could be that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.530" end="00:57:42.400" style="s2">know you&#39;re just the biggest Elton John</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.090" end="00:57:45.250" style="s2">fan ever and you it&#39;s worth quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.400" end="00:57:47.770" style="s2">to you now that is it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.250" end="00:57:51.310" style="s2">evident it&#39;s not value intrinsic to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.770" end="00:57:53.230" style="s2">glass but it is it is it is a where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.310" end="00:57:56.260" style="s2">the value located well it&#39;s a measure in</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.230" end="00:57:58.060" style="s2">in the change this provokes in your</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.260" end="00:58:00.100" style="s2">experience right there&#39;s the idea I mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.060" end="00:58:02.410" style="s2">we value ideas as much as anything else</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.100" end="00:58:04.690" style="s2">and that&#39;s you know that&#39;s hence the the</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.410" end="00:58:06.730" style="s2">mad work done by religion right anything</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.690" end="00:58:09.400" style="s2">cuz it&#39;s not these aren&#39;t facts on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.730" end="00:58:11.260" style="s2">ground these are ideas that rule</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.400" end="00:58:13.630" style="s2">people&#39;s lives people spend their whole</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.260" end="00:58:16.030" style="s2">life afraid of Hell okay it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.630" end="00:58:19.120" style="s2">that it&#39;s easier in some sense rather</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.030" end="00:58:21.040" style="s2">than to relate the value of that I love</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.120" end="00:58:22.690" style="s2">the Alton Jones glass example it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.040" end="00:58:24.160" style="s2">to use the Elvis Presley as here on</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.690" end="00:58:26.140" style="s2">earth so I will tell if a it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.160" end="00:58:27.610" style="s2">wearing the guitar is the fact that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.140" end="00:58:29.530" style="s2">Elvis Presley&#39;s guitar</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.610" end="00:58:32.050" style="s2">well it&#39;s nowhere in the guitar well</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.530" end="00:58:34.270" style="s2">what is it in where is it then and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.050" end="00:58:36.100" style="s2">answer is it&#39;s in the dominance</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.270" end="00:58:37.870" style="s2">hierarchy of values that&#39;s been socially</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.100" end="00:58:40.480" style="s2">constructed around the guitar it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.870" end="00:58:43.030" style="s2">located in interpersonal space and that</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.480" end="00:58:44.920" style="s2">that location so value is located in</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.030" end="00:58:46.630" style="s2">interpersonal space and if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.920" end="00:58:49.600" style="s2">say well that&#39;s also a fact it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.630" end="00:58:52.540" style="s2">okay but in fact and that&#39;s the beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.600" end="00:58:55.150" style="s2">and desires and conscious states of all</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.540" end="00:58:57.040" style="s2">the people involved okay well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.150" end="00:58:59.350" style="s2">only place where it exists it&#39;s only for</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.040" end="00:59:01.180" style="s2">the idea of Elvis&#39;s guitar can show okay</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.350" end="00:59:02.710" style="s2">well I&#39;m trying to figure out then you</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.180" end="00:59:04.720" style="s2">see because what seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.710" end="00:59:07.930" style="s2">happening at least in part is that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.720" end="00:59:09.910" style="s2">we can stretch the the domain of what</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.930" end="00:59:11.800" style="s2">constitutes a fact so that the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.910" end="00:59:14.470" style="s2">fact starts to incorporate the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.800" end="00:59:17.070" style="s2">values but we do that with some doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.470" end="00:59:19.480" style="s2">some damage to the domain of fact so</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.070" end="00:59:21.980" style="s2">don&#39;t don&#39;t say don&#39;t just say no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.480" end="00:59:24.560" style="s2">this is right cause they wore this</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.980" end="00:59:26.600" style="s2">really complicated because you see part</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.560" end="00:59:27.980" style="s2">of what the post modernists have done is</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.600" end="00:59:30.080" style="s2">that they&#39;ve pushed away the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.980" end="00:59:31.910" style="s2">facts entirely and they&#39;ll say well the</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.080" end="00:59:33.800" style="s2">only thing is is that the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.910" end="00:59:36.290" style="s2">that actually exists is that this domain</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.800" end="00:59:38.690" style="s2">of interest objective agreement and they</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.290" end="00:59:40.340" style="s2">know yeah you and I are on the same page</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.690" end="00:59:42.109" style="s2">with respect to post modernist right but</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.340" end="00:59:43.580" style="s2">but but you have to give but you have to</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.109" end="00:59:46.040" style="s2">give it you have to give the devil his</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.580" end="00:59:47.960" style="s2">due as well they pointed out something</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.040" end="00:59:50.359" style="s2">and what they pointed out is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.960" end="00:59:52.340" style="s2">not so easy to localize the structure</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.359" end="00:59:54.650" style="s2">that attributes to facts their value</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.340" end="00:59:58.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not a simple thing now wait wait</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.650" end="01:00:01.609" style="s2">wait yes you would surely agree that if</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.640" end="01:00:04.490" style="s2">we had Elvis Presley&#39;s guitar that that</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.609" end="01:00:07.160" style="s2">guitar would have a material impact on</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.490" end="01:00:08.840" style="s2">people we could tell them this is Elvis</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.160" end="01:00:10.550" style="s2">Presley&#39;s guitar some fraction of them</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.840" end="01:00:12.050" style="s2">would disbelieve it somebody might be</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.550" end="01:00:14.000" style="s2">able to establish it based on a picture</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.050" end="01:00:17.300" style="s2">or something like that and the point is</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.000" end="01:00:19.790" style="s2">it would have a value that would alter</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.300" end="01:00:22.490" style="s2">the behavior of people with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.790" end="01:00:24.590" style="s2">that object in a material way yes it</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.490" end="01:00:27.770" style="s2">would alter the behavior value can also</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.590" end="01:00:29.180" style="s2">manifest in physical space which part of</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.770" end="01:00:30.590" style="s2">it the behavior detective we could</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.180" end="01:00:32.960" style="s2">figure out what the value of this guitar</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.590" end="01:00:34.310" style="s2">is based on some intersection sure we</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.960" end="01:00:35.540" style="s2">need to take a behaviorist approach and</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.310" end="01:00:38.630" style="s2">we could see how much work people were</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.540" end="01:00:40.340" style="s2">willing to do - yes yes we can scan</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.630" end="01:00:42.440" style="s2">their brains and see what it is well I</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.340" end="01:00:44.630" style="s2">don&#39;t so sure we can do that well well</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.440" end="01:00:46.369" style="s2">clearly the brain at home hypothetically</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.630" end="01:00:48.590" style="s2">we can do it but practically we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.369" end="01:00:50.869" style="s2">so good because the amorite down it</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.590" end="01:00:53.390" style="s2">generally speaking is junk well we can</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.869" end="01:00:55.210" style="s2">table that well look it&#39;s that will be a</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.390" end="01:00:58.760" style="s2">profoundly controversial statement in</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.210" end="01:01:00.380" style="s2">MRI circles it&#39;s yeah fair enough I</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.760" end="01:01:02.260" style="s2">don&#39;t think we need it we don&#39;t need it</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.380" end="01:01:05.150" style="s2">but we know let&#39;s go with that a more</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.260" end="01:01:07.369" style="s2">grain the brain as yet incompletely</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.150" end="01:01:09.230" style="s2">understood it surely involved in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.369" end="01:01:11.390" style="s2">valuing of this object right and so if I</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.230" end="01:01:12.980" style="s2">see if I tell you that this is and again</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.390" end="01:01:14.510" style="s2">we can take it out of inter subjective</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.980" end="01:01:17.450" style="s2">space because it could you you could be</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.510" end="01:01:18.920" style="s2">in a value solitude with respect to any</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.450" end="01:01:20.840" style="s2">given object so it could just be you</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.920" end="01:01:23.570" style="s2">could have a sentimental attachment to</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.840" end="01:01:25.430" style="s2">your watch that&#39;s worth exactly</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.570" end="01:01:27.260" style="s2">twenty-five dollars because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.430" end="01:01:28.970" style="s2">you paid for it but this is the watch</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.260" end="01:01:30.320" style="s2">that you know this is your first watch</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.970" end="01:01:31.820" style="s2">or whatever it is and you wouldn&#39;t sell</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.320" end="01:01:32.910" style="s2">it for any amount of money right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.820" end="01:01:34.140" style="s2">a measure of your</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.910" end="01:01:36.330" style="s2">behavioral measure of how much you value</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.140" end="01:01:38.370" style="s2">it and if I told you oh well you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.330" end="01:01:41.130" style="s2">sorry I brought your watch and lost it</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.370" end="01:01:42.720" style="s2">what the cascade of negative effects</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.130" end="01:01:43.800" style="s2">that I see on your face is correlated</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.720" end="01:01:46.350" style="s2">with something that&#39;s happening in your</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.800" end="01:01:48.660" style="s2">head and the brain is involved right so</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.350" end="01:01:50.520" style="s2">that the ology of that picture or</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.660" end="01:01:52.620" style="s2">basically state is the value I can tell</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.520" end="01:01:54.870" style="s2">is that there&#39;d be a socio-cultural</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.620" end="01:01:56.280" style="s2">agreement as to the value of whatever</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.870" end="01:01:58.500" style="s2">this entity is and that would find its</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.280" end="01:02:00.500" style="s2">mirror in the brain and that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.500" end="01:02:02.250" style="s2">non-controversial statement because all</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.500" end="01:02:04.020" style="s2">socio-cultural phenomena that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.250" end="01:02:05.820" style="s2">experienced find the reflection in the</p>

<p begin="01:02:05.820" end="01:02:11.460" style="s2">that&#39;s reflected in the brain probably</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.390" end="01:02:13.170" style="s2">it&#39;s continually run into with religion</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.460" end="01:02:16.230" style="s2">is that there you have a domain of</p>

<p begin="01:02:40.890" end="01:02:46.380" style="s2">well no it&#39;s just no no it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.430" end="01:02:48.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like that but that&#39;s not irrational</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.380" end="01:02:49.710" style="s2">by your own definition you just said</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.180" end="01:02:52.380" style="s2">that that was actually constituted of</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.710" end="01:02:55.290" style="s2">fact well no it&#39;s a fact about people</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.380" end="01:02:57.450" style="s2">right saying no there are this is okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.290" end="01:02:58.230" style="s2">okay just be a little careful cuz it</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.450" end="01:03:02.370" style="s2">gets confusing</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.230" end="01:03:07.170" style="s2">yeah the there are we can make objective</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.370" end="01:03:10.170" style="s2">claims about subjective experience right</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.170" end="01:03:12.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s there are we use this word</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.170" end="01:03:14.670" style="s2">objective and subjective in in different</p>

<p begin="01:03:23.100" end="01:03:27.540" style="s2">just your subjective opinion right I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:03:47.470" end="01:03:51.640" style="s2">people get confused they think that</p>

<p begin="01:03:57.369" end="01:04:02.710" style="s2">a much more objective than that we can</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.290" end="01:04:04.990" style="s2">we can make objective claims about the</p>

<p begin="01:04:04.990" end="01:04:09.549" style="s2">ourselves I can I can I can make an</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.960" end="01:04:12.700" style="s2">infinite number of objective claims</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.549" end="01:04:14.349" style="s2">about the experience this is the example</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.700" end="01:04:15.180" style="s2">I always use but I just happen to love</p>

<p begin="01:04:15.180" end="01:04:20.740" style="s2">what what was JFK thinking the moment he</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.760" end="01:04:22.900" style="s2">got shot right that&#39;s it we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.740" end="01:04:26.230" style="s2">so we&#39;ll never get the data right so the</p>

<p begin="01:04:29.290" end="01:04:37.089" style="s2">because because he&#39;s not around and his</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.809" end="01:04:38.890" style="s2">brains not around to scan so but we you</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.089" end="01:04:41.170" style="s2">and I both know an infinite number of</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.890" end="01:04:43.299" style="s2">things he wasn&#39;t thinking about we can</p>

<p begin="01:04:43.299" end="01:04:48.010" style="s2">subjectivity I know he wasn&#39;t thinking</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.609" end="01:04:49.740" style="s2">well I hope Jordan Peterson and sam</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.010" end="01:04:52.690" style="s2">Harris work it out on stage that night</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.740" end="01:04:54.640" style="s2">right and an infinite number of things</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.690" end="01:04:56.710" style="s2">like that he was thinking something he</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.640" end="01:05:00.730" style="s2">was experiencing something but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.710" end="01:05:03.369" style="s2">know what it is that so I so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.730" end="01:05:06.760" style="s2">talking about this domain of value I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.369" end="01:05:09.549" style="s2">saying that it exists in the this</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.760" end="01:05:11.740" style="s2">landscape of actual and possible</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.549" end="01:05:14.349" style="s2">conscious experience for human beings</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.740" end="01:05:16.210" style="s2">and and any other system like us that</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.349" end="01:05:18.010" style="s2">can experience this range of suffering</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.210" end="01:05:19.450" style="s2">and happiness well okay so and partly</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.010" end="01:05:21.970" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to do is to actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.450" end="01:05:25.059" style="s2">determine what that structure is like so</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.970" end="01:05:26.799" style="s2">in our case it&#39;s certainly connected to</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.059" end="01:05:29.140" style="s2">the evolved structure of our brain yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.799" end="01:05:30.549" style="s2">but it&#39;s all mental it&#39;s all mental by</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.140" end="01:05:32.680" style="s2">everything else we do want to go way</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.549" end="01:05:34.390" style="s2">deeper into to the idea then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.680" end="01:05:36.190" style="s2">connected with brain States because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.390" end="01:05:37.839" style="s2">yes it&#39;s definitely connected with brain</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.190" end="01:05:40.059" style="s2">States the question is at least in part</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.839" end="01:05:42.250" style="s2">how and what does that mean and I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.059" end="01:05:43.480" style="s2">that the neuroscience has progressed far</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.250" end="01:05:45.940" style="s2">enough so that we can do quite a good</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.480" end="01:05:47.740" style="s2">job of this and so what I want to return</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.940" end="01:05:50.470" style="s2">to one thing and maybe I&#39;ll outline a</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.740" end="01:05:52.059" style="s2">little bit of this and when you talked</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.470" end="01:05:54.540" style="s2">about the israeli-palestinian conflict</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.059" end="01:05:56.640" style="s2">you said that that was irrational</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.540" end="01:05:58.260" style="s2">and so look you know fair enough it we</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.640" end="01:05:59.550" style="s2">people have been locked with their hands</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.260" end="01:06:01.830" style="s2">around each other&#39;s necks there for</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.550" end="01:06:04.530" style="s2">3,000 years but there&#39;s a problem there</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.830" end="01:06:07.920" style="s2">and the problem is that people are</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.530" end="01:06:10.860" style="s2">looking at the landscape from a</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.920" end="01:06:12.780" style="s2">contextualized perspective right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.860" end="01:06:14.370" style="s2">not just a piece of land it&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.780" end="01:06:16.050" style="s2">piece of land it&#39;s like your house or</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.370" end="01:06:17.280" style="s2">maybe your favorite shirt it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.050" end="01:06:19.140" style="s2">you say well I have a favorite shirt</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.280" end="01:06:20.220" style="s2">it&#39;s like well there&#39;s nothing inherent</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.140" end="01:06:21.720" style="s2">in this shirt that makes it your</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.220" end="01:06:23.790" style="s2">favorite no it&#39;s a subjective judgment</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.720" end="01:06:25.260" style="s2">it&#39;s like well then is that a fact</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.790" end="01:06:27.360" style="s2">well yes it&#39;s a fact it&#39;s a fact about</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.260" end="01:06:29.070" style="s2">subjective judgement it&#39;s okay well the</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.360" end="01:06:30.630" style="s2">israeli claim on the land that the</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.070" end="01:06:32.550" style="s2">palestinian claim on the land is a</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.630" end="01:06:34.260" style="s2">subjective judgment that&#39;s a fact it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.550" end="01:06:39.030" style="s2">like so how is it yet rather saying it</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.260" end="01:06:42.350" style="s2">because it is the the true analogy here</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.030" end="01:06:45.630" style="s2">the complete analogy is rather like</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.350" end="01:06:50.840" style="s2">we&#39;re about to fight over elton john&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.630" end="01:06:50.840" style="s2">glass and elton john was never here</p>

<p begin="01:06:55.280" end="01:07:00.259" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.869" end="01:07:03.049" style="s2">so I&#39;m not saying so it clearly still</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.259" end="01:07:05.569" style="s2">matters to us in our misapprehension of</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.049" end="01:07:07.009" style="s2">our situation we still really care and</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.569" end="01:07:09.380" style="s2">these are these are objectively true</p>

<p begin="01:07:09.380" end="01:07:14.779" style="s2">value things and then hence the impasse</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.019" end="01:07:17.059" style="s2">but in a manner that&#39;s counterproductive</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.779" end="01:07:19.219" style="s2">ly dismissive like you could say well</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.059" end="01:07:21.170" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really not you look at that</p>

<p begin="01:07:25.729" end="01:07:29.749" style="s2">you said well there&#39;s multiple reasons</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.529" end="01:07:31.400" style="s2">why different people who occupy the same</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.749" end="01:07:33.859" style="s2">piece of land are going to feel about it</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.400" end="01:07:36.109" style="s2">in different ways sure okay and and most</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.859" end="01:07:39.499" style="s2">of those reasons are amenable to some</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.109" end="01:07:40.969" style="s2">kind of rational compromise their</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.499" end="01:07:42.829" style="s2">studies on this and their studies done</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.969" end="01:07:44.630" style="s2">by people who when you say disagree</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.829" end="01:07:46.279" style="s2">right when you say the word rational in</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.630" end="01:07:49.039" style="s2">that context you&#39;re using it as a black</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.279" end="01:07:50.539" style="s2">box that contains the concept proper way</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.039" end="01:07:52.400" style="s2">of thinking about it it&#39;s like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.539" end="01:07:56.059" style="s2">so obvious tin most situations what the</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.400" end="01:07:58.160" style="s2">rational approach is well I have an</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.059" end="01:08:00.950" style="s2">obvious one here and and and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.160" end="01:08:04.130" style="s2">whatever the Christians and the Muslims</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.950" end="01:08:05.930" style="s2">and the Jews think they&#39;re getting from</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.130" end="01:08:08.359" style="s2">their attachment to their dogmatic and</p>

<p begin="01:08:08.359" end="01:08:16.880" style="s2">be gotten just as well by a deeper</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.670" end="01:08:19.960" style="s2">understanding of the of our universal</p>

<p begin="01:08:22.880" end="01:08:27.380" style="s2">community building and we can see what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:08:29.239" end="01:08:32.989" style="s2">if it&#39;s almost like the status quo is</p>

<p begin="01:08:43.159" end="01:08:47.389" style="s2">another over their fandom right like</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.349" end="01:08:48.650" style="s2">what if that were the status quo so I</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.389" end="01:08:50.480" style="s2">spin this way for thousands of years</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.650" end="01:08:52.339" style="s2">there must be a reason for it really</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.480" end="01:08:55.009" style="s2">like sports I&#39;m not trying to justify</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.339" end="01:08:56.810" style="s2">the israeli-palestinian conflict no but</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.009" end="01:08:58.580" style="s2">I&#39;m saying that can lead to quick to</p>

<p begin="01:08:59.700" end="01:09:04.140" style="s2">but wait a minute Sam there you made a</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.500" end="01:09:05.310" style="s2">claim like your claim was that if the</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.140" end="01:09:07.320" style="s2">Christians and the Jews and the Muslims</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.310" end="01:09:09.390" style="s2">would just stop their stupidity and</p>

<p begin="01:10:24.180" end="01:10:30.300" style="s2">actually hear you both loud and clear</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.630" end="01:10:33.360" style="s2">your point is that if the people faced</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.300" end="01:10:35.040" style="s2">with the question were to you know start</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.360" end="01:10:36.300" style="s2">with a fresh sheet of paper look at the</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.040" end="01:10:37.440" style="s2">Middle East they could arrive at a</p>

<p begin="01:10:37.440" end="01:10:44.910" style="s2">might find put them way ahead and is</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.170" end="01:10:46.140" style="s2">more profitable than the situation that</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.910" end="01:10:48.600" style="s2">they are continually finding themselves</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.140" end="01:10:51.660" style="s2">yeah and that might be the case on the</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.600" end="01:10:54.780" style="s2">other hand the reason that they don&#39;t is</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.660" end="01:10:57.060" style="s2">that historically those who have have</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.780" end="01:11:00.660" style="s2">been out competed by those who haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.060" end="01:11:02.100" style="s2">so the point is the universe and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.660" end="01:11:03.900" style="s2">fact that it refuses to solve that</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.100" end="01:11:06.300" style="s2">conflict is telling us that there is</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.900" end="01:11:10.920" style="s2">some reason that people who take that</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.300" end="01:11:11.460" style="s2">prospect seriously are not actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.920" end="01:11:13.590" style="s2">correct</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.460" end="01:11:15.210" style="s2">in some at least metaphorical way so in</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.590" end="01:11:17.910" style="s2">other words what is it to have a</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.210" end="01:11:19.950" style="s2">sentimental attachment to some piece of</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.910" end="01:11:22.080" style="s2">territory somewhere that sounds</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.950" end="01:11:24.239" style="s2">completely irrational on the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.080" end="01:11:27.210" style="s2">that sentimental attachment may result</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.239" end="01:11:29.070" style="s2">in you continuing for 500 or a thousand</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.210" end="01:11:30.510" style="s2">or 2,000 years whereas if you</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.070" end="01:11:32.820" style="s2">surrendered it because it was irrational</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.510" end="01:11:34.620" style="s2">you might go extinct now should you care</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.820" end="01:11:37.230" style="s2">that your lineage is gonna go extinct</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.620" end="01:11:39.030" style="s2">maybe arguably not on the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.230" end="01:11:41.700" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to imagine that what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.030" end="01:11:44.730" style="s2">saying is so thoroughly grounded that it</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.700" end="01:11:46.950" style="s2">can justify causing people to alter</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.730" end="01:11:48.480" style="s2">their perspective on value in such a way</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.950" end="01:11:52.969" style="s2">that it might actually drive them</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.480" end="01:11:55.560" style="s2">extinct it&#39;s not clearly secularism they</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.969" end="01:11:56.550" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the fringe here</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.560" end="01:11:59.370" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about that when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.550" end="01:12:03.270" style="s2">talking about in this case the Israeli</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.370" end="01:12:06.360" style="s2">settlers and the Palestinian terrorists</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.270" end="01:12:08.550" style="s2">right like that is that is there we</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.360" end="01:12:10.500" style="s2">should all breathe a sigh of relief that</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.550" end="01:12:13.650" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t that that that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.500" end="01:12:16.170" style="s2">passionate attachment to land doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.650" end="01:12:18.480" style="s2">characterize most of humanity if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.170" end="01:12:21.300" style="s2">trying to defend your house so but that</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.480" end="01:12:23.160" style="s2">but that&#39;s if it&#39;s in a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.300" end="01:12:25.050" style="s2">different a contour dn&#39;t because I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.160" end="01:12:27.690" style="s2">this is this is where you this is where</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.050" end="01:12:30.270" style="s2">the the crux of it is well so if you</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.690" end="01:12:33.090" style="s2">follow the idea that this is actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.270" end="01:12:34.739" style="s2">some come that the seemingly sentimental</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.090" end="01:12:37.290" style="s2">and irrational attachment to the piece</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.739" end="01:12:40.190" style="s2">of land is some sort of meta rationality</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.290" end="01:12:42.930" style="s2">which sounds like your perspective then</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.190" end="01:12:45.510" style="s2">we are now confronted with the question</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.930" end="01:12:47.940" style="s2">of alright if it is an evolved kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.510" end="01:12:49.710" style="s2">meta rationality that is being manifest</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.940" end="01:12:51.390" style="s2">in stories that cause people to behave</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.710" end="01:12:54.030" style="s2">in ways that Sam sees is clearly</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.390" end="01:12:56.670" style="s2">irrational then we are stuck with the</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.030" end="01:12:57.630" style="s2">naturalistic fallacy which is to say so</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.670" end="01:12:59.580" style="s2">for those who don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.630" end="01:13:01.620" style="s2">naturalistic fallacy says that just</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.580" end="01:13:04.230" style="s2">because something is doesn&#39;t mean it</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.620" end="01:13:05.940" style="s2">ought right the fact that selection</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.230" end="01:13:09.210" style="s2">favors something doesn&#39;t make it good</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.940" end="01:13:12.330" style="s2">when the Aztecs sacrifice their enemies</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.210" end="01:13:14.489" style="s2">it is good for continuing Aztec nests</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.330" end="01:13:17.160" style="s2">but it may not be good in some absolute</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.489" end="01:13:20.400" style="s2">moral sense so here&#39;s the question for</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.160" end="01:13:23.350" style="s2">you you&#39;re arguing for and I think an</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.400" end="01:13:25.330" style="s2">evolutionarily very viable explanation</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.350" end="01:13:27.490" style="s2">for religious belief and dogma but</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.330" end="01:13:29.620" style="s2">aren&#39;t you stuck with the downside of it</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.490" end="01:13:33.040" style="s2">where much of what is encoded in that</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.620" end="01:13:35.110" style="s2">way may actually be abhorrent yet really</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.040" end="01:13:37.390" style="s2">unconscious absolutely okay so what</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.110" end="01:13:39.130" style="s2">doubt about it what do we do about well</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.390" end="01:13:41.740" style="s2">this is this is exactly the sorting</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.130" end="01:13:44.080" style="s2">algorithm yes what isn&#39;t trying to get</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.740" end="01:13:45.820" style="s2">to it okay okay so this is actually why</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.080" end="01:13:48.700" style="s2">I asked Sam this question it wasn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.820" end="01:13:50.200" style="s2">wasn&#39;t an attack it&#39;s like okay so look</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.700" end="01:13:52.540" style="s2">people have these belief systems</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.200" end="01:13:54.970" style="s2">Christian Muslim Jew will say for that</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.540" end="01:13:57.100" style="s2">and you&#39;re saying abandon those let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.970" end="01:13:59.380" style="s2">say - - and move towards this</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.100" end="01:14:02.980" style="s2">transcendent rationality it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.380" end="01:14:04.630" style="s2">two problems it&#39;s not so easy to abandon</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.980" end="01:14:07.570" style="s2">a belief system because you end up in</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.630" end="01:14:09.400" style="s2">the moral relativist nihilist pit well</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.570" end="01:14:11.950" style="s2">the problem one doesn&#39;t have to well</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.400" end="01:14:15.160" style="s2">double tend to and so it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.950" end="01:14:17.440" style="s2">problem this is not and don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.160" end="01:14:19.150" style="s2">wait Sam that&#39;s a that&#39;s an empirical</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.440" end="01:14:20.830" style="s2">claim that we would think we&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.150" end="01:14:22.840" style="s2">find out whether that&#39;s true there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.830" end="01:14:24.580" style="s2">lot of evidence against that yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.840" end="01:14:25.930" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of evidence for it - but</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.580" end="01:14:27.520" style="s2">it&#39;s beside the point to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.930" end="01:14:29.080" style="s2">because that isn&#39;t that isn&#39;t something</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.520" end="01:14:30.190" style="s2">that I want to quibble about there</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.080" end="01:14:31.600" style="s2">perhaps there are trends</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.190" end="01:14:33.640" style="s2">there are transitional paths and</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.600" end="01:14:35.410" style="s2">sometimes people find a collapse of</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.640" end="01:14:36.760" style="s2">their faith actually freeing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.410" end="01:14:39.490" style="s2">certainly the case that many of the</p>

<p begin="01:14:39.490" end="01:14:43.000" style="s2">doing have found exactly that in what</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.320" end="01:14:44.620" style="s2">you&#39;ve been saying and more power to you</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.000" end="01:14:47.410" style="s2">and so on I&#39;m not willing to dispute</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.620" end="01:14:48.940" style="s2">that but what you said was okay here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.410" end="01:14:51.970" style="s2">these belief systems that are ancient</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.940" end="01:14:53.080" style="s2">and complex and we can step outside of</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.970" end="01:14:55.210" style="s2">the men there&#39;s this transcendent</p>

<p begin="01:14:55.210" end="01:15:03.010" style="s2">that would solve the problems it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.190" end="01:15:08.020" style="s2">okay what is it well what is it examine</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.010" end="01:15:10.570" style="s2">Imam to value all of the variables that</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.020" end="01:15:13.270" style="s2">conspire to make the one life we know we</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.570" end="01:15:14.800" style="s2">have can&#39;t value all those variables</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.270" end="01:15:16.420" style="s2">well no we can we were doing it right we</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.800" end="01:15:18.340" style="s2">do it every day and how we organize</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.420" end="01:15:21.070" style="s2">ourselves because I apply an a priori</p>

<p begin="01:16:52.900" end="01:16:56.050" style="s2">each of us owe the children of other</p>

<p begin="01:17:13.030" end="01:17:19.360" style="s2">extend the circle and again moral but it</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.910" end="01:17:21.100" style="s2">is not a mystery where we want to go</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.360" end="01:17:23.710" style="s2">here we want to extend the circle more</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.100" end="01:17:27.870" style="s2">and more and build institutions and</p>

<p begin="01:17:37.540" end="01:17:42.130" style="s2">said yeah alright so you are built to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.630" end="01:17:44.710" style="s2">more likely to rescue your own child</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.130" end="01:17:47.740" style="s2">than someone else&#39;s child from a fire we</p>

<p begin="01:17:58.390" end="01:18:04.750" style="s2">who on why might rescue religions do</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.750" end="01:18:07.510" style="s2">exactly this restructuring of values</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.750" end="01:18:10.000" style="s2">because they say something like actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.510" end="01:18:11.950" style="s2">your goodness in risking your own life</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.000" end="01:18:15.040" style="s2">to save that other child from the fire</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.950" end="01:18:16.960" style="s2">is observed and it is it is calculated</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.040" end="01:18:19.900" style="s2">and you will be rewarded for it in some</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.960" end="01:18:24.760" style="s2">way that if that&#39;s one possible benefit</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.900" end="01:18:26.410" style="s2">of some religions right good and ok so</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.760" end="01:18:27.670" style="s2">you put that on the balance but I have a</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.410" end="01:18:30.100" style="s2">lot to put on the other side of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.670" end="01:18:33.160" style="s2">ground do I know you know however and we</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.100" end="01:18:35.140" style="s2">list all right but that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.160" end="01:18:37.090" style="s2">trying to point out to Jordan here which</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.140" end="01:18:39.520" style="s2">he actually acknowledges which is that</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.090" end="01:18:43.000" style="s2">he&#39;s got a big stack of good things that</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.520" end="01:18:45.070" style="s2">come from this heuristic but he&#39;s also</p>

<p begin="01:18:45.070" end="01:18:48.010" style="s2">our core of disagreement here which is</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.420" end="01:18:50.200" style="s2">it however you want to however the</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.010" end="01:18:53.970" style="s2">balance is going to swing the difference</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.200" end="01:18:58.540" style="s2">between us here is that I think we read</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.970" end="01:19:00.930" style="s2">the utility of relevant of anything but</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.540" end="01:19:04.480" style="s2">in this case religious thinking as</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.930" end="01:19:07.900" style="s2">evidence of you you read it as evidence</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.480" end="01:19:12.220" style="s2">of something perhaps in it literally</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.900" end="01:19:15.490" style="s2">true inevitability ok so I say and I</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.220" end="01:19:17.380" style="s2">view that as a kind of version of either</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.490" end="01:19:20.200" style="s2">the genetic or naturalistic fallacy that</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.380" end="01:19:24.070" style="s2">it&#39;s just done whether whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.200" end="01:19:26.980" style="s2">it&#39;s useful now here for us it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.070" end="01:19:28.780" style="s2">doesn&#39;t argue that it&#39;s the best way of</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.980" end="01:19:30.610" style="s2">getting those good things I mean that my</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.780" end="01:19:32.500" style="s2">argument here is that religion gives</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.610" end="01:19:35.080" style="s2">people bad reasons to be good we&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.500" end="01:19:36.760" style="s2">reasons are available ok so and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.080" end="01:19:38.530" style="s2">problem right that because good read</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.760" end="01:19:41.560" style="s2">good reason scale better than bad</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.530" end="01:19:43.570" style="s2">reasons and I think we can under even if</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.560" end="01:19:47.410" style="s2">you take the case where religion is</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.570" end="01:19:51.340" style="s2">clearly useful in a life saving utterly</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.410" end="01:19:54.040" style="s2">benign way in in virtually all of those</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.340" end="01:19:56.200" style="s2">cases I think I can I can get you there</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.040" end="01:20:00.430" style="s2">by some other way without the the</p>

<p begin="01:20:01.099" end="01:20:06.289" style="s2">yes the fiction was more useful how many</p>

<p begin="01:20:11.570" end="01:20:15.530" style="s2">from it in a single conversation I would</p>

<p begin="01:23:26.410" end="01:23:32.020" style="s2">of other discoveries and other</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.870" end="01:23:34.270" style="s2">intuitions as you know which only if</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.020" end="01:23:35.140" style="s2">mathematical facts are intuitions then</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.270" end="01:23:38.620" style="s2">what are we doing</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.140" end="01:23:40.270" style="s2">let&#39;s take a table so we&#39;ve arrived we</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.620" end="01:23:43.450" style="s2">have to decide a super-important though</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.270" end="01:23:47.980" style="s2">okay okay we don&#39;t losers okay this is</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.450" end="01:23:50.260" style="s2">so we for what two thousand years people</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.980" end="01:23:53.050" style="s2">have been studying geometry and had a</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.260" end="01:23:55.630" style="s2">very well worked out set of mathematical</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.050" end="01:23:58.750" style="s2">intuitions with respect to Euclidean</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.630" end="01:24:00.520" style="s2">space you know flat geometry and then</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.750" end="01:24:01.660" style="s2">some brilliant guy you know riemann</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.520" end="01:24:04.600" style="s2">might have been the first said well</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.660" end="01:24:06.460" style="s2">actually you can curved space you know i</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.600" end="01:24:08.230" style="s2">can bend this triangle and all of a</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.460" end="01:24:09.190" style="s2">sudden that has more than 180 degrees</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.230" end="01:24:12.040" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.190" end="01:24:15.040" style="s2">that&#39;s an intuition that people tuned up</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.040" end="01:24:17.080" style="s2">pretty quickly but all of humanity was</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.040" end="01:24:20.710" style="s2">blind to it for the longest time right</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.080" end="01:24:22.900" style="s2">these are at what I mean by intuition is</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.710" end="01:24:25.690" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing you&#39;re using to</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.900" end="01:24:27.700" style="s2">understand something that you you are</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.690" end="01:24:30.490" style="s2">not in a position to analyze I am now</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.700" end="01:24:34.000" style="s2">that&#39;s but that&#39;s not faith of the sort</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.490" end="01:24:35.350" style="s2">which is listen I know the Bible was</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.000" end="01:24:38.740" style="s2">dictated by the creator of the universe</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.350" end="01:24:40.330" style="s2">I know Jesus was his son I know he rose</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.740" end="01:24:42.370" style="s2">from the dead I know he&#39;ll be coming</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.330" end="01:24:44.200" style="s2">back and a thousand other propositional</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.370" end="01:24:46.150" style="s2">claims it&#39;s a statement it&#39;s a highly</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.200" end="01:24:48.070" style="s2">valuable if it&#39;s a statement of faith</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.150" end="01:24:49.470" style="s2">and it&#39;s in the value domain how is it</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.070" end="01:24:53.200" style="s2">derived from fact</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.470" end="01:24:55.270" style="s2">okay so I&#39;ve we&#39;ve arrived at the point</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.200" end="01:24:58.060" style="s2">where we have to decide whether to go to</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.270" end="01:24:59.860" style="s2">QA or to continue the discussion while</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.060" end="01:25:01.720" style="s2">you all are thinking about that I would</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.860" end="01:25:03.550" style="s2">like to level a challenge to each of you</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.720" end="01:25:05.590" style="s2">and then I will pull the audience and</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.550" end="01:25:11.230" style="s2">see what they think about Q&amp;A okay okay</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.590" end="01:25:15.100" style="s2">so Jordan is arguing to you that you</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.230" end="01:25:18.070" style="s2">cannot ground the values that would</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.100" end="01:25:22.360" style="s2">undergird the modality of increasing</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.070" end="01:25:25.450" style="s2">well-being in anything factual and you</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.360" end="01:25:27.760" style="s2">are arguing in response that not without</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.450" end="01:25:29.170" style="s2">an intermediary so let me just argue and</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.760" end="01:25:31.000" style="s2">hold on a second</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.170" end="01:25:32.800" style="s2">not without an intermediary struck what</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.000" end="01:25:34.780" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard you argue is something that I</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.800" end="01:25:40.000" style="s2">agree with which is that you can ground</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.780" end="01:25:42.310" style="s2">many things in a nearly objective</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.000" end="01:25:44.500" style="s2">observation of the universe but it</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.310" end="01:25:46.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t say anything about the value</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.500" end="01:25:48.190" style="s2">part of the equation and in fact I think</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.480" end="01:25:49.930" style="s2">having thought about the question from</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.190" end="01:25:51.940" style="s2">an evolutionary point of view that in</p>

<p begin="01:25:54.040" end="01:25:58.300" style="s2">have to accept that that is going to</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.590" end="01:26:00.550" style="s2">leave you with an arbitrary grounding</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.300" end="01:26:02.020" style="s2">there is no absolute grounding for it</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.550" end="01:26:03.940" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have to just simply accept</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.020" end="01:26:05.740" style="s2">that it&#39;s going to make you arbitrary</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.940" end="01:26:09.100" style="s2">that you are in fact going to have to do</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.740" end="01:26:11.740" style="s2">no inconsistent things like decide to</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.100" end="01:26:14.620" style="s2">honor the love of a mother for her child</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.740" end="01:26:17.470" style="s2">and dishonor the love of country that</p>

<p begin="01:26:28.240" end="01:26:31.020" style="s2">but you just say we have to put stuff in</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.490" end="01:26:34.170" style="s2">somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.020" end="01:26:37.260" style="s2">we have a navigate the way it&#39;s grounded</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.170" end="01:26:40.680" style="s2">is the acknowledgement that what we have</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.260" end="01:26:43.680" style="s2">is it&#39;s analogous to what people do with</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.680" end="01:26:44.910" style="s2">the notion of meaning in life like</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.680" end="01:26:46.080" style="s2">what&#39;s the meaning of life how do you</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.910" end="01:26:48.420" style="s2">find meaning in life but what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.080" end="01:26:50.610" style="s2">purpose of life these are bad questions</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.420" end="01:26:53.400" style="s2">these are questions that but when you</p>

<p begin="01:27:48.200" end="01:27:52.170" style="s2">conscious minds that can thrive or</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.580" end="01:27:54.810" style="s2">suffer right and that the difference</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.170" end="01:27:57.950" style="s2">matters but we&#39;re in the circumstance</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.810" end="01:28:00.690" style="s2">where we are trying to understand how</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.950" end="01:28:04.080" style="s2">conscious consciousness and its States</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.690" end="01:28:10.220" style="s2">arises but one thing that is undeniable</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.080" end="01:28:15.240" style="s2">is that the lights are on and being on</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.220" end="01:28:19.800" style="s2">they reveal a spectrum of experience</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.240" end="01:28:23.460" style="s2">that which has one end that we the the</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.800" end="01:28:25.770" style="s2">worse it gets the more compelling it is</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.460" end="01:28:27.450" style="s2">to move away from it now meaning that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.770" end="01:28:29.700" style="s2">meaning yes okay so the soap and then</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.450" end="01:28:32.700" style="s2">and all of our meaning talk and value</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.700" end="01:28:34.020" style="s2">talk relates to navigating in this space</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.700" end="01:28:36.270" style="s2">so there&#39;s well there&#39;s one end of it</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.020" end="01:28:37.350" style="s2">where things get needlessly horrible</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.270" end="01:28:39.000" style="s2">without a silver lining</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.350" end="01:28:41.250" style="s2">and there&#39;s another end where it gets</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.000" end="01:28:42.600" style="s2">better and better and nonzero-sum and</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.250" end="01:28:44.100" style="s2">all boats are rising with the same</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.600" end="01:28:46.020" style="s2">tied and the Israelis and the</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.100" end="01:28:48.690" style="s2">Palestinians the landscape they evil and</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.020" end="01:28:50.850" style="s2">good yeah okay what do you do that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.690" end="01:28:54.150" style="s2">so these are compelling ways to talk</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.850" end="01:28:55.890" style="s2">about this space of navigation what do</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.150" end="01:28:57.480" style="s2">you do when you accept your space of</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.890" end="01:29:00.020" style="s2">navigation and there&#39;s a conflict</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.480" end="01:29:02.760" style="s2">between wellbeing for the living</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.020" end="01:29:05.010" style="s2">population of Earth roses well-being</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.760" end="01:29:07.170" style="s2">over the maximum populations that could</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.010" end="01:29:09.030" style="s2">possibly live into the future when they</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.170" end="01:29:11.370" style="s2">have a big conflict between how much</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.030" end="01:29:13.230" style="s2">well-being we are gonna feel now versus</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.370" end="01:29:15.090" style="s2">how much well-being future human beings</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.230" end="01:29:18.120" style="s2">will get to feel yeah well that those</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.090" end="01:29:20.490" style="s2">are legitimate ethical problems which</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.120" end="01:29:23.490" style="s2">but we I think we often live in the</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.490" end="01:29:27.570" style="s2">space where we know there&#39;s a right</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.490" end="01:29:30.090" style="s2">answer that we are too selfish to</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.570" end="01:29:32.130" style="s2">fulfill or too short-sighted to fulfill</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.090" end="01:29:34.680" style="s2">like so I know there are things I do</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.130" end="01:29:37.770" style="s2">every day that not only will other</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.680" end="01:29:40.200" style="s2">people as yet unborn wish I hadn&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.770" end="01:29:41.430" style="s2">I might wake up tomorrow wishing I</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.200" end="01:29:44.370" style="s2">hadn&#39;t done those things right so like</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.430" end="01:29:46.500" style="s2">I&#39;m I I&#39;m a bad friend to my future self</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.370" end="01:29:48.780" style="s2">in some respect to say nothing of the</p>

<p begin="01:29:48.780" end="01:29:52.380" style="s2">have failures of we could have weakness</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.520" end="01:29:54.600" style="s2">of will we can have failures that we can</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.380" end="01:29:57.990" style="s2">just be wrong about certain things but</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.600" end="01:30:00.360" style="s2">it&#39;s nowhere written that is easy to be</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.990" end="01:30:01.890" style="s2">a good person right in that case it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.360" end="01:30:05.280" style="s2">not even clear what good means well no I</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.890" end="01:30:07.380" style="s2">know it is clubs really knows oh the</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.280" end="01:30:08.910" style="s2">answer it might be hard to be motivated</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.380" end="01:30:10.770" style="s2">by that knowledge and that because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.910" end="01:30:15.510" style="s2">not a unity right I mean part of a part</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.770" end="01:30:17.910" style="s2">of what wisdom is morally is an ability</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.510" end="01:30:21.480" style="s2">to be able to live integrated enough</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.910" end="01:30:22.710" style="s2">with your own you know better self we</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.480" end="01:30:24.870" style="s2">have the advice you would give to a</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.710" end="01:30:27.120" style="s2">friend just falls right out of your work</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.870" end="01:30:28.800" style="s2">as well it&#39;s like well live is uh but</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.120" end="01:30:30.810" style="s2">basically treat yourself the way you</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.800" end="01:30:32.100" style="s2">would treat I think this is your line so</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.810" end="01:30:33.810" style="s2">you know someone new you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.100" end="01:30:36.330" style="s2">responsible for or there&#39;s some of you a</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.810" end="01:30:38.100" style="s2">friend of yours right if you can if you</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.330" end="01:30:40.170" style="s2">can do that you&#39;re already ahead of who</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.100" end="01:30:42.710" style="s2">most people are most of the time but</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.170" end="01:30:45.660" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no reason to say that</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.710" end="01:30:47.190" style="s2">because it&#39;s difficult or because</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.660" end="01:30:48.990" style="s2">sometimes we&#39;re looking through a glass</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.190" end="01:30:51.180" style="s2">darkly and can&#39;t figure out what the</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.990" end="01:30:52.649" style="s2">answer is the answer doesn&#39;t exist or</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.180" end="01:31:00.599" style="s2">there is no right one</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.649" end="01:31:06.209" style="s2">okay now let me try with you you yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.599" end="01:31:09.749" style="s2">Jordan you have argued for an evolved</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.209" end="01:31:12.090" style="s2">framework of religious belief in which</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.749" end="01:31:13.349" style="s2">there are elements that are morally</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.090" end="01:31:15.659" style="s2">defensible that will be carried through</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.349" end="01:31:16.979" style="s2">time there are elements that are morally</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.659" end="01:31:18.479" style="s2">reprehensible that will be carried</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.979" end="01:31:22.169" style="s2">through time by virtue of the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.479" end="01:31:24.689" style="s2">they are effective and you have argued</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.169" end="01:31:28.050" style="s2">that these things because they have</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.689" end="01:31:31.409" style="s2">withstood the test of time have some</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.050" end="01:31:33.570" style="s2">kind of value which is not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.409" end="01:31:37.530" style="s2">something that we should honor but some</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.570" end="01:31:40.769" style="s2">large fraction that it must be but that</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.530" end="01:31:43.919" style="s2">would seem to suggest that the degree to</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.769" end="01:31:47.099" style="s2">which these belief structures has value</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.919" end="01:31:48.809" style="s2">is contingent on the degree to which the</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.099" end="01:31:50.939" style="s2">environment in which we attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.809" end="01:31:52.469" style="s2">deploy these structures matches the</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.939" end="01:31:55.469" style="s2">environment in which they evolve</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.469" end="01:31:58.469" style="s2">absolutely now I would argue that no</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.469" end="01:32:01.379" style="s2">population of humans has lived farther</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.469" end="01:32:01.829" style="s2">from its ancestral environment than we</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.379" end="01:32:04.199" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.829" end="01:32:06.300" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a fallacy you think so yes</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.199" end="01:32:09.749" style="s2">well it isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t and look I think</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.300" end="01:32:13.110" style="s2">that&#39;s an absolutely valid point okay so</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.749" end="01:32:16.590" style="s2">much so this gets esoteric relatively</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.110" end="01:32:18.719" style="s2">rapidly but the question is let&#39;s say at</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.590" end="01:32:20.309" style="s2">the highest levels of adaptation were</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.719" end="01:32:22.709" style="s2">adapted to the things that lasts the</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.309" end="01:32:24.300" style="s2">longest periods of time okay those are</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.709" end="01:32:25.649" style="s2">the most permanent things now the</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.300" end="01:32:27.929" style="s2">question is what are those most</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.649" end="01:32:29.369" style="s2">permanent things and you know one answer</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.929" end="01:32:31.709" style="s2">would be the fundamental material</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.369" end="01:32:33.809" style="s2">substrate of the world and all right</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.709" end="01:32:35.820" style="s2">that&#39;s true I&#39;m gonna leave that be like</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.809" end="01:32:38.729" style="s2">we&#39;re evolved to deal with gravity okay</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.820" end="01:32:41.129" style="s2">but there are other elements that are</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.729" end="01:32:44.669" style="s2">higher order abstractions in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.129" end="01:32:46.829" style="s2">that are also apparently hyper real so</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.669" end="01:32:50.189" style="s2">for example there&#39;s there&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.829" end="01:32:51.329" style="s2">that we have a bifurcated brain the</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.189" end="01:32:53.459" style="s2">question is well why do we have a</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.329" end="01:32:55.889" style="s2">bifurcated brain and the answer seemed</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.459" end="01:32:57.659" style="s2">and not just us animals to master seems</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.889" end="01:32:59.099" style="s2">to be well there&#39;s two necessary ways of</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.659" end="01:33:00.749" style="s2">looking at the world and they have to be</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.099" end="01:33:02.939" style="s2">in conflict to some degree in order to</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.749" end="01:33:03.329" style="s2">work properly the right hemisphere mode</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.939" end="01:33:04.619" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.329" end="01:33:05.729" style="s2">left hemisphere mode the right</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.619" end="01:33:07.019" style="s2">hemisphere mode is a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.729" end="01:33:08.699" style="s2">metaphorical than the left hemisphere</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.019" end="01:33:10.139" style="s2">mode the right hemisphere is the</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.699" end="01:33:12.629" style="s2">hemisphere that seems to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.139" end="01:33:14.909" style="s2">exceptions to the rule and it seems to</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.629" end="01:33:18.449" style="s2">deal with exceptions to the rule by met</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.909" end="01:33:20.609" style="s2">by treating them by aggregating and then</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.449" end="01:33:23.309" style="s2">trying to recognize patterns that unite</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.609" end="01:33:24.719" style="s2">them as a corrective to the totalitarian</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.309" end="01:33:26.849" style="s2">system in some sense that the left</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.719" end="01:33:28.409" style="s2">hemisphere imposes you could say that</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.849" end="01:33:30.599" style="s2">the right and the left are adapted for</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.409" end="01:33:32.369" style="s2">something like explored territory for</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.599" end="01:33:34.129" style="s2">the left and unexplored territory for</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.369" end="01:33:37.649" style="s2">the right i&#39;ve characterized that as</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.129" end="01:33:40.349" style="s2">order versus chaos and i said i think</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.649" end="01:33:42.119" style="s2">the religious landscape is good versus</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.349" end="01:33:44.159" style="s2">evil to Sam&#39;s point that we should</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.119" end="01:33:45.989" style="s2">strive for a good life on a landscape of</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.159" end="01:33:48.539" style="s2">chaos first disorder and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.989" end="01:33:50.159" style="s2">landscape is permanent now I know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.539" end="01:33:52.639" style="s2">moved from our African ancestral</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.159" end="01:33:55.800" style="s2">homeland but these this underlying</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.639" end="01:33:57.629" style="s2">abstraction this underlying on this</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.800" end="01:34:00.389" style="s2">underlying reality is so profound that</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.629" end="01:34:01.609" style="s2">it it maintains its validity across all</p>

<p begin="01:34:08.780" end="01:34:13.739" style="s2">just a sea is on one piece you you put</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.579" end="01:34:15.989" style="s2">and play there here&#39;s why good and evil</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.739" end="01:34:17.489" style="s2">can&#39;t be permanent in the in the usual</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.989" end="01:34:20.659" style="s2">sense certainly not in the Christian or</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.489" end="01:34:22.320" style="s2">judeo-christian sense one is that the</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.659" end="01:34:25.679" style="s2">judeo-christian notion of good and evil</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.320" end="01:34:28.589" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even map on to eastern you made</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.679" end="01:34:30.689" style="s2">a good evil versus immoral lands Oh</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.589" end="01:34:32.309" style="s2">quite excited but it&#39;s also in an</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.689" end="01:34:34.979" style="s2">Eastern context and a Buddhist or Hindu</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.309" end="01:34:36.570" style="s2">context the evil isn&#39;t really evil is</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.979" end="01:34:37.619" style="s2">just ignorance now you might dispute</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.570" end="01:34:38.820" style="s2">that you might say well that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.619" end="01:34:40.289" style="s2">really that they haven&#39;t met a</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.820" end="01:34:43.849" style="s2">sufficiently evil person to if they</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.289" end="01:34:46.199" style="s2">could think that but the reality is</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.849" end="01:34:49.919" style="s2">they&#39;re billions of people who have a</p>

<p begin="01:34:56.339" end="01:35:02.159" style="s2">want this conversation to continue or do</p>

<p begin="01:35:17.219" end="01:35:28.110" style="s2">all right well now the group that would</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.760" end="01:35:30.179" style="s2">prefer Q&amp;A what&#39;s the former there what</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.110" end="01:35:33.300" style="s2">was disturbing is that many of the same</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.179" end="01:35:34.860" style="s2">people were clapping that proves what</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.300" end="01:35:40.170" style="s2">I&#39;m saying about the two hemispheres</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.860" end="01:35:42.420" style="s2">that are a metaphor so so look I mean it</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.170" end="01:35:45.539" style="s2">seems to me and again correct me if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.420" end="01:35:47.070" style="s2">wrong is that you made an absolute moral</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.539" end="01:35:50.309" style="s2">claim in the moral landscape and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.070" end="01:35:51.510" style="s2">what groans here take the Fievel piece</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.309" end="01:35:53.489" style="s2">because it&#39;ll be interesting if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.510" end="01:35:56.729" style="s2">totally on point okay the reason why</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.489" end="01:36:01.019" style="s2">evil is susceptible to total deflation</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.729" end="01:36:05.099" style="s2">is if you agree with me evil is a</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.019" end="01:36:08.639" style="s2">category of human misbehavior human</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.099" end="01:36:10.260" style="s2">intention that we don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.639" end="01:36:13.199" style="s2">significantly at the level of the brain</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.260" end="01:36:15.749" style="s2">but if we did understand it totally at</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.199" end="01:36:18.599" style="s2">the level of the brain then every evil</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.749" end="01:36:20.999" style="s2">person we had in the dock at trial would</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.599" end="01:36:24.420" style="s2">be just like Charles Whitman with his</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.999" end="01:36:26.449" style="s2">brain tumor after he shot up everyone at</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.420" end="01:36:28.949" style="s2">the University of Texas right so like</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.449" end="01:36:32.190" style="s2">he&#39;s at he&#39;s the prototypical</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.949" end="01:36:35.039" style="s2">evil mass murderer but he&#39;s complaining</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.190" end="01:36:36.869" style="s2">about that this change that overcame his</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.039" end="01:36:38.940" style="s2">personality and he thinks it would be</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.869" end="01:36:41.130" style="s2">good because a good idea that after the</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.940" end="01:36:42.300" style="s2">cops kill me you autopsy my brain</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.130" end="01:36:44.670" style="s2">because I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m doing any</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.300" end="01:36:46.229" style="s2">of this right and lo and behold he had a</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.670" end="01:36:47.400" style="s2">glioblastoma but president hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.229" end="01:36:49.889" style="s2">McDonough and all of a sudden it made</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.400" end="01:36:52.440" style="s2">sense of his behavior in a way that a</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.889" end="01:36:54.869" style="s2">full understanding of psychopathy or</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.440" end="01:36:57.239" style="s2">every other variant of human evil would</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.869" end="01:36:59.039" style="s2">make sense of it in a way that would be</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.239" end="01:37:00.150" style="s2">deflationary ethically and then and then</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.039" end="01:37:02.280" style="s2">you would look at so then you look at</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.150" end="01:37:04.199" style="s2">someone like Saddam Hussein or the the</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.280" end="01:37:07.650" style="s2">the worst evil person you could imagine</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.199" end="01:37:10.019" style="s2">and you would say well he&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.650" end="01:37:14.639" style="s2">unlucky you know there but for the grace</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.019" end="01:37:16.650" style="s2">of biology go I because if I had that</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.639" end="01:37:18.329" style="s2">brain if I had those genes if I had</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.650" end="01:37:21.630" style="s2">those influences that gave me those</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.329" end="01:37:22.949" style="s2">synapses I would be just like him now if</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.630" end="01:37:25.559" style="s2">you think there&#39;s some other element</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.949" end="01:37:27.239" style="s2">that gives us free will and and now then</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.559" end="01:37:29.249" style="s2">you and I are disagreeing then that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.239" end="01:37:29.860" style="s2">factual claim that&#39;s at variance with</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.249" end="01:37:33.760" style="s2">mine</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.860" end="01:37:36.369" style="s2">but but if we are just on some level now</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.760" end="01:37:38.350" style="s2">a malfunctioning biological systems when</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.369" end="01:37:41.050" style="s2">we&#39;re being evil then a complete</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.350" end="01:37:43.000" style="s2">understanding of evil would cancel that</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.050" end="01:37:44.110" style="s2">category can you have a claim define</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.000" end="01:37:44.469" style="s2">evil so we know what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.110" end="01:37:46.659" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.469" end="01:37:48.730" style="s2">well just let me take take just the</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.659" end="01:37:51.219" style="s2">worst people who have statistically</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.730" end="01:37:53.710" style="s2">victimized the most people and those are</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.219" end="01:37:55.449" style="s2">the evils people we can name so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.710" end="01:37:56.619" style="s2">so when you say so I think this is</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.449" end="01:37:59.260" style="s2">actually really important so I think</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.619" end="01:38:00.940" style="s2">actual evil of that kind is pretty darn</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.260" end="01:38:03.429" style="s2">rare and there&#39;s a lot of badness that</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.940" end="01:38:04.869" style="s2">yes oh yeah well the most troubling</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.429" end="01:38:06.940" style="s2">thing are all the good people doing evil</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.869" end="01:38:08.619" style="s2">because they&#39;re ruled by bad ideas but</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.940" end="01:38:10.780" style="s2">that I think is more consequential than</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.619" end="01:38:12.670" style="s2">we introduce we introduced a whole set</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.780" end="01:38:15.250" style="s2">of other things here in the last little</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.670" end="01:38:16.840" style="s2">round but a free will and evil but but</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.250" end="01:38:18.760" style="s2">but just I just want to make it clear</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.840" end="01:38:21.730" style="s2">why I went there so you were saying this</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.760" end="01:38:26.619" style="s2">is this is this is I forget that word</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.730" end="01:38:28.750" style="s2">you used inevitable or ineluctable or</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.619" end="01:38:31.179" style="s2">its permanent location is that this</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.750" end="01:38:33.429" style="s2">category is permanent and I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.179" end="01:38:34.960" style="s2">diet that I don&#39;t think ok but evil in</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.429" end="01:38:37.210" style="s2">that sense it&#39;s a permanent category for</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.960" end="01:38:39.730" style="s2">it awaits more information and insight</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.210" end="01:38:41.980" style="s2">ok we&#39;re going to distinguish for a</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.730" end="01:38:44.320" style="s2">minute good versus evil and good versus</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.980" end="01:38:47.199" style="s2">bad just for the sake of conceptual</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.320" end="01:38:50.920" style="s2">clarity in the moral landscape you make</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.199" end="01:38:52.690" style="s2">a fundamental axiomatic claim looks like</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.920" end="01:38:55.330" style="s2">a moral claim may be its claim a fact</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.690" end="01:38:57.670" style="s2">and the claim is there are bad lives and</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.330" end="01:38:59.920" style="s2">good lives sure and the claim you make</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.670" end="01:39:03.429" style="s2">is that that&#39;s universally true</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.920" end="01:39:05.830" style="s2">well it&#39;s is true for the the requisite</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.429" end="01:39:08.590" style="s2">mine who knows 10 Dewey&#39;s okay doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.830" end="01:39:09.909" style="s2">matter ok but evil so yes unless I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.590" end="01:39:12.909" style="s2">telling you that you should purge the</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.909" end="01:39:14.560" style="s2">word evil from your your vocabulary I</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.909" end="01:39:16.630" style="s2">use the word all the time and I think</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.560" end="01:39:19.540" style="s2">it&#39;s useful it&#39;s a motivating word I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.630" end="01:39:21.369" style="s2">just saying that it&#39;s ok there we can</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.540" end="01:39:24.219" style="s2">understand this continuum of good and</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.369" end="01:39:28.449" style="s2">bad or positive and negative in ways</p>

<p begin="01:42:19.449" end="01:42:24.090" style="s2">it&#39;s if if in fact we could inspect the</p>

<p begin="01:42:24.090" end="01:42:30.370" style="s2">participating in that it is not</p>

<p begin="01:42:30.370" end="01:42:34.630" style="s2">that they are just as happy as we are in</p>

<p begin="01:42:34.630" end="01:42:37.780" style="s2">this conversation I would say that they</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.860" end="01:42:39.969" style="s2">might be the happier yards feel good</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.780" end="01:42:41.800" style="s2">it&#39;s been good so let me let me ask you</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.969" end="01:42:43.540" style="s2">a question here about well-being because</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.800" end="01:42:46.060" style="s2">this is something I&#39;ve wanted to ask you</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.540" end="01:42:47.530" style="s2">about but we never seem to get to is so</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.060" end="01:42:49.330" style="s2">you think that we should maximize</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.530" end="01:42:51.910" style="s2">well-being and that&#39;s part of your</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.330" end="01:42:53.320" style="s2">proposition which which I don&#39;t entirely</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.910" end="01:42:55.810" style="s2">disagree with by the way that we should</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.320" end="01:42:58.360" style="s2">ground our value structures in facts but</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.810" end="01:43:00.730" style="s2">but but there&#39;s a black box problem</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.360" end="01:43:02.469" style="s2">there like I think the black box problem</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.730" end="01:43:04.840" style="s2">about the a priori structure that we use</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.469" end="01:43:09.010" style="s2">to extract the facts of the world out</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.840" end="01:43:11.920" style="s2">and the black box problem is if we could</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.010" end="01:43:14.290" style="s2">measure well-being it&#39;s like yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.920" end="01:43:15.790" style="s2">a big problem Sam like we have measures</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.290" end="01:43:18.550" style="s2">of well-being and they&#39;re terrible</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.790" end="01:43:21.070" style="s2">yes they are if you no no I I&#39;m agreeing</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.550" end="01:43:23.050" style="s2">I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think it&#39;s but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.070" end="01:43:24.699" style="s2">a problem for my thesis is it we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.050" end="01:43:26.800" style="s2">have measures for anything we care about</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.699" end="01:43:29.230" style="s2">we yeah but I mean if your if your</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.800" end="01:43:30.850" style="s2">thesis is that if we had the measures of</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.230" end="01:43:33.190" style="s2">well-being that were appropriate we</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.850" end="01:43:34.810" style="s2">could use them in a positive way and the</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.190" end="01:43:36.550" style="s2">responses but we don&#39;t have those</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.810" end="01:43:38.020" style="s2">measures it&#39;s like well okay well then</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.550" end="01:43:40.210" style="s2">what do we do oh no no what we have only</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.020" end="01:43:42.610" style="s2">have measures and if this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.210" end="01:43:44.500" style="s2">is a measure I don&#39;t like that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.610" end="01:43:46.930" style="s2">measure right you step on my toe and I</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.500" end="01:43:48.070" style="s2">say ow that&#39;s a measure don&#39;t do that if</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.930" end="01:43:49.840" style="s2">that&#39;s not a measure of your well-being</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.070" end="01:43:52.150" style="s2">it might be a measure of your treat your</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.840" end="01:43:54.880" style="s2">auto system its am it as a measure of</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.150" end="01:43:56.110" style="s2">but I mean that I measure non-points but</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.880" end="01:43:57.880" style="s2">I shouldn&#39;t expect I mean this</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.110" end="01:43:59.790" style="s2">technically if you look at the</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.880" end="01:44:02.170" style="s2">well-being measures that we have</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.790" end="01:44:02.809" style="s2">yeah they degenerated to measures of</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.170" end="01:44:05.340" style="s2">neuro</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.809" end="01:44:09.349" style="s2">we don&#39;t we don&#39;t but we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.340" end="01:44:13.409" style="s2">measures of certainty of belief of</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.349" end="01:44:14.939" style="s2">compassion of joy of any any of these</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.409" end="01:44:16.619" style="s2">conscious states we have we have neural</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.939" end="01:44:18.929" style="s2">correlates of some of them but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.619" end="01:44:21.030" style="s2">have okay there&#39;s no well then how to</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.929" end="01:44:22.739" style="s2">helmet I could also hold all rights</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.030" end="01:44:24.090" style="s2">about them to orient ourselves in the</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.739" end="01:44:27.090" style="s2">world then because we&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.090" end="01:44:28.649" style="s2">we&#39;re doing this all the time yours if</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.090" end="01:44:30.030" style="s2">you&#39;ve got an instantaneous measure</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.649" end="01:44:31.739" style="s2">though you&#39;ve got an instantaneous</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.030" end="01:44:33.840" style="s2">measure of well-being we can all check</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.739" end="01:44:35.519" style="s2">with ourselves see how we feel but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.840" end="01:44:41.939" style="s2">possible to be wrong about that right</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.519" end="01:44:44.179" style="s2">always but it degrades as you get away</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.939" end="01:44:47.159" style="s2">from the individual&#39;s ability to check</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.179" end="01:44:49.380" style="s2">internally the internal the internal</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.159" end="01:44:50.760" style="s2">thing isn&#39;t reliable its liable or happy</p>

<p begin="01:44:51.989" end="01:44:55.590" style="s2">you feel very good and would cause you</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.579" end="01:44:57.329" style="s2">to take apart your own life because it</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.590" end="01:44:59.010" style="s2">would mean like okay right you would it</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.329" end="01:45:00.329" style="s2">would destroy the the motivational</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.010" end="01:45:03.149" style="s2">structure that gets you to do stumps</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.329" end="01:45:05.010" style="s2">stuff of value that that you&#39;re right so</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.149" end="01:45:06.510" style="s2">we can&#39;t use emotion well right moment</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.010" end="01:45:09.510" style="s2">emotion as an indicator right well the</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.510" end="01:45:11.280" style="s2">in taneous is not good but you have a</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.510" end="01:45:13.649" style="s2">parallel problem it looks to me like the</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.280" end="01:45:17.699" style="s2">exact mirror image which is that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.649" end="01:45:19.530" style="s2">got an integrative long-term measure of</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.699" end="01:45:22.289" style="s2">well-being instantiated in an</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.530" end="01:45:24.449" style="s2">evolutionary belief system but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.289" end="01:45:26.489" style="s2">coming apart because we are living in</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.449" end="01:45:28.949" style="s2">circumstances that are less well</p>

<p begin="01:45:28.949" end="01:45:33.209" style="s2">mirror the past and therefore these</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.809" end="01:45:36.090" style="s2">games which you you believe our timeless</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.209" end="01:45:39.119" style="s2">are degrading rapidly that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.090" end="01:45:41.669" style="s2">there that&#39;s exactly right okay so what</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.119" end="01:45:44.340" style="s2">Sam is arguing is that the tools to</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.669" end="01:45:47.039" style="s2">pivot in order to improve our way of</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.340" end="01:45:48.899" style="s2">interacting those are not the tools of</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.039" end="01:45:51.869" style="s2">long-standing tradition those are the</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.899" end="01:45:53.039" style="s2">tools of rational engagement respect for</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.869" end="01:45:55.289" style="s2">that process is part of the</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.039" end="01:45:57.510" style="s2">long-standing tradition yes that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.289" end="01:45:59.669" style="s2">yeah but that&#39;s a big truth Mike that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.510" end="01:46:01.590" style="s2">a major-league truth I agree and in fact</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.669" end="01:46:03.239" style="s2">I would say the fundamental tradition</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.590" end="01:46:06.510" style="s2">the most fundamental tradition of the</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.239" end="01:46:08.519" style="s2">west says that respect for the process</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.510" end="01:46:10.079" style="s2">that updates moral judgment is the</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.519" end="01:46:11.999" style="s2">highest of all possible values and</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.079" end="01:46:14.789" style="s2">that&#39;s also built into the tradition</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.999" end="01:46:16.530" style="s2">strangely enough I agree it&#39;s built into</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.789" end="01:46:16.739" style="s2">the tradition but I would argue that it</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.530" end="01:46:19.949" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.739" end="01:46:21.690" style="s2">very likely to be compartmentalized in</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.949" end="01:46:25.199" style="s2">other words I was a little bit struck</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.690" end="01:46:32.010" style="s2">when you said that what did you say</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.199" end="01:46:34.409" style="s2">about scaling you said that that a good</p>

<p begin="01:46:37.559" end="01:46:42.960" style="s2">if you&#39;re calling these was stories that</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.199" end="01:46:44.789" style="s2">give prescriptions for how to behave bad</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.960" end="01:46:48.960" style="s2">ideas the point is those stories</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.789" end="01:46:50.219" style="s2">propagate very easily so where as so if</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.960" end="01:46:52.530" style="s2">we want to talk about the gun and</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.219" end="01:46:54.690" style="s2">whether it is loaded the idea that the</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.530" end="01:46:56.999" style="s2">gun is definitely loaded that scales</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.690" end="01:46:58.889" style="s2">really easily right you can pass that</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.999" end="01:47:00.090" style="s2">along in one sentence and the classic</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.889" end="01:47:02.039" style="s2">book the common way of it again I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.090" end="01:47:04.380" style="s2">wrong about a loaded gun also scale</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.039" end="01:47:07.309" style="s2">right so no no other no well this you</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.380" end="01:47:09.989" style="s2">want to talk to people about very small</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.309" end="01:47:12.599" style="s2">possibilities of very dire things</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.989" end="01:47:14.519" style="s2">happening they trip over it it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.599" end="01:47:16.769" style="s2">thing to get it&#39;s almost impossible for</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.519" end="01:47:18.420" style="s2">Golden together so the point is the one</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.769" end="01:47:20.190" style="s2">thing does scale the story that says</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.420" end="01:47:22.559" style="s2">yeah every gun is loaded it&#39;s a false</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.190" end="01:47:25.320" style="s2">story but that one definitely scales</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.559" end="01:47:26.789" style="s2">yeah the statistical reality of guns and</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.320" end="01:47:28.679" style="s2">the fact that they may indeed be</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.789" end="01:47:30.329" style="s2">unloaded but you don&#39;t want to play</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.679" end="01:47:33.030" style="s2">around with the remote possibility that</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.329" end="01:47:34.949" style="s2">one day you&#39;ll get it wrong right that</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.030" end="01:47:37.050" style="s2">doesn&#39;t scale because it requires you to</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.949" end="01:47:40.050" style="s2">have experience with stuff that is not</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.050" end="01:47:42.269" style="s2">common right so the two things there one</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.050" end="01:47:44.460" style="s2">if you bring up a an ancillary of a very</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.269" end="01:47:49.769" style="s2">important point which is that moral</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.460" end="01:47:56.400" style="s2">progress here is often the result of</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.769" end="01:47:58.760" style="s2">moving from our story driven protagonist</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.400" end="01:48:00.960" style="s2">driven intuitions to something far more</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.760" end="01:48:03.539" style="s2">quantified right so I mean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.960" end="01:48:05.789" style="s2">there&#39;s a classic you know moral study</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.539" end="01:48:08.969" style="s2">done by Paul slovic oh I&#39;m sure you are</p>

<p begin="01:51:20.280" end="01:51:26.370" style="s2">close to us and we can be told stories</p>

<p begin="01:59:17.949" end="01:59:22.900" style="s2">accident and that says something deep</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.860" end="01:59:25.179" style="s2">about us that we could understand at in</p>

<p begin="01:59:32.289" end="01:59:37.420" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing there&#39;s nothing that I</p>

<p begin="01:59:47.980" end="01:59:51.059" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.079" end="01:59:54.510" style="s2">basic claim however is that we never</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.059" end="01:59:57.510" style="s2">need to believe that one of our books</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.510" end="01:59:59.460" style="s2">may not have a human origin in order to</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.510" end="02:00:02.329" style="s2">do that effectively you can you can be</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.460" end="02:00:06.260" style="s2">just as compelled by the example of</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.329" end="02:00:08.849" style="s2">somebody like Jesus or some more modern</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.260" end="02:00:11.780" style="s2">person who strikes he was a moral hero</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.849" end="02:00:13.829" style="s2">and a BA and deeply wise without</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.780" end="02:00:18.510" style="s2">believing anything on insufficient</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.829" end="02:00:20.760" style="s2">evidence and if and and as I saluted to</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.510" end="02:00:23.520" style="s2">purely fictional stories about</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.760" end="02:00:24.869" style="s2">superheroes can have immense effect on</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.520" end="02:00:27.420" style="s2">us and that&#39;s something we could</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.869" end="02:00:29.250" style="s2">understand and also leverage but again</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.420" end="02:00:30.540" style="s2">that takes us out of the religion</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.250" end="02:00:32.699" style="s2">business and that&#39;s that&#39;s all I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.540" end="02:00:39.059" style="s2">arguing for so do you really believe</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.699" end="02:00:42.030" style="s2">that that the belief in the supernatural</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.059" end="02:00:44.750" style="s2">aspect of these stories never alters the</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.030" end="02:00:47.730" style="s2">calculus of what people should do that</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.750" end="02:00:49.500" style="s2">the divine nature of a story of AB Jesus</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.730" end="02:00:50.969" style="s2">doesn&#39;t motivate people to do something</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.500" end="02:00:52.469" style="s2">that they might not have the courage to</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.969" end="02:00:54.780" style="s2">do otherwise the belief that they might</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.469" end="02:00:56.670" style="s2">end up in heaven because their good work</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.780" end="02:00:58.320" style="s2">is going to be observed it doesn&#39;t alter</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.670" end="02:01:00.389" style="s2">their behavior well yeah I know it</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.320" end="02:01:01.619" style="s2">alters their behavior but it but rather</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.389" end="02:01:03.659" style="s2">often for the bad</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.619" end="02:01:05.760" style="s2">well I mean this is why this is what</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.659" end="02:01:08.969" style="s2">worries me about and hey I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.760" end="02:01:11.400" style="s2">something there&#39;s a profound net</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.969" end="02:01:15.389" style="s2">negative that we are paying paying the</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.400" end="02:01:17.760" style="s2">price for every day by believing in</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.389" end="02:01:21.000" style="s2">paradise right a belief a belief that</p>
<p begin="02:01:17.760" end="02:01:24.389" style="s2">this life it probably doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.000" end="02:01:28.079" style="s2">very much at all because we get what we</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.389" end="02:01:30.300" style="s2">really want after we die is forget about</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.079" end="02:01:34.469" style="s2">the evidentiary basis for that belief it</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.300" end="02:01:35.940" style="s2">it is it&#39;s ruinous for prioritizing what</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.469" end="02:01:38.730" style="s2">we should be prioritizing in this life</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.940" end="02:01:41.000" style="s2">and it with that by the way yeah ok well</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.730" end="02:01:41.000" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.500" end="02:01:49.860" style="s2">so let me ask you this I hear from you</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.460" end="02:01:52.620" style="s2">what might be a kind of confirmation</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.860" end="02:01:53.850" style="s2">bias where I hear that you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.620" end="02:01:56.280" style="s2">got a mixed bag</p>
<p begin="02:01:53.850" end="02:01:58.590" style="s2">you&#39;ve got supernatural claims these</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.280" end="02:01:59.880" style="s2">supernatural claims we all agree have</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.590" end="02:02:03.750" style="s2">effects on the way people actually</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.880" end="02:02:05.910" style="s2">behave and you&#39;re quite focused on the</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.750" end="02:02:08.250" style="s2">negative and you tend to discount the</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.910" end="02:02:09.870" style="s2">positive which might be an artifact of</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.250" end="02:02:11.790" style="s2">the fact that we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.870" end="02:02:13.530" style="s2">present and therefore maybe something</p>
<p begin="02:02:11.790" end="02:02:16.290" style="s2">that&#39;s not well matched to these stories</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.530" end="02:02:17.580" style="s2">or it might be from the idea that you</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.290" end="02:02:21.150" style="s2">have the sense that there is actually a</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.580" end="02:02:25.080" style="s2">bias that these belief structures do and</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.150" end="02:02:27.840" style="s2">have always produced more harm than good</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.080" end="02:02:30.900" style="s2">and also my sense that the positive can</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.840" end="02:02:33.600" style="s2">be had without those structures so the</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.900" end="02:02:35.400" style="s2">if you&#39;re talking about the the</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.600" end="02:02:37.320" style="s2">contemplative experience like is it</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.400" end="02:02:39.690" style="s2">possible to feed that wake up tomorrow</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.320" end="02:02:42.320" style="s2">morning feeling like meister eckhart</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.690" end="02:02:45.420" style="s2">right feeling like you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.320" end="02:02:48.990" style="s2">inseparable from the pure capital b beam</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.420" end="02:02:51.620" style="s2">that is consciousness right and then</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.990" end="02:02:55.110" style="s2">there&#39;s no separate self there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.620" end="02:02:56.760" style="s2">self-transcending union with everything</p>
<p begin="02:02:55.110" end="02:02:58.860" style="s2">you can perceive right I think that can</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.760" end="02:03:00.330" style="s2">be had without any kind of religious dog</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.860" end="02:03:01.770" style="s2">which is a mess just a matter of paying</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.330" end="02:03:03.540" style="s2">close enough attention to the nature of</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.770" end="02:03:05.520" style="s2">consciousness so the contemplatively is</p>
<p begin="02:03:03.540" end="02:03:08.310" style="s2">the bait is one baby in the bath water</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.520" end="02:03:10.020" style="s2">we can save the ethical life is another</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.310" end="02:03:12.120" style="s2">baby we can save you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="02:03:10.020" end="02:03:14.610" style="s2">presuppose anything on insufficient</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.120" end="02:03:16.470" style="s2">evidence to argue about what is right</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.610" end="02:03:18.570" style="s2">and wrong and good and evil in in the</p>
<p begin="02:03:16.470" end="02:03:21.570" style="s2">21st century and so is it fair to call</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.570" end="02:03:25.080" style="s2">that a hypothesis that not just for some</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.570" end="02:03:27.860" style="s2">people but for everyone the level of</p>
<p begin="02:03:25.080" end="02:03:30.330" style="s2">well-being can be enhanced through</p>

<p begin="02:03:35.340" end="02:03:41.760" style="s2">that the one additional fact that we</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.710" end="02:03:45.690" style="s2">that makes that more or less moot is</p>
<p begin="02:03:41.760" end="02:03:50.370" style="s2">that on certain points even if we felt</p>

<p begin="02:03:53.640" end="02:03:56.170" style="s2">depending on which fiction you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:03:55.270" end="02:03:58.210" style="s2">talking about they&#39;re simply just</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.170" end="02:04:00.460" style="s2">there&#39;s too much evidence against it</p>
<p begin="02:03:58.210" end="02:04:03.640" style="s2">that you can&#39;t you can&#39;t decide to</p>

<p begin="02:04:57.100" end="02:05:01.330" style="s2">think this is basically I mean we all</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.930" end="02:05:03.640" style="s2">suspend disbelief when we go and watch a</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.330" end="02:05:06.730" style="s2">movie and we sort of entitled a</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.640" end="02:05:08.410" style="s2">moviemaker to to set the ground rules of</p>
<p begin="02:05:06.730" end="02:05:10.240" style="s2">the space and if it&#39;s Harry Potter then</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.410" end="02:05:11.650" style="s2">there are magic magical rings that can</p>
<p begin="02:05:10.240" end="02:05:13.660" style="s2">happen and if it&#39;s some other story</p>
<p begin="02:05:11.650" end="02:05:16.150" style="s2">maybe there aren&#39;t so we all have a</p>

<p begin="02:05:16.150" end="02:05:21.370" style="s2">disbelief and it&#39;s interesting to me</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.610" end="02:05:23.580" style="s2">that you seem not to imagine that people</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.370" end="02:05:25.480" style="s2">are doing that with respect to</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.580" end="02:05:27.760" style="s2">metaphysical beliefs that have</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.480" end="02:05:30.280" style="s2">implications for what the right actions</p>
<p begin="02:05:27.760" end="02:05:32.350" style="s2">that they should take are why wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:05:30.280" end="02:05:35.200" style="s2">it be the case that that same sort of</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.350" end="02:05:37.360" style="s2">mechanism would apply well it does apply</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.200" end="02:05:40.510" style="s2">but there are people who are clearly</p>
<p begin="02:05:37.360" end="02:05:43.570" style="s2">doing much more than that so I&#39;m not if</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.510" end="02:05:45.820" style="s2">that&#39;s all people were doing under the</p>
<p begin="02:05:43.570" end="02:05:47.950" style="s2">ages of religion I wouldn&#39;t spend much</p>
<p begin="02:05:45.820" end="02:05:50.710" style="s2">time worrying about religion that some</p>
<p begin="02:05:47.950" end="02:05:52.420" style="s2">degree that&#39;s what people do you know as</p>
<p begin="02:05:50.710" end="02:05:54.280" style="s2">you say going to caring about things</p>
<p begin="02:05:52.420" end="02:05:56.350" style="s2">that at bottom we really shouldn&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.280" end="02:05:59.080" style="s2">about so the world cup is on right now</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.350" end="02:06:01.200" style="s2">and we you know literally billions of</p>
<p begin="02:05:59.080" end="02:06:03.750" style="s2">people care</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.200" end="02:06:05.910" style="s2">could care down to their toes what</p>
<p begin="02:06:03.750" end="02:06:09.000" style="s2">happens to this little ball as it</p>
<p begin="02:06:05.910" end="02:06:12.090" style="s2">traverses a lawn right and if it goes</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.000" end="02:06:14.190" style="s2">into the net it really matters and if it</p>
<p begin="02:06:12.090" end="02:06:16.500" style="s2">fails - it really matters and always</p>
<p begin="02:06:14.190" end="02:06:18.150" style="s2">matters if we hit the target Sam but</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.500" end="02:06:20.490" style="s2">this is this is something we have</p>
<p begin="02:06:18.150" end="02:06:22.680" style="s2">manufactured to care about right you</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.490" end="02:06:25.590" style="s2">know then it speaks to us it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.680" end="02:06:27.360" style="s2">literally a game we this is a game that</p>
<p begin="02:06:25.590" end="02:06:33.060" style="s2">people are playing but some people take</p>
<p begin="02:06:27.360" end="02:06:36.270" style="s2">it in taking it further than you that</p>
<p begin="02:06:33.060" end="02:06:37.950" style="s2">then seems truly rational is part of the</p>
<p begin="02:06:36.270" end="02:06:39.780" style="s2">fun that&#39;s but but if they ate but the</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.950" end="02:06:41.520" style="s2">people who can&#39;t turn that off metaphors</p>
<p begin="02:06:39.780" end="02:06:43.050" style="s2">the talkers are metaphor yeah but there</p>
<p begin="02:06:41.520" end="02:06:44.580" style="s2">but there are people who if they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.050" end="02:06:46.560" style="s2">know they&#39;re people you know the</p>
<p begin="02:06:44.580" end="02:06:49.170" style="s2">full-back who kicks a known goal and</p>
<p begin="02:06:46.560" end="02:06:51.120" style="s2">then goes back to his you know South</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.170" end="02:06:52.980" style="s2">American village and gets murdered right</p>
<p begin="02:06:51.120" end="02:06:55.410" style="s2">he&#39;s surrounded by people who are taking</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.980" end="02:06:57.930" style="s2">the game too seriously yeah okay I agree</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.410" end="02:06:59.700" style="s2">yes and so my problem with religion is</p>
<p begin="02:06:57.930" end="02:07:01.800" style="s2">that so much of a time we&#39;re meeting</p>
<p begin="02:06:59.700" end="02:07:03.570" style="s2">those people and what Edward yes and</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.800" end="02:07:05.670" style="s2">we&#39;re not criticizing those people have</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.570" end="02:07:07.500" style="s2">no place to stand to criticize those</p>
<p begin="02:07:05.670" end="02:07:11.280" style="s2">people because we&#39;re so attached to the</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.500" end="02:07:12.810" style="s2">game look why don&#39;t we don&#39;t actually do</p>
<p begin="02:07:11.280" end="02:07:15.000" style="s2">this why don&#39;t you each take three</p>
<p begin="02:07:12.810" end="02:07:16.860" style="s2">minutes to sum up so I think yet we are</p>
<p begin="02:07:15.000" end="02:07:18.960" style="s2">there we are at the end of time so why</p>
<p begin="02:07:16.860" end="02:07:21.590" style="s2">don&#39;t you each take three minutes sum up</p>
<p begin="02:07:18.960" end="02:07:24.600" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll call it good yep okay</p>
<p begin="02:07:21.590" end="02:07:24.960" style="s2">sure okay Sam went last you want to go</p>
<p begin="02:07:24.600" end="02:07:32.460" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="02:07:24.960" end="02:07:36.630" style="s2">first here okay so there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="02:07:32.460" end="02:07:40.200" style="s2">things about which Sam and I agree but</p>
<p begin="02:07:36.630" end="02:07:44.190" style="s2">the Devils in the details of course no I</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.200" end="02:07:47.220" style="s2">I&#39;m very sympathetic to his claim that</p>
<p begin="02:07:44.190" end="02:07:51.600" style="s2">we need to ground our ethical systems in</p>
<p begin="02:07:47.220" end="02:07:54.000" style="s2">something solid and demonstrable my</p>
<p begin="02:07:51.600" end="02:07:56.700" style="s2">problem is I&#39;m not sure how to do that</p>
<p begin="02:07:54.000" end="02:07:59.730" style="s2">when I I don&#39;t believe that you can</p>
<p begin="02:07:56.700" end="02:08:02.250" style="s2">derive a value structure from your</p>
<p begin="02:07:59.730" end="02:08:05.700" style="s2">experience of the observable facts</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.250" end="02:08:07.650" style="s2">there&#39;s too many facts you need a</p>
<p begin="02:08:05.700" end="02:08:10.050" style="s2">structure to interpret them and there</p>
<p begin="02:08:07.650" end="02:08:11.820" style="s2">isn&#39;t very much of you and so part of</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.050" end="02:08:14.070" style="s2">the reason part of the way that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:11.820" end="02:08:16.670" style="s2">addressed neurologically</p>
<p begin="02:08:14.070" end="02:08:20.219" style="s2">is that you have an inbuilt structure</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.670" end="02:08:22.920" style="s2">it&#39;s deep it&#39;s partly biological it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:20.219" end="02:08:25.739" style="s2">partly an emergent consequence of of</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.920" end="02:08:27.540" style="s2">your socialization and you view the</p>
<p begin="02:08:25.739" end="02:08:29.579" style="s2">world of facts through that structure</p>
<p begin="02:08:27.540" end="02:08:31.469" style="s2">and it&#39;s a structure of value</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.579" end="02:08:33.900" style="s2">now that structure of value may be</p>
<p begin="02:08:31.469" end="02:08:36.449" style="s2">derived from the world of facts over the</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.900" end="02:08:38.579" style="s2">evolutionary timeframe but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:08:36.449" end="02:08:40.469" style="s2">derived from the world of facts over the</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.579" end="02:08:44.699" style="s2">timeframe that you inhabit and it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:08:40.469" end="02:08:47.429" style="s2">be so the problem I have in with our</p>
<p begin="02:08:44.699" end="02:08:49.409" style="s2">discussion so far isn&#39;t really any of</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.429" end="02:08:50.760" style="s2">Sam&#39;s fundamental ethical claims because</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.409" end="02:08:53.070" style="s2">I do believe there&#39;s a distinction</p>
<p begin="02:08:50.760" end="02:08:55.110" style="s2">between the hellish life and the</p>
<p begin="02:08:53.070" end="02:08:56.849" style="s2">heavenly life say the life that everyone</p>
<p begin="02:08:55.110" end="02:08:58.770" style="s2">would agree was absolutely not worth</p>
<p begin="02:08:56.849" end="02:09:00.599" style="s2">living and the life we could imagine as</p>
<p begin="02:08:58.770" end="02:09:03.060" style="s2">good and I do believe that we should be</p>
<p begin="02:09:00.599" end="02:09:06.929" style="s2">moving from one to the other the</p>
<p begin="02:09:03.060" end="02:09:08.639" style="s2">question is exactly how is it that we</p>
<p begin="02:09:06.929" end="02:09:10.889" style="s2">make the decisions that will guide us</p>
<p begin="02:09:08.639" end="02:09:12.780" style="s2">along that way and I don&#39;t believe we</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.889" end="02:09:14.369" style="s2">can make them without that a priori</p>
<p begin="02:09:12.780" end="02:09:16.920" style="s2">structure in fact I think the evidence</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.369" end="02:09:18.690" style="s2">is absolutely overwhelming that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.920" end="02:09:21.360" style="s2">and I mean also the scientific evidence</p>
<p begin="02:09:18.690" end="02:09:24.090" style="s2">and I would like to go further into the</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.360" end="02:09:29.719" style="s2">devil that&#39;s in those details and so</p>
<p begin="02:09:24.090" end="02:09:29.719" style="s2">that&#39;s my situation at the moment</p>
<p begin="02:09:42.450" end="02:09:49.450" style="s2">well part of these conversations and now</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.870" end="02:09:51.460" style="s2">we&#39;ve you and I&#39;ve had I think for car</p>
<p begin="02:09:49.450" end="02:09:55.330" style="s2">moved unto podcasts or a second live</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.460" end="02:10:04.000" style="s2">event and thank you for doing this by</p>
<p begin="02:09:55.330" end="02:10:08.230" style="s2">the way this is hey it&#39;s an honor to do</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.000" end="02:10:11.590" style="s2">this and it&#39;s it comes with risks for</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.230" end="02:10:13.510" style="s2">both of us I think you can sense we</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.590" end="02:10:16.150" style="s2">don&#39;t have precisely the same audiences</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.510" end="02:10:19.180" style="s2">all of you are sort of rooting for one</p>
<p begin="02:10:16.150" end="02:10:22.890" style="s2">or the other of us to some degree or the</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.180" end="02:10:22.890" style="s2">Spirit of Truth yes</p>
<p begin="02:10:25.780" end="02:10:32.139" style="s2">and but clearly the conversation is the</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.280" end="02:10:34.719" style="s2">point right this is not it though this</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.139" end="02:10:37.389" style="s2">conversation had the character at many</p>
<p begin="02:10:34.719" end="02:10:40.059" style="s2">moments of a debate I don&#39;t think either</p>
<p begin="02:10:37.389" end="02:10:41.679" style="s2">of us view it as a debate in the the</p>
<p begin="02:10:40.059" end="02:10:44.999" style="s2">trivial sense it&#39;s not about point</p>
<p begin="02:10:41.679" end="02:10:47.139" style="s2">scoring it&#39;s about making sense in a way</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.999" end="02:10:48.639" style="s2">that&#39;s consequential because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.139" end="02:10:51.219" style="s2">talking about issues of great</p>
<p begin="02:10:48.639" end="02:10:55.570" style="s2">consequence and you obviously care about</p>
<p begin="02:10:51.219" end="02:10:57.489" style="s2">these things and it matters whether we</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.570" end="02:10:59.739" style="s2">converge on the most important questions</p>
<p begin="02:10:57.489" end="02:11:02.170" style="s2">in human life and as you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:10:59.739" end="02:11:05.110" style="s2">worried that religion doesn&#39;t give us</p>
<p begin="02:11:02.170" end="02:11:08.619" style="s2">the tools we need to converge what what</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.110" end="02:11:15.010" style="s2">does give us the tools is a truly</p>
<p begin="02:11:08.619" end="02:11:17.260" style="s2">open-ended conversation and what then</p>
<p begin="02:11:15.010" end="02:11:19.360" style="s2">you simply have to look honestly at the</p>
<p begin="02:11:17.260" end="02:11:23.979" style="s2">obstacles toward any conversation being</p>
<p begin="02:11:19.360" end="02:11:28.989" style="s2">open-ended and religion presents those</p>
<p begin="02:11:23.979" end="02:11:31.570" style="s2">first and most readily it&#39;s it is a the</p>
<p begin="02:11:28.989" end="02:11:34.710" style="s2">idea that certain things have been</p>
<p begin="02:11:31.570" end="02:11:37.960" style="s2">decided for all time and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.710" end="02:11:40.179" style="s2">future evidence or argument that is</p>
<p begin="02:11:37.960" end="02:11:43.360" style="s2">admissible on those points now that is</p>
<p begin="02:11:40.179" end="02:11:47.559" style="s2">clearly bad everywhere in science it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:43.360" end="02:11:50.590" style="s2">bad everywhere in in how we renegotiate</p>
<p begin="02:11:47.559" end="02:11:54.010" style="s2">our proximity to one another in society</p>
<p begin="02:11:50.590" end="02:11:55.300" style="s2">in new laws and new ideas are born all</p>
<p begin="02:11:54.010" end="02:11:57.309" style="s2">the time about how to structure</p>
<p begin="02:11:55.300" end="02:12:00.070" style="s2">institutions and social relationships</p>
<p begin="02:11:57.309" end="02:12:02.110" style="s2">because new things happen and we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:12:00.070" end="02:12:04.269" style="s2">have an internet and then we did so our</p>
<p begin="02:12:02.110" end="02:12:07.809" style="s2">old laws and our old expectations of</p>
<p begin="02:12:04.269" end="02:12:09.130" style="s2">human communication simply don&#39;t work in</p>
<p begin="02:12:07.809" end="02:12:10.719" style="s2">the presence of this new thing right so</p>
<p begin="02:12:09.130" end="02:12:13.510" style="s2">we have to figure out we again it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:12:10.719" end="02:12:18.130" style="s2">navigation problem and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:12:13.510" end="02:12:20.469" style="s2">perpetually in contest with even in</p>
<p begin="02:12:18.130" end="02:12:24.729" style="s2">conversations like this is the sense</p>
<p begin="02:12:20.469" end="02:12:27.369" style="s2">that the rules need to change just a</p>
<p begin="02:12:24.729" end="02:12:29.889" style="s2">little bit for this class of books that</p>
<p begin="02:12:27.369" end="02:12:32.349" style="s2">literally this side of the bookstore</p>
<p begin="02:12:29.889" end="02:12:35.079" style="s2">right there&#39;s like any other part of the</p>

<p begin="02:12:35.079" end="02:12:39.490" style="s2">to honest conversation but you move over</p>
<p begin="02:12:37.150" end="02:12:41.680" style="s2">here they&#39;ve got this shelf of books</p>
<p begin="02:12:39.490" end="02:12:45.220" style="s2">there you you have to hold your tongue</p>

<p begin="02:12:49.090" end="02:12:53.080" style="s2">the best players ever written and some</p>

<p begin="02:12:59.970" end="02:13:04.780" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing we have to outgrow and</p>
<p begin="02:13:02.770" end="02:13:09.040" style="s2">so at what I&#39;m continually in tension</p>
<p begin="02:13:04.780" end="02:13:12.130" style="s2">with you is the degree to which your</p>

<p begin="02:13:12.130" end="02:13:17.110" style="s2">the power of narrative and and the</p>
<p begin="02:13:14.200" end="02:13:19.150" style="s2">meaning derived from it Alive&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="02:13:17.110" end="02:13:21.430" style="s2">point and seems to let people off the</p>
<p begin="02:13:19.150" end="02:13:23.560" style="s2">hook on that very point and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:13:21.430" end="02:13:25.930" style="s2">that&#39;s where we need to hold the line in</p>
<p begin="02:13:23.560" end="02:13:28.989" style="s2">my view we need to we need to</p>

<p begin="02:13:31.540" end="02:13:38.770" style="s2">that that it has to be clear to us at</p>
<p begin="02:13:36.280" end="02:13:41.790" style="s2">this moment in history that no one has</p>
<p begin="02:13:38.770" end="02:13:45.100" style="s2">the right to their religious</p>
<p begin="02:13:41.790" end="02:13:47.170" style="s2">sectarianism really I mean up to the</p>
<p begin="02:13:45.100" end="02:13:49.780" style="s2">point clearly that there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="02:13:49.780" end="02:13:56.890" style="s2">that is benign but once it gets taken</p>
<p begin="02:13:52.450" end="02:13:59.440" style="s2">past that point we we have to figure out</p>
<p begin="02:13:56.890" end="02:14:01.990" style="s2">how to pull the brakes and that becomes</p>
<p begin="02:13:59.440" end="02:14:04.540" style="s2">a real problem if you are if you are</p>
<p begin="02:14:01.990" end="02:14:06.820" style="s2">going to dignify the foundational claims</p>
<p begin="02:14:04.540" end="02:14:09.580" style="s2">of these faiths claims like revelation</p>
<p begin="02:14:06.820" end="02:14:11.470" style="s2">and paradigms and blasphemy and apostasy</p>
<p begin="02:14:09.580" end="02:14:15.040" style="s2">these are the things that you will you</p>
<p begin="02:14:11.470" end="02:14:16.210" style="s2">come up against and I think converse</p>
<p begin="02:14:15.040" end="02:14:19.570" style="s2">conversations like this are incredibly</p>
<p begin="02:14:16.210" end="02:14:21.790" style="s2">important because we we need to convince</p>
<p begin="02:14:19.570" end="02:14:25.380" style="s2">the better part of humanity that is</p>
<p begin="02:14:21.790" end="02:14:28.660" style="s2">possible to live the best life possible</p>
<p begin="02:14:25.380" end="02:14:31.450" style="s2">without recourse to divisive nonsense</p>
<p begin="02:14:28.660" end="02:14:33.880" style="s2">and where we draw the line between</p>
<p begin="02:14:31.450" end="02:14:35.710" style="s2">divisive nonsense and reasoned and</p>
<p begin="02:14:33.880" end="02:14:37.270" style="s2">necessary discourse is what we&#39;re we</p>
<p begin="02:14:35.710" end="02:14:41.040" style="s2">were dickering over and i think i think</p>
<p begin="02:14:37.270" end="02:14:41.040" style="s2">it&#39;s important that we we continue</p>
<p begin="02:14:55.179" end="02:14:57.810" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="02:14:59.830" end="02:15:06.310" style="s2">in closing let me say first of all I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:15:02.530" end="02:15:10.739" style="s2">tremendously honored that you asked me</p>
<p begin="02:15:06.310" end="02:15:10.739" style="s2">to moderate these debates yeah we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:15:16.100" end="02:15:21.780" style="s2">it was a truly remarkable experience as</p>
<p begin="02:15:19.470" end="02:15:23.940" style="s2">for what was accomplished I think it was</p>
<p begin="02:15:21.780" end="02:15:26.940" style="s2">a tremendous amount I saw both of you</p>
<p begin="02:15:23.940" end="02:15:29.310" style="s2">move I saw both of you exhibit</p>
<p begin="02:15:26.940" end="02:15:33.360" style="s2">tremendous generosity of spirit towards</p>
<p begin="02:15:29.310" end="02:15:35.250" style="s2">the other and I think this has exceeded</p>
<p begin="02:15:33.360" end="02:15:36.990" style="s2">my expectations of what might have been</p>
<p begin="02:15:35.250" end="02:15:37.260" style="s2">possible in these discussions by quite a</p>
<p begin="02:15:36.990" end="02:15:41.550" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="02:15:37.260" end="02:15:43.680" style="s2">and that also I will say has a lot to do</p>
<p begin="02:15:41.550" end="02:15:46.440" style="s2">with the fact that for reasons I think</p>
<p begin="02:15:43.680" end="02:15:49.590" style="s2">none of us can explain a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="02:15:46.440" end="02:15:52.950" style="s2">people a huge population seems to care</p>
<p begin="02:15:49.590" end="02:15:54.900" style="s2">about these issues because they matter a</p>
<p begin="02:15:52.950" end="02:15:56.910" style="s2">great deal so anyway I think this has</p>
<p begin="02:15:54.900" end="02:15:59.220" style="s2">been a very successful exercise and I</p>
<p begin="02:15:56.910" end="02:16:01.260" style="s2">think you can both justly be quite proud</p>
<p begin="02:15:59.220" end="02:16:02.430" style="s2">of what you&#39;ve done all right let&#39;s give</p>
<p begin="02:16:01.260" end="02:16:05.090" style="s2">a huge round of applause for our</p>
