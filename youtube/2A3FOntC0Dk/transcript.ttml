<p begin="00:00:01.139" end="00:00:06.000" style="s2">so today I want to review a book that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.670" end="00:00:08.230" style="s2">think is absolutely vital for</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.000" end="00:00:10.059" style="s2">understanding how we got into the global</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.230" end="00:00:11.920" style="s2">predicaments that we&#39;re in and how we</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.059" end="00:00:15.160" style="s2">can get out of them and that is this</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.920" end="00:00:17.560" style="s2">book moral origins the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.160" end="00:00:20.980" style="s2">virtue altruism and shame by Christopher</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.560" end="00:00:24.069" style="s2">Bohm so Christopher Boehm is a highly</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.980" end="00:00:25.720" style="s2">respected anthropologist who initially</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.069" end="00:00:27.880" style="s2">worked with Jane Goodall studying</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.720" end="00:00:31.500" style="s2">primate behavior and then later went on</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.880" end="00:00:34.120" style="s2">to study social behavior immorality and</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.500" end="00:00:37.210" style="s2">hunter-gatherer societies and what he</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.120" end="00:00:40.120" style="s2">did in this book moral origins is he</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.210" end="00:00:43.180" style="s2">explored the question how did social</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.120" end="00:00:45.340" style="s2">behavior arise in human evolution and in</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.180" end="00:00:48.430" style="s2">particular during the long period of</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.340" end="00:00:51.070" style="s2">time from roughly 200,000 years ago up</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.430" end="00:00:52.930" style="s2">until the present in some cases or</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.070" end="00:00:55.180" style="s2">10,000 years ago before agrarian</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.930" end="00:00:58.270" style="s2">societies he has the question in that</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.180" end="00:01:01.410" style="s2">context how did cooperation arise how</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.270" end="00:01:04.210" style="s2">was antisocial behavior contained and</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.410" end="00:01:08.079" style="s2">what can we learn about that in order to</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.210" end="00:01:11.409" style="s2">create social policies today that help</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.079" end="00:01:12.789" style="s2">us manage the sanctioning of bad</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.409" end="00:01:15.789" style="s2">behavior on the promotion of good</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.789" end="00:01:17.859" style="s2">behavior in society writ large so what</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.789" end="00:01:21.009" style="s2">he found that I think is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.859" end="00:01:23.350" style="s2">helpful for us is he found that there is</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.009" end="00:01:26.649" style="s2">always a small percentage of any society</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.350" end="00:01:28.030" style="s2">that is going to be antisocial and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.649" end="00:01:31.600" style="s2">way that I came to understand this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.030" end="00:01:33.670" style="s2">that about 1% of any population is born</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.600" end="00:01:36.249" style="s2">psychopathic meaning that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.670" end="00:01:38.619" style="s2">able to feel bad about harm caused to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.249" end="00:01:41.409" style="s2">others so they have to learn the rules</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.619" end="00:01:44.279" style="s2">of the social group and experience the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.409" end="00:01:47.109" style="s2">social modeling or the social behavior</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.279" end="00:01:49.479" style="s2">that they need to learn by how other</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.109" end="00:01:51.609" style="s2">people treat them and so what he did as</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.479" end="00:01:53.920" style="s2">he looked at a particular time in our</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.609" end="00:01:56.649" style="s2">evolutionary history which was the time</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.920" end="00:01:59.319" style="s2">when small bands of hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.649" end="00:02:02.740" style="s2">societies typically of 30 to 50 members</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.319" end="00:02:04.959" style="s2">would engage in big game hunting and big</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.740" end="00:02:08.539" style="s2">game hunting requires cooperation and</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.959" end="00:02:10.399" style="s2">then sharing of the spoils of</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.539" end="00:02:12.349" style="s2">so one thing that he found was that in</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.399" end="00:02:14.840" style="s2">all hunter-gatherer societies that</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.349" end="00:02:17.799" style="s2">anthropologists have studied and he did</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.840" end="00:02:20.090" style="s2">a law a very comprehensive and broad</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.799" end="00:02:22.310" style="s2">survey of the anthropological research</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.090" end="00:02:24.709" style="s2">was he found that in all cases they were</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.310" end="00:02:26.840" style="s2">egalitarian and he asked the question</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.709" end="00:02:30.319" style="s2">how did this cooperative behavior arise</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.840" end="00:02:31.519" style="s2">and the simple answer in case you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.319" end="00:02:34.370" style="s2">want to read the book and just cut to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.519" end="00:02:36.889" style="s2">the chase is that he found that for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.370" end="00:02:39.980" style="s2">antisocial behaviors these people that</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.889" end="00:02:43.519" style="s2">would be want to be dictators or bullies</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.980" end="00:02:46.220" style="s2">in other words the Psychopaths that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.519" end="00:02:48.799" style="s2">group would behave as a collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.220" end="00:02:50.989" style="s2">individual to suppress that bully and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.799" end="00:02:53.419" style="s2">keep them from rising to power so they</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.989" end="00:02:56.389" style="s2">did this through three levels of social</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.419" end="00:02:58.669" style="s2">sanctioning the first level was shaming</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.389" end="00:03:00.620" style="s2">meaning that if a person engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.669" end="00:03:02.750" style="s2">antisocial behavior they were humiliated</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.620" end="00:03:04.280" style="s2">in front of the group and if this didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.750" end="00:03:07.129" style="s2">work then they went to the next level</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.280" end="00:03:09.379" style="s2">which was ostracism kicking that</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.129" end="00:03:11.120" style="s2">individual out of the group because they</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.379" end="00:03:13.579" style="s2">were deemed to be bad for the group and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.120" end="00:03:16.250" style="s2">of course in hunter-gatherer societies</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.579" end="00:03:18.379" style="s2">being ostracized meant nearer certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.250" end="00:03:20.690" style="s2">death so this was quite a significant</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.379" end="00:03:22.879" style="s2">behavior and then the third level of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.690" end="00:03:25.489" style="s2">sanctioning of behavior which happened</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.879" end="00:03:27.560" style="s2">much less frequently was execution</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.489" end="00:03:30.019" style="s2">meaning that if the individual was bound</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.560" end="00:03:32.150" style="s2">to be I&#39;m so harmful to the community</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.019" end="00:03:34.340" style="s2">and they weren&#39;t able to remove the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.150" end="00:03:37.310" style="s2">their behavior through the earth the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.340" end="00:03:39.099" style="s2">less of your means than in very rare</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.310" end="00:03:41.329" style="s2">cases they would actually execute them</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.099" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">so this tells us a very important lesson</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.329" end="00:03:46.849" style="s2">that in our world as we move into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:49.220" style="s2">21st century we need to reclaim the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.849" end="00:03:50.599" style="s2">sanctioning of moral behavior meaning we</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.220" end="00:03:52.970" style="s2">need to have collective sanctions</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.599" end="00:03:56.470" style="s2">against bad behavior if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.970" end="00:03:58.609" style="s2">promote the innate and natural</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.470" end="00:04:00.799" style="s2">pro-social and cooperative behaviors of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.609" end="00:04:02.629" style="s2">humans so if you want to understand more</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.799" end="00:04:05.239" style="s2">about how this works and what</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.629" end="00:04:07.639" style="s2">anthropologists have learned across the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.239" end="00:04:09.979" style="s2">decades of research and how pro-social</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.639" end="00:04:12.560" style="s2">behavior arises in human groups and also</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.979" end="00:04:15.439" style="s2">how to design social policies that</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.560" end="00:04:17.810" style="s2">promote social behavior and deter</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.439" end="00:04:19.489" style="s2">antisocial behavior then this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.810" end="00:04:20.690" style="s2">those foundational texts that you will</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.489" end="00:04:23.200" style="s2">want to read so again</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.690" end="00:04:25.310" style="s2">moral origins by Christopher Boehm an</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.200" end="00:04:28.040" style="s2">extremely important piece of scholarly</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.310" end="00:04:30.620" style="s2">work that is accessible to the layperson</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.040" end="00:04:33.530" style="s2">so there you have it i hope this is</p>
