<p begin="00:04:24.910" end="00:04:28.270" style="s2">of boring for the most part in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.620" end="00:04:31.300" style="s2">the actual substantive speeches I only</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.270" end="00:04:32.740" style="s2">watched about two or three I thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.300" end="00:04:34.600" style="s2">Michelle Malkin speech was certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.740" end="00:04:36.370" style="s2">highlight I thought she Spitfire but</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.600" end="00:04:38.169" style="s2">what was she talking about mostly most</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.370" end="00:04:39.580" style="s2">people don&#39;t know I don&#39;t so Michelle</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.169" end="00:04:41.200" style="s2">Malkin just gave a speech and got up</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.580" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">there and immediately made the point of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.200" end="00:04:44.190" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:46.620" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna go along because there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.190" end="00:04:48.180" style="s2">one panel on immigration and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.620" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">ridiculous because it is the most</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.180" end="00:04:51.990" style="s2">important issue that we face right so</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:54.590" style="s2">she made a big point of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.990" end="00:04:57.479" style="s2">the harms of illegal immigration and of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.590" end="00:04:59.009" style="s2">over extensive legal immigration and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.479" end="00:05:00.150" style="s2">I mean she&#39;s an immigration restriction</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.009" end="00:05:01.979" style="s2">Asst</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.150" end="00:05:03.629" style="s2">and it was a you know very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.979" end="00:05:06.180" style="s2">speech she made the point of you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.629" end="00:05:07.979" style="s2">aggressively mocking and criticizing</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.180" end="00:05:11.580" style="s2">almost every previous Republican</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.979" end="00:05:13.349" style="s2">administration from Bush onwards and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.580" end="00:05:15.030" style="s2">other people as well Romney and even the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.349" end="00:05:17.039" style="s2">ghost of John McCain which apparently</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.030" end="00:05:18.300" style="s2">made people very angry you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.039" end="00:05:20.759" style="s2">not allowed to criticize a dead guy</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.300" end="00:05:22.500" style="s2">apparently not well apparently not I</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.759" end="00:05:27.030" style="s2">don&#39;t think the left got that message</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.500" end="00:05:28.740" style="s2">no no I mean you know well it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.030" end="00:05:30.360" style="s2">many things it&#39;s where I mean suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.740" end="00:05:31.949" style="s2">people who are useful to the Left become</p>

<p begin="00:05:31.949" end="00:05:36.900" style="s2">strange new respect for John McCain John</p>

<p begin="00:06:00.569" end="00:06:05.190" style="s2">I think people sort of look back on him</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.729" end="00:06:06.630" style="s2">as being a total disaster yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.190" end="00:06:08.340" style="s2">think I think that whole era of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.630" end="00:06:10.620" style="s2">conservatism has looked on with kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.340" end="00:06:12.539" style="s2">shame and it just wasn&#39;t really that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.620" end="00:06:14.130" style="s2">present if you actually went around CPAC</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.539" end="00:06:15.630" style="s2">and you looked at who was there it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.130" end="00:06:17.969" style="s2">mean there&#39;s sort of a Trump takeover of</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.630" end="00:06:20.370" style="s2">CPAC yeah and in an in something of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.969" end="00:06:22.050" style="s2">nationalist takeover to you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.370" end="00:06:23.550" style="s2">still you know plenty of kind of older</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.050" end="00:06:25.500" style="s2">school ideas but they&#39;re finding</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.550" end="00:06:27.300" style="s2">themselves trying to fit in to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.500" end="00:06:29.250" style="s2">modern conservatism rather than there</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.300" end="00:06:30.599" style="s2">being this uneasy tension I think that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.250" end="00:06:32.400" style="s2">that there was a lot of tension last</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.599" end="00:06:34.620" style="s2">year but this year you know for example</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.400" end="00:06:36.509" style="s2">we had the social media censorship panel</p>

<p begin="00:06:43.560" end="00:06:46.590" style="s2">crew and then there was like another</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.759" end="00:06:48.300" style="s2">like 30 people sort of stuffed in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.590" end="00:06:50.729" style="s2">tiny little room right where was it this</p>

<p begin="00:07:36.480" end="00:07:38.670" style="s2">that you should have the same right to</p>

<p begin="00:07:38.670" end="00:07:43.260" style="s2">park and I feel like that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.160" end="00:07:44.700" style="s2">simple but controversial is there any</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.260" end="00:07:47.070" style="s2">legal precedent for something like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.700" end="00:07:49.800" style="s2">no I mean there people make arguments</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.070" end="00:07:51.420" style="s2">that there is a legal precedent use</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.800" end="00:07:53.250" style="s2">using cases like packing them if we</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.420" end="00:07:54.810" style="s2">really want to get into the weeds of why</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.250" end="00:07:57.060" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that case actually</p>

<p begin="00:07:57.060" end="00:08:00.630" style="s2">yeah we don&#39;t want to get into the weeds</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.380" end="00:08:03.750" style="s2">no but the the basic are I think we</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.630" end="00:08:05.490" style="s2">actually do need new laws mmm like and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.750" end="00:08:07.530" style="s2">take the aggressive position here that</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.490" end="00:08:10.710" style="s2">we should use government power to</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.530" end="00:08:13.800" style="s2">achieve conservative ends and existing</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.710" end="00:08:15.900" style="s2">law is a tough fit with what we need in</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.800" end="00:08:17.990" style="s2">terms of social media companies so we</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.900" end="00:08:22.260" style="s2">should write new law to protect</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.990" end="00:08:24.780" style="s2">conservative speech online okay now sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.260" end="00:08:27.050" style="s2">of in the same context of CPAC having a</p>

<p begin="00:08:34.950" end="00:08:38.190" style="s2">mean it&#39;s not depends on how what type</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.900" end="00:08:39.479" style="s2">of conservative you&#39;re thinking about if</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.190" end="00:08:40.890" style="s2">you classify Teddy Roosevelt as a</p>

<p begin="00:08:44.400" end="00:08:47.310" style="s2">read some biographies of Teddy Roosevelt</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.870" end="00:08:48.930" style="s2">in the past year and really sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.310" end="00:08:51.510" style="s2">empathize with him a lot there was an</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.930" end="00:08:53.700" style="s2">attitude that the idea of regulating</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.510" end="00:08:56.100" style="s2">John Rockefeller was preposterous among</p>

<p begin="00:08:56.100" end="00:08:59.670" style="s2">sort of ridiculous that this one guy has</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.350" end="00:09:00.660" style="s2">more power than the federal government</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.670" end="00:09:02.070" style="s2">or could have more power than the</p>

<p begin="00:09:24.490" end="00:09:28.480" style="s2">end of the day I think is the Civil</p>

<p begin="00:11:28.250" end="00:11:31.130" style="s2">about it more practically speaker and</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.630" end="00:11:32.480" style="s2">like how and we don&#39;t have to get too</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.130" end="00:11:34.490" style="s2">deep into this but it definitely rose</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.480" end="00:11:37.730" style="s2">rate begs the questions in my head and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.490" end="00:11:39.320" style="s2">out okay uh you know if we can&#39;t solve</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.730" end="00:11:41.540" style="s2">that question then at least we can put</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.320" end="00:11:45.230" style="s2">like roadblocks or obstacles or hurdles</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.540" end="00:11:48.260" style="s2">or breaks or a governor on on that like</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.230" end="00:11:50.330" style="s2">do you have any fear that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.260" end="00:11:52.790" style="s2">start you will you start we do it again</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.330" end="00:11:57.350" style="s2">and then you you like the threshold gets</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.790" end="00:12:00.230" style="s2">lower next time no I I they&#39;re they want</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.350" end="00:12:01.460" style="s2">the left want socialism there are that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.230" end="00:12:04.550" style="s2">already part of the mainstream discourse</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.460" end="00:12:06.230" style="s2">like the question is whether or not</p>

<p begin="00:12:11.780" end="00:12:15.410" style="s2">thinking oh well if we do this we might</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.400" end="00:12:16.760" style="s2">risk setting a precedent that the left</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.410" end="00:12:18.350" style="s2">will be able to abused in the future my</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.760" end="00:12:20.480" style="s2">argument would be on the contrary if we</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.350" end="00:12:22.610" style="s2">don&#39;t do this we&#39;re risking not a</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.480" end="00:12:26.050" style="s2">precedent being set but rather a</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.610" end="00:12:28.280" style="s2">political takeover in essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.050" end="00:12:30.590" style="s2">paradigm shift in the way politics works</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.280" end="00:12:33.110" style="s2">because of the dominance of the left</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.590" end="00:12:35.060" style="s2">over social media in addition to every</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.110" end="00:12:36.920" style="s2">other institution they dominate mmm and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.060" end="00:12:38.180" style="s2">if that happens then the erosion of our</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.920" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">liberties and the creep towards</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.180" end="00:12:41.840" style="s2">government intervention will increase</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.920" end="00:12:44.270" style="s2">far more dramatically than it will is</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.840" end="00:12:47.210" style="s2">the result of any precedent we create by</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.270" end="00:12:49.730" style="s2">regulating big tech now mmm fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.210" end="00:12:52.160" style="s2">that&#39;s really fascinating and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.730" end="00:12:55.970" style="s2">things that brings up that I discussed</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.160" end="00:12:58.910" style="s2">on Prior podcast with John rabe that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.970" end="00:13:00.650" style="s2">know our current sort of you know call</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.910" end="00:13:02.240" style="s2">it a civil war or not I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.650" end="00:13:05.860" style="s2">the current conflict that we have right</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.240" end="00:13:08.510" style="s2">now between the red insurgency the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.860" end="00:13:10.730" style="s2">resistance and there&#39;s a third group of</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.510" end="00:13:11.780" style="s2">corporations and right now it seems as</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.730" end="00:13:15.020" style="s2">though that the corporations and</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.780" end="00:13:16.910" style="s2">resistance are have an alignment where I</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.020" end="00:13:18.530" style="s2">have an alliance against the insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.910" end="00:13:19.820" style="s2">and they&#39;re working together not</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.530" end="00:13:22.190" style="s2">necessarily because they have common</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.820" end="00:13:23.870" style="s2">goals because they have common enemy</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.190" end="00:13:26.540" style="s2">sort of the same thing but you</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.870" end="00:13:30.350" style="s2">understand the distinction right to what</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.540" end="00:13:31.500" style="s2">extent does the insurgency becoming the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.350" end="00:13:33.390" style="s2">ones that wants to crack</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.500" end="00:13:35.640" style="s2">down on corporations thereby only</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.390" end="00:13:37.230" style="s2">further embolden that alliance against</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.640" end="00:13:40.170" style="s2">us and have them just sort of have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.230" end="00:13:41.910" style="s2">longer and stronger reason to be united</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.170" end="00:13:43.560" style="s2">in the war against us because I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.910" end="00:13:47.730" style="s2">talking with our friend Jack so back the</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.560" end="00:13:49.380" style="s2">other day how do one strategy is we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.730" end="00:13:52.260" style="s2">to like drive a wedge between the</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.380" end="00:13:55.230" style="s2">corporations and the resistance I fear</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.260" end="00:13:57.270" style="s2">if we do this way we&#39;re just gonna like</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.230" end="00:13:59.340" style="s2">solidify that alliance against us for</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.270" end="00:14:00.930" style="s2">the next 10 20 years to come so I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.340" end="00:14:04.020" style="s2">part of the reason the there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.930" end="00:14:06.380" style="s2">reasons that the corporations are on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.020" end="00:14:08.790" style="s2">resistances side one is a change in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.380" end="00:14:10.410" style="s2">geographic center of our economy to</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.790" end="00:14:12.780" style="s2">Silicon Valley which is a deeply liberal</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.410" end="00:14:14.460" style="s2">place right and the staff of the most</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.780" end="00:14:16.080" style="s2">important corporations of the world is</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.460" end="00:14:19.500" style="s2">you know derived from a place that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.080" end="00:14:22.380" style="s2">like 95 percent democratic and then the</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.500" end="00:14:24.600" style="s2">second is sort of a underlying shift in</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.380" end="00:14:26.880" style="s2">the parties whereby the Republicans have</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.600" end="00:14:27.540" style="s2">become more of a party of the working</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.880" end="00:14:30.330" style="s2">class</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.540" end="00:14:32.520" style="s2">then the war ever before and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.330" end="00:14:34.230" style="s2">this class divide manifests itself and</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.520" end="00:14:36.000" style="s2">people who were previously big business</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.230" end="00:14:38.510" style="s2">elites deciding that they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.000" end="00:14:41.700" style="s2">aligned of the Democrats than otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.510" end="00:14:45.450" style="s2">so I guess my answer to that is that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.700" end="00:14:47.820" style="s2">think those two dynamics mean that the I</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.450" end="00:14:49.230" style="s2">don&#39;t think that we can change that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.820" end="00:14:52.710" style="s2">don&#39;t think the prospect of putting a</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.230" end="00:14:56.580" style="s2">wedge between corporations and the left</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.710" end="00:14:58.470" style="s2">is that will work that well because at</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.580" end="00:15:00.300" style="s2">the end of the day the people staffing</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.470" end="00:15:02.460" style="s2">these core personnel is policy and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.300" end="00:15:04.290" style="s2">personnel despises the nationalist</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.460" end="00:15:09.480" style="s2">movement thinks it&#39;s totally wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.290" end="00:15:11.550" style="s2">misguided and I think moreover that it</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.480" end="00:15:13.380" style="s2">is not a bad thing to be on the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.550" end="00:15:16.050" style="s2">side of the corporations I really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.380" end="00:15:17.430" style="s2">think it&#39;s that bad if we in a world</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.050" end="00:15:18.990" style="s2">where we can make sure to use the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.430" end="00:15:21.420" style="s2">government to ensure that we have access</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.990" end="00:15:24.330" style="s2">to social media the ability of big money</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.420" end="00:15:25.560" style="s2">to influence elections is seriously</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.330" end="00:15:26.970" style="s2">constrained right like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.560" end="00:15:28.920" style="s2">interesting things about modern politics</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.970" end="00:15:30.839" style="s2">the left is so focused on campaign</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.920" end="00:15:32.790" style="s2">finance reform to me that&#39;s just be its</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.839" end="00:15:34.710" style="s2">its passe it doesn&#39;t matter as much</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.790" end="00:15:36.600" style="s2">anymore because social media</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.710" end="00:15:38.430" style="s2">amplification there&#39;s little you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.600" end="00:15:40.530" style="s2">money plays a little bit of a role but</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.430" end="00:15:44.459" style="s2">Donald Trump spent one tenth of what</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.530" end="00:15:45.450" style="s2">Hillary Clinton spent so can we use the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.459" end="00:15:46.980" style="s2">resources we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.450" end="00:15:49.590" style="s2">to put together a winning political</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.980" end="00:15:50.670" style="s2">coalition and I think it&#39;s easier to put</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.590" end="00:15:51.720" style="s2">together a winning couple itical</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.670" end="00:15:53.130" style="s2">coalition when you&#39;re defending the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.720" end="00:15:53.640" style="s2">people against the corporations and not</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.130" end="00:15:55.590" style="s2">vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.640" end="00:15:59.190" style="s2">mmm that&#39;s interesting you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.590" end="00:16:01.710" style="s2">funny I remember in the the 90s the WTO</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.190" end="00:16:04.440" style="s2">protests in Seattle it was an Tifa and</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.710" end="00:16:07.230" style="s2">black bloc uh and then Occupy Wall</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.440" end="00:16:09.240" style="s2">Street and Occupy DC and Tifa black bloc</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.230" end="00:16:12.590" style="s2">all against corporations corporate greed</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.240" end="00:16:15.030" style="s2">big money etc now all of a sudden and</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.590" end="00:16:16.620" style="s2">Tifa black bloc all those guys they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.030" end="00:16:18.480" style="s2">on the same team with the corporations</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.620" end="00:16:20.730" style="s2">how the hell did that happen well well</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.480" end="00:16:23.640" style="s2">it turns out corporate it&#39;s easier to</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.730" end="00:16:25.380" style="s2">beat your opponents and remove them from</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.640" end="00:16:26.940" style="s2">the public square potentially if you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.380" end="00:16:29.640" style="s2">get the corporations to do it for you</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.940" end="00:16:33.240" style="s2">so they infiltrated them and staff them</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.640" end="00:16:34.620" style="s2">up so that is obviously the threat to</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.240" end="00:16:35.760" style="s2">having corporations the wrong side of</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.620" end="00:16:37.920" style="s2">you is the hope is that they might</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.760" end="00:16:40.290" style="s2">censor you which was why we need to</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.920" end="00:16:41.700" style="s2">regulate big tech to rent them from</p>

<p begin="00:16:41.700" end="00:16:44.130" style="s2">we&#39;re not allowed to do that and I&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.050" end="00:16:45.570" style="s2">well then we need to figure out a way to</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.130" end="00:16:47.970" style="s2">get the corporations back on our side</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.570" end="00:16:49.980" style="s2">somehow I don&#39;t know how if we don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:16:55.440" end="00:16:58.950" style="s2">make it profitable to be conservative</p>

<p begin="00:16:58.950" end="00:17:02.970" style="s2">like cultural you know it&#39;s in 2019</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.350" end="00:17:05.250" style="s2">culture matters more than economics it</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.970" end="00:17:07.260" style="s2">really yeah it&#39;s just you know my</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.250" end="00:17:09.240" style="s2">libertarian background I went to George</p>

<p begin="00:17:09.240" end="00:17:13.589" style="s2">is like basically the number two capitol</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.150" end="00:17:15.900" style="s2">of libertarian thought in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.589" end="00:17:18.060" style="s2">country after University of Chicago and</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.900" end="00:17:20.400" style="s2">it&#39;s actually only gotten I say worse</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.060" end="00:17:23.089" style="s2">now it&#39;s only gotten worse since I since</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.400" end="00:17:26.250" style="s2">I left but you know this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.089" end="00:17:28.260" style="s2">regulating the markets just grates me</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.250" end="00:17:30.570" style="s2">right because of my training in my</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.260" end="00:17:33.030" style="s2">background and such but I was I watched</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.570" end="00:17:35.280" style="s2">a monologue from Tucker Carlson the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.030" end="00:17:37.860" style="s2">other day an old one but I came across</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.280" end="00:17:40.920" style="s2">it again and it was where he went on for</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.860" end="00:17:44.010" style="s2">about 15 minutes about free markets are</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.920" end="00:17:46.320" style="s2">not a religion and they&#39;re not the goal</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.010" end="00:17:49.650" style="s2">free markets are not the goal the goal</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.320" end="00:17:51.750" style="s2">is you know some other metric of human</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.650" end="00:17:54.090" style="s2">you know happiness success health or</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.750" end="00:17:57.690" style="s2">whatever and that free markets are but</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.090" end="00:17:58.179" style="s2">merely a tool to achieve whatever we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.690" end="00:18:00.490" style="s2">our goal</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.179" end="00:18:05.019" style="s2">is for Humanity and that really struck</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.490" end="00:18:07.779" style="s2">me as a as a sensible empathetic you</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.019" end="00:18:11.470" style="s2">know future forward thinking perspective</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.779" end="00:18:13.690" style="s2">that is I you know I I&#39;m not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.470" end="00:18:15.279" style="s2">like a Republican conservative historian</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.690" end="00:18:17.710" style="s2">here or anything but like it strikes me</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.279" end="00:18:19.360" style="s2">that that is a new perspective would you</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.710" end="00:18:21.759" style="s2">say that that&#39;s true like that within</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:23.080" style="s2">the right-wing thinking cuz I think a</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.759" end="00:18:25.059" style="s2">lot of us went through a libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.080" end="00:18:26.919" style="s2">phase I mean it&#39;s hard for me to talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.059" end="00:18:29.110" style="s2">about what say Republican thought was</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.919" end="00:18:31.509" style="s2">like in I don&#39;t know the 1940s and 50s</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.110" end="00:18:34.360" style="s2">I&#39;m not actually that good a historian</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.509" end="00:18:36.669" style="s2">of political thought really but I do</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.360" end="00:18:38.950" style="s2">know that in the modern era ever since</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.669" end="00:18:41.320" style="s2">you know the 1970s and 80s that that</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.950" end="00:18:43.059" style="s2">would that is very hetero Doc&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.320" end="00:18:45.340" style="s2">and that&#39;s forty years of political</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.059" end="00:18:46.659" style="s2">thought and political positioning on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.340" end="00:18:50.019" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.659" end="00:18:51.519" style="s2">I think it&#39;s overdue III find thyself</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.019" end="00:18:54.639" style="s2">I found myself very persuaded by that</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.519" end="00:18:57.190" style="s2">point as well and I also am a big</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.639" end="00:18:58.899" style="s2">believer as a corollary I think the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.190" end="00:19:01.990" style="s2">right needs to avoid any self-defeating</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.899" end="00:19:03.639" style="s2">principles right like if your principle</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.990" end="00:19:06.039" style="s2">leads to your own political defeat then</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.639" end="00:19:08.289" style="s2">it&#39;s not a principle worth keeping dis</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.039" end="00:19:10.119" style="s2">genic yeah is familiar with this is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.289" end="00:19:12.970" style="s2">bad principle for you to hold on to so</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.119" end="00:19:15.580" style="s2">very principle is we&#39;re not gonna ever</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.970" end="00:19:17.830" style="s2">discuss regulating big tech companies</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.580" end="00:19:19.509" style="s2">because the free market should be this</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.830" end="00:19:20.860" style="s2">only solution we use to solving any</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.509" end="00:19:22.119" style="s2">problems we have politically and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.860" end="00:19:23.619" style="s2">like well that&#39;s funny because the</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.119" end="00:19:25.960" style="s2">Socialists will been and then you&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.619" end="00:19:27.700" style="s2">nothing of what you want right right and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.960" end="00:19:30.070" style="s2">Republicans and conservatives will find</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.700" end="00:19:31.899" style="s2">themselves the continually excluded from</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.070" end="00:19:33.340" style="s2">more and more things and by the time you</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.899" end="00:19:35.350" style="s2">realize that oh my gosh we need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.340" end="00:19:37.779" style="s2">actually do something about how the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.350" end="00:19:40.509" style="s2">world has we&#39;ve turned into the private</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.779" end="00:19:42.100" style="s2">GDR right a private jerk you know German</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.509" end="00:19:43.929" style="s2">Democratic Republic where you can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.100" end="00:19:45.759" style="s2">publicly what you want a privately</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.929" end="00:19:46.179" style="s2">enforced Social Credit System it&#39;ll be</p>

<p begin="00:19:46.179" end="00:19:50.529" style="s2">right yeah there&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.279" end="00:19:52.389" style="s2">thought experiment out there about when</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.529" end="00:19:54.850" style="s2">you make everything free total freedom</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.389" end="00:19:56.440" style="s2">liberty and whatnot then like tyranny</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.850" end="00:19:59.350" style="s2">well that&#39;s the conditions for tyranny</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.440" end="00:20:01.960" style="s2">to arise right so you have to amman this</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.350" end="00:20:03.879" style="s2">balance this essential balance which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.960" end="00:20:05.889" style="s2">what&#39;s been debated forever and will be</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.879" end="00:20:08.169" style="s2">debated forever and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.889" end="00:20:09.970" style="s2">fascinating that we have this this real</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.169" end="00:20:11.950" style="s2">case study right now yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.970" end="00:20:13.929" style="s2">and you know we can say we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.950" end="00:20:15.460" style="s2">to go circle back and wrap up on CPAC</p>

<p begin="00:23:04.090" end="00:23:07.390" style="s2">and interacting with you that that can</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.380" end="00:23:09.370" style="s2">really suck your time away so I guess a</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.390" end="00:23:11.260" style="s2">Joe Joe you know he does spend a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.370" end="00:23:13.240" style="s2">time producing content but I just would</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.260" end="00:23:14.800" style="s2">have thought in the conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.240" end="00:23:16.420" style="s2">he was having with people that he would</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.800" end="00:23:19.180" style="s2">have gotten the download but apparently</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.420" end="00:23:20.830" style="s2">not so Tim so Tim gives him so he goes</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.180" end="00:23:23.110" style="s2">Jack Jack Dorsey goes on the show</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.830" end="00:23:24.790" style="s2">Joe basically softballs him the whole</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.110" end="00:23:26.440" style="s2">time just talks to him about Joe so -</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.790" end="00:23:28.480" style="s2">like to run a company you know and like</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.440" end="00:23:31.060" style="s2">Jack&#39;s the boringest interview you ever</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.480" end="00:23:34.420" style="s2">ever saw in your whole entire life</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.060" end="00:23:36.190" style="s2">and it enraged Alex Jones because Alex</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.420" end="00:23:38.200" style="s2">Jones felt like Joe a pass up an</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.190" end="00:23:41.230" style="s2">opportunity to really dig in onto the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.200" end="00:23:44.710" style="s2">issues and then Alex goes on Joe show</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.230" end="00:23:46.990" style="s2">they they make up Joe promises to dig</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.710" end="00:23:48.670" style="s2">into it a little bit deeper and who does</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.990" end="00:23:51.220" style="s2">he pull up to dig into a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.670" end="00:23:52.840" style="s2">deeper but our buddy Tim ya know cuz</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.220" end="00:23:54.640" style="s2">apparently Tim did a video on what he</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.840" end="00:23:57.070" style="s2">thought the podcast itself was bad and</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.640" end="00:23:58.990" style="s2">then Joe apparently apparently Joe had</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.070" end="00:24:01.000" style="s2">already been following Tim like</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.990" end="00:24:03.610" style="s2">they described this on the Rubin report</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.000" end="00:24:07.900" style="s2">right in Tim poo and on Ruben yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.610" end="00:24:09.310" style="s2">I think and so they have this DM</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.900" end="00:24:11.080" style="s2">conversation and Joe was like hey call</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.310" end="00:24:13.240" style="s2">me up and eventually they have like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.080" end="00:24:16.390" style="s2">ended up - Tim being brought out to do a</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.240" end="00:24:17.860" style="s2">podcast one-on-one with Joe that went</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.390" end="00:24:19.720" style="s2">well and then apparently there was</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.860" end="00:24:23.110" style="s2">already some discussion about bringing</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.720" end="00:24:25.450" style="s2">him back to go have a combined podcast</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.110" end="00:24:26.860" style="s2">with him Jack Dorsey and somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.450" end="00:24:29.790" style="s2">in this case it turned out to be vidya</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.860" end="00:24:32.770" style="s2">right so that was how that came about</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.790" end="00:24:35.170" style="s2">is an incredible podcast I think Tim did</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.770" end="00:24:36.220" style="s2">a wonderful job of confronting Jack and</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.170" end="00:24:38.380" style="s2">Vidya with</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.220" end="00:24:41.169" style="s2">and considered the idea that their rule</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.380" end="00:24:43.360" style="s2">about dead naming and misgendering was</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.169" end="00:24:45.280" style="s2">inherently ideological yeah and a</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.360" end="00:24:47.559" style="s2">demonstration of an underlying bias that</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.280" end="00:24:50.350" style="s2">various of these bannings were overdone</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.559" end="00:24:54.250" style="s2">or ridiculous or ridiculous and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.350" end="00:24:55.659" style="s2">also that the sort of the problem of how</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.250" end="00:24:57.309" style="s2">each of these individual decisions</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.659" end="00:24:59.020" style="s2">always seems to go in one direction you</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.309" end="00:25:01.000" style="s2">know it&#39;s like grains of sand making a</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.020" end="00:25:02.650" style="s2">heap look like every single decision you</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.000" end="00:25:04.240" style="s2">make where you say oh we made a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.650" end="00:25:05.679" style="s2">or oh you have to understand the full</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.240" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">context or oh whatever</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.679" end="00:25:09.070" style="s2">if every single one of those decisions</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:12.549" style="s2">is ending up with the left-wing outcome</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.070" end="00:25:14.200" style="s2">result like you&#39;re biased right even if</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.549" end="00:25:15.789" style="s2">any individual decision is explainable</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.200" end="00:25:18.100" style="s2">like if they&#39;re all coming out the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.789" end="00:25:19.960" style="s2">way right your bias I mean I live</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.100" end="00:25:22.210" style="s2">through Twitter bias I mean a year ago I</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.960" end="00:25:24.850" style="s2">got doxxed and somebody like literally</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.210" end="00:25:27.039" style="s2">engaged in a full-on targeted harassment</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.850" end="00:25:29.350" style="s2">campaign of daxing like definition of</p>

<p begin="00:25:36.100" end="00:25:40.690" style="s2">and all of my followers reported all</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.320" end="00:25:42.400" style="s2">these all these tweets they all came</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.690" end="00:25:43.390" style="s2">back is approved without any problem I</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.400" end="00:25:45.789" style="s2">mean there couldn&#39;t have been a more</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.390" end="00:25:48.400" style="s2">clear case of like violating or Terms of</p>

<p begin="00:25:48.400" end="00:25:52.720" style="s2">harassment you know misinformation lying</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.710" end="00:25:56.470" style="s2">actual harm created in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.720" end="00:25:58.510" style="s2">etc but nobody nobody cared yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.470" end="00:26:00.909" style="s2">I tell people now that you know Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.510" end="00:26:03.640" style="s2">has gotten better in the sense of they</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.909" end="00:26:04.870" style="s2">are less likely to come up you know ban</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.640" end="00:26:06.880" style="s2">you for things that aren&#39;t rule</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.870" end="00:26:08.950" style="s2">violations so like in the last year or</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.880" end="00:26:10.360" style="s2">so I think they&#39;ve sort of gotten a hold</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.950" end="00:26:12.130" style="s2">of okay we need to be at least somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.360" end="00:26:14.350" style="s2">more consistent so when we do actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.130" end="00:26:15.669" style="s2">enforce the rules we can point to real</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.350" end="00:26:19.059" style="s2">violations and not just ban people</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.669" end="00:26:20.230" style="s2">arbitrarily right but that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.059" end="00:26:23.200" style="s2">that they enforce the rules against</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.230" end="00:26:24.789" style="s2">everybody equally correct right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.200" end="00:26:26.350" style="s2">like basically what it means is if the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.789" end="00:26:28.870" style="s2">rules apply to you as a conservative</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.350" end="00:26:30.789" style="s2">they don&#39;t apply to the Liberals and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.870" end="00:26:33.010" style="s2">know I do tell people that it&#39;s like but</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.789" end="00:26:34.780" style="s2">you know that right like stop why I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.010" end="00:26:36.580" style="s2">in the context of your own personal</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.780" end="00:26:38.140" style="s2">Twitter use look the fact that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.580" end="00:26:39.250" style="s2">going to just enforce the rules if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.140" end="00:26:42.070" style="s2">stay within the lines you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.250" end="00:26:43.510" style="s2">get banned like stay on the lines right</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.070" end="00:26:44.830" style="s2">it&#39;s some unit or something you have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.510" end="00:26:47.919" style="s2">deal with and like I&#39;m dealing with it</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.830" end="00:26:49.159" style="s2">all the time I I feel as though there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.919" end="00:26:51.080" style="s2">just any minute it could</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.159" end="00:26:52.909" style="s2">hammer could come yeah and I worry about</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.080" end="00:26:55.220" style="s2">that intensely and a lot of people do</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.909" end="00:26:56.690" style="s2">and I think one of the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.220" end="00:26:59.210" style="s2">things to come out of that is you really</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.690" end="00:27:01.220" style="s2">did see Jack more than Vijaya who seems</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.210" end="00:27:02.809" style="s2">sort of intensely focused on the nuts</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.220" end="00:27:04.999" style="s2">and bolts or for a job but like Jack</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.809" end="00:27:07.729" style="s2">sort of get a handle on like oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.999" end="00:27:10.249" style="s2">what everybody&#39;s upset about Yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.729" end="00:27:13.669" style="s2">like this is why the Conservatives are</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.249" end="00:27:16.099" style="s2">livid because one it&#39;s just so crazy</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.669" end="00:27:17.960" style="s2">consequential to have Twitter taken away</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.099" end="00:27:20.119" style="s2">from you as anybody who wants is</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.960" end="00:27:21.470" style="s2">anybody&#39;s job requires some ability to</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.119" end="00:27:23.450" style="s2">influence the public square right</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.470" end="00:27:25.729" style="s2">anything having to do with media Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.450" end="00:27:27.649" style="s2">is the only place to be right yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.729" end="00:27:29.539" style="s2">mean it becomes incredibly difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.649" end="00:27:32.119" style="s2">do any job in politics any job the media</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.539" end="00:27:34.429" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have Twitter now so super</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.119" end="00:27:36.710" style="s2">consequential to take that away and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.429" end="00:27:38.419" style="s2">fact that conservatives see it like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.710" end="00:27:40.099" style="s2">you know where the decisions come down</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.419" end="00:27:41.570" style="s2">whenever there&#39;s you know where there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:27:50.989" end="00:27:55.970" style="s2">entire podcast but I did read some</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.970" end="00:27:57.109" style="s2">attempts follow-up comments um it seemed</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.970" end="00:27:59.450" style="s2">to me that he was making an argument</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.109" end="00:28:01.309" style="s2">about fairness mm-hmm and he was also</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.450" end="00:28:03.139" style="s2">making an argument about Twitter&#39;s terms</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.309" end="00:28:05.960" style="s2">of service operating sort of in a</p>

<p begin="00:28:09.080" end="00:28:12.259" style="s2">then he brought in the idea of like</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.549" end="00:28:13.999" style="s2">foreign influence and therefore were</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.259" end="00:28:15.979" style="s2">like allowing foreigners to have a</p>

<p begin="00:28:19.489" end="00:28:23.389" style="s2">of those actually were very persuasive</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.629" end="00:28:26.090" style="s2">to me yeah I didn&#39;t hear him making the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.389" end="00:28:28.940" style="s2">public square argument right there like</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.090" end="00:28:31.759" style="s2">this is now a utility we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.940" end="00:28:33.679" style="s2">talking about regulation and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.759" end="00:28:37.849" style="s2">be talking about government involvement</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.679" end="00:28:42.320" style="s2">in managing what is now basically the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.849" end="00:28:44.869" style="s2">new form of television right Guga who</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.320" end="00:28:48.139" style="s2">regulates the airwaves and sells you</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.869" end="00:28:50.269" style="s2">know sells us cell phone bandwidth and</p>

<p begin="00:28:50.269" end="00:28:55.429" style="s2">government who regulates how much it</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.479" end="00:28:58.249" style="s2">costs and who&#39;s able to get electricity</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.429" end="00:29:01.690" style="s2">the government also same with you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.249" end="00:29:03.220" style="s2">plumbing and sewer etc so</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.690" end="00:29:06.460" style="s2">where is that argument in Tim&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.220" end="00:29:07.840" style="s2">presentation and where is that argument</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.460" end="00:29:09.880" style="s2">moving forward because that seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.840" end="00:29:13.240" style="s2">to be the one that makes the most sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.880" end="00:29:16.060" style="s2">yeah I mean I thought I thought Tim&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.240" end="00:29:17.890" style="s2">framing was interesting in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.060" end="00:29:20.440" style="s2">trying to but it could have been framed</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.890" end="00:29:24.400" style="s2">much more simply your your platform is</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.440" end="00:29:26.050" style="s2">too powerful to exclude people from your</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.400" end="00:29:28.270" style="s2">platform is too important to exclude</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.050" end="00:29:30.130" style="s2">people from mm-hmm right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.270" end="00:29:31.870" style="s2">simplest way of framing it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.130" end="00:29:33.220" style="s2">like rather than talking about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.870" end="00:29:35.050" style="s2">important because people try and</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.220" end="00:29:36.610" style="s2">influence it it&#39;s just no it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.050" end="00:29:39.220" style="s2">it&#39;s the center of all this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.610" end="00:29:40.960" style="s2">and to have a culture of free speech in</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.220" end="00:29:42.850" style="s2">America not just what the First</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.960" end="00:29:44.050" style="s2">Amendment permits because like again if</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.850" end="00:29:45.250" style="s2">you think of free speech in the First</p>

<p begin="00:29:51.040" end="00:29:54.430" style="s2">free speech is more than the First</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.930" end="00:29:55.750" style="s2">Amendment it&#39;s a cultural value that</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.430" end="00:29:57.850" style="s2">says we should all have the right to say</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.750" end="00:30:01.930" style="s2">what we think and participate in public</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.850" end="00:30:03.250" style="s2">discourse and you know if that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.930" end="00:30:04.180" style="s2">say again you should have the same right</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.250" end="00:30:05.800" style="s2">to speak on Twitter that you do in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.180" end="00:30:06.940" style="s2">public park I firmly believe that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.800" end="00:30:09.580" style="s2">don&#39;t believe current law requires that</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.940" end="00:30:12.400" style="s2">but I believe that that&#39;s what ought be</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.580" end="00:30:16.870" style="s2">we ought change current law to manifest</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.400" end="00:30:18.640" style="s2">that as a reality and that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.870" end="00:30:19.720" style="s2">free speech is of value as a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.640" end="00:30:21.940" style="s2">norm is much bigger than that and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.720" end="00:30:24.130" style="s2">requires a cultural commitment to it in</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.940" end="00:30:25.420" style="s2">the same way that you know private</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.130" end="00:30:27.340" style="s2">companies could discriminate and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.420" end="00:30:29.140" style="s2">wasn&#39;t unconstitutional for private</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.340" end="00:30:31.150" style="s2">entities like restaurants and hotels to</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.140" end="00:30:34.270" style="s2">discriminate against people of color we</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.150" end="00:30:35.710" style="s2">passed laws because the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.270" end="00:30:37.510" style="s2">the government not discriminating is</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.710" end="00:30:39.370" style="s2">that&#39;s only one part of a cultural value</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.510" end="00:30:40.930" style="s2">of non-discrimination right we actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.370" end="00:30:41.650" style="s2">need to have laws that say you private</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.930" end="00:30:42.910" style="s2">companies are not allowed to</p>

<p begin="00:30:42.910" end="00:30:49.270" style="s2">sandy&#39;ll it is the same deal and I worry</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:51.430" style="s2">that the free speech is like one of our</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.270" end="00:30:53.830" style="s2">common stories that we tell each other</p>

<p begin="00:31:45.950" end="00:31:50.870" style="s2">is that unites us and so it&#39;s a valuable</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.130" end="00:31:53.630" style="s2">thing for us to protect if we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.870" end="00:31:54.980" style="s2">to have a civic nationalism if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.630" end="00:31:57.890" style="s2">going to have a nationalism that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.980" end="00:31:59.809" style="s2">based on blood heritage and geography in</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.890" end="00:32:02.750" style="s2">a lifelong history of occupying the same</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.809" end="00:32:04.280" style="s2">lands free speech is the one that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.750" end="00:32:05.000" style="s2">have to defend right right if we</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.280" end="00:32:06.740" style="s2">actually that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.000" end="00:32:08.270" style="s2">that&#39;s and that&#39;s a really good point</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.740" end="00:32:10.010" style="s2">about why it&#39;s so important to defend as</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.270" end="00:32:10.940" style="s2">a cultural vacuum because I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.010" end="00:32:13.880" style="s2">right I haven&#39;t thought about it this</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.940" end="00:32:16.670" style="s2">way but it&#39;s actually key to American</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.880" end="00:32:18.110" style="s2">nationalism yes right and non-ethnic</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.670" end="00:32:19.970" style="s2">American nationalism is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.110" end="00:32:22.309" style="s2">rooted in common values common</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.970" end="00:32:23.720" style="s2">traditions what is a more common value</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.309" end="00:32:25.130" style="s2">or tradition in America than free speech</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.720" end="00:32:28.160" style="s2">there is not I don&#39;t think there is well</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.130" end="00:32:30.860" style="s2">so yeah I mean if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.160" end="00:32:32.540" style="s2">rejecting free speech or just and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.860" end="00:32:34.130" style="s2">cultural norm of it and you&#39;re rejecting</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.540" end="00:32:36.800" style="s2">some I don&#39;t know how you even get to</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.130" end="00:32:39.410" style="s2">what unifies us as a nation</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.800" end="00:32:40.760" style="s2">you really don&#39;t so I can i I understand</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.410" end="00:32:42.350" style="s2">now you know ten years ago I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.760" end="00:32:43.790" style="s2">hear the phrase free speech warrior and</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.350" end="00:32:46.820" style="s2">I didn&#39;t quite understand the power of</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.790" end="00:32:48.260" style="s2">it but you know all these experiences</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.820" end="00:32:51.290" style="s2">that we&#39;ve had over the last few years</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.260" end="00:32:53.900" style="s2">all the learnings all the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.290" end="00:32:56.059" style="s2">evolutions technological evolutions all</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.900" end="00:32:57.740" style="s2">of it has led me to believe that free</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.059" end="00:32:58.880" style="s2">speech defending free speech is the key</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.740" end="00:33:01.400" style="s2">to keeping our civic nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.880" end="00:33:03.320" style="s2">together and from preventing us from</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.400" end="00:33:05.750" style="s2">spiraling out of control into warring</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.320" end="00:33:08.360" style="s2">factions however the irony of that is is</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.750" end="00:33:10.280" style="s2">that this free speech also then sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.360" end="00:33:12.910" style="s2">facilitates especially online through</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.280" end="00:33:15.410" style="s2">social media facilitates our tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.910" end="00:33:16.850" style="s2">right and it also facilitates these</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.410" end="00:33:18.980" style="s2">collective intelligence networks that</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.850" end="00:33:20.300" style="s2">have arisen and this network warfare</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.980" end="00:33:21.710" style="s2">that&#39;s going on between the resistance</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.300" end="00:33:24.290" style="s2">and insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.710" end="00:33:26.000" style="s2">so it&#39;s like it&#39;s like the key to at all</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.290" end="00:33:27.770" style="s2">but it&#39;s also part of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.000" end="00:33:30.710" style="s2">it&#39;s alcohol the cause of and solution</p>

<p begin="00:34:15.140" end="00:34:19.210" style="s2">London former aide-de-camp to Nigel</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.000" end="00:34:21.350" style="s2">Faraj and Steve Bannon oh there we go</p>

<p begin="00:34:25.340" end="00:34:30.620" style="s2">rights to Human Events the what is human</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.490" end="00:34:33.410" style="s2">events Human Events is was the name of</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.620" end="00:34:35.060" style="s2">the oldest conservative magazine to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.410" end="00:34:36.380" style="s2">published it was published in the modern</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.060" end="00:34:39.560" style="s2">era is plot start being published in</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.380" end="00:34:40.670" style="s2">1944 so older the National Review older</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.560" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">obviously older than the Weekly Standard</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.670" end="00:34:46.700" style="s2">but older older than all those it went</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:48.500" style="s2">it had been a you know actual paper</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.700" end="00:34:51.050" style="s2">publication and so I think 2013 when I</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.500" end="00:34:53.210" style="s2">went digital only and by 2015 it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.050" end="00:34:56.170" style="s2">basically defunct so it&#39;s just been sort</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.210" end="00:34:59.240" style="s2">of sitting dead for four years or so</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.170" end="00:35:00.440" style="s2">Rahim and I were had been looking for</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.240" end="00:35:01.550" style="s2">things we could do together in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.440" end="00:35:03.320" style="s2">a project we&#39;ve been talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.550" end="00:35:05.360" style="s2">non-profit to think-tank various other</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.320" end="00:35:06.830" style="s2">things when he remembered that human</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.360" end="00:35:08.390" style="s2">events was up somebody had told him</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.830" end="00:35:10.340" style="s2">human events might be for sale and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.390" end="00:35:11.690" style="s2">quickly coalesced around that idea both</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.340" end="00:35:13.940" style="s2">because we saw a sort of a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.690" end="00:35:16.220" style="s2">institutions on the right that you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.940" end="00:35:19.390" style="s2">prestige institutions that fit in are</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.220" end="00:35:22.550" style="s2">the nationalist pocket if you will and</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.390" end="00:35:24.080" style="s2">also the fact that Rahim himself had</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.550" end="00:35:25.580" style="s2">been editor-in-chief of Breitbart London</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.080" end="00:35:27.620" style="s2">so in terms of finding something we</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.580" end="00:35:29.630" style="s2">could clearly do that was clearly within</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.620" end="00:35:31.160" style="s2">our kin to start with right let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.630" end="00:35:33.350" style="s2">with something Rahim knows and right</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.160" end="00:35:34.970" style="s2">that I am part of so and also I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.350" end="00:35:36.230" style="s2">markets clearly speaking about this</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.970" end="00:35:37.400" style="s2">because you got some other people out</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.230" end="00:35:37.890" style="s2">there trying to do something else right</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.400" end="00:35:39.930" style="s2">now too</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.890" end="00:35:40.700" style="s2">right Jonah Goldberg and Steven Hayes</p>

<p begin="00:35:44.790" end="00:35:49.770" style="s2">into and what I&#39;m sure is a vastly</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.920" end="00:35:51.600" style="s2">underserved market of people opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.770" end="00:35:54.180" style="s2">Trump on the right I think this sarcasm</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.600" end="00:35:55.440" style="s2">yeah a little bit a little bit 93% of</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.180" end="00:35:56.910" style="s2">the party is proud Trump and they want</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.440" end="00:36:00.390" style="s2">to be Trump skeptical good good luck</p>

<p begin="00:40:20.380" end="00:40:25.390" style="s2">year or two years you know we all we all</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.590" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">sort of came into this thing with this</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.390" end="00:40:29.350" style="s2">this whole Trump phenomenon starting up</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:32.500" style="s2">in the fitt in 2015 in it the election</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.350" end="00:40:35.770" style="s2">in 2016 and we&#39;re all sort of they were</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.500" end="00:40:37.630" style="s2">attracted to necessarily Trump himself</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.770" end="00:40:41.140" style="s2">because clearly there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.630" end="00:40:45.370" style="s2">downsides but really to sort of what his</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.140" end="00:40:47.260" style="s2">popularity represented and we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.370" end="00:40:49.390" style="s2">been sort of evolving and trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.260" end="00:40:51.040" style="s2">our way in this space and you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.390" end="00:40:52.510" style="s2">working very hard to build your own</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.040" end="00:40:54.100" style="s2">audience and you&#39;ve been doing that</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.510" end="00:40:55.690" style="s2">through your periscopes and yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.100" end="00:40:57.580" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s talk a little bit about that</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.690" end="00:41:01.120" style="s2">because dude you have been just killing</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.580" end="00:41:02.680" style="s2">it almost periscopes yeah so I mean for</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.120" end="00:41:04.930" style="s2">those if you don&#39;t know periscope again</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.680" end="00:41:07.660" style="s2">live streaming platform on Twitter and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.930" end="00:41:09.340" style="s2">do a pretty simple periscope very</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.660" end="00:41:12.130" style="s2">regularly I&#39;d say I try to do at least</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.340" end="00:41:14.770" style="s2">like four or five a week where it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.130" end="00:41:17.710" style="s2">usually between 15 and 25 minutes and</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.770" end="00:41:21.370" style="s2">it&#39;s me commenting on an issue and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.710" end="00:41:23.290" style="s2">taking questions and so my setup is</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.370" end="00:41:24.640" style="s2">unbelievably simple like people are like</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.290" end="00:41:26.290" style="s2">thinking I mean I see a lot of people do</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.640" end="00:41:27.700" style="s2">periscopes and they have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.290" end="00:41:28.960" style="s2">complicated layers of production I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.700" end="00:41:30.940" style="s2">tried some of them and I quickly went</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.960" end="00:41:33.040" style="s2">back have you tried to dig into like OBS</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.940" end="00:41:35.740" style="s2">and everything oh yeah no I used OBS for</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.040" end="00:41:37.420" style="s2">maybe a week yeah and I went back to</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.740" end="00:41:39.820" style="s2">what I still have found to be the</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.420" end="00:41:41.650" style="s2">simplest and best way to do periscopes</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.820" end="00:41:43.990" style="s2">of the style that I do what&#39;s that an</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.650" end="00:41:46.450" style="s2">iPad on a tripod just an iPad just not</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.990" end="00:41:48.550" style="s2">bad and like a white yeah and and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.450" end="00:41:51.640" style="s2">reason I say that is because I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.550" end="00:41:53.590" style="s2">periscope is a unique medium as a form</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.640" end="00:41:55.330" style="s2">of live-streaming I mean there are ways</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.590" end="00:41:56.980" style="s2">I don&#39;t even produce it on multiple</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.330" end="00:41:59.170" style="s2">platforms I keep it on periscope I might</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.980" end="00:42:00.550" style="s2">start doing multiple platforms but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.170" end="00:42:03.100" style="s2">there&#39;s technical complexity they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.550" end="00:42:05.380" style="s2">have to deal with the core value and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.100" end="00:42:07.000" style="s2">core offering I think of periscope is</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.380" end="00:42:09.070" style="s2">the ability for an audience to</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.000" end="00:42:11.350" style="s2">participate in a performance that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.070" end="00:42:12.640" style="s2">totally unique yes like if you do a</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.350" end="00:42:14.740" style="s2">podcast like right now you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.640" end="00:42:16.090" style="s2">listening you&#39;re not I love you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.740" end="00:42:17.080" style="s2">not participating in the performance</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.090" end="00:42:17.680" style="s2">that Jack and I are currently doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.080" end="00:42:19.450" style="s2">crack</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.680" end="00:42:21.000" style="s2">right when you listen to watch a</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.450" end="00:42:23.650" style="s2">television show you&#39;re not participating</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.000" end="00:42:24.790" style="s2">and when you watch a YouTube video</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.650" end="00:42:26.770" style="s2">you&#39;re not participating you are</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.790" end="00:42:28.960" style="s2">passively consuming when you watch a</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.770" end="00:42:30.430" style="s2">periscope and if the performer of a</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.960" end="00:42:32.650" style="s2">periscope is interacting with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.430" end="00:42:34.450" style="s2">comments live then you are participating</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.650" end="00:42:36.940" style="s2">in a live performance that&#39;s really cool</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.450" end="00:42:38.440" style="s2">and really unique definitely and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.940" end="00:42:40.119" style="s2">has that has that experience that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.440" end="00:42:41.500" style="s2">interaction it&#39;s forced me to think</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.119" end="00:42:42.640" style="s2">deeply about issues week knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.500" end="00:42:44.650" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna have to defend them against</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.640" end="00:42:46.180" style="s2">comments and if I fail to respond to a</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.650" end="00:42:47.740" style="s2">solid query in the comments it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.180" end="00:42:50.680" style="s2">embarrassing yeah it&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.740" end="00:42:52.690" style="s2">being in court and you have 400 judges</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.680" end="00:42:55.030" style="s2">asking you questions as an advocate do</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.690" end="00:42:57.099" style="s2">it do your do the other followers say</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.030" end="00:42:58.540" style="s2">hey hey you&#39;re gonna answer this one</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.099" end="00:43:00.280" style="s2">occasionally but I&#39;m pretty good about</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.540" end="00:43:02.530" style="s2">being responsive you know I was I was a</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.280" end="00:43:04.000" style="s2">teasing I was a decent attorney and a</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.530" end="00:43:05.740" style="s2">decent law certainly very good mood</p>

<p begin="00:43:34.839" end="00:43:39.520" style="s2">because he also thinks very quickly on</p>

<p begin="00:46:46.510" end="00:46:49.930" style="s2">yeah I think by a virtue of you</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.220" end="00:46:52.330" style="s2">listening to this podcast guys that</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.930" end="00:46:54.910" style="s2">you&#39;re not interested in Tosa those hit</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.330" end="00:46:56.650" style="s2">the soundbite as sword-fighting and</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.910" end="00:46:58.330" style="s2">neither are you are i interested in</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.650" end="00:47:00.520" style="s2">delivering that kind of content because</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.330" end="00:47:02.740" style="s2">we like to explore the issues we&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.520" end="00:47:04.330" style="s2">to go deep on things and in fact talking</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.740" end="00:47:06.340" style="s2">about we were talking about current</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.330" end="00:47:08.230" style="s2">events and we drilled down deep enough</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.340" end="00:47:10.030" style="s2">on each at least two of them where we</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.230" end="00:47:12.370" style="s2">got down to the like most fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.030" end="00:47:14.350" style="s2">question you know on each subject right</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.370" end="00:47:16.810" style="s2">and you don&#39;t get that in sort in</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.350" end="00:47:19.440" style="s2">soundbite sword-fighting true you get</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.810" end="00:47:22.600" style="s2">that through you know having in-depth in</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.440" end="00:47:24.820" style="s2">meaningful meaningful conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.600" end="00:47:26.860" style="s2">so that is something that I look forward</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.820" end="00:47:28.990" style="s2">to seeing continue with you with your</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.860" end="00:47:30.580" style="s2">periscopes and with the new venture with</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.990" end="00:47:33.850" style="s2">the new publication any thought to</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.580" end="00:47:35.740" style="s2">taking the publication back to print I</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.850" end="00:47:37.540" style="s2">mean eventually hopefully but that would</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.740" end="00:47:39.130" style="s2">be sort of a vanity project at the end</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.540" end="00:47:41.590" style="s2">of the day I mean I I haven&#39;t read a</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.130" end="00:47:42.700" style="s2">paper periodical in years so I don&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.590" end="00:47:44.200" style="s2">I don&#39;t know that most of you have</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.700" end="00:47:46.090" style="s2">either I&#39;ve read on my phone and I read</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.200" end="00:47:48.220" style="s2">on the computer yeah so I don&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.090" end="00:47:51.850" style="s2">my audience to do do the opposite either</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.220" end="00:47:53.980" style="s2">yeah and I and you know so we&#39;re much</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.850" end="00:47:55.990" style="s2">more likely to add newer forms of media</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.980" end="00:47:58.690" style="s2">like to human events live streams and</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.990" end="00:48:01.540" style="s2">yes podcasts and events videos and we</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.690" end="00:48:03.760" style="s2">are to go paper I think that creating</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.540" end="00:48:06.630" style="s2">more ways for people to engage with us</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.760" end="00:48:09.070" style="s2">personally and with our content is ideal</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.630" end="00:48:10.780" style="s2">and that actually gets back to a point I</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.070" end="00:48:12.280" style="s2">we we got a little bit off track on like</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.780" end="00:48:14.050" style="s2">why I think it&#39;s so important why do</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.280" end="00:48:16.540" style="s2">have so little production value Wow</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.050" end="00:48:18.040" style="s2">right yeah oh yeah tell us right because</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.540" end="00:48:19.720" style="s2">this is this is like a key point people</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.040" end="00:48:21.250" style="s2">I think oh I need a really nice video in</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.720" end="00:48:22.840" style="s2">a really nice mic and whatever if you</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.250" end="00:48:24.930" style="s2">use that stuff you&#39;re using periscope</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.840" end="00:48:26.920" style="s2">producer or some other fancy program</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.930" end="00:48:29.500" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a time delay between</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.920" end="00:48:31.450" style="s2">you saying something and the comments</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.500" end="00:48:33.340" style="s2">showing up oh my god dude I was playing</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.450" end="00:48:35.170" style="s2">around with OBS yesterday in periscope I</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.340" end="00:48:36.700" style="s2">mean it&#39;s not just a couple of seconds</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.170" end="00:48:38.170" style="s2">now it&#39;s like five seconds yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.700" end="00:48:39.850" style="s2">makes it impossible to really carry on a</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.170" end="00:48:41.380" style="s2">meaningful conversation yeah with your</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.850" end="00:48:42.910" style="s2">audience yeah which is the entire point</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.380" end="00:48:46.060" style="s2">of the medium as far as I can tell right</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.910" end="00:48:47.650" style="s2">right and so then what you&#39;re doing if</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.060" end="00:48:50.410" style="s2">you do periscope that way you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.650" end="00:48:52.710" style="s2">doing a live podcast and it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.410" end="00:48:54.910" style="s2">much better than a not live podcast</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.710" end="00:48:56.500" style="s2">right like I mean there&#39;s some benefit</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.910" end="00:48:58.090" style="s2">to being doing it right after a news</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.500" end="00:48:58.820" style="s2">event hits you know so you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.090" end="00:49:02.060" style="s2">immediately get on</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.820" end="00:49:03.380" style="s2">err but the unique value of periscope</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.060" end="00:49:05.480" style="s2">being able to have a participatory</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.380" end="00:49:08.120" style="s2">performance goes away when you use all</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.480" end="00:49:09.890" style="s2">these layers of production so I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.120" end="00:49:11.570" style="s2">that many people starting periscopes are</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.890" end="00:49:13.400" style="s2">thinking oh do I need all this setup no</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.570" end="00:49:16.310" style="s2">you don&#39;t and in fact it it almost hurts</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.400" end="00:49:18.260" style="s2">it you need to get good at responding</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.310" end="00:49:20.060" style="s2">and interacting with an audience and not</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.260" end="00:49:21.740" style="s2">getting distracted I think the best</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.060" end="00:49:24.290" style="s2">periscope I ever did was I did right</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.740" end="00:49:26.000" style="s2">here on my iPhone 6s plus which I</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.290" end="00:49:28.730" style="s2">haven&#39;t upgraded because I&#39;m a Luddite</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.000" end="00:49:30.890" style="s2">right I mean I started doing most on</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.730" end="00:49:32.240" style="s2">periscopes on an iPhone I did you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.890" end="00:49:33.560" style="s2">first I did Facebook live streams with</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.240" end="00:49:34.970" style="s2">just a small group of friends to get</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.560" end="00:49:36.890" style="s2">used to the format and used to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.970" end="00:49:38.060" style="s2">dynamic of having a comment having to</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.890" end="00:49:41.620" style="s2">respond to it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.060" end="00:49:43.310" style="s2">most low-tech thing imaginable then</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.620" end="00:49:44.930" style="s2">literally no I mean it&#39;s just like I</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.310" end="00:49:47.270" style="s2">would put my phone in in the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.930" end="00:49:49.820" style="s2">crevice of the laptop right and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.270" end="00:49:51.860" style="s2">just just I was just laughing at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.820" end="00:49:53.450" style="s2">low-tech thing possible being also a</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.860" end="00:49:56.900" style="s2">thing that involves mobile technology</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.450" end="00:49:59.840" style="s2">right that&#39;s true low tech is wrong low</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.900" end="00:50:01.580" style="s2">production yes or low effort you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.840" end="00:50:03.230" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing you everybody owns right</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.580" end="00:50:05.210" style="s2">all you have to do is just oh you just</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.230" end="00:50:08.990" style="s2">hit start broadcast yeah and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.210" end="00:50:10.550" style="s2">going and then and then I started doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.990" end="00:50:13.730" style="s2">periscopes getting amplified by a few</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.550" end="00:50:15.230" style="s2">people and now I mean I really do</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.730" end="00:50:16.760" style="s2">believe that you know I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.230" end="00:50:18.530" style="s2">change from using an iPad in a tripod</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.760" end="00:50:20.090" style="s2">just so I can stand while I&#39;m doing it</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.530" end="00:50:21.560" style="s2">and have the beauty of an iPad is</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.090" end="00:50:22.790" style="s2">obviously the comments appear larger so</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.560" end="00:50:26.120" style="s2">it&#39;s easier to read them and interact</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.790" end="00:50:29.180" style="s2">with them but that&#39;s been the secret</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.120" end="00:50:30.770" style="s2">sauce for me and I think like so you</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.180" end="00:50:31.820" style="s2">know if you&#39;re if you&#39;re listening to</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.770" end="00:50:33.290" style="s2">this and you&#39;re like I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.820" end="00:50:35.240" style="s2">starting a periscope don&#39;t worry about</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.290" end="00:50:37.100" style="s2">production just don&#39;t do it you need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.240" end="00:50:38.150" style="s2">worry about content quality and your own</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.100" end="00:50:40.130" style="s2">ability to interact with your audience</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.150" end="00:50:41.810" style="s2">yeah I would I would say for the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.130" end="00:50:44.090" style="s2">is a little bit different like I made</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.810" end="00:50:45.710" style="s2">sure to go out like you guys can hear</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.090" end="00:50:47.240" style="s2">the quality of our voices on these</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.710" end="00:50:49.100" style="s2">microphones and the recording equipment</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.240" end="00:50:51.350" style="s2">that we have it makes a huge difference</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.100" end="00:50:53.090" style="s2">oh yeah on the podcast cuz you know a</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.350" end="00:50:54.320" style="s2">lot of you have this in your ears and</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.090" end="00:50:57.020" style="s2">it&#39;s like something that&#39;s very personal</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.320" end="00:50:58.760" style="s2">I&#39;ve been debating whether or not taking</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.020" end="00:51:02.180" style="s2">taking the podcast into a live format</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.760" end="00:51:03.950" style="s2">also with video everything I&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.180" end="00:51:05.980" style="s2">about expanding your podcast audience as</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.950" end="00:51:08.450" style="s2">the video to it things really take off</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.980" end="00:51:09.270" style="s2">I&#39;ve been having good success I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.450" end="00:51:12.210" style="s2">have had</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.270" end="00:51:14.040" style="s2">extremely good growth feedback online</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.210" end="00:51:15.330" style="s2">has been tremendous the reviews that</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.040" end="00:51:17.160" style="s2">have come in you guys can check it out</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.330" end="00:51:19.230" style="s2">at Jack Murphy live.com forward slash</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.160" end="00:51:20.820" style="s2">podcast I&#39;ve been capturing some of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.230" end="00:51:22.590" style="s2">best reviews I mean the reviews have</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.820" end="00:51:24.720" style="s2">been tremendous so yeah I&#39;m just looking</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.590" end="00:51:27.720" style="s2">to add new layers as we go on as we move</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.720" end="00:51:30.270" style="s2">forward but you know the periscope thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.720" end="00:51:34.050" style="s2">is definitely a little low-tech relative</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.270" end="00:51:35.670" style="s2">but super powerful and it&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.050" end="00:51:37.560" style="s2">immediate connection to your audience so</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.670" end="00:51:39.150" style="s2">let&#39;s write but I&#39;m last on that tip</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.560" end="00:51:40.410" style="s2">unless you have something else I want to</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.150" end="00:51:44.040" style="s2">just talk about authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.410" end="00:51:45.840" style="s2">right it has authenticity look okay I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.040" end="00:51:47.250" style="s2">been writing about this in a few of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.840" end="00:51:48.750" style="s2">last podcast we did we talked about sort</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.250" end="00:51:50.280" style="s2">of the death of expertise and part of</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.750" end="00:51:51.810" style="s2">the reason the expertise doesn&#39;t have as</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.280" end="00:51:55.680" style="s2">much value anymore is because the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.810" end="00:51:58.590" style="s2">is too complex for any one person to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.680" end="00:52:00.869" style="s2">an expert and able to say if we do X</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.590" end="00:52:02.070" style="s2">then Y is going to happen basically at</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.869" end="00:52:05.220" style="s2">this point the only thing we can do is</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.070" end="00:52:06.660" style="s2">be like hey let&#39;s try XYZ ABC and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.220" end="00:52:07.920" style="s2">see what happens and then maybe we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.660" end="00:52:09.570" style="s2">pick one of those and we&#39;ll run with</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.920" end="00:52:11.100" style="s2">this so that&#39;s why expertise is like</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.570" end="00:52:13.170" style="s2">there&#39;s other reasons but I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.100" end="00:52:14.940" style="s2">why expertise has become less of an</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.170" end="00:52:17.340" style="s2">important idea because the world is just</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.940" end="00:52:19.380" style="s2">too complex for us to predict the future</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.340" end="00:52:21.810" style="s2">and to predict the actions or the</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.380" end="00:52:23.630" style="s2">consequences of our actions and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.810" end="00:52:26.430" style="s2">also had a proliferation of people</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.630" end="00:52:29.430" style="s2">thinking and talking and sharing ideas</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.430" end="00:52:32.090" style="s2">and so what&#39;s more important these days</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.430" end="00:52:34.890" style="s2">seems to be a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.090" end="00:52:37.080" style="s2">discoverability and authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.890" end="00:52:39.270" style="s2">once you become discovered I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.080" end="00:52:41.250" style="s2">like that&#39;s like ten-millionth the</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.270" end="00:52:43.530" style="s2">problem definitely times the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.250" end="00:52:45.060" style="s2">like becoming discovered and I can do a</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.530" end="00:52:46.470" style="s2">whole podcast and a whole series of</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.060" end="00:52:48.119" style="s2">essays on disk how do you become</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.470" end="00:52:50.160" style="s2">discovered there&#39;s strategies and</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.119" end="00:52:51.150" style="s2">there&#39;s like roadmaps but it&#39;s not easy</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.160" end="00:52:51.570" style="s2">and there&#39;s definitely some luck</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.150" end="00:52:54.930" style="s2">involved</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.570" end="00:52:56.640" style="s2">but then the authenticity part in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.930" end="00:52:58.740" style="s2">world awash with Talking Heads</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.640" end="00:53:01.080" style="s2">commentators and million billion Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.740" end="00:53:02.640" style="s2">feeds and YouTube you know got youtubers</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.080" end="00:53:06.830" style="s2">I never I&#39;m not comfortable saying</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.640" end="00:53:09.300" style="s2">youtuber yeah authenticity is what sells</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.830" end="00:53:10.980" style="s2">authenticity and I don&#39;t even mean self</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.300" end="00:53:13.200" style="s2">I mean authenticity is what drags people</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.980" end="00:53:16.590" style="s2">in keeps them there and keeps them</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.200" end="00:53:17.940" style="s2">connected to your content so will how</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.590" end="00:53:20.670" style="s2">are you going to maintain your</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.940" end="00:53:23.500" style="s2">authenticity as you become the publisher</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.670" end="00:53:26.650" style="s2">of like a nationally known</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.500" end="00:53:29.140" style="s2">or publication involved with people that</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.650" end="00:53:31.540" style="s2">are nationally internationally known</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.140" end="00:53:33.820" style="s2">authors and journalists you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.540" end="00:53:35.980" style="s2">gonna end up on boards and panels and at</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.820" end="00:53:38.730" style="s2">conferences and on the TV and all that</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.980" end="00:53:41.290" style="s2">stuff how are you going to remain</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.730" end="00:53:43.390" style="s2">authentic authentic and protect you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.290" end="00:53:45.670" style="s2">continue with your authentic authentic</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.390" end="00:53:47.710" style="s2">connection with your audience and your</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.670" end="00:53:48.940" style="s2">persona I mean I think it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.710" end="00:53:52.780" style="s2">through periscope that&#39;s the beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.940" end="00:53:55.720" style="s2">doing them I think one of the things so</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.780" end="00:53:56.800" style="s2">I&#39;m a lawyer too and in law school I</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.720" end="00:53:57.940" style="s2">learned that the best way to learn</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.800" end="00:53:59.560" style="s2">something was to actually subject</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.940" end="00:54:03.099" style="s2">yourself to Socratic questioning by the</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.560" end="00:54:05.230" style="s2">professor so you because if you subject</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.099" end="00:54:07.180" style="s2">yourself to questioning by person you</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.230" end="00:54:08.410" style="s2">know intelligent person then you if</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.180" end="00:54:09.670" style="s2">there are any flaws and the way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.410" end="00:54:11.260" style="s2">approaching things they will get</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.670" end="00:54:12.849" style="s2">revealed if you haven&#39;t thought through</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.260" end="00:54:15.099" style="s2">something that will get revealed yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.849" end="00:54:17.200" style="s2">and so and in some sense periscope is</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.099" end="00:54:18.880" style="s2">just that times 100 right instead of</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.200" end="00:54:20.590" style="s2">taking questioning from a single</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.880" end="00:54:22.510" style="s2">professor I&#39;m taking questions from 300</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.590" end="00:54:23.650" style="s2">people at a time now it gives me escape</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.510" end="00:54:25.690" style="s2">routes because it&#39;s easy to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.650" end="00:54:27.340" style="s2">questions if I want to and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.690" end="00:54:29.589" style="s2">taking it&#39;s hard to like chart out a</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.340" end="00:54:31.000" style="s2">list of questions or a path of questions</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.589" end="00:54:32.710" style="s2">that can force people into revealing</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.000" end="00:54:33.849" style="s2">their contradictions right but at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.710" end="00:54:35.680" style="s2">same time subjecting yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.849" end="00:54:38.050" style="s2">questioning is a way to easily make sure</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.680" end="00:54:40.540" style="s2">that you&#39;re and by anybody is a way to</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.050" end="00:54:41.920" style="s2">kind of keep you grounded yes you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.540" end="00:54:43.119" style="s2">get cut down to size pretty quickly on a</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:43.750" style="s2">periscope if you just don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.119" end="00:54:46.270" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.750" end="00:54:49.540" style="s2">you know so we and you would say that</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.270" end="00:54:51.760" style="s2">the quality of your periscope viewer is</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.540" end="00:54:53.050" style="s2">such that they offer challenging</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.760" end="00:54:55.210" style="s2">questions oh yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.050" end="00:54:57.700" style="s2">you know they post challenges and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.210" end="00:54:59.290" style="s2">you know initiate some conflict and</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.700" end="00:55:00.400" style="s2">sometimes I&#39;m not in the mood for it and</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.290" end="00:55:02.050" style="s2">I just if especially if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.400" end="00:55:03.310" style="s2">obnoxious I mean I have a general rule</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.050" end="00:55:04.960" style="s2">about Twitter and periscope and</p>

<p begin="00:55:26.830" end="00:55:30.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s made my life better</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.630" end="00:55:32.980" style="s2">mm-hm it&#39;s made the lives of my</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.280" end="00:55:35.170" style="s2">followers better there&#39;s less irassman</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.980" end="00:55:36.430" style="s2">in the mentions that my timeline is</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.170" end="00:55:38.289" style="s2">cleaner</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.430" end="00:55:40.329" style="s2">and I think my content is stronger for</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.289" end="00:55:41.859" style="s2">it you know I certainly maybe two years</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.329" end="00:55:44.289" style="s2">ago would have said like Oh walking</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.859" end="00:55:47.019" style="s2">that&#39;s for babies and also back then I</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.289" end="00:55:49.299" style="s2">think we all many of us believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.019" end="00:55:50.589" style="s2">conflict is a tension model was the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.299" end="00:55:52.150" style="s2">right model mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.589" end="00:55:54.849" style="s2">but I think that that has moved into the</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.150" end="00:55:57.220" style="s2">background somewhat especially with</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.849" end="00:56:00.579" style="s2">people at or sort of social capital</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.220" end="00:56:02.109" style="s2">level and down for sure but the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.579" end="00:56:03.579" style="s2">battle is with the ideas and with the</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.109" end="00:56:05.890" style="s2">events and with the big the big people</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.579" end="00:56:07.749" style="s2">at the top right and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.890" end="00:56:09.039" style="s2">conflict still still works yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.749" end="00:56:10.839" style="s2">kind of like still works and I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.039" end="00:56:11.950" style="s2">the conflict is substantive right if</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.839" end="00:56:13.569" style="s2">you&#39;re opposing associative challenge</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.950" end="00:56:14.589" style="s2">annoyance or it but if you&#39;re just being</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.569" end="00:56:16.539" style="s2">an asshole then you&#39;re getting blocked</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.589" end="00:56:19.329" style="s2">right and I don&#39;t I mean I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.539" end="00:56:20.470" style="s2">hesitate and I think it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.329" end="00:56:22.119" style="s2">important to your followers it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.470" end="00:56:23.499" style="s2">generous right if somebody is an asshole</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.119" end="00:56:24.759" style="s2">enough to annoy you there certainly</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.499" end="00:56:26.079" style="s2">annoying the people who want to read you</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.759" end="00:56:27.819" style="s2">right definitely you gotta stand up for</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.079" end="00:56:31.180" style="s2">your people yeah yeah it&#39;s like an act</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.819" end="00:56:32.289" style="s2">of leadership I think yes yeah and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.180" end="00:56:34.329" style="s2">people don&#39;t block enough they should</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.289" end="00:56:37.180" style="s2">block more lock more block more that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.329" end="00:56:39.130" style="s2">what&#39;s more mute less well yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.180" end="00:56:40.450" style="s2">because if you mute them you can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.130" end="00:56:42.819" style="s2">the way that they&#39;re harassing people in</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.450" end="00:56:44.829" style="s2">your mentioned someone right okay so I</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.819" end="00:56:47.470" style="s2">think we&#39;ve made it through most of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.829" end="00:56:49.509" style="s2">items on our lists I think we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.470" end="00:56:50.710" style="s2">jettison some of the other ideas because</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.509" end="00:56:52.390" style="s2">we&#39;ve had a really substantive</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.710" end="00:56:55.779" style="s2">conversation on a number of a number of</p>

<p begin="00:57:41.559" end="00:57:45.400" style="s2">podcast the guest list has been</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.539" end="00:57:47.739" style="s2">tremendous the information that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.400" end="00:57:50.380" style="s2">delivered has been fantastic the topics</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.739" end="00:57:51.880" style="s2">that we&#39;ve explored the most meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.380" end="00:57:54.070" style="s2">important conversations that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.880" end="00:57:55.840" style="s2">having in the country today really you</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.070" end="00:57:58.330" style="s2">know in every podcast we seem to be able</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.840" end="00:57:59.920" style="s2">to get down to fundamental question</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.330" end="00:58:01.870" style="s2">affecting our society and have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.920" end="00:58:04.570" style="s2">conversation about it that is digestible</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.870" end="00:58:07.210" style="s2">that&#39;s understandable I know some people</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.570" end="00:58:09.070" style="s2">have to the Jordan Hall yeah Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.210" end="00:58:11.350" style="s2">podcasts were like man I listened like</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.070" end="00:58:12.610" style="s2">three times and things are just rattling</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.350" end="00:58:14.050" style="s2">around in my head still I haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.610" end="00:58:16.930" style="s2">able to process all that but you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.050" end="00:58:18.850" style="s2">listen to it again and and really my</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.930" end="00:58:22.840" style="s2">whole point in doing podcasts like this</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.850" end="00:58:24.790" style="s2">is to bring today&#39;s best thinkers to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.840" end="00:58:26.770" style="s2">table and have conversations meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.790" end="00:58:29.260" style="s2">conversations with them that will help</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.770" end="00:58:31.120" style="s2">us sort of create a new mental framework</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.260" end="00:58:33.370" style="s2">for understanding the world around us</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.120" end="00:58:36.550" style="s2">because the old frameworks that you were</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.370" end="00:58:38.560" style="s2">given no longer work the operating</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.550" end="00:58:41.110" style="s2">system software in your brain that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.560" end="00:58:43.300" style="s2">were handed as a child that&#39;s a product</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.110" end="00:58:45.640" style="s2">of the blue church and of the early and</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.300" end="00:58:47.170" style="s2">mid 20th century and if you were you</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.640" end="00:58:49.180" style="s2">know born in the late 20th century for</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.170" end="00:58:51.280" style="s2">sure whatever you got from your parents</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.180" end="00:58:53.770" style="s2">culture and society is whack and it does</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.280" end="00:58:55.900" style="s2">not work and that is why we&#39;re feeling a</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.770" end="00:58:57.940" style="s2">nationwide sense of cognitive dissonance</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.900" end="00:58:59.830" style="s2">when we&#39;re looking at the world and it</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.940" end="00:59:01.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t match with what our mental</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.830" end="00:59:02.590" style="s2">models tell us it should be it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.420" end="00:59:03.340" style="s2">match with the feelings that we have</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.590" end="00:59:04.720" style="s2">inside of us</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.340" end="00:59:06.790" style="s2">I think we&#39;re experiencing like a</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.720" end="00:59:08.980" style="s2">national cognitive dissonance on all</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.790" end="00:59:10.570" style="s2">sides right now which is why everybody</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.980" end="00:59:12.520" style="s2">feels a little agitated it feels a</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.570" end="00:59:14.800" style="s2">little off feels a little confused and</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.520" end="00:59:16.480" style="s2">the whole point of the podcast here is</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.800" end="00:59:18.610" style="s2">to help us create new mental frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.480" end="00:59:20.410" style="s2">for understanding the world so we become</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.610" end="00:59:23.080" style="s2">more at peace and we can understand what</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.410" end="00:59:24.610" style="s2">to do and where to go and how to make</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.080" end="00:59:25.780" style="s2">progress in a chaotic and confusing</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.610" end="00:59:29.170" style="s2">world that&#39;s becoming increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.780" end="00:59:31.090" style="s2">complex you know we are as John rabe</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.170" end="00:59:32.920" style="s2">said in the podcast previous we are in</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.090" end="00:59:34.510" style="s2">the midst of a war that sees no</p>
