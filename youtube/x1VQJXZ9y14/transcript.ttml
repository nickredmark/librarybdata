<p begin="00:00:07.830" end="00:00:14.759" style="s2">inside sort of world of what you called</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.429" end="00:00:16.289" style="s2">grievance studies and post-modernism I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.759" end="00:00:19.140" style="s2">really interested in what you&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.289" end="00:00:21.119" style="s2">during that time and what you think</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.140" end="00:00:22.740" style="s2">I mean how important do you think this</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.119" end="00:00:25.170" style="s2">or how how serious do you think this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.740" end="00:00:26.609" style="s2">is a something we need to look at and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.170" end="00:00:29.369" style="s2">what do you think are the main</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.609" end="00:00:31.980" style="s2">characteristics of post-modernism or</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.369" end="00:00:34.530" style="s2">this kind of scholarship and that well</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.980" end="00:00:37.260" style="s2">the main characteristics of it are a</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.530" end="00:00:39.719" style="s2">belief in the cultural constructiveness</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.260" end="00:00:41.280" style="s2">of knowledge so knowledge isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.719" end="00:00:43.500" style="s2">something that&#39;s out there to be found</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.280" end="00:00:46.200" style="s2">it&#39;s something that humans make with</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.500" end="00:00:48.660" style="s2">their language and this works in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.200" end="00:00:50.280" style="s2">service of power so particularly the</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.660" end="00:00:52.980" style="s2">postmodern ideas will go against</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.280" end="00:00:54.690" style="s2">Christianity but also Marxism and also</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.980" end="00:00:56.489" style="s2">science they will say these have own</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.690" end="00:00:59.370" style="s2">view power they&#39;re accepted as truths</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.489" end="00:01:01.520" style="s2">they&#39;re dangerous and they want to pick</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.370" end="00:01:04.470" style="s2">them all apart so because of that we see</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.520" end="00:01:06.299" style="s2">understandings of categories that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.470" end="00:01:08.280" style="s2">accepted as distinct as actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.299" end="00:01:10.680" style="s2">blending into each other the things like</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.280" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">facts and fiction reason and emotion</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.680" end="00:01:14.130" style="s2">we&#39;re not separating these in</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:17.790" style="s2">post-modernism there&#39;s that really</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.130" end="00:01:20.340" style="s2">intense focus on language as as</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.790" end="00:01:23.250" style="s2">dangerous as a constructor of things we</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.340" end="00:01:26.970" style="s2">and we&#39;ve got quite a loss of both</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.250" end="00:01:29.340" style="s2">humanism and individuality we&#39;re not to</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.970" end="00:01:31.049" style="s2">see each other as fellow human beings</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.340" end="00:01:32.939" style="s2">with individual characteristics that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.049" end="00:01:35.400" style="s2">can like dislike agree with disagree</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.939" end="00:01:38.549" style="s2">with now it&#39;s all about knowledge as</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.400" end="00:01:41.210" style="s2">attached to identity so a black person</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.549" end="00:01:45.119" style="s2">will have authoritative knowledge on</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.210" end="00:01:46.290" style="s2">racism and she just has to be believed</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.119" end="00:01:47.880" style="s2">of course the problem with this</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.290" end="00:01:49.380" style="s2">immediately is that if you have to black</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.880" end="00:01:50.610" style="s2">people and ask them a question they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.380" end="00:01:53.130" style="s2">not going to agree because they are</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.610" end="00:01:56.100" style="s2">actually individuals so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.130" end="00:01:58.920" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing quite a lot from from</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.100" end="00:02:02.119" style="s2">post-modernism I think it is a serious</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.920" end="00:02:05.880" style="s2">problem not in the extent that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.119" end="00:02:09.450" style="s2">majority belief but I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.880" end="00:02:11.380" style="s2">coming into wider society we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.450" end="00:02:13.930" style="s2">quite a lot of the X</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.380" end="00:02:16.630" style="s2">to give evidence for a claim to make it</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.930" end="00:02:18.820" style="s2">reasoned and to be able to talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.630" end="00:02:20.770" style="s2">other on them on the basis of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.820" end="00:02:23.110" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing more and more that people</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.770" end="00:02:25.000" style="s2">are asking more who are you a straight</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.110" end="00:02:27.610" style="s2">white man to to address this issue</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.000" end="00:02:30.430" style="s2">that&#39;s in complete contradiction to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.610" end="00:02:32.380" style="s2">liberal marketplace of ideas so I am</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.430" end="00:02:33.850" style="s2">concerned about it but I think what</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.380" end="00:02:35.740" style="s2">worries me most is that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.850" end="00:02:38.020" style="s2">really understand how it works because</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.740" end="00:02:39.700" style="s2">it&#39;s so counterintuitive and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.020" end="00:02:41.800" style="s2">need to break it down and make the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.700" end="00:02:44.230" style="s2">people able to get at it and then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.800" end="00:02:45.880" style="s2">be able to counter it do you get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.230" end="00:02:48.190" style="s2">that things are starting to shift</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.880" end="00:02:49.630" style="s2">because there&#39;s it&#39;s certainly seem that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.190" end="00:02:51.910" style="s2">there&#39;s more awareness of this in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.630" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2">culture than there was before and do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.910" end="00:02:55.120" style="s2">get a sense that things are starting to</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.200" end="00:02:57.070" style="s2">shift and and people&#39;s minds are</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.120" end="00:02:58.780" style="s2">starting to change around this yes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.070" end="00:03:02.740" style="s2">just worried about where it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.780" end="00:03:04.390" style="s2">shift to because since about 2010 but</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.740" end="00:03:07.300" style="s2">really escalating over the last few</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.390" end="00:03:10.360" style="s2">years the social justice ideas have got</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.300" end="00:03:12.550" style="s2">stronger more assertive and clearer so</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.360" end="00:03:14.380" style="s2">people can get at them that&#39;s the good</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.550" end="00:03:16.150" style="s2">thing we can now see what they are and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.380" end="00:03:17.440" style="s2">we can argue with them without being</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.150" end="00:03:19.630" style="s2">accused of straw Manning there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.440" end="00:03:22.360" style="s2">obscurantist language or ambiguity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.630" end="00:03:23.860" style="s2">very clear and the bad thing about this</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.360" end="00:03:26.200" style="s2">is that it&#39;s it&#39;s highly contagious</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.860" end="00:03:29.080" style="s2">young idealistic students particularly</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.200" end="00:03:32.020" style="s2">can grasp this and and absorb it but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.080" end="00:03:35.410" style="s2">think that that does move us into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.020" end="00:03:37.750" style="s2">stage of of pushback of culture war</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.410" end="00:03:41.140" style="s2">rather than cultural confusion which has</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.750" end="00:03:43.780" style="s2">been what we&#39;re seeing so my concern at</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.140" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">the moment is that I think there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.780" end="00:03:48.400" style="s2">to be a big pushback at social justice</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:51.550" style="s2">and I want it to come from the liberal</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.400" end="00:03:54.010" style="s2">left rather than the populist right and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.550" end="00:03:57.130" style="s2">I see at the moment people surging</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.010" end="00:03:59.260" style="s2">writers in the UK and the u.s. we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.130" end="00:04:00.990" style="s2">a surgery we have conservative parties</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.260" end="00:04:04.510" style="s2">in now people are expressing less</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.990" end="00:04:07.870" style="s2">confidence in left-wing parties and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.510" end="00:04:09.430" style="s2">think this is partly to do with the kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.870" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">of social justice ideas that are coming</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.430" end="00:04:14.080" style="s2">from them so I want the liberal left to</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:16.420" style="s2">push back at them otherwise I fear that</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.080" end="00:04:18.580" style="s2">the anti intellectual right the populist</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.420" end="00:04:19.150" style="s2">right could become more attractive to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.580" end="00:04:21.549" style="s2">more people</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.150" end="00:04:22.670" style="s2">it could even push back racial equality</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.549" end="00:04:25.970" style="s2">gender equality</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.670" end="00:04:29.000" style="s2">LGBT equality and that is is what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.970" end="00:04:31.190" style="s2">want to try and stop what I do what does</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.000" end="00:04:33.950" style="s2">that look like a pushback from the left</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.190" end="00:04:37.990" style="s2">and the center left I think it looks</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.950" end="00:04:40.910" style="s2">like an unembarrassed assertion of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.990" end="00:04:42.830" style="s2">belief in the marketplace of ideas in</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.910" end="00:04:45.200" style="s2">science in reason in evidence in</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.830" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">progress you know it&#39;s supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.200" end="00:04:51.950" style="s2">embarrassingly naive now to believe in</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:54.290" style="s2">enlightenment ideas and that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.950" end="00:04:57.830" style="s2">they are presented so childishly and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.290" end="00:05:00.260" style="s2">sort of it sort of caricature by the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.830" end="00:05:02.810" style="s2">social justice left but actually if we</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.260" end="00:05:05.120" style="s2">are looking at how these I&#39;d what these</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.810" end="00:05:07.910" style="s2">ideas have done for society the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.120" end="00:05:10.190" style="s2">universal liberalism of requiring</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.910" end="00:05:12.200" style="s2">evidence to make a truth claim of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.190" end="00:05:14.840" style="s2">requiring our arguments to be reasoned</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.200" end="00:05:17.270" style="s2">these are not embarrassing ideas and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.840" end="00:05:19.550" style="s2">progress they have made is measurable so</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.270" end="00:05:21.410" style="s2">we need liberals to be confident enough</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.550" end="00:05:23.390" style="s2">in saying I don&#39;t accept your</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.410" end="00:05:25.940" style="s2">epistemology I don&#39;t accept your ethics</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.390" end="00:05:27.920" style="s2">these are the ones I do accept and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.940" end="00:05:30.320" style="s2">think that would cause reasonable people</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.920" end="00:05:31.700" style="s2">who have gone right to come back I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.320" end="00:05:33.880" style="s2">that&#39;s all we can do to win them back</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.700" end="00:05:36.950" style="s2">and isn&#39;t there a really difficult</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.880" end="00:05:39.710" style="s2">needle to be threaded here because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.950" end="00:05:41.960" style="s2">assuming when you say we need to push</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.710" end="00:05:44.030" style="s2">back into these social justice ideas</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.960" end="00:05:46.450" style="s2">what people were hear you saying is I</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.030" end="00:05:49.730" style="s2">want to push back against social justice</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.450" end="00:05:52.240" style="s2">isn&#39;t that the catch-22 that it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.730" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">that&#39;s why and we&#39;ve written so many</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.240" end="00:05:56.660" style="s2">pieces like no identity politics does</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:05:59.540" style="s2">not continue the work of the civil</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.660" end="00:06:01.610" style="s2">rights movement it&#39;s actually being</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.540" end="00:06:03.890" style="s2">helped at the moment that so many social</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.610" end="00:06:05.720" style="s2">justice people are critical of</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.890" end="00:06:08.930" style="s2">liberalism so they&#39;re not calling</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.720" end="00:06:11.990" style="s2">themselves liberals and in America lit</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.930" end="00:06:13.490" style="s2">that they tend to lump liberal with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.990" end="00:06:15.770" style="s2">social justice left and that&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.490" end="00:06:17.750" style="s2">more confusing but over here we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.770" end="00:06:20.330" style="s2">better with distinguishing liberals from</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.750" end="00:06:22.100" style="s2">identitarian but you just I think we</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.330" end="00:06:24.890" style="s2">just have to keep spelling that out very</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.100" end="00:06:27.080" style="s2">clearly and this is this is what James</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.890" end="00:06:29.300" style="s2">and I have done in our book at the end</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.080" end="00:06:31.460" style="s2">we do believe that racial equality</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.300" end="00:06:32.100" style="s2">matters we do believe we are not there</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.460" end="00:06:33.870" style="s2">yet</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.100" end="00:06:35.910" style="s2">we don&#39;t believe this is the way to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.870" end="00:06:40.290" style="s2">it so I think we just have to keep on</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.910" end="00:06:42.420" style="s2">spelling out you can you can focus on</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.290" end="00:06:44.820" style="s2">social justice you can think the society</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.420" end="00:06:46.530" style="s2">is unjust and you want to fix that</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.820" end="00:06:48.660" style="s2">without going for a social justice</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.530" end="00:06:51.600" style="s2">movement approach which is rooted in</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.660" end="00:06:53.670" style="s2">postmodern ideas so is the problem not</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.600" end="00:06:56.660" style="s2">with the ideas but with the ideology or</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.670" end="00:06:59.640" style="s2">is it in the ideas but at the root cause</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.660" end="00:07:01.950" style="s2">we&#39;re with them they want racial</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.640" end="00:07:05.790" style="s2">equality they want gender equality so</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.950" end="00:07:07.860" style="s2">that those core values are there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.790" end="00:07:09.720" style="s2">shared by everybody on the left and</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.860" end="00:07:11.550" style="s2">quite a few people on the right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.720" end="00:07:14.940" style="s2">not those that are the problem it is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.550" end="00:07:16.980" style="s2">way of distinguishing what is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.940" end="00:07:18.630" style="s2">and what isn&#39;t the way of reading</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.980" end="00:07:20.310" style="s2">assuming that racism will be in</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.630" end="00:07:22.260" style="s2">everything assuming that sexism will be</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.310" end="00:07:25.500" style="s2">and then reading things in order to find</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.260" end="00:07:28.020" style="s2">them and you know wanting to censor</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.500" end="00:07:31.020" style="s2">people wanting to have culturally</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.020" end="00:07:33.360" style="s2">relative ethics ignoring the individual</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.020" end="00:07:35.880" style="s2">the individual and that and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.360" end="00:07:37.770" style="s2">sort of humanist ideal that&#39;s that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.880" end="00:07:40.460" style="s2">the problem that I think it&#39;s clear is</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.770" end="00:07:43.350" style="s2">just going to make more divisions and</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.460" end="00:07:47.010" style="s2">make it harder to address any problems</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.350" end="00:07:49.680" style="s2">that are there I mean I do see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.010" end="00:07:51.300" style="s2">my friends who are in a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.680" end="00:07:53.790" style="s2">kind of activist communities that were</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.300" end="00:07:57.000" style="s2">sort of very heavily social justice</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.790" end="00:07:58.860" style="s2">ideology influenced starting to realize</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.000" end="00:08:00.750" style="s2">at the very least it&#39;s tactically not</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.860" end="00:08:03.830" style="s2">working that it&#39;s creating the the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.750" end="00:08:05.970" style="s2">in like you could argue that as heavily</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.830" end="00:08:06.900" style="s2">influential in the election of Trump you</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.970" end="00:08:09.990" style="s2">could argue it was heavily influential</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.900" end="00:08:13.170" style="s2">and brexit this sort of sense of shaming</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.990" end="00:08:14.700" style="s2">and kind of judging a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.170" end="00:08:19.350" style="s2">didn&#39;t think the same way about social</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.700" end="00:08:20.670" style="s2">justice and diversity issues I do see</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.350" end="00:08:22.830" style="s2">that happening I do wonder whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.670" end="00:08:24.750" style="s2">going to be fast enough and what the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.830" end="00:08:26.280" style="s2">medium term because the medium term</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.750" end="00:08:27.960" style="s2">effect looks almost certain to be the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.280" end="00:08:29.790" style="s2">re-election of Trump as far as I can see</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.960" end="00:08:32.520" style="s2">because what you&#39;re seeing in America is</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.790" end="00:08:34.680" style="s2">just this doubling down on the left of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.520" end="00:08:35.840" style="s2">oh wow it&#39;s far more racist and sexist</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.680" end="00:08:38.370" style="s2">and bigger to than we ever realized</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.840" end="00:08:41.250" style="s2">while it seems quite clear to me that a</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.370" end="00:08:42.400" style="s2">lot of the reaction is anti political</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.250" end="00:08:44.110" style="s2">correctness that&#39;s why people</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.400" end="00:08:45.520" style="s2">voting for Trump so I do see that</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.110" end="00:08:47.320" style="s2">happening in some of these communities</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.520" end="00:08:49.990" style="s2">but I also wonder if it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.320" end="00:08:53.950" style="s2">happen fast enough I have a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.990" end="00:08:58.270" style="s2">hope for the UK because we have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.950" end="00:09:02.620" style="s2">stronger Socialist Left it&#39;s been bigger</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.270" end="00:09:05.050" style="s2">and and more well-established and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.620" end="00:09:06.910" style="s2">getting more positive towards the left</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.050" end="00:09:10.780" style="s2">liberals there is productive</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.910" end="00:09:13.720" style="s2">conversation going on between centrists</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.780" end="00:09:16.180" style="s2">left liberals and economic leftist</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.720" end="00:09:18.970" style="s2">socialist lefties so I think that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.180" end="00:09:21.820" style="s2">could between us push out the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.970" end="00:09:23.980" style="s2">identitarian left I think that could</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.820" end="00:09:25.960" style="s2">happen I&#39;m not sure that could happen in</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.980" end="00:09:27.640" style="s2">the u.s. because they have a different</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.960" end="00:09:30.700" style="s2">relationship with socialism they have</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.640" end="00:09:33.940" style="s2">the whole red scare thing going on there</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.700" end="00:09:36.550" style="s2">they are their economic left hasn&#39;t got</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.940" end="00:09:38.650" style="s2">the prestige to actually stand up and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.550" end="00:09:41.050" style="s2">push back at the identitarian left and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.650" end="00:09:43.060" style="s2">lot of Americans centrists and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.050" end="00:09:45.550" style="s2">right-wingers can&#39;t even don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.060" end="00:09:47.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.550" end="00:09:50.160" style="s2">much more messy there I don&#39;t think this</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.830" end="00:09:52.870" style="s2">is going to be a quick fix in the US and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.160" end="00:09:55.120" style="s2">you&#39;re a professor of philosophy at</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.870" end="00:09:57.760" style="s2">Portland University you&#39;re probably best</p>

<p begin="00:09:57.760" end="00:10:02.610" style="s2">University are probably best known for</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.670" end="00:10:05.260" style="s2">the what&#39;s called the grievant studies</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.610" end="00:10:07.060" style="s2">papers can you give a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.260" end="00:10:10.390" style="s2">background on that what and how how</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.060" end="00:10:12.070" style="s2">would you introduce yourself well before</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.390" end="00:10:13.540" style="s2">I did the grievance Studies thing I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.070" end="00:10:15.820" style="s2">heavily involved in the atheist movement</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.540" end="00:10:17.590" style="s2">and so to understand the grievance</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.820" end="00:10:19.990" style="s2">studies I think it&#39;s really important to</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.590" end="00:10:25.120" style="s2">understand the rise and fall of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.990" end="00:10:27.310" style="s2">atheist movement so grievance studies we</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.120" end="00:10:31.410" style="s2">submitted us James Lindsay Helen pluck</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.310" end="00:10:31.410" style="s2">Rose and I over 10 months wrote around</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.650" end="00:10:37.840" style="s2">250,000 words in 20 papers and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.140" end="00:10:40.870" style="s2">submitted them to peer-reviewed journals</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.840" end="00:10:43.240" style="s2">to test the process to whistle blow if</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.870" end="00:10:45.690" style="s2">you will to see if intentionally broken</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.240" end="00:10:48.760" style="s2">absurd papers would get published and</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.690" end="00:10:51.910" style="s2">seven more published or and accepted by</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.760" end="00:10:53.860" style="s2">the time the Wall Street Journal found</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.910" end="00:10:55.200" style="s2">out about it and then we came clean and</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.860" end="00:10:57.720" style="s2">seven more were</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.200" end="00:10:59.850" style="s2">review and the idea there was to expose</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.720" end="00:11:03.330" style="s2">shoddy scholarship corrupt scholarship</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.850" end="00:11:04.860" style="s2">agenda-driven scholarship but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.330" end="00:11:08.040" style="s2">things we realized from coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.860" end="00:11:11.760" style="s2">Atheist movement was that social justice</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.040" end="00:11:14.700" style="s2">with an uppercase s and uppercase J had</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.760" end="00:11:17.790" style="s2">it really is a parasitic ideology and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.700" end="00:11:20.400" style="s2">had woven its way ironically enough into</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.790" end="00:11:23.310" style="s2">the Atheist movement and caused schisms</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.400" end="00:11:27.030" style="s2">and fractures within that movement and</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.310" end="00:11:29.880" style="s2">so what we did was the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.030" end="00:11:31.830" style="s2">writing those was to test our own ideas</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.880" end="00:11:34.140" style="s2">maybe these folks are onto something</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.830" end="00:11:35.700" style="s2">that we haven&#39;t figured out maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.140" end="00:11:39.390" style="s2">really there really is something there</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.700" end="00:11:41.610" style="s2">and the way to do that was to call pen</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.390" end="00:11:46.260" style="s2">testing penetration testing to see if it</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.610" end="00:11:50.600" style="s2">works so we wrote those papers and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.260" end="00:11:54.960" style="s2">we now have our answer to that question</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.600" end="00:11:57.990" style="s2">because I mean that there I&#39;ve seen sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.960" end="00:12:00.240" style="s2">of strong criticisms of that I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.990" end="00:12:02.670" style="s2">there was an editorial in The Times</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.240" end="00:12:04.350" style="s2">Literary Supplement maybe and some</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.670" end="00:12:05.970" style="s2">people saying that what you proved</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.350" end="00:12:07.530" style="s2">wasn&#39;t what you said that you&#39;ve proved</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.970" end="00:12:08.910" style="s2">and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.530" end="00:12:11.490" style="s2">people who&#39;ve questioned what you did</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.910" end="00:12:13.080" style="s2">have you had any dialogues with your</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.490" end="00:12:14.700" style="s2">books about impossible conversations if</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.080" end="00:12:19.770" style="s2">you had any dialogues with your critics</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.700" end="00:12:22.530" style="s2">over this dialogues no I mean I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.770" end="00:12:24.660" style="s2">brought up on trial and I would been</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.530" end="00:12:27.600" style="s2">brought up three times and I&#39;m about to</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.660" end="00:12:30.090" style="s2">be brought up again for additional</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.600" end="00:12:32.580" style="s2">ethical violations and charges and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.090" end="00:12:34.110" style="s2">conversation starter that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.580" end="00:12:35.700" style="s2">remains on the table when we did the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.110" end="00:12:39.390" style="s2">James - more of that with Helen pluck</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.700" end="00:12:41.220" style="s2">Rose and Heather Haim and I at PSU we</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.390" end="00:12:43.290" style="s2">invited folks from the Women&#39;s Studies</p>

<p begin="00:13:58.950" end="00:14:06.510" style="s2">fellow it could be fear of losing an</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.450" end="00:14:08.340" style="s2">argument it could be platforming which</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.510" end="00:14:09.540" style="s2">is another idea that&#39;s very common we</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.340" end="00:14:12.710" style="s2">don&#39;t want to give someone who has a</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.540" end="00:14:15.990" style="s2">different belief a platform it could be</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.710" end="00:14:17.580" style="s2">my strongest suspicion is that these</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.990" end="00:14:18.990" style="s2">folks don&#39;t know the other side of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.580" end="00:14:21.420" style="s2">argument and so they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.990" end="00:14:23.730" style="s2">indoctrinated they don&#39;t value open</p>

<p begin="00:14:23.730" end="00:14:29.790" style="s2">interactions they look at education as</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.600" end="00:14:33.570" style="s2">an ideology mill and their agenda driven</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.790" end="00:14:37.560" style="s2">that&#39;s my strongest conjecture</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.570" end="00:14:39.600" style="s2">I&#39;m not positive of the percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.560" end="00:14:42.420" style="s2">the role like in a pie chart like how</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.600" end="00:14:44.910" style="s2">big of a cut of pie that would be but</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.420" end="00:14:48.000" style="s2">I&#39;m fairly confident it&#39;s a sizable cut</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.910" end="00:14:50.550" style="s2">of that pie so you&#39;re you&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.000" end="00:14:51.930" style="s2">asking for someone to discuss with now I</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.550" end="00:14:55.500" style="s2">hope someone does come out that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.930" end="00:14:57.420" style="s2">basically what the letter wiki project</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.500" end="00:14:58.740" style="s2">is about having those conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.420" end="00:15:01.470" style="s2">matching up people with opposing views</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.740" end="00:15:04.080" style="s2">so I hope we will call someone out now</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.470" end="00:15:06.990" style="s2">I&#39;ll try and put some of the criticisms</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.080" end="00:15:08.040" style="s2">that someone might raise to you and but</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.990" end="00:15:10.050" style="s2">I think it would be much better if</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.040" end="00:15:12.240" style="s2">someone from that that environment came</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.050" end="00:15:15.720" style="s2">oh let me pause you right there and say</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.240" end="00:15:18.150" style="s2">not just anybody because people say well</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.720" end="00:15:19.440" style="s2">you&#39;re punching down why haven&#39;t you had</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.150" end="00:15:20.970" style="s2">a conversation with someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.440" end="00:15:23.910" style="s2">published in these areas</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.970" end="00:15:26.070" style="s2">so I&#39;m happy to have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.910" end="00:15:28.620" style="s2">somebody who specifically published in</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.070" end="00:15:32.190" style="s2">the journals in which we hoax might not</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.620" end="00:15:33.480" style="s2">be exactly the the best word but the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.190" end="00:15:35.940" style="s2">person with whom I&#39;m having that</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.480" end="00:15:39.150" style="s2">discussion they need to they can&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.940" end="00:15:41.130" style="s2">random person so they need to have some</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.150" end="00:15:45.150" style="s2">qualifications to be able to speak in</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.130" end="00:15:47.520" style="s2">the area and that looks like ideally</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.150" end="00:15:49.230" style="s2">that they would replicate what we did if</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.520" end="00:15:51.060" style="s2">you have you know a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.230" end="00:15:52.470" style="s2">peer-reviewed publications in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.060" end="00:15:55.200" style="s2">journals in which we publish</p>

<p begin="00:16:01.920" end="00:16:07.070" style="s2">you on Twitter talked about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.810" end="00:16:10.590" style="s2">that you find it quite peculiar or or</p>

<p begin="00:16:21.480" end="00:16:27.540" style="s2">is quite difficult in in some ways I</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.150" end="00:16:30.120" style="s2">mean I I can deal with people telling me</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.540" end="00:16:32.310" style="s2">I&#39;m on one side they tend to tell me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.120" end="00:16:35.100" style="s2">a Nazi and a fascist on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.310" end="00:16:37.830" style="s2">they tend to point out I&#39;m fat so I can</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.100" end="00:16:41.460" style="s2">I can deal with those kind of random</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.830" end="00:16:44.010" style="s2">insults but there are committed stalkers</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.460" end="00:16:46.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s sort of and I have to block a</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.010" end="00:16:48.210" style="s2">lot of people and then there is just</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.440" end="00:16:51.000" style="s2">this kind of collective of people who</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.210" end="00:16:54.000" style="s2">just really seem to put an awful lot of</p>

<p begin="00:16:58.380" end="00:17:03.420" style="s2">of context and it just really is quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.230" end="00:17:07.040" style="s2">disturbing to know that there are people</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.420" end="00:17:10.920" style="s2">who will put this much energy into</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.040" end="00:17:12.930" style="s2">attacking things that I don&#39;t mean I</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.920" end="00:17:15.540" style="s2">haven&#39;t having it said and would</p>

<p begin="00:17:16.860" end="00:17:21.600" style="s2">that&#39;s quite an uncomfortable thought</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.199" end="00:17:24.870" style="s2">and I&#39;d somebody came back to me when I</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.600" end="00:17:27.540" style="s2">said this on Twitter and she said we you</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.870" end="00:17:30.090" style="s2">get what you give you&#39;re a deeply</p>

<p begin="00:17:34.260" end="00:17:39.210" style="s2">people telling me that my my pistol</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.080" end="00:17:41.520" style="s2">knology my ways of knowing are wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.210" end="00:17:43.110" style="s2">that my ethics are wrong they would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.520" end="00:17:45.330" style="s2">polite they would respond to what I</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.110" end="00:17:49.320" style="s2">actually said I could deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.330" end="00:17:51.180" style="s2">what I can&#39;t deal with is people today</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.320" end="00:17:54.380" style="s2">yeah today apparently I</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.180" end="00:17:57.300" style="s2">I supported Nazis because I said that</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.380" end="00:17:59.430" style="s2">nearly everybody wants good things for</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.300" end="00:18:01.500" style="s2">society and so that was taken off from</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.430" end="00:18:04.650" style="s2">runway and it&#39;s it&#39;s just really</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.500" end="00:18:06.030" style="s2">difficult to took it bothers me I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.650" end="00:18:09.150" style="s2">the other two are better at ignoring</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.030" end="00:18:11.580" style="s2">than I am I feel like if something is</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.150" end="00:18:13.170" style="s2">being presented wrongly I have to I have</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.580" end="00:18:14.910" style="s2">to put it right and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.170" end="00:18:17.130" style="s2">I&#39;ve got to stop doing there&#39;s one other</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.910" end="00:18:19.680" style="s2">thing I&#39;d like to raise about there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.130" end="00:18:24.180" style="s2">lot of I see a lot of accusations of bad</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.680" end="00:18:28.410" style="s2">faith being lobbed around and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.180" end="00:18:30.630" style="s2">grifter and bad faith and also I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.410" end="00:18:33.950" style="s2">I&#39;m interested I unpack that I also see</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.630" end="00:18:36.780" style="s2">the accusation of bad faith it almost</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.950" end="00:18:39.150" style="s2">from people on in the center and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.780" end="00:18:41.430" style="s2">the center right and it almost seems the</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.150" end="00:18:44.760" style="s2">equivalent of the kind of no platforming</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.430" end="00:18:47.070" style="s2">coming from the left do you do you think</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.760" end="00:18:49.710" style="s2">I mean my sense is that if someone is</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.070" end="00:18:51.930" style="s2">genuinely arguing in bad faith surely we</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.710" end="00:18:53.700" style="s2">can we can have a discussion and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.930" end="00:18:57.180" style="s2">that will be exposed if that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.700" end="00:18:58.770" style="s2">I have no problem with I know this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.180" end="00:19:01.140" style="s2">sound weird but I have no problem with</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.770" end="00:19:02.040" style="s2">someone arguing in bad faith that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.140" end="00:19:04.740" style="s2">not my problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.040" end="00:19:07.260" style="s2">look so let&#39;s oh you just said a huge a</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.740" end="00:19:09.630" style="s2">lot so let&#39;s unpack that the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.260" end="00:19:12.390" style="s2">you said well my response that we said</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.630" end="00:19:14.790" style="s2">was grifter so that&#39;s a term I&#39;m accused</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.390" end="00:19:16.890" style="s2">of grifting constantly and when I first</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.790" end="00:19:19.290" style="s2">heard it I was so baffled by it because</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.890" end="00:19:22.170" style="s2">I thought it was you receiving some kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.290" end="00:19:23.880" style="s2">of remuneration financial money or</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.170" end="00:19:26.370" style="s2">something and I was baffled by it</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.880" end="00:19:28.890" style="s2">because I did the grievant Studies thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.370" end="00:19:31.830" style="s2">for no money that New Atheism I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.890" end="00:19:33.810" style="s2">app atheists for no money all the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.830" end="00:19:35.940" style="s2">I don&#39;t have a patreon I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.810" end="00:19:39.540" style="s2">PayPal I haven&#39;t taken a penny for me I</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.940" end="00:19:41.520" style="s2">could not understand where this grifting</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.540" end="00:19:43.800" style="s2">accusation came from and I keep thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.520" end="00:19:46.080" style="s2">well just maybe I don&#39;t understand and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.800" end="00:19:48.540" style="s2">was incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.080" end="00:19:49.470" style="s2">I didn&#39;t understand it I was correct</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.540" end="00:19:52.680" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.470" end="00:19:54.270" style="s2">so grifting means the and correct me if</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.680" end="00:19:56.550" style="s2">you want to throw out another</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.270" end="00:19:59.190" style="s2">interpretation of this it means that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.550" end="00:20:01.770" style="s2">there&#39;s some idea in the zeitgeist that</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.190" end="00:20:03.780" style="s2">you have latched on to not because you</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.770" end="00:20:05.730" style="s2">happen to believe it but because you</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.780" end="00:20:08.190" style="s2">think it gives you social and maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.730" end="00:20:12.060" style="s2">intellectual currency to advance that</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.190" end="00:20:13.560" style="s2">idea so the the problem with that is one</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.060" end="00:20:17.250" style="s2">it assumes that people know your</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.560" end="00:20:19.410" style="s2">motivations that is the only you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.250" end="00:20:21.330" style="s2">know your motivations the other problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.410" end="00:20:23.700" style="s2">with that is it&#39;s a convenient excuse to</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.330" end="00:20:26.160" style="s2">not do intellectual work to engage their</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.700" end="00:20:27.260" style="s2">arguments so someone has just said</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.160" end="00:20:32.490" style="s2">something they&#39;ve made an argument</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.260" end="00:20:34.320" style="s2">grifter or Nazi right so you you we have</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.490" end="00:20:36.210" style="s2">a little label a smear label we play</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.320" end="00:20:39.840" style="s2">someone in a box don&#39;t have to engage</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.210" end="00:20:42.660" style="s2">it&#39;s a way it&#39;s an anti dialectical tool</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.840" end="00:20:44.610" style="s2">that people use to avoid argument or</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.660" end="00:20:47.670" style="s2">engaging ideas at all so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.610" end="00:20:52.230" style="s2">first thing the second thing you said</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.670" end="00:20:53.940" style="s2">what was the second thing again is it a</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.230" end="00:20:57.120" style="s2">bad faith yeah the arguments in bad</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.940" end="00:20:59.040" style="s2">faith yeah or refusing to engage with</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.120" end="00:21:00.390" style="s2">people because you you&#39;ve already pre</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.040" end="00:21:02.730" style="s2">decided that everything that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.390" end="00:21:07.410" style="s2">saying is in bad faith which I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.730" end="00:21:14.060" style="s2">on all sides of the of the aisle yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.410" end="00:21:17.310" style="s2">think ok so let&#39;s take a look at that if</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.060" end="00:21:19.380" style="s2">refusing to engage with somebody because</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.310" end="00:21:22.650" style="s2">you believe that they&#39;re a bad faith</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.380" end="00:21:24.330" style="s2">actor is one thing but engaging with</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.650" end="00:21:29.460" style="s2">someone you believe is acting in bad</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.330" end="00:21:32.930" style="s2">faith is another so the problem I I see</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.460" end="00:21:36.930" style="s2">the more egregious problem by far of</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.930" end="00:21:39.480" style="s2">refusing to engage some someone because</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.930" end="00:21:41.910" style="s2">you think they&#39;re acting in bad faith in</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.480" end="00:21:43.920" style="s2">my experience I have found that that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.910" end="00:21:46.680" style="s2">because people are intellectually afraid</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.920" end="00:21:48.390" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of fear response so</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.680" end="00:21:50.100" style="s2">that&#39;s why they don&#39;t want to engage and</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.390" end="00:21:55.080" style="s2">they&#39;ll use anything as a convenient</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.100" end="00:21:57.120" style="s2">excuse to justify not engaging yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.080" end="00:21:58.680" style="s2">I&#39;d agree with that with the with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.120" end="00:22:02.610" style="s2">the examples that I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.680" end="00:22:05.490" style="s2">about and I also wanted to ask as well</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.610" end="00:22:07.650" style="s2">because you&#39;re you are quite quite</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.490" end="00:22:10.170" style="s2">heavily criticized on Twitter I saw a</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.650" end="00:22:12.630" style="s2">few kind of backwards and forwards and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.170" end="00:22:14.480" style="s2">know that Eric Weinstein and Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.630" end="00:22:19.020" style="s2">have talked about this quite a lot that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.480" end="00:22:21.210" style="s2">actually be again especially Sam is</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.020" end="00:22:23.160" style="s2">obviously attacked quite a lot and he</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.210" end="00:22:24.570" style="s2">feels that he&#39;s actually his sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.160" end="00:22:26.970" style="s2">making is getting worse and worse</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.570" end="00:22:29.940" style="s2">because he&#39;s finding it more and more</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.970" end="00:22:33.330" style="s2">difficult to distill the good quality</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.940" end="00:22:35.220" style="s2">criticism from the bad quality criticism</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.330" end="00:22:37.110" style="s2">do you worry about that do you think</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.220" end="00:22:40.320" style="s2">that might be happening to you as well</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.110" end="00:22:43.410" style="s2">I worried deeply deeply about that that</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.320" end="00:22:46.800" style="s2">is one of my primary concerns one of my</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.410" end="00:22:51.480" style="s2">primary concerns is I&#39;ve gotten so much</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.800" end="00:22:53.490" style="s2">rage and hatred that I&#39;ve just tuned</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.480" end="00:22:56.010" style="s2">those people out but yet I desperately</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.490" end="00:22:59.790" style="s2">need those people I have to have those</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.010" end="00:23:01.170" style="s2">voices - that&#39;s the corrective mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.790" end="00:23:03.090" style="s2">in my head that takes in that of</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.170" end="00:23:05.270" style="s2">delusion but when everyone is telling me</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.090" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">I&#39;m a moron a grifter and a Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.270" end="00:23:12.750" style="s2">constantly it it&#39;s we all need that</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:15.630" style="s2">feedback to keep ourselves in check and</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.750" end="00:23:18.060" style="s2">as much as I have tried to not invoke a</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.630" end="00:23:20.520" style="s2">defensive posture I even find myself</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.060" end="00:23:23.310" style="s2">tone policing things and I can&#39;t stand</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.520" end="00:23:24.810" style="s2">that about myself but yet I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.310" end="00:23:28.470" style="s2">really don&#39;t know what to do about that</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.810" end="00:23:29.970" style="s2">because everybody myself included you</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.470" end="00:23:32.790" style="s2">know when you take strong stances about</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.970" end="00:23:35.010" style="s2">things you absolutely need feedback from</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.790" end="00:23:37.830" style="s2">the other side but when that feedback</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.010" end="00:23:39.420" style="s2">come comes in terms of as Nietzsche said</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.830" end="00:23:41.460" style="s2">you know philosophizing with a hammer</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.420" end="00:23:45.980" style="s2">when you&#39;re just getting hammered all</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.460" end="00:23:48.630" style="s2">the time it&#39;s very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.980" end="00:23:50.730" style="s2">sincerely reflect on your to take those</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.630" end="00:23:53.280" style="s2">comments and sincerely reflect on those</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.730" end="00:23:55.410" style="s2">those ideas so I&#39;m deeply concerned</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.280" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">about that do you have any thoughts of</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.410" end="00:24:01.890" style="s2">any solutions to that wiki letter</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:03.300" style="s2">there&#39;s one having a place where you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.890" end="00:24:07.940" style="s2">go where the conversations are more</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.300" end="00:24:11.340" style="s2">civil I&#39;m also deeply concerned that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.940" end="00:24:13.230" style="s2">have muted people who</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.340" end="00:24:16.110" style="s2">I really would like to hear what they</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.230" end="00:24:20.490" style="s2">say but all I&#39;m getting is sworn out and</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.110" end="00:24:22.410" style="s2">told them and moron constantly I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.490" end="00:24:25.050" style="s2">really know what the solution is other</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.410" end="00:24:27.320" style="s2">than listening first and being willing</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.050" end="00:24:30.300" style="s2">to have conversations with those folks</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.320" end="00:24:32.880" style="s2">and then I think that does get back to</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.300" end="00:24:34.620" style="s2">this idea that when that people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.880" end="00:24:37.320" style="s2">acting in bad faith and when you go to</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.620" end="00:24:39.480" style="s2">have a conversation with them it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.320" end="00:24:42.720" style="s2">meant as some kind of a trap to</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.480" end="00:24:44.880" style="s2">humiliate you as opposed to really get</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.720" end="00:24:50.220" style="s2">to the root of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.880" end="00:24:51.750" style="s2">I don&#39;t really know on a large scale via</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.220" end="00:24:54.630" style="s2">social media I don&#39;t really know what to</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.750" end="00:24:58.380" style="s2">do about that and what would you say</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.630" end="00:25:00.180" style="s2">what was your kind of journey to</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.380" end="00:25:02.880" style="s2">becoming concerned about this or</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.180" end="00:25:05.760" style="s2">becoming really aware of this but I went</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.880" end="00:25:08.700" style="s2">back to university quite late and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.760" end="00:25:11.070" style="s2">studied English literature and we</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.700" end="00:25:13.410" style="s2">learned post-modernism and I immediately</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.070" end="00:25:16.470" style="s2">had a lot of disagreements with that my</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.410" end="00:25:20.580" style="s2">my tutors to their credit were very</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.470" end="00:25:22.950" style="s2">patient with my disagreements but I I</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.580" end="00:25:26.910" style="s2">found it increasingly difficult to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.950" end="00:25:30.300" style="s2">anything that didn&#39;t use theory so we</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.910" end="00:25:32.640" style="s2">were taught ways of reading and so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.300" end="00:25:35.670" style="s2">can read a text through a post-colonial</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.640" end="00:25:37.470" style="s2">lens or through a feminist lens and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.670" end="00:25:39.270" style="s2">idea is confirmation bias pick out the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.470" end="00:25:41.160" style="s2">bits of the text that fit your narrative</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.270" end="00:25:43.200" style="s2">make it work and this this is a good</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.160" end="00:25:46.410" style="s2">thing so I was quite concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.200" end="00:25:48.540" style="s2">that then at postgraduate I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.410" end="00:25:49.980" style="s2">reassured that one of my professors said</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.540" end="00:25:53.160" style="s2">to me we&#39;re not doing post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.980" end="00:25:55.220" style="s2">it&#39;s silly however when I then attempted</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.160" end="00:25:58.380" style="s2">to write an essay about the benefits of</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.220" end="00:26:01.920" style="s2">evolutionary psychological literary</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.380" end="00:26:04.490" style="s2">analysis I by doing a reading of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.920" end="00:26:08.460" style="s2">fellow I was told that I was very</p>

<p begin="00:26:16.230" end="00:26:21.370" style="s2">goals was actually very problematic to a</p>

<p begin="00:26:21.370" end="00:26:27.760" style="s2">talking about 1601 in England but these</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.930" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">ideas they they couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:32.800" style="s2">they weren&#39;t allowed so I got the lowest</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:34.809" style="s2">grade I&#39;d ever got with anything that</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.800" end="00:26:38.260" style="s2">was made clear to me that if I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.809" end="00:26:40.720" style="s2">bring science the biology into things</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.260" end="00:26:42.670" style="s2">that autumn I didn&#39;t instead use the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.720" end="00:26:47.770" style="s2">approved types of theories that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.670" end="00:26:50.830" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get a masters and who who are</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.770" end="00:26:54.070" style="s2">the sort of central thinkers and central</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.830" end="00:26:56.050" style="s2">ideas of post-modernism I mean a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.070" end="00:26:57.670" style="s2">people probably aware of it through</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.050" end="00:26:59.650" style="s2">Jordan Peterson kind of talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.670" end="00:27:02.920" style="s2">a lot and he mentions Foucault and</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.650" end="00:27:04.750" style="s2">Derrida a lot but but I think you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.920" end="00:27:08.140" style="s2">include a few thinkers who&#39;ve come after</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.750" end="00:27:10.540" style="s2">them will you yeah we see the three</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.140" end="00:27:13.420" style="s2">waves of it so at the beginning yet</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.540" end="00:27:17.020" style="s2">there was Beaudry of light our Foucault</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.420" end="00:27:19.030" style="s2">Derrida and and several others and they</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.020" end="00:27:21.010" style="s2">they came from different places but they</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.030" end="00:27:23.679" style="s2">had the same kind of ideas about power</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.010" end="00:27:26.230" style="s2">knowledge and language then in the late</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.679" end="00:27:27.970" style="s2">80s there was a second wave of this</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.230" end="00:27:30.400" style="s2">because the first lot they were fairly</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.970" end="00:27:31.750" style="s2">aimless they were despairing they wanted</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.400" end="00:27:32.830" style="s2">to pull things apart they didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.750" end="00:27:38.130" style="s2">any plans to put them back together</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.830" end="00:27:40.740" style="s2">again so in around 1989 1990 we had</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.130" end="00:27:43.780" style="s2">Judith Butler we had kimberlé crenshaw</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.740" end="00:27:47.410" style="s2">we see him post-colonialism Gayatri</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.780" end="00:27:48.970" style="s2">Spivak and homi Bhabha and people these</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.410" end="00:27:52.360" style="s2">kind of theorists who are suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.970" end="00:27:55.720" style="s2">putting post modern ideas post</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.360" end="00:27:59.080" style="s2">structuralist ideas specifically into a</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.720" end="00:28:01.330" style="s2">kind of activism so kimberlé crenshaw</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.080" end="00:28:04.210" style="s2">is the best for this because she was so</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.330" end="00:28:08.010" style="s2">explicit about it in her foundational</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.210" end="00:28:10.470" style="s2">text for intersectionality she</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.010" end="00:28:12.880" style="s2">essentially what she described it as</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.470" end="00:28:16.120" style="s2">contemporary politics linked to</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.880" end="00:28:17.980" style="s2">postmodern theory and she said that what</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.120" end="00:28:19.600" style="s2">was good about post-modernism was seeing</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.980" end="00:28:21.850" style="s2">everything as a cultural construct and a</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.600" end="00:28:25.540" style="s2">construct of power but we can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.850" end="00:28:27.370" style="s2">everything being constructed some things</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.540" end="00:28:28.850" style="s2">have to be real some things have to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.370" end="00:28:31.130" style="s2">objectively true if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.850" end="00:28:33.200" style="s2">anything so - this next wave of</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.130" end="00:28:35.840" style="s2">theorists there were still the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.200" end="00:28:38.810" style="s2">constructivism but the systems of power</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.840" end="00:28:41.240" style="s2">and privilege were objectively true so</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.810" end="00:28:44.870" style="s2">this has now made a way in which people</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.240" end="00:28:47.000" style="s2">can can do activism can do scholarship</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.870" end="00:28:48.380" style="s2">they assume that it is always there</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.000" end="00:28:50.300" style="s2">there is always a power imbalance</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.380" end="00:28:52.970" style="s2">between people with different identities</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.300" end="00:28:55.100" style="s2">and the idea is to get at it look at it</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.970" end="00:28:56.930" style="s2">and pull it apart and that works in</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.100" end="00:29:00.740" style="s2">different ways in the different fields</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.930" end="00:29:04.250" style="s2">and then at around 2010 we&#39;ve seen a</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.740" end="00:29:07.160" style="s2">further solidification of this and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.250" end="00:29:08.330" style="s2">got much more it&#39;s got clearer we</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.160" end="00:29:11.750" style="s2">haven&#39;t got that sort of obscure</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.330" end="00:29:13.850" style="s2">language and much more assertive and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.750" end="00:29:16.730" style="s2">we see in the work of people like</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.850" end="00:29:19.400" style="s2">Barbara Applebaum and Alison Bailey and</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.730" end="00:29:22.040" style="s2">Robyn D&#39;Angelo there is just an</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.400" end="00:29:24.620" style="s2">assertion this is how it is you are</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.040" end="00:29:26.810" style="s2">white you are racist you can&#39;t help but</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.620" end="00:29:28.640" style="s2">be racist you know this is absolute</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.810" end="00:29:30.290" style="s2">certainty which wouldn&#39;t have come with</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.640" end="00:29:32.540" style="s2">the original postmodernist they were</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.290" end="00:29:34.160" style="s2">radically skeptical and uncertain of</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.540" end="00:29:37.490" style="s2">everything so it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.160" end="00:29:39.830" style="s2">solidification of post-modernism I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.490" end="00:29:41.900" style="s2">hearing some echoes of what Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.830" end="00:29:43.700" style="s2">Pederson says about post-modernism which</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.900" end="00:29:46.040" style="s2">is that postmodern limited it</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.700" end="00:29:47.960" style="s2">post-modernism itself doesn&#39;t give you a</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.040" end="00:29:50.090" style="s2">value system so what they&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.960" end="00:29:53.150" style="s2">smuggling in Marxism and he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.090" end="00:29:56.810" style="s2">neo Marxism and post-modernism being or</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.150" end="00:29:59.720" style="s2">post-modernism being a new disguise for</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.810" end="00:30:02.240" style="s2">for neo Marxism do you agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.720" end="00:30:06.020" style="s2">or do you disagree I disagree with that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.240" end="00:30:08.390" style="s2">you won&#39;t find any economic or class</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.020" end="00:30:10.070" style="s2">analysis in the kind of thing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.390" end="00:30:12.650" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing at the moment and that that</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.070" end="00:30:17.150" style="s2">really is at the bottom of of Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.650" end="00:30:20.450" style="s2">rather than smuggling anything else in</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.150" end="00:30:24.580" style="s2">what has happened is that ideas have</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.450" end="00:30:28.220" style="s2">solidified so it has become more</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.580" end="00:30:30.620" style="s2">totalitarian but it isn&#39;t it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.220" end="00:30:33.200" style="s2">not hiding anything else that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.620" end="00:30:35.600" style="s2">Marxists and socialist materialist</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:37.370" style="s2">scholars are really not very happy with</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.600" end="00:30:40.539" style="s2">the post modernists at all and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.370" end="00:30:41.979" style="s2">constant battle going on between it</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.539" end="00:30:44.589" style="s2">the two of them because the one the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.979" end="00:30:46.570" style="s2">Marxists they want to look at economics</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.589" end="00:30:49.659" style="s2">they want to look at class they want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.570" end="00:30:51.789" style="s2">look at law and solid things in society</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.659" end="00:30:54.159" style="s2">material reality and society of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.789" end="00:30:58.119" style="s2">affecting people and to them all of this</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.159" end="00:31:01.149" style="s2">focus on race sexuality and gender is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.119" end="00:31:02.169" style="s2">bourgeois attempt to remove the issues</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.149" end="00:31:04.269" style="s2">from the working class</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.169" end="00:31:06.519" style="s2">take them into the universities and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.269" end="00:31:08.499" style="s2">squabble about higher earning people and</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.519" end="00:31:11.139" style="s2">who&#39;s doing better than than each other</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.499" end="00:31:14.349" style="s2">so the Marxists really are not fans of</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.139" end="00:31:17.489" style="s2">post modernists but the other way round</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.349" end="00:31:22.089" style="s2">the post modernists will occasionally</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.489" end="00:31:24.969" style="s2">cite Marxists or give credit to Marxists</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.089" end="00:31:27.129" style="s2">because anti capitalism is one of their</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.969" end="00:31:28.809" style="s2">their aims but it&#39;s not a dominant one</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.129" end="00:31:31.449" style="s2">there isn&#39;t much support for</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.809" end="00:31:33.849" style="s2">working-class white men because I</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.449" end="00:31:37.119" style="s2">because I would argue I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.849" end="00:31:38.649" style="s2">interested in this as well that what joy</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.119" end="00:31:40.179" style="s2">and I wonder whether this is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.649" end="00:31:42.129" style="s2">terminology things I think what Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.179" end="00:31:45.279" style="s2">Peterson here I&#39;m talking about is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.129" end="00:31:46.959" style="s2">idea of equity the idea of collectivism</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.279" end="00:31:50.319" style="s2">and I wonder whether there might be a</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.959" end="00:31:51.849" style="s2">common that is not the neo-marxist um is</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.319" end="00:31:54.489" style="s2">in forming post-modernism but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.849" end="00:31:56.919" style="s2">some sort of common ancestor or some</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.489" end="00:32:04.389" style="s2">common habit of thought which wants</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.919" end="00:32:06.069" style="s2">equity which once - yeah so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.389" end="00:32:07.569" style="s2">that there is actually Marxism it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.069" end="00:32:10.179" style="s2">there may be some common ancestor or a</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.569" end="00:32:11.769" style="s2">common way of thinking well I think I</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.179" end="00:32:14.079" style="s2">think there is in philosophical terms</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.769" end="00:32:15.789" style="s2">which which I don&#39;t get into because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.079" end="00:32:20.069" style="s2">not that one informed on it but there</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.789" end="00:32:22.959" style="s2">certainly Hegel in there with his whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.069" end="00:32:24.639" style="s2">sort of slave master things so that that</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.959" end="00:32:28.269" style="s2">underlies both of whom that could be a</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.639" end="00:32:30.959" style="s2">common ancestor we have got the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.269" end="00:32:34.690" style="s2">oppressed and oppressor classes and</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.959" end="00:32:36.789" style="s2">about power structures so it isn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.690" end="00:32:38.319" style="s2">think that the first post modernists</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.789" end="00:32:40.719" style="s2">were disillusions</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.319" end="00:32:43.239" style="s2">Marxists but it has gone in a completely</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.719" end="00:32:45.489" style="s2">different direction with different</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.239" end="00:32:47.919" style="s2">methods different ways they&#39;re obtaining</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.489" end="00:32:50.229" style="s2">knowledge and so I think it is less</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.919" end="00:32:51.400" style="s2">useful to point out the common</p>

<p begin="00:32:51.400" end="00:32:55.180" style="s2">as to point out the differences because</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.170" end="00:32:57.730" style="s2">if you try arguing with a postmodernist</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.180" end="00:32:59.740" style="s2">on Marxists grounds they&#39;re just going</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.730" end="00:33:03.220" style="s2">to agree with you they don&#39;t they don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:33:03.220" end="00:33:06.990" style="s2">really is quite important and it&#39;s not</p>
