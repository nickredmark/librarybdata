<p begin="00:01:33.009" end="00:01:38.380" style="s2">book is really really excellent because</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.649" end="00:01:41.950" style="s2">what it does is it goes through a number</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.380" end="00:01:44.950" style="s2">of key intellectual or analytic points</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.950" end="00:01:48.100" style="s2">about how to understand what social</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.950" end="00:01:50.560" style="s2">networks are how the the mathematics of</p>

<p begin="00:01:53.770" end="00:01:57.340" style="s2">arrangements for how those connections</p>

<p begin="00:02:09.340" end="00:02:15.000" style="s2">widespread in relevant at a particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.580" end="00:02:16.980" style="s2">in time and so this book goes into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.000" end="00:02:19.830" style="s2">different analytic techniques the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.980" end="00:02:21.390" style="s2">different social theory or social</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.830" end="00:02:23.910" style="s2">science kinds of interpretations of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.390" end="00:02:26.550" style="s2">different events and it also explores</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.910" end="00:02:29.190" style="s2">the very important notion that what</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.550" end="00:02:31.500" style="s2">becomes viral is a great measure of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.190" end="00:02:34.890" style="s2">is important and so now that we have so</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.500" end="00:02:36.360" style="s2">much data about what is being spread on</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.890" end="00:02:39.780" style="s2">the internet because it&#39;s digital</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.360" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">information we&#39;re able to track cultural</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.780" end="00:02:44.490" style="s2">change and see what&#39;s important day to</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:47.250" style="s2">day month to month and year to year and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.490" end="00:02:51.000" style="s2">so there&#39;s a call for creating archives</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.250" end="00:02:53.160" style="s2">of viral content to understand what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.000" end="00:02:55.380" style="s2">important and relevant to people at</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.160" end="00:02:57.450" style="s2">particular points in time so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.380" end="00:02:58.980" style="s2">book that I recommend for anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.450" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">wants to understand the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.980" end="00:03:02.940" style="s2">social change in today&#39;s rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:05.730" style="s2">changing world if they want to know how</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.940" end="00:03:07.920" style="s2">to spread messages or run successful</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.730" end="00:03:10.260" style="s2">campaigns to try to influence public</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.920" end="00:03:13.950" style="s2">discourse and of course as researchers</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.260" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">to understand the inherent dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.950" end="00:03:18.540" style="s2">sharing behavior and the politics and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:21.209" style="s2">power arrangements of that sharing</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.540" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">behavior in culture as it is changing in</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.209" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">time so that&#39;s the book going viral I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:29.160" style="s2">highly recommend it as a great companion</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:31.230" style="s2">to any attempt to understand changing</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.160" end="00:03:33.600" style="s2">patterns and culture so that&#39;s it I hope</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.230" end="00:03:35.720" style="s2">you enjoy and um let me know what you</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.600" end="00:03:35.720" style="s2">think</p>
