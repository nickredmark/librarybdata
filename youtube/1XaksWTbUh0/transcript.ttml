<p begin="00:15:47.040" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.079" end="00:15:53.360" style="s2">and it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.759" end="00:15:59.040" style="s2">it&#39;s exciting to be here uh because i</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.399" end="00:16:02.800" style="s2">agree with the work of arthur bush lewis</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.040" end="00:16:05.440" style="s2">um that neoplatonism is the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.800" end="00:16:06.160" style="s2">cultural grammar of the spirituality of</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.440" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">the west</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.160" end="00:16:12.959" style="s2">the west very broadly considered</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:14.000" style="s2">i&#39;m including islam within that the sufi</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.959" end="00:16:17.120" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.000" end="00:16:18.639" style="s2">is definitely deeply informed and</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.120" end="00:16:21.360" style="s2">empowered</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.639" end="00:16:22.160" style="s2">by the neoplatonic tradition</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.360" end="00:16:25.120" style="s2">christianity</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.160" end="00:16:26.800" style="s2">especially the mystical uh trans within</p>

<p begin="00:16:26.800" end="00:16:30.000" style="s2">eastern orthodox christianity deeply</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.600" end="00:16:32.880" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.000" end="00:16:34.399" style="s2">informed transformed and powered by</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.880" end="00:16:36.959" style="s2">neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.399" end="00:16:37.680" style="s2">the mystical traditions within judaism</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.959" end="00:16:40.480" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.680" end="00:16:41.759" style="s2">kabbalah being one example also deeply</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.480" end="00:16:44.079" style="s2">deeply informed</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.759" end="00:16:51.839" style="s2">uh by neoplatonism i&#39;m gonna just get a</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.079" end="00:16:51.839" style="s2">couple of books i&#39;m off camera for a sec</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.199" end="00:16:58.639" style="s2">so just a reminder of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.480" end="00:16:59.839" style="s2">texts we can we&#39;re using of course the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.639" end="00:17:02.240" style="s2">primary one</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.839" end="00:17:03.759" style="s2">we&#39;re going through absolutely mandatory</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.240" end="00:17:05.760" style="s2">is mcclellan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.759" end="00:17:06.799" style="s2">the wisdom of hypatia we&#39;re now moving</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.760" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.799" end="00:17:11.839" style="s2">what he calls the the grove what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.079" end="00:17:13.360" style="s2">calling university we&#39;ve done primary</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.839" end="00:17:15.039" style="s2">school with epicureanism</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.360" end="00:17:16.559" style="s2">high school with stoicism and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.039" end="00:17:18.640" style="s2">into the university</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.559" end="00:17:20.240" style="s2">i mentioned arthur versus lewis i highly</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.640" end="00:17:21.679" style="s2">recommend this little gem of a book</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.240" end="00:17:23.439" style="s2">perennial philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.679" end="00:17:24.880" style="s2">in which he makes the argument that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.439" end="00:17:26.720" style="s2">just made to you</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.880" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">amongst many other books you can he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.720" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">very prolific and very scholastic</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.280" end="00:17:35.120" style="s2">um i recommend this book um</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:36.799" style="s2">for you know a very good very good</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.120" end="00:17:38.960" style="s2">introduction to neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.799" end="00:17:41.120" style="s2">within the context of the argument on</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.960" end="00:17:44.559" style="s2">how it is the cultural cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.120" end="00:17:44.559" style="s2">of the spirituality of the west</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.720" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">another a couple of really good academic</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.120" end="00:17:50.080" style="s2">books</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:51.039" style="s2">this won&#39;t mean much to you now uh but</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.080" end="00:17:52.880" style="s2">this is probably</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.039" end="00:17:54.960" style="s2">the one of the most important books it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.880" end="00:17:57.120" style="s2">called theorgia and the soul by gregory</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.960" end="00:17:59.600" style="s2">shaw this is an academic book</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.120" end="00:18:01.679" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not a practical book</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.600" end="00:18:03.039" style="s2">but it helps to explain theorgia or</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.679" end="00:18:05.280" style="s2">what&#39;s called theorgy</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.039" end="00:18:07.039" style="s2">and that needs a lot of explanation i</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.280" end="00:18:09.360" style="s2">would complement that book</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.039" end="00:18:10.640" style="s2">obviously mcclellan has practices around</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:13.200" style="s2">their ja</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.640" end="00:18:14.160" style="s2">kupperman&#39;s book i don&#39;t agree with any</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.200" end="00:18:16.799" style="s2">everything in</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.160" end="00:18:17.679" style="s2">both uh mcclellan and kepperman but</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.799" end="00:18:21.039" style="s2">nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.679" end="00:18:24.400" style="s2">these are two great books um on</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.039" end="00:18:27.840" style="s2">the neoplatonic practice of theater</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.400" end="00:18:29.360" style="s2">one more academic book i would recommend</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.840" end="00:18:30.880" style="s2">don&#39;t be put off by the title it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.360" end="00:18:32.880" style="s2">very good academic book</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.880" end="00:18:34.240" style="s2">divination and human nature a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.880" end="00:18:37.200" style="s2">history of intuition</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.240" end="00:18:38.799" style="s2">and classical antiquity so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.200" end="00:18:40.720" style="s2">practices that within our time have</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.799" end="00:18:43.039" style="s2">degenerated into psychic</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.720" end="00:18:44.080" style="s2">and magical practices they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.039" end="00:18:46.320" style="s2">really understood</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.080" end="00:18:48.320" style="s2">uh it&#39;s not proper to understand them</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.320" end="00:18:52.320" style="s2">the way we understand them now</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.320" end="00:18:53.760" style="s2">as for example strzok argues um</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.320" end="00:18:55.440" style="s2">and other people have argued we should</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.760" end="00:18:56.400" style="s2">look at a lot of these theorgic</p>

<p begin="00:18:56.400" end="00:19:00.000" style="s2">instead of ways of cultivating a</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.720" end="00:19:03.520" style="s2">profound insight</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.000" end="00:19:05.760" style="s2">or profound intuition implicit learning</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.520" end="00:19:06.960" style="s2">and aspiration and so i&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.760" end="00:19:08.559" style="s2">all of those things from a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.960" end="00:19:09.520" style="s2">scientific perspective</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.559" end="00:19:11.760" style="s2">rather than any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.520" end="00:19:12.559" style="s2">supernaturalistic perspective which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.760" end="00:19:15.919" style="s2">exactly what this</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.559" end="00:19:17.919" style="s2">this book is about so that of course is</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.919" end="00:19:21.440" style="s2">part of the challenge we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.919" end="00:19:23.039" style="s2">um i love neoplatonism i i consider</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.440" end="00:19:24.559" style="s2">myself a neoplatonist</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.039" end="00:19:27.600" style="s2">more than any other label that you might</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.559" end="00:19:31.280" style="s2">apply to me including buddhist or taoist</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.600" end="00:19:35.520" style="s2">and what i want to say about that</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.280" end="00:19:37.760" style="s2">is because i love it so deeply</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.520" end="00:19:39.039" style="s2">and respect it so profoundly i&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.760" end="00:19:41.840" style="s2">aware</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.039" end="00:19:41.840" style="s2">i think perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.559" end="00:19:46.000" style="s2">i&#39;m also aware because not perhaps i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.960" end="00:19:49.360" style="s2">aware because</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.000" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">of that of its dangers and its defects</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.360" end="00:19:53.760" style="s2">and i&#39;m not recommending that we should</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:56.880" style="s2">go back</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.760" end="00:20:00.000" style="s2">to uh ancient forms of neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.880" end="00:20:02.080" style="s2">i do think we should take a look at uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.000" end="00:20:03.280" style="s2">their surviving living traditions of</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.080" end="00:20:05.039" style="s2">neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.280" end="00:20:06.400" style="s2">uh with especially within eastern</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.039" end="00:20:08.000" style="s2">orthodox christianity that&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.400" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">that&#39;s often closest to us</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.000" end="00:20:11.600" style="s2">but those of you who are from a muslim</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2">background sufism</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.600" end="00:20:17.840" style="s2">etc and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:19.280" style="s2">what i&#39;m proposing instead is what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.840" end="00:20:22.880" style="s2">done before which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.280" end="00:20:24.799" style="s2">can we exact from ancient neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.880" end="00:20:26.240" style="s2">a set of practices that we can weave</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.799" end="00:20:29.120" style="s2">into uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.240" end="00:20:30.720" style="s2">the practices the ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.120" end="00:20:31.440" style="s2">that have emerged out of our studies</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.720" end="00:20:34.720" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.440" end="00:20:37.280" style="s2">of epicureanism and stoicism such that</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.720" end="00:20:39.360" style="s2">we get something viable and vital for us</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.280" end="00:20:41.120" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.360" end="00:20:43.200" style="s2">all right so today what i want to do is</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.120" end="00:20:44.960" style="s2">i want to give you a bit of a background</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.200" end="00:20:48.240" style="s2">this will complement the background of</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.960" end="00:20:49.600" style="s2">mclennan about what neoplatonism is</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.240" end="00:20:51.600" style="s2">nobody in the ancient world called</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.600" end="00:20:54.000" style="s2">themselves a neoplatonous this is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.600" end="00:20:55.760" style="s2">this is a modern scholastic term</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.000" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">everybody in this tradition considered</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.760" end="00:20:58.640" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:21:00.640" style="s2">a follower of plato we call it</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.640" end="00:21:02.799" style="s2">neoplatonism because</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:05.039" style="s2">the neoplatonists while they saw</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.799" end="00:21:07.039" style="s2">themselves as continuous with plato</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.039" end="00:21:08.799" style="s2">actually were tremendously innovative</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.039" end="00:21:11.919" style="s2">and i would say in a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.799" end="00:21:13.280" style="s2">uh beneficial way um so what i want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.919" end="00:21:14.960" style="s2">do is show you</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.280" end="00:21:16.559" style="s2">how they&#39;re kind of like the grand</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.960" end="00:21:18.480" style="s2">unified field theory</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.559" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">of western spirituality and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.480" end="00:21:21.760" style="s2">cultivation they basically are the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:24.240" style="s2">summative</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.760" end="00:21:26.000" style="s2">integrative theory and ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.240" end="00:21:28.720" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.000" end="00:21:29.679" style="s2">for western spirituality so what i want</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.720" end="00:21:31.760" style="s2">to do is show you</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.679" end="00:21:33.280" style="s2">how they drew from some though some of</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.760" end="00:21:35.520" style="s2">the most important sources</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.280" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">uh obviously from plato that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.520" end="00:21:39.919" style="s2">be a primary source</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.880" end="00:21:42.000" style="s2">but from aristotle and uh from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.919" end="00:21:43.520" style="s2">stoics as well</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.000" end="00:21:45.120" style="s2">if i had a little bit more time i talked</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.520" end="00:21:47.760" style="s2">about some of the influence of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.120" end="00:21:49.600" style="s2">skeptics but i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.760" end="00:21:51.280" style="s2">that will come out when i do the series</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.600" end="00:21:54.480" style="s2">after socrates so what did they get</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.280" end="00:21:58.400" style="s2">from plato okay well obviously plato</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.480" end="00:22:00.280" style="s2">is where we get the um</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.400" end="00:22:02.320" style="s2">more than just the portrayal we get the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.280" end="00:22:03.840" style="s2">exemplification of socrates in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.320" end="00:22:04.799" style="s2">platonic dialogues we get to see</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.840" end="00:22:06.960" style="s2">socrates</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.799" end="00:22:07.919" style="s2">practicing dialectic engendering</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.960" end="00:22:10.480" style="s2">dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.919" end="00:22:11.120" style="s2">trying to afford radical transformation</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.480" end="00:22:13.440" style="s2">and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.120" end="00:22:14.320" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen how all of these traditions</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.440" end="00:22:16.000" style="s2">as we&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.320" end="00:22:18.559" style="s2">socrates is to the western traditions</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.000" end="00:22:22.159" style="s2">what sidhartha is to buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.559" end="00:22:23.280" style="s2">right that the epicureans the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.159" end="00:22:25.679" style="s2">even more so the stoics were</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.280" end="00:22:26.159" style="s2">internalizing socrates and plato it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.679" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">taken</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.159" end="00:22:29.600" style="s2">up now the interesting thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.840" end="00:22:31.520" style="s2">neoplatonus is unlike the stoics who</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.600" end="00:22:34.480" style="s2">tend to emphasize socrates more</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.520" end="00:22:36.080" style="s2">the neoplatonus as their name declares</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.480" end="00:22:39.120" style="s2">uh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.080" end="00:22:40.000" style="s2">are much more focused on plato so what</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:44.240" style="s2">what are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.000" end="00:22:45.760" style="s2">ideas they got from plato</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.240" end="00:22:47.600" style="s2">well one of the most important and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.760" end="00:22:50.480" style="s2">already using it to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.600" end="00:22:52.720" style="s2">in uh the practice we did last week of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.480" end="00:22:55.440" style="s2">invoking the logos</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.720" end="00:22:57.120" style="s2">plato gate created the first um psyche</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.440" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">logos tsuke logos</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.120" end="00:23:01.840" style="s2">the first psy psychological theory right</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:06.840" style="s2">tsuki logos</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.840" end="00:23:09.600" style="s2">the first right logos of the suitcase</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.840" end="00:23:11.600" style="s2">psychology uh right psychological theory</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.600" end="00:23:13.760" style="s2">in history and he used it in order to</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.600" end="00:23:15.360" style="s2">try and explain</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.760" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">he was trying to figure out why people</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.360" end="00:23:18.400" style="s2">fell into self-deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.960" end="00:23:20.080" style="s2">self-destructive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.400" end="00:23:22.559" style="s2">now the reason why i&#39;m invoking this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.080" end="00:23:23.120" style="s2">that this insight of plato has proved to</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.559" end="00:23:25.200" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.120" end="00:23:26.559" style="s2">such a profound insight we keep</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.200" end="00:23:28.320" style="s2">rediscovering it</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.559" end="00:23:29.840" style="s2">in the west within within western</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.320" end="00:23:30.880" style="s2">psychology i&#39;ll give you a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.840" end="00:23:33.039" style="s2">answers when i</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.880" end="00:23:35.120" style="s2">sorry examples once i explain it to you</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.039" end="00:23:38.240" style="s2">so what plato was interested in is well</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.120" end="00:23:39.760" style="s2">why do we fall into self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.240" end="00:23:41.440" style="s2">so what&#39;s the basic idea that he got</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.760" end="00:23:42.320" style="s2">from socrates we fall into</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.440" end="00:23:45.200" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.320" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">when the salience and the intensity of</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.200" end="00:23:47.600" style="s2">something and we&#39;ve seen this all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:49.360" style="s2">way through this tradition</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.600" end="00:23:51.360" style="s2">when the salience and the intensity of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.360" end="00:23:54.559" style="s2">something is uncoupled from</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.360" end="00:23:57.200" style="s2">the truth and our understanding of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.559" end="00:23:58.400" style="s2">now when it&#39;s uncoupled and we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.200" end="00:24:01.520" style="s2">state of wonder</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.400" end="00:24:02.880" style="s2">and the salience of the intensity is</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.520" end="00:24:03.279" style="s2">beyond our current understanding but</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.880" end="00:24:06.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.279" end="00:24:08.799" style="s2">motivates us to question and to wonder</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.720" end="00:24:10.799" style="s2">well that&#39;s right to to seek more</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.799" end="00:24:13.120" style="s2">understanding and that&#39;s socrates</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.799" end="00:24:14.240" style="s2">because wisdom begins in such wonder but</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.120" end="00:24:15.760" style="s2">the opposite of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.240" end="00:24:17.520" style="s2">is something like what harry frankford</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:20.000" style="s2">calls the phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.520" end="00:24:21.440" style="s2">where the salience and the intensity is</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.000" end="00:24:23.679" style="s2">uncoupled from</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.440" end="00:24:24.480" style="s2">our concern for truth and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.679" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">such that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.480" end="00:24:28.080" style="s2">don&#39;t question we don&#39;t want we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:31.440" style="s2">wonder</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.080" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">we have a pretentious certainty and we</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.440" end="00:24:35.840" style="s2">run headlong</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.480" end="00:24:36.320" style="s2">into and we jump to conclusions and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.840" end="00:24:38.320" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.320" end="00:24:40.480" style="s2">the primary way in which we fall into</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.320" end="00:24:41.520" style="s2">self-deception now plato took that idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.480" end="00:24:43.360" style="s2">but he wanted to understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.520" end="00:24:45.039" style="s2">well how do how does how does the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.360" end="00:24:47.279" style="s2">salience and the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.039" end="00:24:48.480" style="s2">becomes so unglued and he looked at</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.279" end="00:24:49.919" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.480" end="00:24:51.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a very powerful experience for all</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.919" end="00:24:52.880" style="s2">of us and one we encounter in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.679" end="00:24:56.400" style="s2">spiritual pathway</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.880" end="00:24:56.400" style="s2">he looked at inner conflict</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.120" end="00:25:00.559" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of current cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.880" end="00:25:02.240" style="s2">science that backs up the model i&#39;m now</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.559" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">going to talk to you about</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.240" end="00:25:06.799" style="s2">he noticed that let&#39;s say um you i want</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:09.200" style="s2">to lose weight</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.799" end="00:25:10.799" style="s2">right so i want to lose weight and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.200" end="00:25:14.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a part of me</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.799" end="00:25:17.520" style="s2">that knows right and he called this his</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.480" end="00:25:18.960" style="s2">reason he sort of put it and he plato</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.520" end="00:25:20.640" style="s2">was uh for his time one of the least</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.960" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">sexist thinkers he recommended that</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.640" end="00:25:22.880" style="s2">women could also rule also be in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:24.640" style="s2">army</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.880" end="00:25:26.080" style="s2">but right he&#39;s still in the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.640" end="00:25:26.640" style="s2">world athens is a horrible place for</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.080" end="00:25:28.720" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.640" end="00:25:29.760" style="s2">in athens but he represented this with a</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.720" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2">man in</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.760" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">in your head and what what this this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:36.880" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:40.400" style="s2">part of you that can grasp</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.880" end="00:25:40.400" style="s2">long-term goals</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.799" end="00:25:47.039" style="s2">it can right it&#39;s capable of abstract</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.720" end="00:25:48.320" style="s2">thought in that sense that&#39;s things that</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.039" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">are currently present</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.320" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">it allows you to grab abstract goals it</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:54.000" style="s2">allows you to see the abstract or</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.320" end="00:25:57.120" style="s2">invisible properties of things</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.000" end="00:25:59.039" style="s2">so i&#39;m right i i i want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.120" end="00:26:01.200" style="s2">improve my health that&#39;s a very abstract</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.039" end="00:26:04.720" style="s2">phenomenon it&#39;s long-term</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.200" end="00:26:08.400" style="s2">and i&#39;m motivated by you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:09.760" style="s2">the truth of things that seems to what</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.400" end="00:26:11.200" style="s2">happens is i come home and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.760" end="00:26:15.360" style="s2">chocolate cake on the counter and</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.200" end="00:26:17.279" style="s2">ah i want the chocolate cake it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.360" end="00:26:20.080" style="s2">super salient and he said this is like a</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.279" end="00:26:23.600" style="s2">monster on us</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.080" end="00:26:24.000" style="s2">and sorry um yeah i want to keep it</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.600" end="00:26:26.320" style="s2">parallel</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.000" end="00:26:28.880" style="s2">structure for you guys uh there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.320" end="00:26:28.880" style="s2">monster</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.960" end="00:26:35.360" style="s2">and then he called this part you the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.679" end="00:26:35.360" style="s2">part of you that&#39;s your appetites</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.600" end="00:26:41.840" style="s2">and that means sexual food everything</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.679" end="00:26:43.440" style="s2">and he put this sort of in your stomach</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.840" end="00:26:47.120" style="s2">and your genitalia</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.440" end="00:26:48.720" style="s2">all right so this doesn&#39;t grasp</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.120" end="00:26:51.440" style="s2">long-term goals</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.720" end="00:26:52.400" style="s2">it&#39;s about what&#39;s happening right here</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.440" end="00:26:55.360" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.400" end="00:26:56.159" style="s2">it&#39;s urgent it&#39;s superficial it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.360" end="00:26:58.000" style="s2">salient</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.159" end="00:27:01.200" style="s2">it&#39;s intense and it works in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.000" end="00:27:04.559" style="s2">pleasure and pain</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.200" end="00:27:07.679" style="s2">okay so in contrast short term</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.559" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">superficial works in terms of pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.679" end="00:27:14.000" style="s2">and then in between right there is</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:16.000" style="s2">i&#39;m going to erase this now although</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.000" end="00:27:19.440" style="s2">i&#39;ll keep doing this parallel structure</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.000" end="00:27:21.120" style="s2">just in between was</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.440" end="00:27:22.559" style="s2">the fact that we&#39;re social cultural</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.120" end="00:27:23.919" style="s2">beings</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.559" end="00:27:25.919" style="s2">i&#39;m going to use the greek word here</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.919" end="00:27:29.120" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.919" end="00:27:30.799" style="s2">a good english word for this</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.120" end="00:27:32.320" style="s2">we do not have a good english word for</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.799" end="00:27:35.760" style="s2">this so</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.320" end="00:27:36.320" style="s2">the greek word is thymos it&#39;s in your</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.760" end="00:27:38.000" style="s2">chest</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.320" end="00:27:39.440" style="s2">so think of where you feel all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.000" end="00:27:42.559" style="s2">social emotions</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.440" end="00:27:45.200" style="s2">where you feel pride and honor and</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.559" end="00:27:46.159" style="s2">notice what my hands are doing expansion</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.200" end="00:27:49.520" style="s2">or guilt</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.159" end="00:27:52.640" style="s2">and shame the contraction right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.520" end="00:27:54.480" style="s2">that movement that&#39;s the thymus and he</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.640" end="00:27:56.720" style="s2">said this is like a lion</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.480" end="00:27:57.679" style="s2">and as you may have expected it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.720" end="00:28:00.080" style="s2">your chest</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.679" end="00:28:02.240" style="s2">so this doesn&#39;t work in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.080" end="00:28:05.120" style="s2">pleasure and pain or truth and falsity</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.240" end="00:28:05.840" style="s2">works in terms of honor and shame pride</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.120" end="00:28:09.440" style="s2">and guilt</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.840" end="00:28:13.679" style="s2">this is the socio-cultural aspect of you</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.440" end="00:28:16.159" style="s2">and so this is the part of you</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.679" end="00:28:18.000" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t work in terms of ab</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.159" end="00:28:21.600" style="s2">completely abstract</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.000" end="00:28:24.960" style="s2">uh long-term goals but it&#39;s not just at</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.600" end="00:28:27.840" style="s2">right the the urgent bidding of</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.960" end="00:28:28.559" style="s2">the current stimulus instead it has to</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.840" end="00:28:31.600" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.559" end="00:28:34.159" style="s2">with your connectedness to other people</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:36.080" style="s2">and your connectedness to other people</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.159" end="00:28:37.360" style="s2">now i put it this way you could put this</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.080" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">on top uh because</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.360" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">maybe it has to do with morality</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.200" end="00:28:44.960" style="s2">the ordering is just to so it lines up</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.000" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">like with</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.960" end="00:28:52.000" style="s2">with you as an enacted symbol of this</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:56.240" style="s2">and here&#39;s the idea right</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.000" end="00:28:58.159" style="s2">the man can actually learn</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.240" end="00:28:59.679" style="s2">it&#39;s capable of forming theories and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.159" end="00:29:01.760" style="s2">explanations</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.679" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">the lion isn&#39;t really capable of</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.760" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">learning but the lion can be trained</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.159" end="00:29:12.399" style="s2">so the man can learn the theory</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.840" end="00:29:13.039" style="s2">sorry for the sexist language and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.399" end="00:29:16.399" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.039" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">can be learned to use to train the lion</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.399" end="00:29:19.919" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing by the way and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:22.480" style="s2">notice</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.919" end="00:29:24.159" style="s2">that this ultimately requires</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.480" end="00:29:27.039" style="s2">sociocultural interaction</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.159" end="00:29:28.640" style="s2">it requires that we do things with</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.039" end="00:29:28.960" style="s2">others because that&#39;s how that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.640" end="00:29:30.720" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.960" end="00:29:32.000" style="s2">the he chose the lion because the lions</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.720" end="00:29:34.080" style="s2">are social cats right</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.000" end="00:29:35.679" style="s2">they form prides and notice the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.080" end="00:29:39.039" style="s2">association to pride</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.679" end="00:29:40.640" style="s2">by the way okay so you learn the theory</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.039" end="00:29:42.320" style="s2">and then you can train the lion and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.640" end="00:29:42.880" style="s2">you can tame the monster you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.320" end="00:29:44.720" style="s2">to kill</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.880" end="00:29:47.039" style="s2">anything because we need all of these</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.720" end="00:29:48.880" style="s2">sometimes you need your monster</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.039" end="00:29:50.880" style="s2">you need to eat you need to run away</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.880" end="00:29:52.559" style="s2">from the threat</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.880" end="00:29:53.919" style="s2">sometimes of course the lion should be</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.559" end="00:29:54.960" style="s2">predominant because it&#39;s a social</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.919" end="00:29:56.480" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.960" end="00:29:58.640" style="s2">and you should be picking up on other</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.480" end="00:30:00.799" style="s2">people appropriately treating them</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.640" end="00:30:01.679" style="s2">as persons within a community of persons</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.799" end="00:30:03.279" style="s2">of people</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.679" end="00:30:05.679" style="s2">and then of course there&#39;s times we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.279" end="00:30:09.840" style="s2">doing it more here we emphasize the man</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.679" end="00:30:09.840" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to learn</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:17.360" style="s2">when we get this properly</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.200" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">organized we can deal with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.360" end="00:30:22.880" style="s2">the man</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:24.559" style="s2">on his own is largely impotent</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.880" end="00:30:26.320" style="s2">when i come in and i see the chocolate</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.559" end="00:30:28.480" style="s2">cake my knowing</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.320" end="00:30:30.320" style="s2">having the beliefs that i shouldn&#39;t eat</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.480" end="00:30:31.600" style="s2">it and this this is supported by a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.320" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">of evidence by the way is</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.600" end="00:30:37.919" style="s2">largely insufficient</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:41.120" style="s2">even almost impotent at stopping me from</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.919" end="00:30:42.880" style="s2">eating the cake but if i</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.120" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">learn about how to improve my health and</p>

<p begin="00:30:48.159" end="00:30:56.000" style="s2">right then i can use the social power</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.320" end="00:30:59.120" style="s2">of the lion to implement the theory</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.000" end="00:31:01.519" style="s2">and tame the monster</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.120" end="00:31:03.600" style="s2">so when we do and we know all about this</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.519" end="00:31:04.640" style="s2">this is anorexia this is and we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.600" end="00:31:06.720" style="s2">talking about this all through</p>

<p begin="00:31:06.720" end="00:31:13.600" style="s2">and stoicism this is inner peace now</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.000" end="00:31:15.440" style="s2">plato has a brilliant idea about this</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.600" end="00:31:17.360" style="s2">he has the what we&#39;re trying to do he</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.440" end="00:31:19.679" style="s2">says this is something like an</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.360" end="00:31:20.640" style="s2">inner form of justice we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.679" end="00:31:23.279" style="s2">get everything</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.640" end="00:31:24.559" style="s2">in the right relationship so that each</p>

<p begin="00:31:31.360" end="00:31:35.600" style="s2">so if the lion is too much it will right</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.159" end="00:31:36.320" style="s2">it could kill the monster you can think</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.600" end="00:31:39.360" style="s2">of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.320" end="00:31:40.240" style="s2">who are super ascetic and destroy uh</p>

<p begin="00:33:06.080" end="00:33:11.840" style="s2">so the neoplatons have a very</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.840" end="00:33:11.840" style="s2">sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.120" end="00:33:17.279" style="s2">they have a very sophisticated way of</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:19.039" style="s2">making use of this psychological theory</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.279" end="00:33:21.360" style="s2">now that theory it just keeps coming</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.039" end="00:33:22.000" style="s2">back some of you will recognize freud in</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.360" end="00:33:24.640" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.000" end="00:33:26.159" style="s2">some of you will recognize uh the dual</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.640" end="00:33:27.519" style="s2">or what&#39;s now called triple processing</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.159" end="00:33:28.720" style="s2">models that are all the rage within</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.519" end="00:33:30.559" style="s2">cognitive science and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.720" end="00:33:30.960" style="s2">psychology so we keep coming back to</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.559" end="00:33:33.039" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.960" end="00:33:34.000" style="s2">because so much evidence keeps</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.039" end="00:33:36.640" style="s2">converging on this</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.000" end="00:33:37.600" style="s2">but here&#39;s the idea that plato that</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.640" end="00:33:41.120" style="s2">really thought</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.600" end="00:33:43.519" style="s2">so when i don&#39;t have inner justice</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.120" end="00:33:45.519" style="s2">a virtue he called sophoson when i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.519" end="00:33:48.320" style="s2">have that inner justice</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.519" end="00:33:50.480" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen is i&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.320" end="00:33:53.120" style="s2">to have my salience and my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.480" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">properly and my actions</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.120" end="00:33:59.360" style="s2">properly coordinated so if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:01.519" style="s2">if i haven&#39;t cultivated that inner</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.360" end="00:34:04.399" style="s2">justice which is one important</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.519" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">poll or aspect of wisdom then when i</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:08.159" style="s2">come into a situation let&#39;s for example</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:09.760" style="s2">the chocolate cake the salience of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.159" end="00:34:11.520" style="s2">cake overwhelms</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.760" end="00:34:14.399" style="s2">my understanding and my grasp of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.520" end="00:34:16.800" style="s2">truth and that is exactly why i fall</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.399" end="00:34:18.560" style="s2">into this self-destructive bit i deceive</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.800" end="00:34:19.280" style="s2">myself oh it&#39;s okay to eat the cake</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.560" end="00:34:20.800" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.280" end="00:34:23.280" style="s2">and then that&#39;s self-destructive</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.800" end="00:34:26.399" style="s2">behavior so the imbalance</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.280" end="00:34:29.599" style="s2">the imbalance causes self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.399" end="00:34:32.960" style="s2">it actually disconnects me from</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.599" end="00:34:35.359" style="s2">the world i&#39;m not connected to</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.960" end="00:34:36.320" style="s2">the reality of things appropriately this</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.359" end="00:34:38.000" style="s2">connects me from</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.320" end="00:34:40.159" style="s2">my future self that i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.000" end="00:34:41.599" style="s2">cultivate it will ultimately disconnect</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.159" end="00:34:43.679" style="s2">me from others</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.599" end="00:34:45.760" style="s2">because i will act for example greedily</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.679" end="00:34:47.440" style="s2">i will not act properly virtuously</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.760" end="00:34:48.960" style="s2">and if you say well i&#39;ll act morally</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.440" end="00:34:50.320" style="s2">then you&#39;re starting to invoke the lion</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.960" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">and you&#39;re already starting to move to</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.320" end="00:34:55.919" style="s2">right towards the coordination</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:34:58.079" style="s2">so let&#39;s do the opposite then</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.919" end="00:34:59.119" style="s2">let&#39;s say i&#39;ve started to cultivate some</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.079" end="00:35:01.119" style="s2">adoraxia</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.119" end="00:35:02.960" style="s2">what does that mean well it means i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.119" end="00:35:05.920" style="s2">increasing i&#39;m decreasing my</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.960" end="00:35:05.920" style="s2">self-deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.000" end="00:35:09.359" style="s2">self-destructive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.200" end="00:35:21.680" style="s2">okay what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.640" end="00:35:24.880" style="s2">well that means actually because of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.680" end="00:35:24.880" style="s2">i start to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.119" end="00:35:30.000" style="s2">see into in sight i start to see into</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.640" end="00:35:32.000" style="s2">the real patterns of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.000" end="00:35:35.280" style="s2">world and we&#39;ll come back to what plato</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.000" end="00:35:35.280" style="s2">means by these real patterns</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.560" end="00:35:39.760" style="s2">and i see not just in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.640" end="00:35:41.760" style="s2">getting an idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.760" end="00:35:43.280" style="s2">i am fitted i&#39;m more appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.760" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">fitted so you can even put</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.280" end="00:35:46.720" style="s2">realize right the real patterns of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.839" end="00:35:49.200" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.720" end="00:35:50.160" style="s2">now as i start to pick up on the real</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.200" end="00:35:52.480" style="s2">patterns of the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.160" end="00:35:54.400" style="s2">i actually gain some real knowledge i</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.480" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">start to understand</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.400" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">how particular patterns operate</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.079" end="00:36:04.160" style="s2">i can then internalize that i can use</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.400" end="00:36:07.359" style="s2">that understanding</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.160" end="00:36:10.079" style="s2">of real patterns to see</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.359" end="00:36:11.760" style="s2">into the real patterns of my own psyche</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.079" end="00:36:12.720" style="s2">i look into the patterns of my own</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.760" end="00:36:15.200" style="s2">psyche</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.720" end="00:36:17.280" style="s2">which means i get a better oh wait</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.200" end="00:36:19.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a better way in which</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.280" end="00:36:21.920" style="s2">the psyche should be coordinated and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.920" end="00:36:23.920" style="s2">organized</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.920" end="00:36:25.599" style="s2">and you see what starts happening now i</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.920" end="00:36:27.200" style="s2">get more anoraxia</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.599" end="00:36:28.720" style="s2">i reduce my self-deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.200" end="00:36:31.680" style="s2">self-destructive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.720" end="00:36:32.400" style="s2">i start to fit more into the real</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.680" end="00:36:33.760" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.400" end="00:36:36.400" style="s2">the real patterns can be an internal</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.760" end="00:36:39.200" style="s2">life and you know what this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.400" end="00:36:41.839" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen it before this is reciprocal</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.760" end="00:36:50.880" style="s2">came up with the idea of addiction as</p>

<p begin="00:37:02.720" end="00:37:06.079" style="s2">is called anagage</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.760" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">now we have a meta drive for inner peace</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">and then what plato saw is we also have</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">a meta drive here</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.440" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">in addition to whatever satisfy whatever</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.400" end="00:37:24.400" style="s2">satisfies our desires or our wants</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:25.920" style="s2">we want what satisfies it to be real or</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.400" end="00:37:27.440" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.920" end="00:37:29.119" style="s2">i can give you tons of examples i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.440" end="00:37:30.160" style="s2">just give you a quick one i do this all</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.119" end="00:37:32.400" style="s2">the time in my class</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.160" end="00:37:33.520" style="s2">i&#39;ll ask my students how many of you are</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.400" end="00:37:35.440" style="s2">in a really</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.520" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">satisfying romantic relationship they</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.440" end="00:37:40.720" style="s2">put up their hands</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.839" end="00:37:43.119" style="s2">okay how many of you would want to know</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.720" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">if your partner was cheating on you</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.119" end="00:37:46.720" style="s2">even if that means the complete</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:49.119" style="s2">destruction of the relationship about 95</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.720" end="00:37:50.960" style="s2">of the people keep up their hands</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.119" end="00:37:51.520" style="s2">they&#39;re willing to sacrifice all of this</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.960" end="00:37:53.760" style="s2">pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.520" end="00:37:55.359" style="s2">all of this comfort all of this joy</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.760" end="00:37:58.960" style="s2">because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.359" end="00:38:02.160" style="s2">real okay so we</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.960" end="00:38:05.040" style="s2">want to be connected so the idea in</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.160" end="00:38:05.839" style="s2">platonic spirituality is spirituality is</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.040" end="00:38:08.480" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.839" end="00:38:09.520" style="s2">satisfying these two fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.480" end="00:38:11.760" style="s2">metadrives</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.520" end="00:38:13.599" style="s2">the drive for inner peace and the drive</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.760" end="00:38:16.160" style="s2">to be in contact with what&#39;s real and</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:17.839" style="s2">what plato says is if we do it right</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.160" end="00:38:19.359" style="s2">if we cultivate wisdom with the right</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.839" end="00:38:22.160" style="s2">ecology and practices</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.359" end="00:38:24.000" style="s2">these will be mutually reinforcing in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.160" end="00:38:26.000" style="s2">positive feedback cycle</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.000" end="00:38:27.440" style="s2">and we&#39;ll get reciprocal opening and</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.000" end="00:38:32.480" style="s2">that&#39;s anagarge</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.440" end="00:38:36.640" style="s2">that&#39;s anagarge so neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.480" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">is basically the philosophy religion</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.640" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">of anagogy</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.560" end="00:39:01.119" style="s2">okay so what are these real patterns we</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.200" end="00:39:03.040" style="s2">won&#39;t get through all of this today</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.119" end="00:39:04.640" style="s2">and i still have to tell you next time</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.040" end="00:39:06.000" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be together</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.640" end="00:39:08.480" style="s2">how the neoplatonists draw from</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.000" end="00:39:10.160" style="s2">aristotle how they draw from the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.480" end="00:39:11.280" style="s2">and then what the basic form of practice</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.160" end="00:39:12.240" style="s2">so the introduction is going to take</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.280" end="00:39:13.920" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.240" end="00:39:15.440" style="s2">and next saturday and then we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.920" end="00:39:17.680" style="s2">into the ecology of practices but you</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.440" end="00:39:18.880" style="s2">need to understand this background</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.680" end="00:39:20.560" style="s2">just like i gave you a background for</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.880" end="00:39:22.720" style="s2">epicureanism and i gave you the</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.560" end="00:39:25.280" style="s2">background for stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.720" end="00:39:27.680" style="s2">so what are these real patterns that i</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.280" end="00:39:31.119" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.680" end="00:39:34.000" style="s2">well we already make a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.119" end="00:39:35.680" style="s2">in science that&#39;s helpful to start us we</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.000" end="00:39:38.240" style="s2">make a distinction between patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.680" end="00:39:41.599" style="s2">are just correlations</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.240" end="00:39:44.560" style="s2">and patterns that are causal</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.599" end="00:39:45.680" style="s2">and one of the big things you learn and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.560" end="00:39:48.000" style="s2">it takes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.680" end="00:39:49.839" style="s2">discipline you have to discipline</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.000" end="00:39:52.000" style="s2">yourself with discernment</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.839" end="00:39:53.359" style="s2">and open yourself up to the disclosure</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.000" end="00:39:54.560" style="s2">of the world that&#39;s what a really good</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.359" end="00:39:58.480" style="s2">experiment is</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.560" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">in order to make this i&#39;m i</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.480" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna expect a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:05.200" style="s2">frustration i&#39;m tired of people</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:09.440" style="s2">who like</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.200" end="00:40:12.079" style="s2">don&#39;t appreciate enough the discipline</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.440" end="00:40:14.640" style="s2">right of science science that means</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.079" end="00:40:17.680" style="s2">sciencia to know</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.640" end="00:40:17.680" style="s2">you have to right</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.400" end="00:40:25.760" style="s2">we are so beset by self-deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.960" end="00:40:26.560" style="s2">cognitive biases that we need to do a</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.760" end="00:40:28.880" style="s2">lot</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.560" end="00:40:32.240" style="s2">of training in order to distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:32.240" style="s2">correlations from causation</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.000" end="00:40:40.160" style="s2">that&#39;s what science is all about and</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.119" end="00:40:41.599" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard it&#39;s really hard</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.160" end="00:40:44.000" style="s2">and if you&#39;re going to say i reject</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.599" end="00:40:46.640" style="s2">science then tell me please</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.000" end="00:40:48.160" style="s2">your better method for distinguishing</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.640" end="00:40:50.160" style="s2">causation from correlation</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.160" end="00:40:51.599" style="s2">because if you don&#39;t have one i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.160" end="00:40:54.720" style="s2">going to listen to you</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.599" end="00:40:54.720" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to listen to you</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.480" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">so why am i emphasizing that because</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.680" end="00:41:03.200" style="s2">there is a tendency for people who are</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.440" end="00:41:05.680" style="s2">attracted to neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.200" end="00:41:06.640" style="s2">to take an anti-scientific attitude that</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.680" end="00:41:09.040" style="s2">is not</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.640" end="00:41:10.000" style="s2">hypatia&#39;s attitude hypatia was one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.040" end="00:41:12.720" style="s2">the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.000" end="00:41:13.760" style="s2">scientists of her time and there is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.720" end="00:41:15.760" style="s2">deep</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.760" end="00:41:17.920" style="s2">and long-standing tradition of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.760" end="00:41:22.079" style="s2">interconnection between science</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.920" end="00:41:24.880" style="s2">and neoplatonism uh john spencer&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.079" end="00:41:25.280" style="s2">right uh the eternal law uh argues for</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.880" end="00:41:27.839" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.280" end="00:41:29.599" style="s2">the fact the historical fact that many</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.839" end="00:41:31.280" style="s2">of the pivotal figures at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.599" end="00:41:34.960" style="s2">of the scientific revolution</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.280" end="00:41:38.079" style="s2">were deeply uh influenced explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.960" end="00:41:38.079" style="s2">by neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.160" end="00:41:40.560" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.599" end="00:41:45.839" style="s2">so when i was being brought up in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.000" end="00:41:47.599" style="s2">christian fundamentalist family</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.839" end="00:41:49.040" style="s2">right i would hear things like you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.599" end="00:41:49.920" style="s2">things have gotten so much worse since</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.040" end="00:41:52.480" style="s2">we took prayer</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.920" end="00:41:54.480" style="s2">out of the schools right by the way</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.480" end="00:41:56.319" style="s2">that&#39;s not true but let&#39;s say it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.480" end="00:41:58.079" style="s2">now that&#39;s a correlation the problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.319" end="00:42:00.480" style="s2">with correlations yeah two things</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.079" end="00:42:01.839" style="s2">are in relation correlation but you</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.480" end="00:42:05.280" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.839" end="00:42:06.720" style="s2">is a causing b</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.280" end="00:42:08.560" style="s2">your intuitions will say that but it can</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.720" end="00:42:11.680" style="s2">turn out that it&#39;s b that&#39;s causing a</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.560" end="00:42:12.880" style="s2">or often a and b have no causal relation</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.680" end="00:42:16.480" style="s2">they&#39;re both being caused by</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.880" end="00:42:18.560" style="s2">c and your intuitions</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.480" end="00:42:19.599" style="s2">and your untrained observation can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.560" end="00:42:23.760" style="s2">distinguish these</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.599" end="00:42:26.160" style="s2">there&#39;s things you have to do so</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.760" end="00:42:26.800" style="s2">let&#39;s go back to the correlation well we</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.160" end="00:42:28.240" style="s2">took prior</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.800" end="00:42:29.599" style="s2">prior to the school and crime rates went</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.240" end="00:42:30.480" style="s2">up actually it didn&#39;t but let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.599" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.480" end="00:42:35.119" style="s2">well i want you to notice something else</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:38.400" style="s2">here&#39;s greenhouse gases</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.119" end="00:42:39.280" style="s2">going up across time here&#39;s caribbean</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.400" end="00:42:44.079" style="s2">piracy</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.280" end="00:42:45.760" style="s2">it&#39;s been going down across time</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.079" end="00:42:48.400" style="s2">do you see what the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.760" end="00:42:50.400" style="s2">greenhouse gases are going up because</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.400" end="00:42:52.319" style="s2">we have stopped practicing caribbean</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.400" end="00:42:54.480" style="s2">piracy so we need to get on some wooden</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.319" end="00:42:56.319" style="s2">ships and sail around the caribbean</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.480" end="00:43:00.480" style="s2">and that will that will deal with global</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.319" end="00:43:03.760" style="s2">warming now you laugh and it&#39;s absurd</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.480" end="00:43:09.920" style="s2">but notice that many times things are</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.760" end="00:43:09.920" style="s2">absurd because we are confusing</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.160" end="00:43:18.560" style="s2">correlation and causation</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.400" end="00:43:20.240" style="s2">so the first step</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.560" end="00:43:22.400" style="s2">the first step at getting to the real</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.240" end="00:43:24.079" style="s2">patterns that plato was on about was a</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.400" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">careful reflection</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.079" end="00:43:28.800" style="s2">trying to distinguish initially the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:30.880" style="s2">causal patterns</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.800" end="00:43:32.160" style="s2">from the correlational patterns</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.880" end="00:43:34.640" style="s2">practicing</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.160" end="00:43:36.480" style="s2">doing that now he didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.640" end="00:43:39.520" style="s2">full-blown scientific method</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.480" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">but he saw the necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.520" end="00:43:43.760" style="s2">critical theoretical debate and</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:45.920" style="s2">discussion in order to try and discern</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.760" end="00:43:48.800" style="s2">the difference between correlation</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.920" end="00:43:48.800" style="s2">and causation</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.960" end="00:43:55.200" style="s2">so using science notice</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.160" end="00:43:57.040" style="s2">that we can&#39;t as a as an analogy we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.200" end="00:43:58.000" style="s2">talk about the real patterns we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.040" end="00:44:00.560" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.000" end="00:44:03.359" style="s2">there&#39;s patterns of causation like if i</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.560" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">put sugar in water it dissolves</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.359" end="00:44:07.520" style="s2">and then those patterns of causation are</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.599" end="00:44:09.040" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.520" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">maybe i&#39;ll do it this way maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.040" end="00:44:11.920" style="s2">makes more sense now the plate the</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:13.839" style="s2">neoplateness have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.920" end="00:44:15.040" style="s2">have an upward metaphor but now we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.839" end="00:44:17.200" style="s2">a more downward metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.040" end="00:44:19.040" style="s2">so here&#39;s some causal patterns in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.200" end="00:44:21.520" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.040" end="00:44:22.640" style="s2">and what scientists do right is they try</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.520" end="00:44:26.880" style="s2">to find</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.640" end="00:44:26.880" style="s2">deeper structural patterns</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.960" end="00:44:31.520" style="s2">right they try to find systems of</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.040" end="00:44:31.520" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.680" end="00:44:34.960" style="s2">and then they ultimately try to find the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.760" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">principles</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.960" end="00:44:42.400" style="s2">or using a legal term the laws</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.800" end="00:44:42.400" style="s2">that regulate those patterns</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.800" end="00:44:49.040" style="s2">and this is this is virtually you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.960" end="00:44:50.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a version of what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.040" end="00:44:53.280" style="s2">do in</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.400" end="00:44:53.760" style="s2">neoplatonism you&#39;re trying to realize</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.280" end="00:44:55.599" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.760" end="00:44:57.440" style="s2">the patterns that are unfolding in your</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.599" end="00:45:00.400" style="s2">environment then</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.440" end="00:45:02.560" style="s2">the systems the structures that those</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.400" end="00:45:04.319" style="s2">patterns are within</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.560" end="00:45:05.680" style="s2">and then ultimately the governing</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.319" end="00:45:07.680" style="s2">principles that</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.680" end="00:45:09.440" style="s2">ra science is neoplatonic through and</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.680" end="00:45:12.880" style="s2">through that ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.440" end="00:45:16.880" style="s2">the governing principles of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.880" end="00:45:19.599" style="s2">so plato had a theory about this</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.880" end="00:45:20.160" style="s2">and it&#39;s the idea that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.599" end="00:45:22.720" style="s2">come up</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.160" end="00:45:24.960" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to realize what he called</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.720" end="00:45:28.640" style="s2">well he called it the idos</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.960" end="00:45:31.200" style="s2">and we translate it very it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.640" end="00:45:32.240" style="s2">this is like translating logos with word</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.200" end="00:45:34.480" style="s2">the word word</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.240" end="00:45:37.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a legitimate translation but</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.480" end="00:45:40.079" style="s2">it&#39;s radically insufficient</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.680" end="00:45:40.960" style="s2">and so what i want to talk to you about</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.079" end="00:45:44.000" style="s2">next time</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.960" end="00:45:47.200" style="s2">is i want to talk to you about the how</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.000" end="00:45:50.319" style="s2">plato understood this</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.200" end="00:45:53.520" style="s2">but before this seems too strange to you</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.319" end="00:45:56.640" style="s2">think about how we did this in</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.520" end="00:45:59.680" style="s2">when we did invoking the logos right</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.640" end="00:46:02.560" style="s2">we were picking up on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.680" end="00:46:04.079" style="s2">right the fuses the way things are</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.560" end="00:46:07.680" style="s2">unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.079" end="00:46:10.640" style="s2">right and then we were picking up on</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.680" end="00:46:13.040" style="s2">the intelligibility the the system the</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.640" end="00:46:15.440" style="s2">systematic structure</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.040" end="00:46:16.960" style="s2">so we sat like a mountain which is we</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.440" end="00:46:20.079" style="s2">got into the basic</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.960" end="00:46:23.520" style="s2">presencing right the weight of it then</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.079" end="00:46:26.079" style="s2">we sat like a poppy and we tried to turn</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.520" end="00:46:27.760" style="s2">and orient ourselves towards the sun</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.079" end="00:46:28.960" style="s2">we&#39;ll see how plato makes use of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.760" end="00:46:29.760" style="s2">metaphor of the sun we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.960" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">orient our</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.760" end="00:46:33.920" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to orient ourselves to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.599" end="00:46:37.280" style="s2">real patterns the causal patterns</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.920" end="00:46:38.319" style="s2">and then after we sat like a poppy we</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.280" end="00:46:41.760" style="s2">sat like an ocean</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.319" end="00:46:43.119" style="s2">we tried to pick up on the overarching</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.760" end="00:46:45.920" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.119" end="00:46:47.119" style="s2">right over our flow in and out arising</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.920" end="00:46:50.400" style="s2">and passing away</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.119" end="00:46:53.280" style="s2">the system and then right we</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.400" end="00:46:55.599" style="s2">right we moved into that into the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.280" end="00:46:56.880" style="s2">musicality the intelligibility of how it</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.599" end="00:46:58.240" style="s2">all makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.880" end="00:47:01.280" style="s2">so we&#39;ll see how we&#39;re moving through</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.240" end="00:47:04.960" style="s2">here and then we pointed towards</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.280" end="00:47:08.000" style="s2">the source the ultimate principle</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.960" end="00:47:11.839" style="s2">we were doing this we were enacting it</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.000" end="00:47:14.720" style="s2">we were invoking it as we</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.839" end="00:47:15.200" style="s2">were doing the invocation of the logos</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.720" end="00:47:18.800" style="s2">we were</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.200" end="00:47:19.760" style="s2">already practicing anagage because as we</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.800" end="00:47:21.760" style="s2">did it within</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.760" end="00:47:23.280" style="s2">we did it without and as we aligned</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.760" end="00:47:25.280" style="s2">within the microcosm</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.280" end="00:47:27.520" style="s2">we found it we found the alignment</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.280" end="00:47:30.960" style="s2">without the macrocosm</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.520" end="00:47:32.960" style="s2">and we started to do the anagogic ascent</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.960" end="00:47:35.200" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to talk a lot more next</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.960" end="00:47:38.559" style="s2">time about</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.200" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">the plato&#39;s theory of the forms and</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.559" end="00:47:43.599" style="s2">how that gives us an understanding of a</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.760" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">deeper understanding of anagay and</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.599" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">participation</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.960" end="00:47:48.480" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll be able to move into</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:50.800" style="s2">aristotle and how his theory of</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.480" end="00:47:53.760" style="s2">knowledge by conformity was taken in by</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.800" end="00:47:55.359" style="s2">taken into neoplatonism and then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.760" end="00:47:58.480" style="s2">see what neoplatonism draws</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.359" end="00:48:00.520" style="s2">from the stoics in terms of again the</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.480" end="00:48:03.599" style="s2">logos</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.520" end="00:48:05.440" style="s2">internalization self-discipline</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.599" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">the civic virtues that prepare you for</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.440" end="00:48:09.040" style="s2">purification and at one minute</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:11.040" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll be ready to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.040" end="00:48:12.640" style="s2">neoplatonism proper</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.040" end="00:48:14.480" style="s2">uh what its main ideas are the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.640" end="00:48:15.040" style="s2">innovations it brought in so like i said</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.480" end="00:48:17.440" style="s2">we&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.040" end="00:48:18.839" style="s2">we&#39;ll with this might take one or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.440" end="00:48:22.319" style="s2">even two more</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.839" end="00:48:25.599" style="s2">uh lectures i guess that&#39;s what this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.319" end="00:48:28.160" style="s2">sorry so we get the background we needed</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.599" end="00:48:29.440" style="s2">because again this is this is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.160" end="00:48:31.839" style="s2">summative</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.440" end="00:48:32.800" style="s2">it&#39;s simultaneously the grand unified</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.839" end="00:48:34.800" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.800" end="00:48:37.119" style="s2">and the grand unified ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.800" end="00:48:40.000" style="s2">practices of the entire</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.119" end="00:48:41.760" style="s2">western wisdom tradition and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.000" end="00:48:43.040" style="s2">we keep perennially this is verse</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.760" end="00:48:45.200" style="s2">lewis&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.040" end="00:48:46.559" style="s2">we parentally keep turning to it again</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.200" end="00:48:49.280" style="s2">and again and again</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.559" end="00:48:50.000" style="s2">it is the inexhaustible fountain that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.280" end="00:48:51.920" style="s2">turn to</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.000" end="00:48:54.160" style="s2">for the spirituality that puts us</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.920" end="00:48:56.280" style="s2">directly and continuously in touch</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.160" end="00:48:59.440" style="s2">with the inexhaustible source of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.280" end="00:49:02.640" style="s2">intelligibility of being itself for us</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.440" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2">and this is simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.640" end="00:49:07.119" style="s2">something abstract any transcendent in</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.400" end="00:49:10.079" style="s2">that sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.119" end="00:49:11.599" style="s2">but also deeply deeply imminent in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.079" end="00:49:14.000" style="s2">very guts</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.599" end="00:49:15.200" style="s2">think about the tripart soul the ver the</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.000" end="00:49:17.599" style="s2">tripart psyche if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.200" end="00:49:19.280" style="s2">prefer that term right the very guts of</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.599" end="00:49:23.040" style="s2">your being</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.280" end="00:49:25.200" style="s2">okay so i&#39;m now going to go back</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.040" end="00:49:26.559" style="s2">to the meditation pillow jason will</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.200" end="00:49:28.880" style="s2">switch the camera</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.559" end="00:49:30.319" style="s2">and then what we&#39;ll do is we&#39;ll take a</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.880" end="00:49:33.119" style="s2">look at any questions</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.319" end="00:49:34.800" style="s2">uh people might have now please please</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.119" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">be patient with me</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.800" end="00:49:39.200" style="s2">neoplatonism is con i can&#39;t give you the</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.520" end="00:49:41.839" style="s2">background like i could with</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.200" end="00:49:44.079" style="s2">epicureanism or stoicism well i actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.839" end="00:49:46.720" style="s2">i i spread that background over a couple</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.079" end="00:49:47.359" style="s2">of talks too i need two or three talks</p>

<p begin="00:49:54.720" end="00:50:01.680" style="s2">more and more how this right affords</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.160" end="00:50:03.920" style="s2">impregnates and and empowers</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.680" end="00:50:06.319" style="s2">an ecology of practices that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.920" end="00:50:08.720" style="s2">to take a deep look at together</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.319" end="00:50:09.599" style="s2">and then that will bring us uh to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.720" end="00:50:13.839" style="s2">end</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.599" end="00:50:13.839" style="s2">of the wisdom of hypatia</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.760" end="00:50:41.839" style="s2">are there any questions</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.240" end="00:50:48.800" style="s2">oh uh brett uh thank you for doing the</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.040" end="00:50:51.520" style="s2">philosophical fellowship</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.800" end="00:50:52.640" style="s2">uh demonstration you&#39;re welcome brett</p>

<p begin="00:50:59.440" end="00:51:03.280" style="s2">uh and of course ammar behind the scenes</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.760" end="00:51:05.920" style="s2">uh working his magic</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.280" end="00:51:06.640" style="s2">uh we will see um how the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.920" end="00:51:10.480" style="s2">fellowship</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.640" end="00:51:12.079" style="s2">is actually um an important bridging</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.480" end="00:51:15.280" style="s2">practice as i indicated</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.079" end="00:51:18.720" style="s2">uh uh between like epicureanism</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.280" end="00:51:19.200" style="s2">um and aspects of stoicism and we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.720" end="00:51:22.319" style="s2">how it</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.200" end="00:51:24.000" style="s2">therefore also prepares us for practices</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.319" end="00:51:27.200" style="s2">the practice of dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.000" end="00:51:29.839" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the core practices</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.200" end="00:51:31.839" style="s2">within neoplaton neoplatonism so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.839" end="00:51:33.920" style="s2">actually a pedagogical program</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.839" end="00:51:35.040" style="s2">that as you move through elementary</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.920" end="00:51:37.520" style="s2">school high school</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.040" end="00:51:39.280" style="s2">and uh in university and and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.520" end="00:51:41.680" style="s2">program is really important</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.280" end="00:51:42.640" style="s2">if you skip to the end if you jump to</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.680" end="00:51:44.640" style="s2">the conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.640" end="00:51:46.559" style="s2">you are falling into foolishness you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:51.040" style="s2">falling into foolishness</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.559" end="00:51:51.040" style="s2">um are there any other questions that</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.200" end="00:51:55.040" style="s2">anybody else wants to ask about perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.400" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.040" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">talk there&#39;s another question coming up</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.599" end="00:52:20.160" style="s2">gazelle good to hear from you again is</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.720" end="00:52:22.000" style="s2">correla</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.160" end="00:52:23.680" style="s2">is correlation patterns necessarily bad</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.000" end="00:52:25.119" style="s2">i have a lot of meaningful quinces in my</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.680" end="00:52:28.559" style="s2">life so i worry</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.119" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">um that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.559" end="00:52:34.640" style="s2">um the way i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:36.319" style="s2">i would put that is all remember always</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.640" end="00:52:38.400" style="s2">trying to balance discernment</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.319" end="00:52:40.240" style="s2">how we can best see through uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.400" end="00:52:40.880" style="s2">misleading appearances and disclosure</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.240" end="00:52:42.800" style="s2">opening us</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.880" end="00:52:44.160" style="s2">ourselves up for how the world may</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.800" end="00:52:46.079" style="s2">correct what we see</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.160" end="00:52:47.680" style="s2">discernment and disclosure discernment</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.079" end="00:52:51.280" style="s2">and disclosure always</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.680" end="00:52:54.960" style="s2">in coordination so if</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.280" end="00:52:55.920" style="s2">you don&#39;t confuse correlation with</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.960" end="00:52:58.800" style="s2">causation</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.920" end="00:53:00.000" style="s2">if you treat it just as correlation and</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.800" end="00:53:02.720" style="s2">don&#39;t treat it as</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.000" end="00:53:04.480" style="s2">if it is causation then of course</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.720" end="00:53:06.240" style="s2">there&#39;s no mistake because treating a</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.480" end="00:53:09.040" style="s2">correlation as a correlation is treating</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.240" end="00:53:09.040" style="s2">it as it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.440" end="00:53:14.880" style="s2">the danger for us</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.480" end="00:53:16.800" style="s2">is it&#39;s very hard for our brains who are</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.880" end="00:53:18.880" style="s2">prediction-hungry machines</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.800" end="00:53:20.000" style="s2">to leave correlations just as</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.880" end="00:53:23.520" style="s2">correlations</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.000" end="00:53:25.760" style="s2">we start to we start to behave</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.520" end="00:53:28.240" style="s2">and believe that there are causes now</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.760" end="00:53:29.839" style="s2">some of the correlations might be causes</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.240" end="00:53:32.160" style="s2">just because something&#39;s a correlation</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.839" end="00:53:34.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t preclude it from being a cause</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.160" end="00:53:36.559" style="s2">all causes are also correlations it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.640" end="00:53:38.000" style="s2">just that not all correlations many many</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.559" end="00:53:40.559" style="s2">many most correlations</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.000" end="00:53:41.280" style="s2">aren&#39;t causes and so if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.559" end="00:53:43.359" style="s2">correlation</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.280" end="00:53:44.880" style="s2">and you&#39;re being i think this is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.359" end="00:53:46.400" style="s2">right word tempted</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.880" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">into believing that it&#39;s a causal</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.400" end="00:53:48.559" style="s2">pattern then you have to do the hard</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:50.319" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.559" end="00:53:51.760" style="s2">we have to do the hard work because it</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.319" end="00:53:52.720" style="s2">should be done with in concert with</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.760" end="00:53:54.559" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.720" end="00:53:56.400" style="s2">of you know rational reflection</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.559" end="00:53:59.520" style="s2">empirical investigation</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.400" end="00:54:00.480" style="s2">uh to to determine if there&#39;s good</p>

<p begin="00:54:00.480" end="00:54:05.040" style="s2">and good evidence for concluding</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.520" end="00:54:07.200" style="s2">that the correlational pattern is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.040" end="00:54:08.800" style="s2">causal pattern and</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.200" end="00:54:11.200" style="s2">like the degree to which you can do that</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.800" end="00:54:12.160" style="s2">work is the degree to which you can have</p>

<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:18.559" style="s2">rather than a correlational pattern the</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.040" end="00:54:19.040" style="s2">degree to which you can&#39;t do the work</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.559" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.040" end="00:54:22.640" style="s2">many of us can&#39;t because we don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:54:26.000" end="00:54:30.640" style="s2">uh issues or trauma issues i i i wanna</p>

<p begin="00:54:30.640" end="00:54:33.839" style="s2">but the degree to which we can&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.480" end="00:54:36.160" style="s2">is the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.839" end="00:54:38.319" style="s2">we have to practice the stoicism we have</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.160" end="00:54:38.720" style="s2">to practice realizing that if we treat</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.319" end="00:54:40.960" style="s2">cause</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.720" end="00:54:42.400" style="s2">correlations as causes we&#39;re doing the</p>

<p begin="00:54:45.440" end="00:54:49.839" style="s2">we have to bracket and realize no i</p>
