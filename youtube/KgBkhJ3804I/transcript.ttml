<p begin="00:01:26.640" end="00:01:29.920" style="s2">while the interview was going on and i</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.240" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">was trying to explain to them</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.920" end="00:01:35.040" style="s2">what was going on and they thought i was</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:37.840" style="s2">saying that the video feed was</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:39.200" style="s2">close and then by the time by the time</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.840" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">they were they sort of check thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.200" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">like because it only lasted about 15</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:44.799" style="s2">seconds</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">and then then so we just went on so they</p>

<p begin="00:01:56.560" end="00:02:01.200" style="s2">a moment to just sort of stabilize</p>

<p begin="00:02:01.200" end="00:02:03.520" style="s2">get here and hopefully things will</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.479" end="00:02:06.840" style="s2">stabilize</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.520" end="00:02:09.280" style="s2">um okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.840" end="00:02:10.000" style="s2">um well maybe i could just we could just</p>

<p begin="00:02:20.400" end="00:02:25.680" style="s2">things to say and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.560" end="00:02:26.879" style="s2">um it made me think i</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:28.879" style="s2">and and something that i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.879" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">thinking about for for a while</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.879" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">um that i thought might be a topic that</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:35.920" style="s2">you guys</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:37.920" style="s2">could speak on quite well since you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.920" end="00:02:39.280" style="s2">plato and aristotle and the greeks so</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">well and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.280" end="00:02:43.360" style="s2">that is the idea of of a soul what is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:46.000" style="s2">soul</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.360" end="00:02:47.440" style="s2">and how how do we how do we have a soul</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.000" end="00:02:49.920" style="s2">in in this machine</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.440" end="00:02:52.239" style="s2">and i i&#39;ve heard you talk and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.920" end="00:02:55.519" style="s2">redefine the notion of soul</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.239" end="00:02:56.480" style="s2">john and does that seem like a a topic</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.519" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">that might be of</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.480" end="00:03:00.879" style="s2">interest yeah i am very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">discussing that i&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.879" end="00:03:06.159" style="s2">discussing that</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.400" end="00:03:10.319" style="s2">in connection with uh with gnosis and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.159" end="00:03:10.319" style="s2">uh dialectic very much very much</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.200" end="00:03:16.959" style="s2">so maybe i could start um</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.959" end="00:03:20.080" style="s2">try i&#39;ve been talking with chris about</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.959" end="00:03:20.080" style="s2">this and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.319" end="00:03:28.000" style="s2">i guess it&#39;s not right with cover maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:29.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a combination uh there&#39;s a word i</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.000" end="00:03:32.239" style="s2">want to use</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.440" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t exist in english kerry</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.239" end="00:03:36.720" style="s2">makes use of it in his book</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:38.080" style="s2">augustine&#39;s invention of the inner self</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.720" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">which of course is deeply relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.080" end="00:03:41.680" style="s2">what we&#39;re going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">um now the thing about that is carrie</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.680" end="00:03:44.879" style="s2">takes great pains to say</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:46.560" style="s2">well yeah this is english he wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.879" end="00:03:50.560" style="s2">use the latin term</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.560" end="00:03:51.920" style="s2">inventio yeah and the re and they the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.560" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">publishers wouldn&#39;t let them because</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">well they&#39;re publishers um and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:03:59.040" style="s2">the reason you want to use wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">use the word inventio</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.040" end="00:04:07.200" style="s2">is that it hangs between</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:10.080" style="s2">our two words invention and discovery</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.200" end="00:04:11.680" style="s2">so this is where for example you could</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.080" end="00:04:12.560" style="s2">get around a lot of thorny problems in</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.680" end="00:04:14.560" style="s2">math by saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.560" end="00:04:16.639" style="s2">math is neither in invented nor</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.560" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">discovered but it is inventio</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.639" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">uh um so</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.320" end="00:04:23.440" style="s2">i&#39;m very interested then if you&#39;ll allow</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.479" end="00:04:27.199" style="s2">me uh to</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.440" end="00:04:30.960" style="s2">reinvent you i want to reinvent you um</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.199" end="00:04:34.400" style="s2">the soul if that makes any sense sure um</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.960" end="00:04:34.400" style="s2">and i want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.720" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">do something sort of the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:40.960" style="s2">descartes</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">so for really important historical</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.960" end="00:04:46.560" style="s2">reasons especially</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:50.000" style="s2">to try and form an alliance between</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:51.680" style="s2">the catholic church and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.000" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">the neoplatonic magicians from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.680" end="00:04:56.800" style="s2">renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.440" end="00:05:00.160" style="s2">descartes pretty much completely</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.800" end="00:05:03.639" style="s2">identified the soul</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.160" end="00:05:06.880" style="s2">with the self and then he completely</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.639" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">identified the self</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.880" end="00:05:13.199" style="s2">um with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:13.680" style="s2">the the the center of subjectivity the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.199" end="00:05:16.960" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.680" end="00:05:18.400" style="s2">the place where the mind touches itself</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.960" end="00:05:20.080" style="s2">in consciousness you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.400" end="00:05:23.120" style="s2">conscious by being conscious it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.080" end="00:05:25.039" style="s2">pure participation and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.120" end="00:05:26.639" style="s2">as always with descartes when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.039" end="00:05:28.400" style="s2">deconstructing descartes</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.639" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">uh you have to be really really</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.400" end="00:05:32.240" style="s2">respectful there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:33.680" style="s2">important insights there that should not</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.240" end="00:05:39.360" style="s2">be abandoned</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.680" end="00:05:42.160" style="s2">but that confusion of uh soul to self</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.360" end="00:05:43.120" style="s2">to subjective center is something i</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.160" end="00:05:46.320" style="s2">would like to try</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.120" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">and uh pull apart uh well nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.320" end="00:05:51.759" style="s2">keeping the connections</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:54.560" style="s2">um and so um</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.759" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">so also the soul is connected in some</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.560" end="00:05:57.600" style="s2">way with this notion of the divine</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.560" end="00:06:00.720" style="s2">double</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.600" end="00:06:02.560" style="s2">yes um or the sacred second self i think</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.720" end="00:06:06.160" style="s2">as you you&#39;ve renamed</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.560" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">that yeah that&#39;s very much the case</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.160" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">i think there&#39;s something in here that</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.680" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">the term uh soul is in</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.680" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">is aspirational um but i would also like</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:17.440" style="s2">like more does uh christopher moore does</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:20.720" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.440" end="00:06:24.560" style="s2">socratic self-knowledge and reconfigures</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.720" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">reinventio perhaps um thus</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.560" end="00:06:30.240" style="s2">the the self as something</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:31.039" style="s2">not possessed but to which we have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.240" end="00:06:33.919" style="s2">perpetual</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.039" end="00:06:34.800" style="s2">aspirational relation that your true</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.919" end="00:06:37.440" style="s2">self is</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.800" end="00:06:38.720" style="s2">is the um the virtuous self that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.440" end="00:06:40.800" style="s2">always aspiring to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.720" end="00:06:42.400" style="s2">right so the soul is not something we</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.800" end="00:06:44.319" style="s2">have it&#39;s something we do</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.400" end="00:06:46.319" style="s2">with something we it&#39;s an activity and</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.319" end="00:06:47.680" style="s2">it&#39;s something we aspire to become at</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.319" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">the same time</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.680" end="00:06:53.919" style="s2">so what i think it&#39;s what the soul</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:55.039" style="s2">this is an idea i&#39;m playing with serious</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.919" end="00:06:56.479" style="s2">play and i&#39;ve been playing with</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.039" end="00:06:58.880" style="s2">christopher he&#39;s one of my</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.479" end="00:07:01.039" style="s2">uh best pers one of the best people to</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.880" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">play with as you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.039" end="00:07:05.759" style="s2">um this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:07.440" style="s2">i just have this image of you guys in</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.759" end="00:07:09.520" style="s2">the in the playground with marbles</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.440" end="00:07:10.560" style="s2">yeah yeah great great playmates in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:14.400" style="s2">playdate yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.560" end="00:07:16.479" style="s2">um although i may have lost a few of my</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.400" end="00:07:20.240" style="s2">marbles um so</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.479" end="00:07:21.919" style="s2">uh good one yeah i&#39;m trying and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.240" end="00:07:24.479" style="s2">trying to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.919" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">this notion that could resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.479" end="00:07:30.160" style="s2">neoplatonic ideas of the one</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:32.240" style="s2">within us um which i can perhaps get to</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.160" end="00:07:34.000" style="s2">and then buddhist ideas about the no</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.240" end="00:07:36.960" style="s2">self and the true self</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.000" end="00:07:37.680" style="s2">um especially in the work of nishitani</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.960" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">and and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.680" end="00:07:42.840" style="s2">what i&#39;m when i what i&#39;m sort of playing</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:45.360" style="s2">with is this idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.840" end="00:07:49.199" style="s2">that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.360" end="00:07:52.560" style="s2">two ways in which we participate</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.199" end="00:07:56.639" style="s2">in a kind of transcendence one is to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.560" end="00:07:58.400" style="s2">coupled to um</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.639" end="00:08:00.639" style="s2">well put it this way the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.400" end="00:08:01.840" style="s2">mind is wedded to the emergence of world</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.639" end="00:08:04.319" style="s2">and i don&#39;t mean the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.840" end="00:08:05.840" style="s2">thought i mean the emer like the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.319" end="00:08:07.840" style="s2">the way your mind has emerged</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:09.440" style="s2">developmentally the emergence of mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.840" end="00:08:12.720" style="s2">and the emergence of the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.440" end="00:08:14.879" style="s2">as an increasingly complex of complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.720" end="00:08:16.639" style="s2">and dynamic set of intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.879" end="00:08:20.720" style="s2">affordances for affinity</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.639" end="00:08:23.120" style="s2">and aspiration so i&#39;m going to use the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.720" end="00:08:25.120" style="s2">what that does is that couples us to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.120" end="00:08:26.400" style="s2">inexhaustible the moreness</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.120" end="00:08:28.639" style="s2">not just quantitatively but</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.400" end="00:08:30.560" style="s2">qualitatively but there&#39;s also that</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.639" end="00:08:32.800" style="s2">about us</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.560" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2">which i want to use a buddhist term</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.800" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2">which is our suchness</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.080" end="00:08:42.560" style="s2">it is if this direction is the direction</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:44.880" style="s2">of participation the moreness the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.560" end="00:08:47.519" style="s2">movement into mourners</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.880" end="00:08:49.839" style="s2">this is the suchness is the is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.519" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">direction towards individuation</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.839" end="00:08:56.920" style="s2">and the suchness is that about you</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:59.680" style="s2">that is resolutely um</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.920" end="00:09:01.360" style="s2">non-categorical that which that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.680" end="00:09:02.240" style="s2">it&#39;s that which you love in a person</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.360" end="00:09:04.720" style="s2">which you love</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.240" end="00:09:05.839" style="s2">the their uniqueness and i want i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.720" end="00:09:06.800" style="s2">like that term because it&#39;s so bound up</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.839" end="00:09:08.839" style="s2">with narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.800" end="00:09:10.560" style="s2">but when you pick up on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.839" end="00:09:13.040" style="s2">irreplaceable</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.560" end="00:09:14.800" style="s2">way in which that person can is and</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.040" end="00:09:16.800" style="s2">continues to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.800" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">right and you and you and you you get a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.800" end="00:09:20.480" style="s2">sense of oh my gosh</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.160" end="00:09:21.600" style="s2">right that that&#39;s the suchness the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.480" end="00:09:23.279" style="s2">buddhists claim that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.600" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">enlightenment is you get suchness for</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.279" end="00:09:28.880" style="s2">everything it&#39;s so it</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:28.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a way of um</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.360" end="00:09:34.640" style="s2">tailoring your cognition um</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.399" end="00:09:34.640" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.600" end="00:09:42.399" style="s2">the being mode um in everything</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.640" end="00:09:44.399" style="s2">and then what i&#39;m playing with is this</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.399" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">idea that though the individual</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.399" end="00:09:47.440" style="s2">the individuation and this is right out</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:49.279" style="s2">of tillic and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.440" end="00:09:52.320" style="s2">uh chris will tell you that this</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.279" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">individuation participation dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.320" end="00:09:59.040" style="s2">between the mourners and the suchness</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">that activity is soul between the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.040" end="00:10:03.200" style="s2">moreness and the suchness</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.880" end="00:10:04.480" style="s2">yeah so you mean between some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.200" end="00:10:08.079" style="s2">let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.480" end="00:10:11.360" style="s2">excessive life and and and just</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.079" end="00:10:13.680" style="s2">the simple existence the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.360" end="00:10:16.240" style="s2">the inexhaustible overflows the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:17.600" style="s2">and the way in which the uh the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:20.000" style="s2">inexhaustible in you</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.600" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">overflows any categories in which i try</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.000" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">to particularize you</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:26.480" style="s2">but nevertheless i&#39;m pointing something</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:28.000" style="s2">individuated and instantiated in you</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.480" end="00:10:29.920" style="s2">that is not individuated and</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.000" end="00:10:31.279" style="s2">instantiated in anything else</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.920" end="00:10:33.200" style="s2">so this is like trying to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.279" end="00:10:36.240" style="s2">indra&#39;s net and other ideas</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.200" end="00:10:39.120" style="s2">that um you presence</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.240" end="00:10:40.399" style="s2">the moreness in your suchness and your</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.120" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">suchness</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.399" end="00:10:47.519" style="s2">um that about you which</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.920" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">is not just not i want to use a</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.519" end="00:10:49.920" style="s2">distinction protocol it&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:52.399" style="s2">passive</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.920" end="00:10:53.440" style="s2">possibility but the pure potentiality</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.399" end="00:10:57.040" style="s2">the potential</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.440" end="00:11:01.600" style="s2">power potency and act of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.040" end="00:11:02.560" style="s2">right assume uh you know a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.600" end="00:11:05.680" style="s2">identities</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.560" end="00:11:07.360" style="s2">a variety of agent arena relationships</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.680" end="00:11:09.600" style="s2">and also assume this in your own</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.360" end="00:11:10.959" style="s2">idiosyncratic historical development</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.600" end="00:11:12.959" style="s2">yeah and i think we talked about with</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.959" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">that with zach that the soul is</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.959" end="00:11:16.480" style="s2">is not it&#39;s not a singular thing no no</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:19.360" style="s2">no it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.480" end="00:11:19.680" style="s2">multiplicity it&#39;s of potentials rather</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.360" end="00:11:22.959" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.680" end="00:11:26.800" style="s2">yeah yeah and so um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.959" end="00:11:30.320" style="s2">so yeah the soul is that within you</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.800" end="00:11:32.480" style="s2">uh well sorry one pole of the soul</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.320" end="00:11:34.320" style="s2">sounds like dr sorry one pole of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.480" end="00:11:37.760" style="s2">soul is that which in you</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.320" end="00:11:40.079" style="s2">has this inexhaustible capacity</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.760" end="00:11:43.040" style="s2">to do relevance realization and refit</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.079" end="00:11:44.959" style="s2">itself in evolving fashion to the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.040" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">and then the participatory side the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.959" end="00:11:48.880" style="s2">resident side</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:50.480" style="s2">is the fact and we experience it most in</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.880" end="00:11:54.639" style="s2">wonder and ah</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.480" end="00:11:54.639" style="s2">that the the world right</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.040" end="00:11:58.880" style="s2">the world discloses an inexhaustibleness</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.920" end="00:12:02.480" style="s2">that is always</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.880" end="00:12:05.680" style="s2">presencing through it and the soul</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:08.160" style="s2">is when those so</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.680" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">what i&#39;m trying to do and chris probably</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.160" end="00:12:10.399" style="s2">sees this</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:12.320" style="s2">by you making use of tilik&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.399" end="00:12:15.200" style="s2">individuation participation and talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.320" end="00:12:18.079" style="s2">about this a fining relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.200" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">this mutual it&#39;s not reflection that</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.079" end="00:12:20.480" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.639" end="00:12:21.920" style="s2">the moreness comes into the suchness and</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.480" end="00:12:25.200" style="s2">then the suchness</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.920" end="00:12:27.680" style="s2">right adds to the moreness of the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.200" end="00:12:28.240" style="s2">um right it&#39;s great when you can get</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.680" end="00:12:30.000" style="s2">this the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.240" end="00:12:31.519" style="s2">the handle of this vocabulary it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:33.440" style="s2">beautiful yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.519" end="00:12:35.120" style="s2">and and so what and then of course this</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.440" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">is deeply influenced with whitehead but</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.120" end="00:12:37.040" style="s2">i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:39.279" style="s2">i&#39;ll say one more thing and i&#39;ll let</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.040" end="00:12:41.839" style="s2">chris talk quickly what i&#39;m trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.279" end="00:12:44.240" style="s2">and again i mean this respectfully is</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.839" end="00:12:47.920" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to give</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.240" end="00:12:50.000" style="s2">i guess a non-theistic or secularized uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.920" end="00:12:52.639" style="s2">equivalent to what the soul&#39;s main</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.000" end="00:12:54.639" style="s2">function was which was to worship</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.639" end="00:12:56.000" style="s2">the soul&#39;s main function was to worship</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.639" end="00:12:58.560" style="s2">and descartes of course left</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.000" end="00:13:00.240" style="s2">that transformative of finding to</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.560" end="00:13:02.480" style="s2">transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.240" end="00:13:03.519" style="s2">right he left that out and when he</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.480" end="00:13:05.440" style="s2">collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.519" end="00:13:06.720" style="s2">um the soul into the self and then the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.440" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">self into</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.720" end="00:13:14.279" style="s2">the unchanging um center of subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.800" end="00:13:17.440" style="s2">um so i&#39;m trying i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.279" end="00:13:21.200" style="s2">reformulate reinventio soul</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.440" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">in a way that exacts and reappropriates</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.200" end="00:13:24.160" style="s2">in a respectful manner</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:26.320" style="s2">the soul&#39;s main function which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.160" end="00:13:29.440" style="s2">worship beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.320" end="00:13:31.279" style="s2">yeah and before chris speaks i wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.440" end="00:13:33.519" style="s2">the soul ever had a kind of fixed</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.279" end="00:13:35.200" style="s2">meaning if all of these terms kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.519" end="00:13:37.680" style="s2">they have to be reinvented all the time</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.200" end="00:13:38.959" style="s2">otherwise they become reified and</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.680" end="00:13:42.480" style="s2">they have they no longer have any</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.959" end="00:13:44.320" style="s2">meaning well the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.480" end="00:13:46.639" style="s2">things can become rarified in this way</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.320" end="00:13:48.079" style="s2">andrew they can be embedded in a mythos</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.639" end="00:13:50.560" style="s2">that stagnates and dies</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.079" end="00:13:51.839" style="s2">and that has not been replaced by any</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.560" end="00:13:54.480" style="s2">new emergent mythos</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.839" end="00:13:55.279" style="s2">that discloses new logos right and in</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.480" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">that sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.279" end="00:14:00.000" style="s2">they&#39;re trapped within and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.079" end="00:14:01.680" style="s2">chris&#39;s metaphor of the dying star</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.000" end="00:14:03.360" style="s2">is so appropriate they&#39;re trapped</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.680" end="00:14:03.920" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re sort of stuck on</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.360" end="00:14:05.839" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.920" end="00:14:09.120" style="s2">event horizon if i&#39;ll if i turn his</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.839" end="00:14:11.680" style="s2">dying star into a black hole</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.120" end="00:14:12.959" style="s2">right yeah and so i think i think our</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.680" end="00:14:14.639" style="s2">notion of soul</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.959" end="00:14:16.480" style="s2">has been lost interestingly in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.639" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">performing arts you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.480" end="00:14:18.959" style="s2">category of music and you know this much</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:21.440" style="s2">better than mine</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.959" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2">i do soul in which there was an attempt</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.440" end="00:14:26.079" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:29.600" style="s2">uh reinvent you soul as a particular way</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.079" end="00:14:30.399" style="s2">of you know connecting um through into</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:33.440" style="s2">music</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.399" end="00:14:35.839" style="s2">yeah well exactly i mean you have to you</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.440" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">can distinguish between music that has a</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.839" end="00:14:38.959" style="s2">soul</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:40.720" style="s2">yeah and music that doesn&#39;t have a soul</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.959" end="00:14:43.120" style="s2">i mean if you have a very fine</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.720" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">fine ear and the music that has its soul</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.120" end="00:14:46.240" style="s2">i think is connected</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:47.920" style="s2">with that inexhaustibility and the music</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.240" end="00:14:48.800" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t have a soul is just a</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.920" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">formulaic</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.800" end="00:14:54.160" style="s2">repetition of of something you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:58.320" style="s2">it might be very performative it might</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.160" end="00:15:01.600" style="s2">be very salient to use your term or</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.320" end="00:15:03.600" style="s2">and that and that uh that relationship</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.600" end="00:15:05.839" style="s2">uh that i&#39;m talking about of worship</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.600" end="00:15:09.040" style="s2">that individuation participation</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.839" end="00:15:12.480" style="s2">tonos a dynamic tension creative tension</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.040" end="00:15:14.880" style="s2">um that&#39;s very aspirational uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.480" end="00:15:16.639" style="s2">you are participating in the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.880" end="00:15:17.680" style="s2">second self while you&#39;re individuating</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.639" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">the current self</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.680" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">and reindividuating it and</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:23.120" style="s2">reindividuating it</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:24.959" style="s2">tapping into its suchness until you</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.120" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">actually come to appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.959" end="00:15:30.959" style="s2">and become um or asymptote towards the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:32.959" style="s2">sacred second self</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.959" end="00:15:34.560" style="s2">beautiful christopher i want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.959" end="00:15:36.880" style="s2">from you i want to hear you</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.560" end="00:15:37.680" style="s2">sometimes i&#39;ll add to that riff riff on</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.880" end="00:15:39.759" style="s2">on someone</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.680" end="00:15:42.320" style="s2">possibly to be added to that well i i</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.759" end="00:15:44.000" style="s2">guess yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.320" end="00:15:45.600" style="s2">unsurprisingly what i say is just going</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.000" end="00:15:46.320" style="s2">to be a recapitulation of what john just</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.600" end="00:15:49.360" style="s2">said yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.320" end="00:15:52.000" style="s2">chris chris come on</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.360" end="00:15:52.399" style="s2">humility hang on no no no i wasn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.000" end="00:15:54.160" style="s2">wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.399" end="00:15:55.680" style="s2">i wasn&#39;t i wasn&#39;t i wasn&#39;t courting</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.160" end="00:15:57.360" style="s2">contradiction by saying that at all i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.680" end="00:15:59.600" style="s2">just i&#39;m just trying to say that</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.360" end="00:16:01.120" style="s2">uh that was pretty comprehensive i i</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.600" end="00:16:04.240" style="s2">mean okay maybe i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.120" end="00:16:06.160" style="s2">put it i&#39;ll try and put it what you did</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.240" end="00:16:09.839" style="s2">john i&#39;ll try and maybe put</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.160" end="00:16:12.560" style="s2">pithily i to me that</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.839" end="00:16:13.839" style="s2">if i had to distill it down as a working</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.560" end="00:16:17.199" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.839" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">i would say that the soul when i what i</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.199" end="00:16:20.240" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.839" end="00:16:23.519" style="s2">soul to be is like the transitive</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.240" end="00:16:26.399" style="s2">property of the self that relates it</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.519" end="00:16:27.600" style="s2">to its own moreness i i always come back</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.399" end="00:16:31.199" style="s2">to thinking of soul</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.600" end="00:16:33.360" style="s2">as a an a as a relational aspect</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.199" end="00:16:35.120" style="s2">which helps to dislodge the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.360" end="00:16:36.639" style="s2">it&#39;s something fixed and entity fixed</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.120" end="00:16:38.880" style="s2">within time and space right</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.639" end="00:16:40.240" style="s2">if it has if it&#39;s fundamental nature is</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.880" end="00:16:43.360" style="s2">as a relational nature</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.240" end="00:16:45.839" style="s2">both expressive and impressive then its</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.360" end="00:16:47.839" style="s2">function in a very sort of guardian way</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.839" end="00:16:48.880" style="s2">its function is as a relation to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.839" end="00:16:52.720" style="s2">cultivated</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.880" end="00:16:55.680" style="s2">it&#39;s as a relation as the of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.720" end="00:16:55.680" style="s2">it it&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.519" end="00:17:03.680" style="s2">it is the intermediary aspect</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:07.360" style="s2">in the orchestra of self that</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.680" end="00:17:08.880" style="s2">bridges between the the suchness of its</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.360" end="00:17:10.720" style="s2">current composition</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.880" end="00:17:11.919" style="s2">to the moreness of the yet unheard</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.720" end="00:17:15.039" style="s2">melody right</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.919" end="00:17:17.439" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it it&#39;s the transitivity</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.039" end="00:17:20.000" style="s2">to me is the property of the soul that</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.439" end="00:17:21.839" style="s2">most eludes its definition</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.000" end="00:17:24.079" style="s2">because and and that also explains it</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.839" end="00:17:25.280" style="s2">sort of multi-vocality and its equivocal</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.079" end="00:17:27.199" style="s2">definitions right</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:29.200" style="s2">because it&#39;s if it&#39;s nature is as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.199" end="00:17:31.280" style="s2">dynamical form of relation</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.200" end="00:17:33.039" style="s2">then it&#39;s no wonder that we keep trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.280" end="00:17:36.559" style="s2">to voice definitions on it</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.039" end="00:17:40.799" style="s2">that it continually bucks and eludes</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.559" end="00:17:43.919" style="s2">so so i think that the the the as</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.799" end="00:17:47.039" style="s2">uh yeah when i think of the soul</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.919" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">the the best place to start for me</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.039" end="00:17:51.600" style="s2">is to understand the soul as the</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:54.160" style="s2">expression</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.600" end="00:17:56.799" style="s2">of the existential and ontological</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.160" end="00:17:57.360" style="s2">relation that we have with the aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.799" end="00:17:58.960" style="s2">self</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.360" end="00:18:01.840" style="s2">that is to be disclosed with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.960" end="00:18:01.840" style="s2">moreness of the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:05.919" style="s2">and that&#39;s perhaps why well i was</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:08.400" style="s2">thinking when when</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.919" end="00:18:10.240" style="s2">when john was was mentioning the soul</p>

<p begin="00:19:24.720" end="00:19:31.520" style="s2">so that what faith is is faith is</p>

<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:10.640" style="s2">when that is wedded to the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.799" end="00:20:11.760" style="s2">the world is constantly disclosing</p>

<p begin="00:20:11.760" end="00:20:16.320" style="s2">and then the two poles of that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.760" end="00:20:19.280" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a disclosure of</p>

<p begin="00:20:20.799" end="00:20:27.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s like two sides at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.400" end="00:20:29.520" style="s2">but there&#39;s also a demand put on me to</p>

<p begin="00:20:29.520" end="00:20:35.120" style="s2">to tap into the resources of my suchness</p>

<p begin="00:20:56.799" end="00:21:00.799" style="s2">i think it&#39;s entirely appropriate that</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.200" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">the definitions of faith and soul be</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.799" end="00:21:04.480" style="s2">understood conterminously because</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:06.559" style="s2">totally because it&#39;s it&#39;s almost as</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.480" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">though faith faith is a just</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.559" end="00:21:10.960" style="s2">is the described activity of the soul</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:13.200" style="s2">and so it&#39;s really i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:16.720" style="s2">impossible to think of them</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.200" end="00:21:18.880" style="s2">in as independent dynamics i think one</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.720" end="00:21:21.280" style="s2">one is somehow a property of the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.880" end="00:21:23.520" style="s2">so that the cultivation of soul</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.280" end="00:21:25.600" style="s2">manifests in faith and the cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.520" end="00:21:27.679" style="s2">of faith manifests in soul i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.600" end="00:21:30.320" style="s2">appropriate to understand them</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.679" end="00:21:31.200" style="s2">consistent in that manner i i would say</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.320" end="00:21:34.559" style="s2">that soul</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.200" end="00:21:38.320" style="s2">is the term for a power and</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.559" end="00:21:41.039" style="s2">faith is a term for the virtue</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.320" end="00:21:42.400" style="s2">uh that you know cultivates that power</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.039" end="00:21:44.240" style="s2">towards excellence</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.400" end="00:21:46.000" style="s2">the enacted worksheet so faith is</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.240" end="00:21:47.679" style="s2">related to virtue</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.000" end="00:21:49.120" style="s2">that&#39;s not very much just like this</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.679" end="00:21:50.320" style="s2">something i wanted to ask you about</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.120" end="00:21:52.799" style="s2">today also was this</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.320" end="00:21:53.520" style="s2">this word virtue because in peter</p>

<p begin="00:21:53.520" end="00:21:58.559" style="s2">blog there was a big discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.840" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">about virtue and um and he was saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.559" end="00:22:05.200" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.840" end="00:22:05.200" style="s2">um he made some kind of comment like um</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.440" end="00:22:08.480" style="s2">he says he loves virtue more than he</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.360" end="00:22:13.120" style="s2">could love even</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.480" end="00:22:16.080" style="s2">a woman or his wife or if</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.120" end="00:22:16.640" style="s2">that kind of that&#39;s what virtue means so</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.080" end="00:22:18.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.640" end="00:22:19.679" style="s2">that seems to be related to faith as</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.640" end="00:22:23.039" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.679" end="00:22:24.960" style="s2">yeah i mean so i i i</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.039" end="00:22:26.080" style="s2">let me try something that&#39;s close and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.960" end="00:22:29.200" style="s2">related</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.080" end="00:22:30.960" style="s2">um and that may help physicist um</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.200" end="00:22:32.480" style="s2">so i think of reverence and here i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.480" end="00:22:35.600" style="s2">because he explicitly argues that</p>

<p begin="00:22:35.600" end="00:22:39.280" style="s2">experience it&#39;s a virtue</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.600" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">um he&#39;s a little bit less clear about</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.280" end="00:22:44.000" style="s2">what the virtue is but his ex</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.120" end="00:22:45.679" style="s2">his examples um and the allusions to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.000" end="00:22:47.039" style="s2">platonic tradition make clear what the</p>

<p begin="00:22:51.520" end="00:22:54.000" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.240" end="00:22:58.080" style="s2">uh sorry reverence is the virtue that</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.000" end="00:22:58.080" style="s2">puts you into right relationship to awe</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.240" end="00:23:03.120" style="s2">right so that you are both excellently</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.919" end="00:23:06.000" style="s2">receptive</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.120" end="00:23:06.240" style="s2">and excellently that&#39;s the disclosure</p>

<p begin="00:23:06.240" end="00:23:10.240" style="s2">excellently responsive that&#39;s the demand</p>

<p begin="00:23:10.240" end="00:23:15.280" style="s2">so that you can tap into</p>

<p begin="00:23:17.360" end="00:23:24.240" style="s2">um and so reverence is that virtue</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.880" end="00:23:27.840" style="s2">faith is by the more encompassing virtue</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.240" end="00:23:31.200" style="s2">uh that you know right like i say that</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.840" end="00:23:32.799" style="s2">um alludes back to the notion of worship</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.200" end="00:23:35.520" style="s2">where we are trying to get into a</p>

<p begin="00:26:01.840" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">concrete um think about</p>

<p begin="00:26:20.799" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">for me oh i just had a good thought when</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.039" end="00:26:28.400" style="s2">you said i didn&#39;t mean to interrupt um</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.840" end="00:26:28.960" style="s2">when you say being faithful to your wife</p>

<p begin="00:26:31.600" end="00:26:35.279" style="s2">enormous if you look inside your mind</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.600" end="00:26:35.600" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re not always faithful you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.279" end="00:26:38.080" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.600" end="00:26:39.919" style="s2">we&#39;re not always faithful right in our</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.080" end="00:26:42.320" style="s2">in our hearts and minds</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.919" end="00:26:43.039" style="s2">but it&#39;s what we do so that it just gave</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.320" end="00:26:45.120" style="s2">me that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.039" end="00:26:46.640" style="s2">that thought yeah it is it is and notice</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.120" end="00:26:48.799" style="s2">how it&#39;s interdefining</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.640" end="00:26:51.039" style="s2">interdefined with love too and yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.799" end="00:26:52.320" style="s2">mean and that&#39;s if we make a sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.039" end="00:26:54.799" style="s2">on some level we might</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.320" end="00:26:55.840" style="s2">have an attraction to other people or or</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.799" end="00:26:57.679" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:27:00.159" style="s2">yeah but we make a sacrifice and we</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.679" end="00:27:03.600" style="s2">decide to to limit ourselves to that</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.159" end="00:27:06.720" style="s2">that um that relationship which actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.600" end="00:27:08.559" style="s2">you know makes our horizon larger</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.720" end="00:27:10.640" style="s2">yes exactly and that was the point i</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.559" end="00:27:11.840" style="s2">want to make like your faithfulness to</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.640" end="00:27:15.520" style="s2">your partner</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.840" end="00:27:17.919" style="s2">isn&#39;t about any sense of</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.520" end="00:27:20.399" style="s2">closure or the fact that she can be</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.919" end="00:27:22.640" style="s2">captured by a set of beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.399" end="00:27:23.679" style="s2">so when you the virtue of faithfulness</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.640" end="00:27:26.080" style="s2">is to have</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.679" end="00:27:27.600" style="s2">of course you have sentences you utter</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.080" end="00:27:31.039" style="s2">but it&#39;s also a virtue</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.600" end="00:27:33.840" style="s2">also requires skills</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.039" end="00:27:35.520" style="s2">it requires a sensibility for</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.840" end="00:27:38.720" style="s2">perspective knowing</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.520" end="00:27:40.240" style="s2">right and and it requires a kind of cell</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.720" end="00:27:41.279" style="s2">thing for the participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.240" end="00:27:43.200" style="s2">virtues</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.279" end="00:27:45.760" style="s2">they do they link all the knowings</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.200" end="00:27:47.600" style="s2">together such that what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.760" end="00:27:48.960" style="s2">is as you said you&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.600" end="00:27:52.240" style="s2">affording your</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.960" end="00:27:54.399" style="s2">wife&#39;s moreness</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.240" end="00:27:56.480" style="s2">right and how but always always in</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.399" end="00:27:58.960" style="s2">recognition of her suchness she&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.480" end="00:28:00.640" style="s2">abstract principle to you yeah so you</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.960" end="00:28:01.440" style="s2">are affordable it&#39;s not your property or</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.640" end="00:28:03.840" style="s2">possession</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.440" end="00:28:05.039" style="s2">or any of those things that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.840" end="00:28:06.880" style="s2">otherwise if you have that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.039" end="00:28:08.640" style="s2">relationship it&#39;s a relationship without</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.880" end="00:28:10.240" style="s2">faith isn&#39;t it it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.640" end="00:28:12.159" style="s2">so there&#39;s definitely not she&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.240" end="00:28:13.120" style="s2">she&#39;s so she&#39;s not categorical she has</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.159" end="00:28:15.039" style="s2">suchness</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.120" end="00:28:16.480" style="s2">but she&#39;s also a doorway to the moreness</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.039" end="00:28:17.600" style="s2">of the world right she&#39;s also not just</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.480" end="00:28:19.200" style="s2">an abstract</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.600" end="00:28:21.360" style="s2">principal she&#39;s neither just an abstract</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.200" end="00:28:22.080" style="s2">principle or just a simple concrete</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.360" end="00:28:25.120" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.080" end="00:28:26.240" style="s2">she is a person which is not either an</p>

<p begin="00:28:26.240" end="00:28:29.440" style="s2">nor a concrete thing but something</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.600" end="00:28:31.039" style="s2">beyond them something like corban would</p>

<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">that within the faithful relationship is</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.360" end="00:29:35.200" style="s2">the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:36.399" style="s2">the capacity for inexhaustible</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.200" end="00:29:38.640" style="s2">reinvention</p>

<p begin="00:30:00.880" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">absurdity right because when a</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.080" end="00:30:05.520" style="s2">relationship becomes so unpredictable</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:07.520" style="s2">then it verges into absurdity exactly</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.520" end="00:30:10.720" style="s2">but it is not so predictable</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.520" end="00:30:12.080" style="s2">as to become that&#39;s another kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.720" end="00:30:14.640" style="s2">absurdity</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.080" end="00:30:17.120" style="s2">that&#39;s right yeah it&#39;s predictable total</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.640" end="00:30:20.559" style="s2">predictableness is a is absurd and</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.120" end="00:30:21.760" style="s2">just as subtle chaos is yeah engineering</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.559" end="00:30:23.200" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s right that&#39;s the virtual</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.760" end="00:30:24.159" style="s2">engineering right you&#39;re trying to steer</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.200" end="00:30:25.679" style="s2">between those</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.159" end="00:30:27.679" style="s2">yeah so there&#39;s something so the</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.679" end="00:30:29.440" style="s2">property so that the the property of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.679" end="00:30:32.559" style="s2">faith in a relationship is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.440" end="00:30:33.760" style="s2">which keeps its poises ongoing and</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.559" end="00:30:35.520" style="s2">replenishing</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.760" end="00:30:36.880" style="s2">right so that when you when you turn to</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.520" end="00:30:38.880" style="s2">the relationship that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.880" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s why faithful relationships</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.880" end="00:30:42.640" style="s2">are a font for existential renewal in</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:45.360" style="s2">some respect right</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.640" end="00:30:46.720" style="s2">because you find yourself recovered and</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.360" end="00:30:48.840" style="s2">recollected anew</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.720" end="00:30:50.159" style="s2">in a faithful relationship precisely</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.840" end="00:30:52.080" style="s2">because it</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.159" end="00:30:53.600" style="s2">intermediates the moreness of the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.080" end="00:30:57.279" style="s2">as well as the moreness of</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.600" end="00:30:58.480" style="s2">yourself and so the the the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.279" end="00:31:01.840" style="s2">self police for</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.480" end="00:31:03.919" style="s2">the auto poetic evolutionary quality to</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.840" end="00:31:05.039" style="s2">a faithful relationship is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.919" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">that what makes it</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.039" end="00:31:08.880" style="s2">a font of an exhaustibility yes and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:11.840" style="s2">notice</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.880" end="00:31:13.600" style="s2">notice how as you are participating in</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.840" end="00:31:17.360" style="s2">the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.600" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">right and right like chris chris said</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.360" end="00:31:21.200" style="s2">you&#39;re also internalizing the other you</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.840" end="00:31:23.760" style="s2">be you individuate</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.200" end="00:31:25.120" style="s2">your suchness through your capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.760" end="00:31:27.279" style="s2">internalize other people</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.120" end="00:31:28.320" style="s2">yes and this is what dialogue says i</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.279" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">mean this is what deal</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.320" end="00:31:31.760" style="s2">does right this is the sacramental</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:33.039" style="s2">property of dialogue is precisely that</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.760" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">by the revelation of thou</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.039" end="00:31:36.640" style="s2">you are so revealed and in your</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:38.320" style="s2">revelation that was more revealed and</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.640" end="00:31:39.600" style="s2">then the cycling that takes place as a</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.320" end="00:31:42.159" style="s2">consequence of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.600" end="00:31:43.039" style="s2">opens the perspective of the diologos to</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.159" end="00:31:44.480" style="s2">the to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.039" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2">to the sort of something like the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:49.600" style="s2">ontological vertex</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">that is that is available with it</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.600" end="00:31:54.559" style="s2">with now available by by virtue of in</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:56.240" style="s2">virtue i should say in virtue i love</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.559" end="00:31:57.039" style="s2">that expression because i think exactly</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:32:00.720" style="s2">that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.039" end="00:32:01.760" style="s2">in virtue of that faith</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.720" end="00:32:03.679" style="s2">there&#39;s something else that i was</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.760" end="00:32:04.960" style="s2">thinking about is that is the the uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.679" end="00:32:06.320" style="s2">erotic aspect</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.960" end="00:32:08.399" style="s2">i was just going to do that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.320" end="00:32:10.720" style="s2">what yeah and and i i</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.399" end="00:32:11.679" style="s2">in these conversations often we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.720" end="00:32:14.159" style="s2">bunch of men</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.679" end="00:32:15.919" style="s2">talking it seems to be um there are</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.159" end="00:32:18.320" style="s2">women involved as well and i hope more</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.919" end="00:32:20.640" style="s2">and more women get involved and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.320" end="00:32:21.679" style="s2">there&#39;s this invocation of the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.640" end="00:32:23.760" style="s2">which happens</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.679" end="00:32:24.880" style="s2">and then that seems to to bring this</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.760" end="00:32:27.760" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.880" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">in in seoul the conversation if i if i</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.760" end="00:32:31.279" style="s2">could say so and i know that</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:33.200" style="s2">in hebrew there i i remember that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.279" end="00:32:34.480" style="s2">soul is feminine or the holy spirit is</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.200" end="00:32:39.120" style="s2">feminine</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.480" end="00:32:41.200" style="s2">in other languages it&#39;s masculine but</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.120" end="00:32:43.279" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s inappropriate to</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.200" end="00:32:45.440" style="s2">i mean i i think that way all the time</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.279" end="00:32:47.039" style="s2">in terms of masculine feminine</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.440" end="00:32:48.320" style="s2">polarities but people seem to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.039" end="00:32:50.399" style="s2">offended when you well i</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.320" end="00:32:51.760" style="s2">i prefer the taoist polarities of yin</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.399" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2">and yang because they</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.760" end="00:32:56.320" style="s2">are more comprehensive they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:58.480" style="s2">limited to biological creatures um</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:32:59.360" style="s2">and uh and then they also dispose us</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.480" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.360" end="00:33:02.720" style="s2">not getting overly politicized about</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.279" end="00:33:03.600" style="s2">something important that we need to talk</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.720" end="00:33:06.799" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.600" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">i i was going to bring up the uh i was</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.799" end="00:33:08.720" style="s2">going to bring up that connection</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.000" end="00:33:12.000" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.720" end="00:33:14.240" style="s2">the moreness into suchness and</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.000" end="00:33:16.080" style="s2">and when it sort of affines our</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.240" end="00:33:17.200" style="s2">individuation to participation when we</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.080" end="00:33:19.760" style="s2">get that appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.200" end="00:33:20.320" style="s2">toenails that right relationship i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.760" end="00:33:23.360" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.320" end="00:33:26.000" style="s2">that&#39;s really the experience of beauty</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.360" end="00:33:27.919" style="s2">where i want to bring beauty and han&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.000" end="00:33:28.480" style="s2">book on saving beauty and skarry&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.919" end="00:33:29.760" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.480" end="00:33:31.760" style="s2">beauty i think are really really</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.760" end="00:33:32.559" style="s2">important works on recent works on</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.760" end="00:33:34.799" style="s2">beauty</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.559" end="00:33:35.679" style="s2">because because what beauty is is beauty</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.799" end="00:33:39.200" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.679" end="00:33:42.320" style="s2">exactly like scary says you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.200" end="00:33:44.480" style="s2">you come upon a beautiful tree</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.320" end="00:33:46.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s two things you say geez i</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.480" end="00:33:49.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t realize trees could be like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.960" end="00:33:52.000" style="s2">right there&#39;s the moreness but then you</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.440" end="00:33:54.640" style="s2">you realize that this tree is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.000" end="00:33:55.200" style="s2">in the experience of beauty unique and</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.640" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.200" end="00:33:58.960" style="s2">from all other trees so right so the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:01.120" style="s2">tree has a soul in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.960" end="00:34:02.399" style="s2">yeah yeah the tree has a soul and sets</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.120" end="00:34:04.960" style="s2">not in any animism</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.399" end="00:34:06.559" style="s2">i think animism is a for us an</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.960" end="00:34:09.200" style="s2">inaccessible mythos</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.559" end="00:34:10.159" style="s2">uh that that uh symbolized that uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.200" end="00:34:13.280" style="s2">correctly</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.159" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">uh but yeah i i think in that sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.280" end="00:34:16.480" style="s2">a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:18.000" style="s2">animation where animation also means uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.480" end="00:34:22.480" style="s2">to set things into motion</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.000" end="00:34:26.159" style="s2">uh right uh so i think beauty is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.480" end="00:34:27.760" style="s2">that experience it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.159" end="00:34:29.679" style="s2">most of the time we&#39;re doing relevance</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.760" end="00:34:32.560" style="s2">realization because the goal</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.679" end="00:34:34.720" style="s2">is to produce relevance but sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.560" end="00:34:37.119" style="s2">the relevance realization machinery</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.720" end="00:34:39.280" style="s2">is in the service of realization it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.119" end="00:34:41.119" style="s2">the service of disclosing the moreness</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.280" end="00:34:43.599" style="s2">into touchness of everything</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.119" end="00:34:45.200" style="s2">it&#39;s in service of beautifying the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.599" end="00:34:48.399" style="s2">and that&#39;s a kind of flip</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.200" end="00:34:50.879" style="s2">uh right where the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.399" end="00:34:52.079" style="s2">you know the work though what i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.879" end="00:34:53.839" style="s2">to do is actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.079" end="00:34:55.440" style="s2">put myself and this is like the worship</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.839" end="00:34:57.520" style="s2">and the reverence i&#39;m trying to put my</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.440" end="00:35:00.960" style="s2">relevance realization machinery</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.520" end="00:35:01.760" style="s2">in service it&#39;s not subjectively</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.960" end="00:35:04.480" style="s2">oriented</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.760" end="00:35:06.400" style="s2">i&#39;m putting it in service transactively</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.480" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">to the disclosure</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.400" end="00:35:11.839" style="s2">in beauty of you know how</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.839" end="00:35:13.440" style="s2">all of the universe had to have existed</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.839" end="00:35:16.480" style="s2">the way it did for this</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.440" end="00:35:17.119" style="s2">cup to be the way it is and to be here</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.480" end="00:35:18.640" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.119" end="00:35:20.320" style="s2">the way it is and have all the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.640" end="00:35:22.560" style="s2">properties that it has</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.320" end="00:35:23.359" style="s2">that you cannot possibly grasp right</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.560" end="00:35:26.560" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.359" end="00:35:29.040" style="s2">right now and so and so</p>

<p begin="00:35:55.280" end="00:35:59.200" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like beauty is like the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.200" end="00:36:00.480" style="s2">like the it&#39;s like the physionomy of the</p>

<p begin="00:36:04.400" end="00:36:06.960" style="s2">the mourners is precisely what strikes</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.160" end="00:36:08.960" style="s2">us as beauty</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.960" end="00:36:10.480" style="s2">so and then you have a word for this</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.960" end="00:36:11.359" style="s2">that i think i think you&#39;d like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.480" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">going to give it to you and see if you</p>

<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:15.280" style="s2">it i think in this self it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.680" end="00:36:18.160" style="s2">interface where</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.280" end="00:36:19.839" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing we can face the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.160" end="00:36:23.119" style="s2">and we give it a way of facing</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.839" end="00:36:24.960" style="s2">us yes and also</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.119" end="00:36:26.160" style="s2">also picking up on the technological</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.960" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">sense of interface</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.160" end="00:36:31.119" style="s2">as that which defines and conforms two</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:33.119" style="s2">things together so they can</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.119" end="00:36:34.640" style="s2">mutually function together i thought you</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.119" end="00:36:36.160" style="s2">might want to play with that</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.640" end="00:36:37.760" style="s2">yeah i will play with that well i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.160" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">it&#39;s entire it&#39;s also there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.760" end="00:36:39.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.640" end="00:36:41.040" style="s2">in sort of a tongue-in-cheek way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.839" end="00:36:41.920" style="s2">also appropriate to this exact</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.040" end="00:36:45.599" style="s2">circumstance because</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.920" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">exactly right now is interfacing um</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.599" end="00:36:49.440" style="s2">and and and so go ahead andrew well i</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.240" end="00:36:52.720" style="s2">just gotta say that</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.440" end="00:36:55.760" style="s2">yeah the interface being beauty but</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.720" end="00:36:57.599" style="s2">there&#39;s also a an ugliness to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.760" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">of interface as well it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.599" end="00:37:01.359" style="s2">you need to have this technological</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">barrier</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:04.720" style="s2">between us or something like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.119" end="00:37:05.440" style="s2">just a feeling i got when i when i heard</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.720" end="00:37:08.400" style="s2">the word</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.440" end="00:37:09.119" style="s2">yeah exactly that and so we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.400" end="00:37:10.880" style="s2">get out</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.119" end="00:37:12.960" style="s2">i i mean i want to bring back the face</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.880" end="00:37:14.720" style="s2">within interface this is why i brought</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.960" end="00:37:16.240" style="s2">up tyler in the beginning because he</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.720" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">was talking about this technological</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:19.760" style="s2">platform and then i had two feelings</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">about that i had one feeling about</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.760" end="00:37:23.280" style="s2">yay great little be creative and then a</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:26.480" style="s2">other feeling of like</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.280" end="00:37:28.640" style="s2">getting completely consumed by by this</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.480" end="00:37:31.440" style="s2">machine that is just devouring all our</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.640" end="00:37:34.560" style="s2">creative um</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.440" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">you know acts and potentials i</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.560" end="00:37:41.280" style="s2">think that&#39;s right um i but</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:41.760" style="s2">i think i think the technology is what</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.280" end="00:37:43.520" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.760" end="00:37:45.280" style="s2">in the sense sorry that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.520" end="00:37:48.480" style="s2">trivializing what i mean is</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.280" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">um it is a power that has not</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.480" end="00:37:53.680" style="s2">been coupled to virtue</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.839" end="00:37:55.200" style="s2">there is nothing in virtue to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.680" end="00:37:58.400" style="s2">chris in which</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.200" end="00:37:59.680" style="s2">yet uh that we have decided uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.400" end="00:38:01.440" style="s2">you know how we&#39;re going to actualize</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.680" end="00:38:02.000" style="s2">the potential of this you wouldn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.440" end="00:38:03.359" style="s2">it to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.000" end="00:38:05.839" style="s2">ver you wouldn&#39;t want a machine to have</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.359" end="00:38:07.760" style="s2">virtue either that in a sense that has</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.839" end="00:38:10.480" style="s2">to be a uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.760" end="00:38:10.800" style="s2">um well i don&#39;t know about that i i i</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.480" end="00:38:12.720" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.800" end="00:38:13.920" style="s2">yeah i i i actually would argue the</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.720" end="00:38:15.520" style="s2">other way i think</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.920" end="00:38:16.960" style="s2">as as we try to give them intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.520" end="00:38:18.160" style="s2">we better be giving them virtues of</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.960" end="00:38:20.079" style="s2">rationality and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.160" end="00:38:22.320" style="s2">but that&#39;s another argument i think what</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.079" end="00:38:25.280" style="s2">what tyler was trying to point out is</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.320" end="00:38:26.000" style="s2">what&#39;s happening on the discord servers</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.280" end="00:38:28.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.000" end="00:38:30.640" style="s2">is a particularly powerful way in which</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.640" end="00:38:33.040" style="s2">people are appropriating</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.640" end="00:38:34.000" style="s2">the interface medium in order to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.040" end="00:38:36.000" style="s2">interfacing</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.000" end="00:38:38.079" style="s2">the way i&#39;m talking about it right now</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.000" end="00:38:41.119" style="s2">in order to try and create</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.079" end="00:38:43.520" style="s2">um the communitas and the distributed</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.119" end="00:38:44.240" style="s2">cognition for the reculturation of our</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.520" end="00:38:46.720" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.240" end="00:38:47.680" style="s2">stealing the culture uh from the way it</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.720" end="00:38:50.160" style="s2">is now frozen</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.680" end="00:38:51.599" style="s2">in sort of um more abundant</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.160" end="00:38:52.320" style="s2">normativities and more abundant</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.599" end="00:38:54.720" style="s2">structures</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.320" end="00:38:56.560" style="s2">and reculturate i mean that&#39;s what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.720" end="00:38:57.839" style="s2">based if you that&#39;s what he&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.560" end="00:39:00.480" style="s2">arguing for</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.839" end="00:39:01.280" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what i&#39;m trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.480" end="00:39:05.760" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.280" end="00:39:08.480" style="s2">that um there&#39;s a way in which we could</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.760" end="00:39:11.119" style="s2">virtue we could uh we could appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.480" end="00:39:14.400" style="s2">in virtue the potential of this medium</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.119" end="00:39:16.720" style="s2">um so that we can reculture</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.400" end="00:39:18.560" style="s2">in a really powerful way and recognize</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.720" end="00:39:21.839" style="s2">and re-culture and recognize</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.560" end="00:39:24.000" style="s2">in an interdependent fashion</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.839" end="00:39:25.359" style="s2">and so the people that attend these i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.000" end="00:39:25.839" style="s2">sorry this will actually circle back</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.359" end="00:39:27.920" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.839" end="00:39:29.359" style="s2">the people that attend these discord</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.920" end="00:39:33.040" style="s2">services are there</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:33.520" style="s2">in good faith they&#39;re in good faith and</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.040" end="00:39:35.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.520" end="00:39:37.119" style="s2">faithfulness they don&#39;t have an ulterior</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.920" end="00:39:39.920" style="s2">motive</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:41.839" style="s2">they&#39;re just doing it for itself because</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.920" end="00:39:42.960" style="s2">they want to stay wedded to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.839" end="00:39:46.240" style="s2">emerging</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.960" end="00:39:46.800" style="s2">they have a sense of they have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.240" end="00:39:49.280" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.800" end="00:39:51.200" style="s2">finding themselves and finding the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.280" end="00:39:52.480" style="s2">in the deal logos and the emerging</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.200" end="00:39:54.960" style="s2">community around it</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.480" end="00:39:56.000" style="s2">and so they want they want they love the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.960" end="00:39:58.320" style="s2">beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.000" end="00:39:59.280" style="s2">that and they are seduced in the proper</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.320" end="00:40:02.320" style="s2">sense of the word</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.280" end="00:40:04.400" style="s2">by the erotic aspect of it right they</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.320" end="00:40:06.880" style="s2">are seduced into wanting to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.400" end="00:40:08.880" style="s2">continuity of contact with it so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.880" end="00:40:10.000" style="s2">this when you say seduction there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.880" end="00:40:12.720" style="s2">incredible darkness</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.000" end="00:40:14.800" style="s2">and danger at the same time that&#39;s why i</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.720" end="00:40:16.560" style="s2">don&#39;t want to forget about that right</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.800" end="00:40:17.839" style="s2">no no no no we&#39;re talking about whatever</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.560" end="00:40:21.119" style="s2">it is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.839" end="00:40:21.599" style="s2">there is there is go ahead chris i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.119" end="00:40:24.640" style="s2">philly</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.599" end="00:40:26.480" style="s2">so i think in some sense philia</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.640" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">i think so taking the model of these</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.480" end="00:40:30.560" style="s2">these dialogue i think is</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:32.880" style="s2">appropriate because i think what what</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.560" end="00:40:35.520" style="s2">the presence of philia does</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.880" end="00:40:37.119" style="s2">is it essentially creates a matrix for</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.520" end="00:40:38.960" style="s2">the cultivation of eros right and for</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.119" end="00:40:41.200" style="s2">the transmutation of eras into something</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.960" end="00:40:44.160" style="s2">like an agapic form of oesis</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.200" end="00:40:46.160" style="s2">so you know eros eros of course can be</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.160" end="00:40:47.839" style="s2">creative or consumptive depending on its</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.160" end="00:40:49.599" style="s2">particular valence but i think one of</p>

<p begin="00:41:38.000" end="00:41:42.400" style="s2">is so it&#39;s such a fundamental starting</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.079" end="00:41:43.359" style="s2">point because what it seems to do is it</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.400" end="00:41:46.640" style="s2">seems to</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.359" end="00:41:49.520" style="s2">bound the arena of play</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.640" end="00:41:50.400" style="s2">in such a way that the eros becomes a</p>

<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:06.720" style="s2">and it makes me think of the campfire</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.119" end="00:42:07.610" style="s2">again you said you said of course</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.720" end="00:42:09.599" style="s2">there&#39;s a circle and</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.610" end="00:42:11.599" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.599" end="00:42:12.960" style="s2">of course so so there&#39;s something really</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.599" end="00:42:15.040" style="s2">really central then</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.960" end="00:42:16.480" style="s2">about and and i think this will come out</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.040" end="00:42:18.079" style="s2">you know as this as this</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.480" end="00:42:19.680" style="s2">we work to refine this more and more i</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.079" end="00:42:22.319" style="s2">think it&#39;s going to become really</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.680" end="00:42:24.640" style="s2">essential to understand how this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.319" end="00:42:27.520" style="s2">sequenced and to understand how it</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.640" end="00:42:28.560" style="s2">how you know what what the proper</p>

<p begin="00:42:28.560" end="00:42:32.400" style="s2">in order for this to happen reliably but</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.040" end="00:42:33.200" style="s2">i think that&#39;s why there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.400" end="00:42:34.880" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.200" end="00:42:36.560" style="s2">there&#39;s something about cordoning off</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.880" end="00:42:38.560" style="s2">the interpersonal arena</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.560" end="00:42:41.040" style="s2">in such a way then that it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.560" end="00:42:44.079" style="s2">proper symbolic body</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.040" end="00:42:45.920" style="s2">for the transmutation of eros</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.079" end="00:42:47.760" style="s2">because you&#39;re right andrew it can be</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.920" end="00:42:50.720" style="s2">profoundly destructive</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.760" end="00:42:53.119" style="s2">and and it can feed it can feed and</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.720" end="00:42:54.319" style="s2">dilate every narcissistic impulse we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.119" end="00:42:56.319" style="s2">possibly have</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.319" end="00:42:57.839" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a very very careful game</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.319" end="00:42:58.880" style="s2">that we have to make to play to make</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.839" end="00:43:00.319" style="s2">sure that doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.880" end="00:43:02.079" style="s2">well when you were talking i was</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.319" end="00:43:02.560" style="s2">reminded of you know my own tradition</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.079" end="00:43:04.720" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.560" end="00:43:05.839" style="s2">of practices of psychotechnologies which</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.720" end="00:43:08.560" style="s2">is tantra and</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.839" end="00:43:10.319" style="s2">tantric buddhism and of course tantric</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.560" end="00:43:12.160" style="s2">buddhism is not about removing those</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.319" end="00:43:13.440" style="s2">kind of darknesses or those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.160" end="00:43:15.119" style="s2">passions or those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.440" end="00:43:16.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not about doing away with them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.119" end="00:43:18.800" style="s2">about it&#39;s always about</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.640" end="00:43:21.040" style="s2">transmutation of transformation exactly</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.800" end="00:43:21.040" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.359" end="00:43:24.480" style="s2">so i mean the let&#39;s remember we are</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.839" end="00:43:25.680" style="s2">talking and</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.480" end="00:43:27.520" style="s2">it&#39;s appropriate that we are we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.680" end="00:43:30.079" style="s2">talking about soul</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.520" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">and faith but we&#39;re also talk and love</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.079" end="00:43:33.119" style="s2">and beauty</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.720" end="00:43:35.440" style="s2">we&#39;re also talking about virtue and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.119" end="00:43:38.560" style="s2">that&#39;s why the virtues that</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.440" end="00:43:41.760" style="s2">are cultivated to ameliorate</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.560" end="00:43:44.079" style="s2">and help us perhaps grow out of</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.760" end="00:43:44.960" style="s2">self-deceptive behavior is bound up in</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.079" end="00:43:47.040" style="s2">this reason</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.960" end="00:43:48.560" style="s2">rationality and andrew you know that i</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.040" end="00:43:51.920" style="s2">have a much broader view of this</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.560" end="00:43:55.280" style="s2">yes yes yeah so i i think reason</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.920" end="00:43:56.800" style="s2">and rationality and ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.280" end="00:43:58.720" style="s2">you know the interpenetration of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.800" end="00:44:00.720" style="s2">intellectual virtue is like</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.720" end="00:44:01.760" style="s2">reason and the ethical virtues like</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.720" end="00:44:04.000" style="s2">courage right</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.760" end="00:44:04.960" style="s2">they come together in that superlative</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.000" end="00:44:08.480" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.960" end="00:44:10.319" style="s2">virtue which is wisdom do you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.480" end="00:44:12.079" style="s2">people have to be cultivating wisdom so</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.319" end="00:44:15.520" style="s2">dial dial logos</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.079" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">this is the point that uh you know that</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.520" end="00:44:19.520" style="s2">well i i i don&#39;t mean to make it sound</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:22.640" style="s2">like a guy is not responsive he has been</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.520" end="00:44:25.599" style="s2">immensely responsive to it but to bring</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.640" end="00:44:26.960" style="s2">back you know the sapiential aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.599" end="00:44:30.000" style="s2">to bring back</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.960" end="00:44:32.000" style="s2">the cultivation of wisdom into right</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.000" end="00:44:34.000" style="s2">these dialogic practices that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.000" end="00:44:35.720" style="s2">the core things of dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.000" end="00:44:37.119" style="s2">right is to have the deep</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.720" end="00:44:41.280" style="s2">interpenetration</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.119" end="00:44:41.280" style="s2">of the right the</p>

<p begin="00:44:44.640" end="00:44:51.200" style="s2">and realization of uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.839" end="00:44:53.599" style="s2">self-deception coupled to</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.200" end="00:44:55.280" style="s2">right the participation in the overflow</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.599" end="00:44:58.640" style="s2">that&#39;s afforded by dialectic they</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.280" end="00:45:00.319" style="s2">they are your point andrew actually says</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.640" end="00:45:01.920" style="s2">one of the things i&#39;ve been arguing for</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.319" end="00:45:03.680" style="s2">philosophy is not</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.920" end="00:45:05.599" style="s2">just circling it&#39;s not just</p>

<p begin="00:46:37.440" end="00:46:41.119" style="s2">in the form of your own understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.440" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">yourself and in the form of your</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.119" end="00:46:44.560" style="s2">understanding of the other person right</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.480" end="00:46:47.839" style="s2">the sensibility transcendence of it</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.560" end="00:46:50.960" style="s2">is such that it it is it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.839" end="00:46:52.640" style="s2">endlessly dis infinitely discoverable</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.960" end="00:46:54.400" style="s2">right there&#39;s a property of it that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.640" end="00:46:55.520" style="s2">infinitely discoverable and so then that</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.400" end="00:46:58.880" style="s2">property</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.520" end="00:47:01.280" style="s2">becomes host i think to</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.880" end="00:47:02.160" style="s2">the kind of infinite discoverability</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.280" end="00:47:05.119" style="s2">that happens</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.160" end="00:47:06.079" style="s2">in anagogi maybe home is better than</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.119" end="00:47:09.200" style="s2">host</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.079" end="00:47:10.079" style="s2">right um and it&#39;s all yeah that&#39;s but i</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.200" end="00:47:11.520" style="s2">like going beyond</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.079" end="00:47:13.920" style="s2">itself because it picks up on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.520" end="00:47:16.400" style="s2">sacramental ah</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.920" end="00:47:18.400" style="s2">valence of the exercise but i think home</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.400" end="00:47:20.079" style="s2">is also appropriate it&#39;s both really</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.400" end="00:47:21.760" style="s2">well that&#39;s good that&#39;s good i like that</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:24.640" style="s2">that&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.760" end="00:47:26.000" style="s2">so i mean you know again to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.640" end="00:47:29.200" style="s2">the the worship</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.000" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">all of this is uh to you know to get</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.200" end="00:47:34.240" style="s2">back into sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.200" end="00:47:35.920" style="s2">a liturgical relationship it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.240" end="00:47:36.880" style="s2">how religious these discussions are</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.920" end="00:47:38.720" style="s2">becoming right</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.880" end="00:47:40.079" style="s2">oh yeah despite the you know even though</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.720" end="00:47:41.520" style="s2">we&#39;re where the religion</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.079" end="00:47:43.280" style="s2">we&#39;re speaking of the religion that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.520" end="00:47:46.000" style="s2">not the religion yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.280" end="00:47:48.000" style="s2">more deeply religious almost the more we</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.000" end="00:47:48.559" style="s2">get into all these things and we find</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.000" end="00:47:50.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.559" end="00:47:52.480" style="s2">all these notions like faith and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.800" end="00:47:55.760" style="s2">worship and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.480" end="00:47:58.160" style="s2">and um you know transcendence are</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.760" end="00:47:59.520" style="s2">are really what&#39;s all about right but we</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.160" end="00:48:01.440" style="s2">also find virtue</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.520" end="00:48:03.280" style="s2">and we also find wisdom we also find</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.440" end="00:48:06.319" style="s2">rationality that&#39;s why i</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.280" end="00:48:09.359" style="s2">i almost always affix socratic</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.319" end="00:48:11.520" style="s2">to faith socratic faith um</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.359" end="00:48:12.480" style="s2">because that&#39;s what&#39;s so amazing about</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.520" end="00:48:15.280" style="s2">socrates</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.480" end="00:48:16.240" style="s2">is the way he weds himself and right to</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.280" end="00:48:18.800" style="s2">the other</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.240" end="00:48:20.079" style="s2">um and that&#39;s his commented on in in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.800" end="00:48:22.079" style="s2">dialogues um</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.079" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">because he&#39;s a tip he has a suchness</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.079" end="00:48:27.760" style="s2">about him that allows him to</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.400" end="00:48:30.960" style="s2">reform himself to anybody he&#39;s with</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.760" end="00:48:32.800" style="s2">right and he he&#39;s a sort of a midwife to</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.960" end="00:48:35.359" style="s2">them he helps them give birth</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.800" end="00:48:37.440" style="s2">but he also has this faith in the logos</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.359" end="00:48:38.960" style="s2">he is willing to follow the argument and</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.440" end="00:48:39.520" style="s2">this is why it also requires the virtue</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.960" end="00:48:40.880" style="s2">of courage</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.520" end="00:48:43.599" style="s2">he&#39;s willing to follow the argument</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.880" end="00:48:45.280" style="s2">wherever it goes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.599" end="00:48:46.960" style="s2">and it seems it always goes i was</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.280" end="00:48:49.520" style="s2">reading socrates this morning</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.960" end="00:48:51.119" style="s2">because of you guys i have for the first</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.520" end="00:48:53.119" style="s2">time i&#39;m reading him directly of course</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.119" end="00:48:56.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve read him through other people and</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.119" end="00:48:56.960" style="s2">and the the last part of the chapter was</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.000" end="00:48:59.119" style="s2">you know he comes</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.960" end="00:49:00.800" style="s2">up to all these pseudo conclusions about</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.119" end="00:49:02.880" style="s2">things and then he suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.800" end="00:49:04.319" style="s2">says well we don&#39;t know actually what</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.880" end="00:49:06.559" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.319" end="00:49:07.520" style="s2">you know at the very end of the chapter</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.559" end="00:49:09.280" style="s2">i thought like</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.520" end="00:49:12.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a humor there that i i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.280" end="00:49:12.880" style="s2">know there is there it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.440" end="00:49:16.960" style="s2">this person into like thinking he had</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.359" end="00:49:17.680" style="s2">this grandiose understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.960" end="00:49:20.800" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.680" end="00:49:22.240" style="s2">but really the whole point was that once</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.800" end="00:49:23.680" style="s2">you&#39;ve understood something you you</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.240" end="00:49:26.240" style="s2">don&#39;t know anything anymore</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.680" end="00:49:28.240" style="s2">you&#39;re at the beginning again or this</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.240" end="00:49:31.359" style="s2">gets taken up in the neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.240" end="00:49:32.079" style="s2">uh practice so so the neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.359" end="00:49:33.839" style="s2">universe</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.079" end="00:49:35.359" style="s2">is one in which i think there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.839" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">absolute pure</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.359" end="00:49:39.280" style="s2">oneness of the one and then things</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.520" end="00:49:40.079" style="s2">emanate they proceed out to all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.280" end="00:49:42.480" style="s2">various</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.079" end="00:49:43.200" style="s2">multiplicitous instantiation and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.480" end="00:49:44.960" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.200" end="00:49:46.240" style="s2">right returns this is not a temporal</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.960" end="00:49:47.200" style="s2">process this is what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.240" end="00:49:48.800" style="s2">ontology</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.200" end="00:49:50.319" style="s2">and the idea in dialectic because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.800" end="00:49:51.520" style="s2">supposed to do that same thing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.319" end="00:49:52.800" style="s2">supposed to project</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.520" end="00:49:55.119" style="s2">all of your thoughts all of their</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.800" end="00:49:56.960" style="s2">variations you have and then notice all</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.119" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">the differences and then recollect and</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.960" end="00:50:00.160" style="s2">say yes</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:01.440" style="s2">but that&#39;s just a projection and only</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.160" end="00:50:04.079" style="s2">and then when you recollect</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.440" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">recollect back right and try and step</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.079" end="00:50:06.880" style="s2">back to</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:08.160" style="s2">what&#39;s deeper and what&#39;s affording all</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.880" end="00:50:09.680" style="s2">of the variations</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.160" end="00:50:11.359" style="s2">that&#39;s when you realize oh but i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.680" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">really know it and then you gather this</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.359" end="00:50:14.000" style="s2">is how you practice</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:16.000" style="s2">dialect that you gather it back in and</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.000" end="00:50:17.760" style="s2">then you again project it out so that</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.000" end="00:50:18.319" style="s2">you externalize it you can become aware</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.760" end="00:50:20.000" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.319" end="00:50:21.520" style="s2">right and and then you see all the</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.000" end="00:50:22.160" style="s2">variations and you and then you pull it</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.520" end="00:50:23.839" style="s2">back in</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.160" end="00:50:25.599" style="s2">and you and you don&#39;t stop you just keep</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.839" end="00:50:26.880" style="s2">going back and forth because</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.599" end="00:50:29.760" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get into conformity</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.880" end="00:50:33.119" style="s2">with how how how reality is unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.760" end="00:50:35.440" style="s2">in that constant procession and</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.119" end="00:50:37.680" style="s2">return and what&#39;s really cool for me is</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.440" end="00:50:40.160" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly the main motion</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.680" end="00:50:41.680" style="s2">in artificial intelligence deep learning</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.160" end="00:50:44.000" style="s2">right you take some data</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.680" end="00:50:45.119" style="s2">and you can compress out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.000" end="00:50:47.680" style="s2">underneath them all</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.119" end="00:50:48.559" style="s2">the one and then you run variations from</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.680" end="00:50:51.839" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.559" end="00:50:54.880" style="s2">see what sticks gather it back in</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.839" end="00:50:57.359" style="s2">right vary it out project it out</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.880" end="00:50:58.480" style="s2">recollected in projected out recollected</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.359" end="00:51:00.319" style="s2">in and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.480" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">this that&#39;s why how these networks</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.319" end="00:51:04.000" style="s2">evolve their capacity</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.920" end="00:51:05.520" style="s2">to pick up on complex patterns in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.000" end="00:51:07.040" style="s2">world that&#39;s what gives them their</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.520" end="00:51:09.440" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.040" end="00:51:12.160" style="s2">right right and then i guess i guess too</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.440" end="00:51:14.640" style="s2">then that that neoplatonic process</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.160" end="00:51:16.319" style="s2">that in that neoplatonic process beauty</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.640" end="00:51:17.520" style="s2">is really the kind of hypostatic</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.319" end="00:51:19.680" style="s2">emissary</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.520" end="00:51:20.800" style="s2">right that signals the realism of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.680" end="00:51:23.280" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.800" end="00:51:24.640" style="s2">and um and allows you to track and</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.280" end="00:51:28.160" style="s2">follow it more</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.640" end="00:51:30.079" style="s2">yeah perhaps more more um more reliably</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.160" end="00:51:31.200" style="s2">i think it allows you not to be stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.079" end="00:51:34.960" style="s2">your tracks somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.200" end="00:51:36.720" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like it seduces you forward</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.960" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">all the time so that you&#39;re not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.720" end="00:51:39.839" style="s2">not uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.839" end="00:51:42.240" style="s2">you know you just you don&#39;t fall asleep</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.839" end="00:51:45.440" style="s2">by the side of the road or</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.240" end="00:51:49.280" style="s2">i think beauty is the mark of</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.440" end="00:51:53.040" style="s2">knowing by loving right right</p>

<p begin="00:57:41.599" end="00:57:45.200" style="s2">uh a really good creative tension that</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.400" end="00:57:48.559" style="s2">would prov</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.200" end="00:57:50.880" style="s2">would keep well</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.559" end="00:57:52.799" style="s2">perhaps keep a kind of criticality uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.880" end="00:57:55.040" style="s2">for longer before things</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.799" end="00:57:56.880" style="s2">everything eventually solidify right but</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.040" end="00:57:58.480" style="s2">maybe keep the fire of criticality</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.880" end="00:58:00.559" style="s2">burning a little bit longer</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.480" end="00:58:01.599" style="s2">oh yeah what i wanted to say about my</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.559" end="00:58:03.119" style="s2">discussion with this</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.599" end="00:58:05.200" style="s2">uh this person also was that he</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.119" end="00:58:07.920" style="s2">mentioned that you know he said each</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.200" end="00:58:09.119" style="s2">each period that we live in has this</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.920" end="00:58:11.680" style="s2">denial</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.119" end="00:58:12.960" style="s2">uh denial of love he called it yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.680" end="00:58:14.000" style="s2">he would say that you know the in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.960" end="00:58:16.000" style="s2">religious era</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.000" end="00:58:17.839" style="s2">right when people were highly religious</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.000" end="00:58:20.000" style="s2">you know uh you would burn somebody</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.839" end="00:58:21.599" style="s2">at the stake or or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.000" end="00:58:23.520" style="s2">and that was the denial of love right</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.599" end="00:58:25.200" style="s2">somebody who wasn&#39;t a christian</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.520" end="00:58:26.640" style="s2">he burned them at the stake or if</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.200" end="00:58:28.960" style="s2">somebody wasn&#39;t a buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.640" end="00:58:30.160" style="s2">they were a heretic and and all that</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.960" end="00:58:33.119" style="s2">sort of thing he says</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.160" end="00:58:35.680" style="s2">but but but our denial he was he was he</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.119" end="00:58:37.799" style="s2">he&#39;s written a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.680" end="00:58:40.319" style="s2">our cultural denial today is this</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.799" end="00:58:43.200" style="s2">commodification of everything</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.319" end="00:58:43.760" style="s2">where where um and this pseudo happiness</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.200" end="00:58:45.839" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.760" end="00:58:47.680" style="s2">search for for and he was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.839" end="00:58:49.200" style="s2">how meditation you know is usually</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.680" end="00:58:51.599" style="s2">taught as being this</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.200" end="00:58:52.720" style="s2">panacea to make somebody to make you</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.599" end="00:58:55.599" style="s2">calm and</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.720" end="00:58:56.240" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s that&#39;s the sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.599" end="00:58:58.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.240" end="00:58:59.359" style="s2">and that that actually the spirit of it</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.400" end="00:59:02.079" style="s2">it should be more</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.359" end="00:59:03.359" style="s2">and that spirit of all these sorry i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.079" end="00:59:05.760" style="s2">rambling here but all these</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.359" end="00:59:06.880" style="s2">techniques like impermanence that people</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.760" end="00:59:08.720" style="s2">use they&#39;ve they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.880" end="00:59:11.119" style="s2">turned into this sort of description of</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.720" end="00:59:13.359" style="s2">reality that&#39;s very obvious and</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.119" end="00:59:14.640" style="s2">and stupid and they just you just use</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.359" end="00:59:17.680" style="s2">these phrases but</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.640" end="00:59:20.480" style="s2">but i think i think the dialogues would</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.680" end="00:59:22.480" style="s2">you always have to keep the the the soul</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.480" end="00:59:26.400" style="s2">and intelligence of</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.480" end="00:59:29.440" style="s2">something i think i think so i i mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.400" end="00:59:32.880" style="s2">i mean i think han has been the best</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.440" end="00:59:36.079" style="s2">for talking about our incapacity</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.880" end="00:59:38.000" style="s2">for love now our denial for love in um</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.079" end="00:59:39.280" style="s2">the way in which we have turned</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.000" end="00:59:41.599" style="s2">everything into consumption</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.280" end="00:59:42.799" style="s2">and commodified everything and he also</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.599" end="00:59:45.119" style="s2">has talked about</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.799" end="00:59:46.000" style="s2">uh a correlated thing with and this</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.119" end="00:59:47.760" style="s2">allows us to circle</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.000" end="00:59:49.359" style="s2">back because of the way love and beauty</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.760" end="00:59:51.599" style="s2">are bound together</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.359" end="00:59:52.880" style="s2">uh he he has this wonderful chapter</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.599" end="00:59:55.920" style="s2">where he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.880" end="00:59:57.359" style="s2">um the aesthetics of the smooth yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.920" end="01:00:00.160" style="s2">we&#39;re mentioning that right yeah that we</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.359" end="01:00:03.359" style="s2">want we want this like we want</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.160" end="01:00:06.240" style="s2">we have we have re-identified</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.359" end="01:00:07.200" style="s2">but his point is we have misidentified</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.240" end="01:00:09.839" style="s2">beauty</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.200" end="01:00:10.720" style="s2">with with making things as smooth as</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.839" end="01:00:14.160" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.720" end="01:00:16.559" style="s2">visually cognitively interpersonally</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.160" end="01:00:17.440" style="s2">and his point is that what we are doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.559" end="01:00:19.680" style="s2">then is</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.440" end="01:00:21.680" style="s2">is this grand act of narcissism because</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.680" end="01:00:25.200" style="s2">what we&#39;re basically saying is</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.680" end="01:00:28.079" style="s2">um i don&#39;t want anything to disturb me</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.200" end="01:00:29.119" style="s2">or disrupt me um and that&#39;s this comes</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.079" end="01:00:30.720" style="s2">back to your point that</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.119" end="01:00:32.480" style="s2">meditation i when i&#39;m teaching them my</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.720" end="01:00:33.359" style="s2">meditation classes i&#39;m doing them i</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.480" end="01:00:34.480" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you knew that andrew i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.359" end="01:00:36.319" style="s2">doing no i did i did</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.480" end="01:00:37.920" style="s2">i did know that yeah i&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.319" end="01:00:38.640" style="s2">burdened otherwise i would i&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.920" end="01:00:40.559" style="s2">come but</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.640" end="01:00:42.799" style="s2">no no no that wasn&#39;t i wasn&#39;t trying to</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.559" end="01:00:44.400" style="s2">no no</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.799" end="01:00:46.240" style="s2">i repeatedly tell my students you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.400" end="01:00:47.280" style="s2">that meditation is not a vacation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.240" end="01:00:49.040" style="s2">an education</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.280" end="01:00:51.119" style="s2">it should disturb you and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.040" end="01:00:54.559" style="s2">having unpleasant disturbing feelings</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.119" end="01:00:55.920" style="s2">good good right the people that come in</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.559" end="01:00:57.760" style="s2">and all they want to do and they want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.920" end="01:01:00.000" style="s2">talk about how they feel wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.760" end="01:01:01.440" style="s2">you know it is appropriate at times to</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.000" end="01:01:04.160" style="s2">celebrate</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.440" end="01:01:04.480" style="s2">wonder and connectedness and presence</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.160" end="01:01:07.280" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.480" end="01:01:07.760" style="s2">you should also have periods where there</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.280" end="01:01:11.839" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.760" end="01:01:14.079" style="s2">demand and challenge on you yeah and and</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.839" end="01:01:14.960" style="s2">and i guess you also have to go into the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.079" end="01:01:16.240" style="s2">underworld</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.960" end="01:01:18.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what this guy was telling me</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.240" end="01:01:19.359" style="s2">today about you know the poet has to go</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.000" end="01:01:22.480" style="s2">into the underworld and</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.359" end="01:01:24.880" style="s2">and look at the dark aspects um</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.480" end="01:01:25.599" style="s2">of your of your world and and and of</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.880" end="01:01:27.920" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.599" end="01:01:29.280" style="s2">and and all that and that&#39;s also part of</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.920" end="01:01:31.839" style="s2">meditation which</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.280" end="01:01:33.200" style="s2">well but you see that the the the the</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.839" end="01:01:34.160" style="s2">you know the gnostic and jungian</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.200" end="01:01:36.319" style="s2">metaphors are</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.160" end="01:01:37.760" style="s2">ultimately wed to that neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.319" end="01:01:40.559" style="s2">practice that i was talking about</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.760" end="01:01:42.240" style="s2">because what do you do well how do you</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.559" end="01:01:44.000" style="s2">really journey into the underworld well</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.240" end="01:01:45.119" style="s2">you try to notice how you&#39;re projecting</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.000" end="01:01:47.440" style="s2">your shadow</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.119" end="01:01:48.640" style="s2">here&#39;s the projection and all the way</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.440" end="01:01:51.760" style="s2">and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.640" end="01:01:54.000" style="s2">it&#39;s all i mean you really can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.760" end="01:01:58.400" style="s2">introspectively get out your shadow</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.000" end="01:01:59.280" style="s2">um and and the point is that i&#39;m taking</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.400" end="01:02:00.640" style="s2">shadow not just</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.280" end="01:02:03.119" style="s2">because it&#39;s too hard to look at you</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.640" end="01:02:06.880" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s you&#39;re not no no</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.119" end="01:02:09.839" style="s2">because uh you you</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.880" end="01:02:10.319" style="s2">where you have to get to a place where i</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.839" end="01:02:12.000" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.319" end="01:02:13.680" style="s2">play with nietzsche&#39;s thing you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.000" end="01:02:15.760" style="s2">jump over your own shadow</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.680" end="01:02:16.720" style="s2">right it it is immersed in the very</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.760" end="01:02:19.440" style="s2">activity</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.720" end="01:02:20.720" style="s2">that of you&#39;re looking at your shadow</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.440" end="01:02:22.880" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a mesh</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.720" end="01:02:23.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like this let me give it&#39;s deeply</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.880" end="01:02:26.799" style="s2">like this</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.920" end="01:02:28.559" style="s2">you are so wise with other people you</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.799" end="01:02:29.359" style="s2">can give your friend amazingly good</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.559" end="01:02:32.240" style="s2">advice</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.359" end="01:02:32.960" style="s2">right but trying to do that for yourself</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.240" end="01:02:34.640" style="s2">is almost</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.960" end="01:02:36.960" style="s2">impossible and that that&#39;s a hallmark of</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.640" end="01:02:37.280" style="s2">wisdom where people can successfully do</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.960" end="01:02:38.799" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.280" end="01:02:40.480" style="s2">and what you have to do and this is why</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.799" end="01:02:43.920" style="s2">and this is moore&#39;s point about</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.480" end="01:02:44.880" style="s2">self knowledge requires distributed</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.920" end="01:02:46.720" style="s2">cognition and</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.880" end="01:02:48.480" style="s2">sperver&#39;s point rationality requires</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.720" end="01:02:52.400" style="s2">distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.480" end="01:02:53.359" style="s2">because only in you like reflecting back</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.400" end="01:02:56.400" style="s2">on me</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.359" end="01:02:56.960" style="s2">like my projections and if we can if we</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.400" end="01:02:58.799" style="s2">can</p>

<p begin="01:10:42.239" end="01:10:45.840" style="s2">japanese aesthetics they say that uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.120" end="01:10:48.400" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.840" end="01:10:49.360" style="s2">a woman or a man who&#39;s just beyond that</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.400" end="01:10:51.040" style="s2">prime</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.360" end="01:10:52.480" style="s2">that they they consider that to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.040" end="01:10:54.400" style="s2">beauty not</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.480" end="01:10:55.760" style="s2">not something in its prime perfection of</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.400" end="01:10:58.640" style="s2">life but if somebody</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.760" end="01:11:00.640" style="s2">has gone just beyond the prime um so</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.640" end="01:11:02.960" style="s2">that it contains life and death</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.640" end="01:11:03.760" style="s2">within it it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not this false</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.960" end="01:11:06.400" style="s2">promise</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.760" end="01:11:07.360" style="s2">of perfection yes excellent that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.400" end="01:11:08.560" style="s2">exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.360" end="01:11:11.040" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a beautiful thing you</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.560" end="01:11:12.000" style="s2">just said and so notice how we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.040" end="01:11:14.400" style="s2">talk about these things</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.000" end="01:11:15.520" style="s2">without all of these all of these nodal</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.400" end="01:11:19.360" style="s2">terms coming up</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.520" end="01:11:23.199" style="s2">beauty love wisdom faith soul</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.360" end="01:11:24.480" style="s2">right um</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.199" end="01:11:26.159" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a particular</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.480" end="01:11:29.199" style="s2">headquarters go ahead particularly</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.159" end="01:11:33.360" style="s2">beautiful analogy to be made</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.199" end="01:11:36.719" style="s2">um about the role of</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.360" end="01:11:41.120" style="s2">analogically the role of silence and</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.719" end="01:11:44.239" style="s2">the the so you know one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.120" end="01:11:45.600" style="s2">if i can sort of use this metaphorically</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.239" end="01:11:49.679" style="s2">at least at first</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.600" end="01:11:52.880" style="s2">one of the things that happens in</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.679" end="01:11:56.800" style="s2">a disclosing dialogue is that this</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.880" end="01:11:59.120" style="s2">the silence by which you are heard</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.800" end="01:12:00.640" style="s2">deepens and appreciates the meaning of</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.120" end="01:12:03.520" style="s2">what is spoken</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.640" end="01:12:04.320" style="s2">now the silence in the margins of any</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.520" end="01:12:07.600" style="s2">given</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.320" end="01:12:08.080" style="s2">utterance is always infinitely greater</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.600" end="01:12:10.640" style="s2">and more</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.080" end="01:12:12.080" style="s2">engulfing than the speech that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.640" end="01:12:13.920" style="s2">proffered into it</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.080" end="01:12:15.440" style="s2">so there&#39;s a way in which that the</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.920" end="01:12:18.640" style="s2">silence is infinitely</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.440" end="01:12:21.760" style="s2">appreciative of sound but</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.640" end="01:12:24.159" style="s2">sound also contains the presence</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.760" end="01:12:25.920" style="s2">of that silence right as though between</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.159" end="01:12:27.760" style="s2">the notes of music as though between the</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.920" end="01:12:30.400" style="s2">syllables of speech</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.760" end="01:12:32.400" style="s2">and so one of the things that happens i</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.400" end="01:12:34.960" style="s2">think when a relationship becomes</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.400" end="01:12:37.440" style="s2">loving and faithful in all of the ways</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.960" end="01:12:40.320" style="s2">in which we&#39;ve just defined it</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.440" end="01:12:41.040" style="s2">the silence of the relationship becomes</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.320" end="01:12:43.760" style="s2">more and</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.040" end="01:12:44.640" style="s2">more pregnant so you become accustomed</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.760" end="01:12:47.199" style="s2">to speaking</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.640" end="01:12:48.640" style="s2">into the silence of the listening ear</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.199" end="01:12:50.560" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.640" end="01:12:52.560" style="s2">that whatever is spoken into that</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.560" end="01:12:54.000" style="s2">silence appreciates by virtue of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.560" end="01:12:54.800" style="s2">fact that it was spoken into that</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.000" end="01:12:57.760" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.800" end="01:12:58.719" style="s2">form of attentive silence and then when</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.760" end="01:13:01.040" style="s2">and then when</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.719" end="01:13:02.480" style="s2">when that relationship becomes more and</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.040" end="01:13:06.480" style="s2">more knowing</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.480" end="01:13:08.239" style="s2">its particular its particular auditing</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.480" end="01:13:10.159" style="s2">silence becomes something that you can</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.239" end="01:13:11.520" style="s2">internalize more and more right which i</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.159" end="01:13:12.960" style="s2">think is in many ways what</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.520" end="01:13:15.679" style="s2">augustine&#39;s project was with his</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.960" end="01:13:18.640" style="s2">confessions right he&#39;s speaking</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.679" end="01:13:20.000" style="s2">into the silence into a vow of silence</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.640" end="01:13:21.360" style="s2">that is infinitely knowing and</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.000" end="01:13:25.199" style="s2">infinitely knowable</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.360" end="01:13:27.840" style="s2">and so is hearing himself heard</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.199" end="01:13:28.640" style="s2">in the in in in the property of that</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.840" end="01:13:31.120" style="s2">silence</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.640" end="01:13:32.719" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like the relationship so it</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.120" end="01:13:35.520" style="s2">goes going back to your relation</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.719" end="01:13:36.880" style="s2">to the to the tension between such and</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.520" end="01:13:39.360" style="s2">more for instance</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.880" end="01:13:41.600" style="s2">that there&#39;s a way in which the tension</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.360" end="01:13:42.880" style="s2">between such and more can be analogized</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.600" end="01:13:45.360" style="s2">by the relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.880" end="01:13:46.560" style="s2">sound and silence and that the more</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.360" end="01:13:49.280" style="s2">encompassing</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.560" end="01:13:50.880" style="s2">of silence that the sound becomes the</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.280" end="01:13:53.520" style="s2">more the logos of it</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.880" end="01:13:54.080" style="s2">deepens deepens deepens and appreciates</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.520" end="01:13:56.480" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.080" end="01:13:58.080" style="s2">to me i think that that&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.480" end="01:14:00.320" style="s2">understanding both</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.080" end="01:14:02.080" style="s2">the dynamic the dynamic of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.320" end="01:14:06.320" style="s2">comprehending relationship</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.080" end="01:14:08.159" style="s2">as as a as a a as a symbol on for poetic</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.320" end="01:14:11.000" style="s2">love and it&#39;s self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.159" end="01:14:12.400" style="s2">but also then its capacity to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.000" end="01:14:14.640" style="s2">interiorized</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.400" end="01:14:16.320" style="s2">as a way of performing the dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.640" end="01:14:18.000" style="s2">interiorly because i agree john i mean</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.320" end="01:14:21.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which we cannot</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.000" end="01:14:22.800" style="s2">we cannot self-introspect reliably to</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.440" end="01:14:24.000" style="s2">the degree that we can do so in a</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.800" end="01:14:25.840" style="s2">distributed fashion</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.000" end="01:14:28.159" style="s2">but then when the distributed dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.840" end="01:14:30.080" style="s2">becomes interiorized it does become a</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.159" end="01:14:31.040" style="s2">way obviously internalizing the sage as</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.080" end="01:14:32.719" style="s2">you often say</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.040" end="01:14:34.960" style="s2">it becomes a way of cultivating that</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.719" end="01:14:37.199" style="s2">practice it within the</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.960" end="01:14:39.120" style="s2">within the confines of your inner life</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.199" end="01:14:42.080" style="s2">but i think that has everything to</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.120" end="01:14:42.400" style="s2">do with with it&#39;s not as though you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.080" end="01:14:44.480" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.400" end="01:14:46.080" style="s2">importing a dialogue and then running it</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.480" end="01:14:47.280" style="s2">online</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.080" end="01:14:49.360" style="s2">the thing the thing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.280" end="01:14:51.440" style="s2">internalizing is not the speech</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.360" end="01:14:54.239" style="s2">made by the other person it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.440" end="01:14:56.400" style="s2">particular comprehending ear of silence</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.239" end="01:15:01.120" style="s2">that they lend to your speech</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.400" end="01:15:02.560" style="s2">and thereby pronounce its moreness</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.120" end="01:15:04.400" style="s2">okay i want i want to riff on that</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.560" end="01:15:07.120" style="s2">because that was beautiful and music</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.400" end="01:15:09.280" style="s2">i i felt i felt two thoughts came to me</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.120" end="01:15:10.719" style="s2">and that was music and clairvoyance</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.280" end="01:15:12.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of clairvoyance that</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.719" end="01:15:14.239" style="s2">happens between uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.320" end="01:15:16.560" style="s2">two people and musicians when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.239" end="01:15:18.960" style="s2">playing together and go ahead john</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.560" end="01:15:20.679" style="s2">well i i wanna play i wanna i wanna</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.960" end="01:15:22.080" style="s2">invoke both senses of the term</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.679" end="01:15:24.640" style="s2">articulation</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.080" end="01:15:25.199" style="s2">which is to you know to speak but also</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.640" end="01:15:27.520" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.199" end="01:15:28.800" style="s2">break things into their parts right and</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.520" end="01:15:31.679" style="s2">what chris has just</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.800" end="01:15:33.520" style="s2">made me realize what she often does is</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.679" end="01:15:35.840" style="s2">the way in which the silence isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.520" end="01:15:38.400" style="s2">internalized into the articulation of</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.840" end="01:15:41.600" style="s2">our intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.400" end="01:15:45.760" style="s2">and yeah yeah and that the way</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.600" end="01:15:47.360" style="s2">emporia are those moments of</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.760" end="01:15:49.600" style="s2">depends you have to have cultivated the</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.360" end="01:15:52.159" style="s2">correct receptivity but eporia</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.600" end="01:15:52.960" style="s2">is those moments of silence in which you</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.159" end="01:15:55.199" style="s2">appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.960" end="01:15:57.199" style="s2">the moreness that is beyond you right</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.199" end="01:15:57.520" style="s2">and and it demands a transformation for</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.199" end="01:16:00.080" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.520" end="01:16:01.840" style="s2">and so what i&#39;m suggesting is uh one of</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.080" end="01:16:04.880" style="s2">the things we do in dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.840" end="01:16:06.560" style="s2">is we learn to seek those emporias that</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.880" end="01:16:09.360" style="s2">articulate our intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.560" end="01:16:10.159" style="s2">in just the way chris articulate just</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.360" end="01:16:12.560" style="s2">the way you articulate</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.159" end="01:16:14.000" style="s2">i&#39;m reminded of antisthenes when asked</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.560" end="01:16:14.719" style="s2">because he didn&#39;t write the volumes that</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.000" end="01:16:16.640" style="s2">plato wrote</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.719" end="01:16:17.920" style="s2">he asked what did he learn from socrates</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.640" end="01:16:19.760" style="s2">and he said something</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.920" end="01:16:22.000" style="s2">and all right he said well i learned how</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.760" end="01:16:24.080" style="s2">to converse with myself</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.000" end="01:16:26.080" style="s2">and everybody was kind of like what what</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.080" end="01:16:27.280" style="s2">he meant was just what chris said he</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.080" end="01:16:30.320" style="s2">spent so much time</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.280" end="01:16:33.440" style="s2">living with socrates memetically right</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.320" end="01:16:37.440" style="s2">that he had internalized this</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.440" end="01:16:40.800" style="s2">socratic process and he was capable now</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.440" end="01:16:44.560" style="s2">after only practicing it years</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.800" end="01:16:45.120" style="s2">of doing it himself uh so so dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.560" end="01:16:48.800" style="s2">is not</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.120" end="01:16:51.360" style="s2">just a um a social behavior it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.800" end="01:16:52.239" style="s2">um it&#39;s it&#39;s something you do uh you</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.360" end="01:16:54.400" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.239" end="01:16:56.000" style="s2">you speak with god in a sense or that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.400" end="01:16:58.400" style="s2">what you look that&#39;s what you learn how</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.000" end="01:17:00.640" style="s2">to do and you learn how to speak with</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.400" end="01:17:02.400" style="s2">absolutely fine nature and that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.640" end="01:17:03.360" style="s2">you&#39;re the most that&#39;s when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.400" end="01:17:05.520" style="s2">arguably that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.360" end="01:17:06.719" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s that&#39;s if if the process has</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.520" end="01:17:09.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a fruition that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.719" end="01:17:11.040" style="s2">that&#39;s it yeah the epictasis i mean the</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.920" end="01:17:13.600" style="s2">neoplatonus</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.040" end="01:17:15.520" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s all i think uh very um</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.600" end="01:17:17.600" style="s2">implicit in plato</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.520" end="01:17:19.040" style="s2">but the neoplatons bring out those two</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.600" end="01:17:20.880" style="s2">dimensions very clearly</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.040" end="01:17:22.640" style="s2">in fact they go a little too far they</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.880" end="01:17:23.199" style="s2">tend to emphasize if you allow me the</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.640" end="01:17:27.120" style="s2">vertical</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.199" end="01:17:30.239" style="s2">ontological aspect of dialectic within</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.120" end="01:17:30.960" style="s2">the the the the discourse with one&#39;s own</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.239" end="01:17:32.880" style="s2">soul</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.960" end="01:17:34.000" style="s2">right and that&#39;s how plato by the way</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.880" end="01:17:37.280" style="s2">defined dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.000" end="01:17:39.280" style="s2">you know uh uh discourse with your soul</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.280" end="01:17:41.040" style="s2">right they tended to emphasize this but</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.280" end="01:17:42.480" style="s2">there was that&#39;s because they had</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.040" end="01:17:44.159" style="s2">they lived in a school and it was so</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.480" end="01:17:47.920" style="s2">taken for granted that</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.159" end="01:17:51.280" style="s2">the ontological right right</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.920" end="01:17:55.280" style="s2">intrapersonal was embedded into</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.280" end="01:17:58.320" style="s2">an existential interpersonal yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.280" end="01:18:00.000" style="s2">yeah and a community both both are</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.320" end="01:18:01.840" style="s2">always there</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.000" end="01:18:03.280" style="s2">mutually informing and transforming each</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.840" end="01:18:04.400" style="s2">other chris christie</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.280" end="01:18:07.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s something and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.400" end="01:18:09.840" style="s2">something that socrates i mean</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.360" end="01:18:10.800" style="s2">alongside the socialized dialogues in</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.840" end="01:18:12.320" style="s2">plato</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.800" end="01:18:14.719" style="s2">socrates i mean i think that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.320" end="01:18:16.800" style="s2">represented by those moments of reverie</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.719" end="01:18:17.920" style="s2">that socrates famously has when he</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.800" end="01:18:20.960" style="s2">pauses</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.920" end="01:18:23.920" style="s2">for hours at a time to listen</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.960" end="01:18:25.760" style="s2">to his diamond right that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.920" end="01:18:28.719" style="s2">the end that&#39;s the interiorized</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.760" end="01:18:29.360" style="s2">exaction of the socialized dialectic uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.719" end="01:18:31.360" style="s2">in the for</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.360" end="01:18:32.560" style="s2">in the epictasis form that you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.360" end="01:18:34.480" style="s2">described</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.560" end="01:18:36.400" style="s2">yeah socrates makes it clear that the</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.480" end="01:18:38.560" style="s2">examination of others the socratic</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.400" end="01:18:40.320" style="s2">examination of others is always for</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.560" end="01:18:43.600" style="s2">reasons we&#39;ve already articulated</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.320" end="01:18:45.600" style="s2">always always also a self-examination</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.600" end="01:18:46.880" style="s2">and socrates i forget which dialogue it</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.600" end="01:18:48.960" style="s2">is he says</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.880" end="01:18:50.800" style="s2">you know after i&#39;m done talking with you</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.960" end="01:18:52.320" style="s2">i always remember that there&#39;s a man</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.800" end="01:18:53.040" style="s2">waiting for me at home that i have to</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.320" end="01:18:56.880" style="s2">talk to</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.040" end="01:18:56.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s his own soul yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.360" end="01:19:02.080" style="s2">yeah and then it kind of feeds back too</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.640" end="01:19:04.880" style="s2">though doesn&#39;t it because for</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.080" end="01:19:07.440" style="s2">for like the sun that the the the</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.880" end="01:19:07.760" style="s2">dialectic that socrates carries on with</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.440" end="01:19:11.360" style="s2">his</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.760" end="01:19:14.960" style="s2">diamond also is what</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.360" end="01:19:16.800" style="s2">is also what indicates the kairos of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.960" end="01:19:18.719" style="s2">socialized dialogues</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.800" end="01:19:20.880" style="s2">and the point of his entry into those</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.719" end="01:19:24.080" style="s2">dialogues right he&#39;s guided</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.880" end="01:19:25.199" style="s2">he&#39;s guided all the while by his inward</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.080" end="01:19:26.880" style="s2">dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.199" end="01:19:29.120" style="s2">and and that&#39;s what that&#39;s i think</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.880" end="01:19:31.280" style="s2">that&#39;s precisely what tutors him</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.120" end="01:19:32.960" style="s2">to guide the socialized dialectic as</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.280" end="01:19:33.280" style="s2">effectively as he does right so there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:19:37.199" end="01:19:40.239" style="s2">yeah i think throughout the entire</p>

<p begin="01:19:40.239" end="01:19:45.280" style="s2">uh that internal dialectic you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.120" end="01:19:48.880" style="s2">transforms the mind</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.280" end="01:19:51.920" style="s2">into into an uh so it&#39;s able to achieve</p>

<p begin="01:20:04.800" end="01:20:08.560" style="s2">transforming to yourself so you</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.400" end="01:20:09.440" style="s2">more and more have the perspicacious</p>

<p begin="01:20:31.040" end="01:20:34.560" style="s2">were speaking that it&#39;s this is very</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.880" end="01:20:36.239" style="s2">high conceptual stuff</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.560" end="01:20:37.600" style="s2">but also it&#39;s very simple at the same</p>

<p begin="01:20:41.040" end="01:20:45.679" style="s2">or or or when you know you you go for a</p>

<p begin="01:20:45.679" end="01:20:49.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not it&#39;s not all that this</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.760" end="01:20:51.440" style="s2">complexity of</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.440" end="01:20:52.639" style="s2">concepts it&#39;s just it&#39;s being attuned to</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.440" end="01:20:55.040" style="s2">reality right</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.639" end="01:20:56.639" style="s2">yes that&#39;s scalability that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.040" end="01:21:00.960" style="s2">that paul&#39;s keeps looking for</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.639" end="01:21:03.760" style="s2">and there&#39;s a scalability of discourse</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.960" end="01:21:04.400" style="s2">that is scale well that&#39;s exactly it you</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.760" end="01:21:06.239" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.400" end="01:21:07.600" style="s2">as soon as we are persons we are in</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.239" end="01:21:10.560" style="s2">discourse because we become</p>

<p begin="01:21:10.560" end="01:21:13.760" style="s2">yes this is very</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.760" end="01:21:15.280" style="s2">in some sense it can reach up or reach</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.760" end="01:21:17.600" style="s2">down whichever metaphor you want</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.280" end="01:21:19.600" style="s2">into the very foundations of your</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.600" end="01:21:20.239" style="s2">fundamental framing of reality and how</p>

<p begin="01:21:23.280" end="01:21:27.679" style="s2">all of that it can reach to that as you</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.600" end="01:21:30.800" style="s2">said this very high conceptual stuff</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.679" end="01:21:32.480" style="s2">but it is practicable in the most and i</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.800" end="01:21:34.960" style="s2">don&#39;t want this to sound like an insult</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.480" end="01:21:36.800" style="s2">in the most mundane discourse that you</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.960" end="01:21:38.080" style="s2">can engage in</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.800" end="01:21:40.159" style="s2">this is what i mean about it being</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.080" end="01:21:42.719" style="s2">scalable because every disc</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.159" end="01:21:44.159" style="s2">like nobody has to be an expert in</p>

<p begin="01:22:10.560" end="01:22:15.199" style="s2">we can afford it&#39;s in i know it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:23:19.600" end="01:23:23.920" style="s2">and a verb that picks up on like</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.760" end="01:23:27.360" style="s2">connections to embodiment and enactment</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.920" end="01:23:30.880" style="s2">yeah um yeah i think</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.360" end="01:23:34.880" style="s2">it is and so i mean this is again</p>

<p begin="01:23:36.639" end="01:23:40.320" style="s2">ancient world where they were sort of</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.320" end="01:23:41.920" style="s2">practicing sort of animating things</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.320" end="01:23:44.000" style="s2">and we look at that and go that&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.920" end="01:23:45.040" style="s2">magic and you know and i don&#39;t doubt</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.000" end="01:23:46.639" style="s2">that there was</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.040" end="01:23:48.400" style="s2">there was degraded forms of it in which</p>

<p begin="01:23:48.400" end="01:23:52.880" style="s2">really powerful forms of it</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.320" end="01:23:53.840" style="s2">because you know proquest for example</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.880" end="01:23:55.679" style="s2">says that uh</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.840" end="01:23:57.199" style="s2">internal theo theory is way more</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.679" end="01:23:59.440" style="s2">important than external</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.199" end="01:24:00.400" style="s2">uh theory and what it was is about this</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.440" end="01:24:02.800" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.400" end="01:24:03.520" style="s2">right like you said of insolving things</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.800" end="01:24:06.239" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.520" end="01:24:07.920" style="s2">uh of reanimating them setting them back</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.239" end="01:24:11.280" style="s2">into their proper motion</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.920" end="01:24:11.600" style="s2">the the you know psyche is wind blowing</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.280" end="01:24:14.800" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.600" end="01:24:16.320" style="s2">it it&#39;s a self-moving thing when we when</p>

<p begin="01:24:20.320" end="01:24:24.239" style="s2">how the logos is not just a set but a</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.719" end="01:24:27.440" style="s2">continual gathering</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.239" end="01:24:29.600" style="s2">and unfolding like that that reanimation</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.440" end="01:24:31.360" style="s2">so that we&#39;re constantly remembering the</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.600" end="01:24:34.000" style="s2">moreness into the suchness</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.360" end="01:24:34.560" style="s2">that was also a big part of this whole</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.000" end="01:24:36.639" style="s2">set of</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.560" end="01:24:38.320" style="s2">ritual practices that we dimly</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.639" end="01:24:40.000" style="s2">understand called fiergia</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.320" end="01:24:42.880" style="s2">in the ancient world so you&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.000" end="01:24:45.120" style="s2">to always be practicing fioria</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.880" end="01:24:46.080" style="s2">you know contemplation meditation</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.120" end="01:24:49.199" style="s2">reflection</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.080" end="01:24:50.719" style="s2">and theodia and and then that was also</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.199" end="01:24:51.760" style="s2">ultimately supposed to lead to theosis</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.719" end="01:24:54.719" style="s2">you&#39;re going to become more and more</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.760" end="01:24:56.719" style="s2">godlike by doing it</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.719" end="01:24:58.880" style="s2">yeah i i thought of the uh the</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.719" end="01:25:02.719" style="s2">reanimating the death star again</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.880" end="01:25:06.080" style="s2">um that image came came back to me again</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.719" end="01:25:09.280" style="s2">well the zombie zombie is is</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.080" end="01:25:12.159" style="s2">is is the horror of</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.280" end="01:25:14.560" style="s2">of uh of what reanimation looks like</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.159" end="01:25:15.840" style="s2">when it cannot be properly housed within</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.560" end="01:25:18.800" style="s2">a world view</p>

<p begin="01:25:18.800" end="01:25:21.440" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.360" end="01:25:23.920" style="s2">well reanimation is the wrong word um i</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.440" end="01:25:24.480" style="s2">guess yeah in souling i like my word and</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.920" end="01:25:26.480" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.480" end="01:25:28.239" style="s2">but so that&#39;s a way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.480" end="01:25:31.760" style="s2">is the zombie is a</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.239" end="01:25:34.880" style="s2">is resurrection without any insolent</p>

<p begin="01:25:37.360" end="01:25:41.040" style="s2">talking about the death star and</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.280" end="01:25:43.440" style="s2">in popular culture you want you want to</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.040" end="01:25:44.239" style="s2">you want to um you want to destroy the</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.440" end="01:25:47.440" style="s2">death star</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.239" end="01:25:48.800" style="s2">right but but but you don&#39;t buy the</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.440" end="01:25:50.719" style="s2">death star you want to integrate the</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.800" end="01:25:53.760" style="s2">shadow you want to insult the</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.719" end="01:25:55.199" style="s2">the world right with all of its darkness</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.760" end="01:25:58.400" style="s2">and machine</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.199" end="01:26:00.639" style="s2">machines and and uh</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.400" end="01:26:02.239" style="s2">find a soul in in you know the reality</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.639" end="01:26:05.520" style="s2">of what we&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.239" end="01:26:08.960" style="s2">at this time i i mean part of it</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.520" end="01:26:09.520" style="s2">i mean the the difficulty with darkness</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.960" end="01:26:12.639" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.520" end="01:26:13.600" style="s2">you know it stands for many things as a</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.639" end="01:26:15.679" style="s2">term</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.600" end="01:26:18.080" style="s2">um because there&#39;s a way in which the</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.679" end="01:26:19.199" style="s2">darkness is to the light as the silence</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.080" end="01:26:20.840" style="s2">is to the sound</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.199" end="01:26:23.120" style="s2">um so that there&#39;s that sense of</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.840" end="01:26:26.560" style="s2">darkness holy darkness</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.120" end="01:26:30.000" style="s2">yeah well yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.560" end="01:26:34.000" style="s2">and so um</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.000" end="01:26:37.280" style="s2">yeah i mean i</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.000" end="01:26:37.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which a lot of what</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.280" end="01:26:40.480" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.600" end="01:26:42.159" style="s2">might think of darkness is just the</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.480" end="01:26:45.679" style="s2">otherness of things</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.159" end="01:26:46.800" style="s2">and their capacity to disturb us and</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.679" end="01:26:48.960" style="s2">disrupt us</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.800" end="01:26:50.239" style="s2">now we can either resist that and harden</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.960" end="01:26:53.520" style="s2">against it</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.239" end="01:26:56.800" style="s2">or we can like wilka was was saying</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.520" end="01:26:58.719" style="s2">we can get an adaptive uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.800" end="01:27:01.120" style="s2">relationship to it so that it starts to</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.719" end="01:27:03.120" style="s2">disclose itself as beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.120" end="01:27:05.360" style="s2">and beautiful doesn&#39;t mean comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.120" end="01:27:07.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean smooth i like that point in</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.360" end="01:27:09.600" style="s2">the lord of the rings where galadriel is</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.840" end="01:27:10.159" style="s2">considering taking the one ring and she</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.600" end="01:27:12.480" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.159" end="01:27:13.840" style="s2">i will be like i will be beautiful like</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.480" end="01:27:15.679" style="s2">the sea or what is it</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.840" end="01:27:18.320" style="s2">you know oh yeah horrible then all men</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.679" end="01:27:20.239" style="s2">will fear me and you go whoa</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.320" end="01:27:21.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s the sense of beauty that</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.239" end="01:27:23.600" style="s2">rilke was talking about</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.520" end="01:27:25.440" style="s2">so i&#39;m trying to get andrew that the</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.600" end="01:27:26.560" style="s2">beauty that i&#39;m talking about is not the</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.440" end="01:27:29.120" style="s2">smoothness</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.560" end="01:27:29.600" style="s2">it is exactly that kind it has awe</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.120" end="01:27:32.800" style="s2">within</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.600" end="01:27:34.880" style="s2">it and the sense it&#39;s not this false</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.800" end="01:27:37.120" style="s2">luminosity or love and light</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.880" end="01:27:39.760" style="s2">which actually is is a very dark thing</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.120" end="01:27:42.880" style="s2">because it&#39;s a denial of</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.760" end="01:27:45.120" style="s2">you know the other half of life</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.880" end="01:27:46.880" style="s2">this was part of the uh the the</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.120" end="01:27:48.480" style="s2">transformation of the lucifer metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.880" end="01:27:50.159" style="s2">the the light bearer</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.480" end="01:27:51.600" style="s2">and that the idea became and this goes</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.159" end="01:27:53.199" style="s2">so much with bullshitting is that</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.600" end="01:27:55.920" style="s2">lucifer bears the light</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.199" end="01:27:56.239" style="s2">that misdirects your salience and and</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.920" end="01:27:59.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.239" end="01:28:00.800" style="s2">right and and and makes you not seek the</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.360" end="01:28:03.760" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.800" end="01:28:03.760" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>

<p begin="01:28:24.159" end="01:28:32.800" style="s2">the idea of of beauty as something that</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.400" end="01:28:36.239" style="s2">necessarily that necessarily destroys</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.800" end="01:28:38.080" style="s2">and recreates yourself that if that that</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.239" end="01:28:40.719" style="s2">the the roughness of beauty and</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.080" end="01:28:43.199" style="s2">and also the rough roughness of love is</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.719" end="01:28:46.159" style="s2">such that you cannot encounter it</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.199" end="01:28:47.120" style="s2">without being so changed and if you can</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.159" end="01:28:50.080" style="s2">encounter it</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.120" end="01:28:51.280" style="s2">without being so changed then it has</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.080" end="01:28:54.719" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.280" end="01:28:56.960" style="s2">it is less than um it is less than it is</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.719" end="01:28:59.199" style="s2">less than the fullness of its nature</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.960" end="01:29:01.360" style="s2">uh it is it is less than the fullness of</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.199" end="01:29:02.800" style="s2">love if you can encounter it without</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.360" end="01:29:04.880" style="s2">also being transformed</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.800" end="01:29:06.560" style="s2">by it so there has to be a crack in</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.880" end="01:29:07.760" style="s2">everything uh you know uh there has to</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.560" end="01:29:09.840" style="s2">be um</p>

<p begin="01:31:14.880" end="01:31:20.080" style="s2">with its share of danger which i think</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.600" end="01:31:22.719" style="s2">is something that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.080" end="01:31:24.080" style="s2">adequately appreciated about this</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.719" end="01:31:25.920" style="s2">process about the dialect</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.080" end="01:31:27.280" style="s2">about philosophy in general because</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.920" end="01:31:30.400" style="s2">we&#39;re too comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.280" end="01:31:32.239" style="s2">is that it&#39;s dangerous and and you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.400" end="01:31:34.080" style="s2">and the the association of wisdom with</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.239" end="01:31:36.320" style="s2">danger i think is not intuitive</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.080" end="01:31:37.520" style="s2">for a lot of people um i don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.320" end="01:31:38.159" style="s2">it would have been intuitive to me</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.520" end="01:31:40.880" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.159" end="01:31:41.280" style="s2">before undertaking it but every instance</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.880" end="01:31:43.840" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.280" end="01:31:45.280" style="s2">risks a form of dispossession that is</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.840" end="01:31:48.480" style="s2">utterly utterly</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.280" end="01:31:50.800" style="s2">destructive and</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.480" end="01:31:53.199" style="s2">that is i think necessarily so just as</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.800" end="01:31:56.239" style="s2">just as love is just as love does</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.199" end="01:31:56.880" style="s2">and so i think that um it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.239" end="01:32:00.560" style="s2">darkness</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.880" end="01:32:03.920" style="s2">has to be properly manifest in order for</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.560" end="01:32:07.520" style="s2">its sapiential promise</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.920" end="01:32:08.880" style="s2">to be fulfilled that&#39;s why it&#39;s the dark</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.520" end="01:32:11.840" style="s2">knight of the soul</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.880" end="01:32:13.199" style="s2">yeah and i thought of this notion of</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.840" end="01:32:16.320" style="s2">sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.199" end="01:32:18.560" style="s2">um as well uh there was that was one</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.320" end="01:32:21.199" style="s2">thing i i wanted to talk to you</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.560" end="01:32:22.960" style="s2">you guys about as is the notion of</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.199" end="01:32:24.080" style="s2">sacrifice and the scapegoat and because</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.960" end="01:32:25.040" style="s2">i&#39;ve been thinking a lot about that</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.080" end="01:32:28.719" style="s2">having read the</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.040" end="01:32:32.000" style="s2">reading gerard and ah when</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.719" end="01:32:35.280" style="s2">i saw satan fall as lightning yeah</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.000" end="01:32:36.960" style="s2">um and uh</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.280" end="01:32:38.400" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a whole other</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.960" end="01:32:40.880" style="s2">big topic that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.400" end="01:32:42.159" style="s2">you can&#39;t get into right now but um well</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.880" end="01:32:44.880" style="s2">anyway what you said</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.159" end="01:32:46.719" style="s2">uh chris struck me as quite profound but</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.880" end="01:32:48.960" style="s2">notice what we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.719" end="01:32:50.400" style="s2">because we&#39;ve enacted it we start with</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.960" end="01:32:52.239" style="s2">this notion of soul and notice</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.400" end="01:32:54.000" style="s2">how we&#39;ve we&#39;ve done all the processions</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.239" end="01:32:56.159" style="s2">we&#39;ve projected it out</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.000" end="01:32:57.760" style="s2">right into all of these variations</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.159" end="01:32:58.719" style="s2">almost like the projection of sound and</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.760" end="01:33:01.280" style="s2">music</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.719" end="01:33:03.199" style="s2">right but we&#39;re also periodically we</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.280" end="01:33:04.480" style="s2">keep circling back and gathering back</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.199" end="01:33:06.880" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to find</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.480" end="01:33:09.120" style="s2">what is the thread running is this what</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.880" end="01:33:12.480" style="s2">is the symptomatic thread</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.120" end="01:33:14.960" style="s2">that runs through all these projections</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.480" end="01:33:15.760" style="s2">and thereby i can retrace back to their</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.960" end="01:33:18.880" style="s2">origin</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.760" end="01:33:20.639" style="s2">originating source right because</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.880" end="01:33:22.480" style="s2">we haven&#39;t disclosed it fully of course</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.639" end="01:33:24.239" style="s2">we haven&#39;t but you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.480" end="01:33:26.960" style="s2">we&#39;ve been enacted the very process i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.239" end="01:33:29.520" style="s2">talking about we cycle at we project out</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.960" end="01:33:31.440" style="s2">we gather back in and we&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.520" end="01:33:34.000" style="s2">doing this and we&#39;ve just done it</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.440" end="01:33:34.800" style="s2">all over seoul now have we come up have</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.000" end="01:33:36.880" style="s2">we come out with</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.800" end="01:33:36.880" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.880" end="01:33:42.239" style="s2">are we now in a more right relationship</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.960" end="01:33:44.960" style="s2">with the reality</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.239" end="01:33:45.760" style="s2">that is referred to by seoul i think so</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.960" end="01:33:48.719" style="s2">i think so too</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.760" end="01:33:50.719" style="s2">yeah yeah so i think i think that just</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.719" end="01:33:52.560" style="s2">the notion becomes more evocative it</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.719" end="01:33:55.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take any final form</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.560" end="01:33:56.639" style="s2">or or or structure or or certainly not</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.440" end="01:33:59.360" style="s2">any kind of certainty</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.639" end="01:33:59.679" style="s2">uh attached to it yeah no it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.360" end="01:34:01.840" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.679" end="01:34:02.719" style="s2">we come within range of knowing by the</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.840" end="01:34:07.360" style="s2">light of that</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.719" end="01:34:07.360" style="s2">which we cannot define yeah</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.679" end="01:34:11.280" style="s2">yeah i i i think it these things are</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.239" end="01:34:13.760" style="s2">always</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.280" end="01:34:16.239" style="s2">epic static for us we&#39;re always right</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.760" end="01:34:19.440" style="s2">we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.239" end="01:34:21.199" style="s2">we we get a trajective sense of them in</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.440" end="01:34:23.920" style="s2">our constant trajectory</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.199" end="01:34:23.920" style="s2">towards them</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.600" end="01:34:31.199" style="s2">that&#39;s wonderful but notice what you</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.440" end="01:34:33.120" style="s2">have to give up you have to give up the</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.199" end="01:34:35.760" style="s2">having mode the having mode is about</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.120" end="01:34:38.800" style="s2">completable goals</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.760" end="01:34:42.080" style="s2">right i i can drink until i am done</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.800" end="01:34:44.320" style="s2">yeah but becoming wise like i</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.080" end="01:34:46.239" style="s2">i i there&#39;s no doneness there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.320" end="01:34:47.760" style="s2">there&#39;s no it&#39;s final i&#39;m complete</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.239" end="01:34:49.360" style="s2">in fact that&#39;s that&#39;s a sure sign that</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.760" end="01:34:51.760" style="s2">somebody isn&#39;t one</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.360" end="01:34:53.760" style="s2">right and having something to say has to</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.760" end="01:34:56.800" style="s2">be given up as well in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.760" end="01:34:58.639" style="s2">yes um i noticed sort of</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.800" end="01:35:00.960" style="s2">a silence overtaking me and then the</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.639" end="01:35:04.000" style="s2">compulsion to speak</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.960" end="01:35:07.119" style="s2">the the two move right um</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.000" end="01:35:08.639" style="s2">i mean right now i i i&#39;m tending to</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.119" end="01:35:11.440" style="s2">speak a lot because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.639" end="01:35:12.560" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m very much caught up in trying to</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.440" end="01:35:15.760" style="s2">voice</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.560" end="01:35:17.920" style="s2">what is what i&#39;m trying to follow i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.760" end="01:35:19.679" style="s2">there&#39;s a vocation for me i&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.920" end="01:35:21.199" style="s2">called right and i&#39;m trying to give</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.679" end="01:35:24.000" style="s2">voice to this calling</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.199" end="01:35:25.840" style="s2">um the sense of being called um and i</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.000" end="01:35:27.840" style="s2">feel a particular urgency</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.840" end="01:35:28.960" style="s2">of how it&#39;s impregnating me and</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.840" end="01:35:31.360" style="s2">impressing upon me</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.960" end="01:35:32.880" style="s2">but also the urgency of the need of the</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.360" end="01:35:34.000" style="s2">situation we&#39;re in both the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.880" end="01:35:35.440" style="s2">crisis and the particular</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.000" end="01:35:37.840" style="s2">the way it&#39;s being accelerated by the</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.440" end="01:35:39.679" style="s2">covid crisis um</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.840" end="01:35:41.119" style="s2">but i appreciate what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.679" end="01:35:44.239" style="s2">andrew um</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.119" end="01:35:45.040" style="s2">i think i i didn&#39;t mean that as a</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.239" end="01:35:47.360" style="s2">criticism</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.040" end="01:35:49.119" style="s2">or to suggest that you were speaking too</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.360" end="01:35:51.360" style="s2">much too much i&#39;m just saying</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.119" end="01:35:53.440" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like there&#39;s a compulsion to</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.360" end="01:35:55.679" style="s2">speak and you have to you have to stop</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.440" end="01:35:58.000" style="s2">yourself and say</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.679" end="01:35:59.440" style="s2">what what why am i speaking what is the</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.000" end="01:36:01.440" style="s2">you know am i adding anything to this</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.440" end="01:36:03.119" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.440" end="01:36:05.040" style="s2">speaking but i feel that you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.119" end="01:36:07.520" style="s2">animated by something beyond that so</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.040" end="01:36:09.840" style="s2">so i i never questioned that in in what</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.520" end="01:36:12.320" style="s2">you were saying</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.840" end="01:36:14.560" style="s2">i i just want to reish i guess i was</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.320" end="01:36:17.920" style="s2">trying to offer reassurance that</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.560" end="01:36:18.320" style="s2">um i am trying to cultivate a sense</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.920" end="01:36:21.679" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.320" end="01:36:24.719" style="s2">i am receptive to being struck by people</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.679" end="01:36:26.320" style="s2">by insight connection criticism and</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.719" end="01:36:29.679" style="s2">commentary that they give</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.320" end="01:36:31.760" style="s2">such that i will take it to heart if i</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.679" end="01:36:33.520" style="s2">have good plausible reason to believe it</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.760" end="01:36:35.440" style="s2">was given in good faith</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.520" end="01:36:38.080" style="s2">that&#39;s a standard that&#39;s a virtue i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:37:05.520" end="01:37:09.679" style="s2">the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.639" end="01:37:11.199" style="s2">as much as words would add to the</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.679" end="01:37:14.159" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.199" end="01:37:15.280" style="s2">i think so yeah because i i mean well i</p>

<p begin="01:37:24.159" end="01:37:28.480" style="s2">listen in this deeply</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.679" end="01:37:28.719" style="s2">responsive and receptive way right and</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.480" end="01:37:32.159" style="s2">and</p>

<p begin="01:37:32.159" end="01:37:36.080" style="s2">like i&#39;ve been saying and you come point</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.239" end="01:37:38.239" style="s2">so when you come back</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.080" end="01:37:40.080" style="s2">um after the silence i mean that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.239" end="01:37:42.080" style="s2">it was that&#39;s why you spoke of this art</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.080" end="01:37:45.199" style="s2">because you come back out of the silence</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.080" end="01:37:48.320" style="s2">right um yeah yeah in in</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.199" end="01:37:50.400" style="s2">in in like</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.320" end="01:37:51.760" style="s2">and you speak in virtue of it and you</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.400" end="01:37:54.400" style="s2">speak right yeah</p>

<p begin="01:37:56.400" end="01:38:01.360" style="s2">that way i think um</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.320" end="01:38:03.360" style="s2">because because to me identifying with</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.360" end="01:38:06.480" style="s2">the rhythm of the dialogues</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.360" end="01:38:09.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t always mean being its voice</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.480" end="01:38:10.159" style="s2">right because because the listening ear</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.040" end="01:38:12.880" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.159" end="01:38:13.679" style="s2">to me like the idea logos the dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.880" end="01:38:17.040" style="s2">takes</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.679" end="01:38:17.360" style="s2">the the various dialogists and collapses</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.040" end="01:38:20.000" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.360" end="01:38:20.560" style="s2">into an entity so that the listening</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.000" end="01:38:22.800" style="s2">voice</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.560" end="01:38:24.080" style="s2">and the the sorry the speaking voice and</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.800" end="01:38:27.679" style="s2">the listening ear</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.080" end="01:38:29.760" style="s2">collapse into unity and so the unity</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.679" end="01:38:31.760" style="s2">of the list the listening ear and the</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.760" end="01:38:33.520" style="s2">speaking voice is such that partaking of</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.760" end="01:38:36.880" style="s2">the rhythm of the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.520" end="01:38:38.639" style="s2">can simply be that can simply be being</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.880" end="01:38:41.600" style="s2">its form of silence</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.639" end="01:38:42.880" style="s2">being its form of listening silence and</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.600" end="01:38:45.280" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.880" end="01:38:46.560" style="s2">and you&#39;re right i and and i have this i</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.280" end="01:38:49.119" style="s2">i share your</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.560" end="01:38:50.159" style="s2">feeling andrew of wanting to make sure</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.119" end="01:38:54.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.159" end="01:38:59.280" style="s2">that anytime this speech is offered</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.480" end="01:39:01.600" style="s2">that it is offered in</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.280" end="01:39:02.960" style="s2">that it&#39;s that it&#39;s tuned to the rhythm</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.600" end="01:39:05.119" style="s2">of the dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.960" end="01:39:06.159" style="s2">so that it contributes to the evolution</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.119" end="01:39:07.920" style="s2">of the melody</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.159" end="01:39:09.920" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t interrupt it or if it</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.920" end="01:39:11.280" style="s2">does interrupt it it interrupts it in</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.920" end="01:39:14.560" style="s2">order to pivot it</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.280" end="01:39:16.960" style="s2">meaningfully and not gratuitously so i</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.560" end="01:39:18.320" style="s2">like that&#39;s that&#39;s so important to me</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.960" end="01:39:20.560" style="s2">the economy</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.320" end="01:39:21.840" style="s2">of dialogues is really really important</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.560" end="01:39:23.520" style="s2">to me and</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.840" end="01:39:24.960" style="s2">and and because i think it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.520" end="01:39:26.239" style="s2">that has to be finessed and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.960" end="01:39:28.880" style="s2">something you can you can</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.239" end="01:39:30.159" style="s2">get better at and you can get more more</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.880" end="01:39:33.520" style="s2">fluent in</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.159" end="01:39:35.920" style="s2">so i think yeah reticence is not</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.520" end="01:39:38.000" style="s2">reticence is not um reticence is not</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.920" end="01:39:38.639" style="s2">fear or trepidation most of the time</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.000" end="01:39:40.719" style="s2">it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.639" end="01:39:42.960" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just wait it&#39;s waiting for the</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.719" end="01:39:45.280" style="s2">chiropractic opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.960" end="01:39:47.679" style="s2">where the voice becomes an essential</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.280" end="01:39:50.800" style="s2">part of the dialogic evolution</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.679" end="01:39:51.360" style="s2">um and and and therein big dignifies</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.800" end="01:39:54.880" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.360" end="01:39:56.159" style="s2">you know so so i got this powerful image</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.880" end="01:39:57.199" style="s2">out of this and i don&#39;t know if you were</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.159" end="01:39:59.199" style="s2">attending it</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.199" end="01:40:00.639" style="s2">uh you know this notion of the way the</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.199" end="01:40:03.199" style="s2">greek chorus</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.639" end="01:40:04.320" style="s2">bears witness uh because in dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.199" end="01:40:06.960" style="s2">all the people that are</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.320" end="01:40:07.520" style="s2">not speaking are basically the greek</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.960" end="01:40:10.159" style="s2">chorus</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.520" end="01:40:10.960" style="s2">bearing witness in a reflective fashion</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.159" end="01:40:14.080" style="s2">and always</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.960" end="01:40:17.280" style="s2">poised to you know disturb</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.080" end="01:40:19.840" style="s2">what the speaker has done or or</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.280" end="01:40:20.320" style="s2">like they&#39;re meant to call the speaker</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.840" end="01:40:22.239" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.320" end="01:40:23.760" style="s2">in both meanings of the word they&#39;re men</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.239" end="01:40:25.440" style="s2">and they&#39;re right here now and</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.760" end="01:40:26.960" style="s2">uh they&#39;re here and uh they&#39;re with us</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.440" end="01:40:29.199" style="s2">in a sense yes exactly</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.960" end="01:40:30.719" style="s2">exactly right i&#39;m playing on this notion</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.199" end="01:40:31.199" style="s2">of calling out when you call somebody</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.719" end="01:40:32.560" style="s2">out and</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.199" end="01:40:34.400" style="s2">that means you&#39;re trying to draw them</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.560" end="01:40:35.360" style="s2">but you&#39;re also calling them into giving</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.400" end="01:40:37.199" style="s2">an account</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.360" end="01:40:39.199" style="s2">right of themselves and being</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.199" end="01:40:42.159" style="s2">responsible like i&#39;m calling you out</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.199" end="01:40:43.440" style="s2">right um and and so i mean that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.159" end="01:40:44.239" style="s2">how i understand the function of the</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.440" end="01:40:46.320" style="s2">greek chorus</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.239" end="01:40:47.360" style="s2">and what i was hearing when chris was i</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.320" end="01:40:50.719" style="s2">just got this image</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.360" end="01:40:52.400" style="s2">when he was talking about uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.719" end="01:40:54.000" style="s2">all the people participating for example</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.400" end="01:40:56.560" style="s2">in a dialectic that</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.000" end="01:40:59.040" style="s2">the the what&#39;s happening is you know</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.560" end="01:41:00.960" style="s2">momentarily this person is the speaker</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.040" end="01:41:02.080" style="s2">right in the greek and then you all the</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.960" end="01:41:04.800" style="s2">other people are the</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.080" end="01:41:06.000" style="s2">the greek chorus bearing witness and and</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.800" end="01:41:08.239" style="s2">people often and</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.000" end="01:41:09.600" style="s2">it&#39;s telling that we don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.239" end="01:41:10.400" style="s2">the dramatic function of the greek</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.600" end="01:41:13.280" style="s2">chorus any</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.400" end="01:41:15.199" style="s2">anymore um so chris was i correct in</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.280" end="01:41:16.080" style="s2">picking up on that illusion ah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.199" end="01:41:19.040" style="s2">no i think so</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.080" end="01:41:20.159" style="s2">i think so because i i think what the</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.040" end="01:41:22.400" style="s2">chorus does</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.159" end="01:41:24.080" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s a reason that that the</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.400" end="01:41:25.760" style="s2">traditional function of the greek chorus</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.080" end="01:41:28.880" style="s2">is in part</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.760" end="01:41:32.639" style="s2">a a</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.880" end="01:41:34.159" style="s2">um a wordless ex well they&#39;re not always</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.639" end="01:41:35.920" style="s2">wordless sometimes they speak but when</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.159" end="01:41:38.320" style="s2">they don&#39;t speak they are a wordless</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.920" end="01:41:41.119" style="s2">expression of the dramatic irony</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.320" end="01:41:42.960" style="s2">that knows the circumstances of the plot</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.119" end="01:41:45.679" style="s2">beyond its own knowing</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.960" end="01:41:47.520" style="s2">so right you listen for like the the</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.679" end="01:41:49.760" style="s2">greek chorus hears everything that is</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.520" end="01:41:50.639" style="s2">not said as opposed to everything that</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.760" end="01:41:52.719" style="s2">is said</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.639" end="01:41:54.320" style="s2">and so they represe again they represent</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.719" end="01:41:57.679" style="s2">the form of proleptic</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.320" end="01:42:00.639" style="s2">knowing that sees the meta meaning</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.679" end="01:42:02.400" style="s2">of the narrative beyond the beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.639" end="01:42:02.880" style="s2">meaning that the characters are living</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.400" end="01:42:06.400" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.880" end="01:42:08.560" style="s2">right right so the representation of</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.400" end="01:42:08.960" style="s2">that presence in a dialogue i think is</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.560" end="01:42:11.440" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.960" end="01:42:12.400" style="s2">important because it hears and sees</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.440" end="01:42:15.520" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.400" end="01:42:17.600" style="s2">that is that is yet unsaid that is yet</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.520" end="01:42:19.440" style="s2">unspoken that has not yet been shown</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.600" end="01:42:22.159" style="s2">forth and so the presence</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.440" end="01:42:23.520" style="s2">the presence of that person shows forth</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.159" end="01:42:26.800" style="s2">the dialogues</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.520" end="01:42:29.280" style="s2">to patterns that it has not yet espoused</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.800" end="01:42:31.040" style="s2">just as the greek chorus with their eye</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.280" end="01:42:33.040" style="s2">to dramatic irony</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.040" end="01:42:35.040" style="s2">can see the meta meaningfulness of the</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.040" end="01:42:36.800" style="s2">narrative that is not available to the</p>

<p begin="01:42:37.840" end="01:42:43.520" style="s2">that&#39;s amazing yes</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.280" end="01:42:44.400" style="s2">and it gives me a slight insight into</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.520" end="01:42:46.000" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.400" end="01:42:47.840" style="s2">why we&#39;re doing this as well because</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.000" end="01:42:50.080" style="s2">we&#39;re not just doing this</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.840" end="01:42:51.920" style="s2">for ourselves or for some egocentric</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.080" end="01:42:53.600" style="s2">reason even though it might appear that</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.920" end="01:42:54.239" style="s2">like putting our putting videos on</p>

<p begin="01:42:54.239" end="01:42:57.760" style="s2">because there is there is this chorus</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.239" end="01:43:00.080" style="s2">around us there is this</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.760" end="01:43:01.199" style="s2">multiplicity of voices that we are</p>

<p begin="01:43:01.199" end="01:43:07.199" style="s2">or that that are that are</p>

<p begin="01:43:07.199" end="01:43:11.040" style="s2">i think that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.040" end="01:43:12.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the weird symbol on of this</p>

<p begin="01:43:12.320" end="01:43:15.440" style="s2">like i mean think about well think about</p>

<p begin="01:43:15.440" end="01:43:18.639" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t want to write anything down</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.040" end="01:43:19.440" style="s2">because he thought the permanence of</p>

<p begin="01:43:19.440" end="01:43:26.080" style="s2">would like choke off the life</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.480" end="01:43:26.880" style="s2">of lo of logos right uh plato of course</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.080" end="01:43:28.880" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.880" end="01:43:30.000" style="s2">ironically especially in a dramatically</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.880" end="01:43:32.159" style="s2">ironic sense</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.000" end="01:43:33.199" style="s2">uh went ahead to write all these dramas</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.159" end="01:43:35.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.199" end="01:43:36.480" style="s2">but what we are doing is we are doing</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.840" end="01:43:39.280" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.480" end="01:43:40.159" style="s2">the we&#39;re you know we are in seouling</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.280" end="01:43:43.280" style="s2">speech</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.159" end="01:43:45.840" style="s2">here in via logos and it has that</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.280" end="01:43:47.280" style="s2">you know if effervescent but ephemeral</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.840" end="01:43:48.880" style="s2">quality of conversation</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.280" end="01:43:50.960" style="s2">but it&#39;s also being made permanent by</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.880" end="01:43:53.040" style="s2">recording we are joining together it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.960" end="01:43:54.960" style="s2">also a performance of some kind</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.040" end="01:43:56.719" style="s2">it absolutely is like it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.960" end="01:43:59.840" style="s2">we&#39;re talking to each other uh</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.719" end="01:44:02.080" style="s2">oh no it kind of seems that way gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.840" end="01:44:04.320" style="s2">taken up and have a life of itself</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.080" end="01:44:06.000" style="s2">beyond us normally when conversation</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.320" end="01:44:07.600" style="s2">ended the only life it had was in the</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.000" end="01:44:11.040" style="s2">memory of the participants</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.600" end="01:44:12.480" style="s2">now like text it will have a life of its</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.040" end="01:44:15.040" style="s2">own independent</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.480" end="01:44:16.719" style="s2">of our authorship and that means we are</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.040" end="01:44:18.639" style="s2">bridging between the two things that</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.719" end="01:44:21.280" style="s2">plato saw is oppositional</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.639" end="01:44:23.280" style="s2">we are getting the permanency of text</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.280" end="01:44:25.280" style="s2">but we&#39;re getting the living breath</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.280" end="01:44:26.639" style="s2">of dialogue and we&#39;re getting theater</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.280" end="01:44:29.119" style="s2">because we need theater</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.639" end="01:44:30.080" style="s2">i mean this is what&#39;s missing in our</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.119" end="01:44:32.080" style="s2">culture as real</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.080" end="01:44:35.119" style="s2">theater and i think that is what almost</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.080" end="01:44:38.239" style="s2">was compelling us to talk like this and</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.119" end="01:44:39.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s appropriate that that chris</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.239" end="01:44:41.440" style="s2">christophe would use these theatrical</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.840" end="01:44:47.520" style="s2">metaphors because</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.440" end="01:44:47.520" style="s2">um you know all of the life is a stage</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.520" end="01:44:53.199" style="s2">it also i think fits the dialogic</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.080" end="01:44:55.760" style="s2">process with its</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.199" end="01:44:57.360" style="s2">share of danger we were talking before</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.760" end="01:44:57.920" style="s2">about the fact that you know in order to</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.360" end="01:44:59.760" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.920" end="01:45:01.119" style="s2">changed by something it ha you have to</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.760" end="01:45:03.760" style="s2">you have to risk</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.119" end="01:45:04.560" style="s2">dispossession and you have to risk there</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.760" end="01:45:06.560" style="s2">has to be something</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.560" end="01:45:08.560" style="s2">deleterious about it and i think that</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.560" end="01:45:10.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the public nature of it</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.560" end="01:45:11.760" style="s2">actually fits it with that quality</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.480" end="01:45:13.520" style="s2">because there is</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.760" end="01:45:15.600" style="s2">or i don&#39;t know if you guys feel i still</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.520" end="01:45:16.239" style="s2">feel that every time i do one of these</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.600" end="01:45:19.679" style="s2">things i</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.239" end="01:45:21.679" style="s2">feel a sense a very pregnant sense</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.679" end="01:45:23.360" style="s2">of risk i feel a very pregnant sense of</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.679" end="01:45:25.920" style="s2">danger and to me</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.360" end="01:45:26.480" style="s2">to me that&#39;s essential that&#39;s essential</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.920" end="01:45:28.159" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.480" end="01:45:30.080" style="s2">civilized said something very very</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.159" end="01:45:32.320" style="s2">eloquent about this too in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.080" end="01:45:34.239" style="s2">of course that the public nature is what</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.320" end="01:45:37.600" style="s2">actually allows for</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.239" end="01:45:42.239" style="s2">the uh is what is what</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.600" end="01:45:42.239" style="s2">um the the</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.320" end="01:45:49.040" style="s2">the public nature of these dialogues</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.159" end="01:45:50.800" style="s2">is precisely what opens them to the</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.040" end="01:45:53.760" style="s2">possibility of dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.800" end="01:45:56.159" style="s2">quality because you have to you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.760" end="01:45:59.199" style="s2">you&#39;re walking and the knife edge</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.159" end="01:46:02.000" style="s2">and um and so the the</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.199" end="01:46:03.280" style="s2">and and i think there&#39;s some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.000" end="01:46:06.719" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.280" end="01:46:09.760" style="s2">artful balance or equilibration that</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.719" end="01:46:12.560" style="s2">some dialogues strike better than others</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.760" end="01:46:13.600" style="s2">depending on the amount of awareness</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.560" end="01:46:16.239" style="s2">that the dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.600" end="01:46:19.199" style="s2">accommodates of the witnessing presence</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.239" end="01:46:21.679" style="s2">of the chorus that sees it from without</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.199" end="01:46:23.760" style="s2">and and and every dialogue is a little</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.679" end="01:46:25.520" style="s2">different how each dialogue accommodates</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.760" end="01:46:27.840" style="s2">that presence is a little bit different</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.520" end="01:46:28.800" style="s2">some seem to kind of carry on almost</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.840" end="01:46:30.560" style="s2">heedless of it</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.800" end="01:46:31.840" style="s2">some are so hyper aware of it that they</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.560" end="01:46:34.480" style="s2">become so</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.840" end="01:46:35.440" style="s2">fraught with their their fore knowing</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.480" end="01:46:37.520" style="s2">sense of risk</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.440" end="01:46:38.560" style="s2">that they become almost inhibited by it</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.520" end="01:46:41.520" style="s2">but there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.560" end="01:46:42.320" style="s2">something down the middle of those two</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.520" end="01:46:45.040" style="s2">and when that</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.320" end="01:46:46.880" style="s2">catches properly i think that the the</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.040" end="01:46:49.679" style="s2">fear of exposure</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.880" end="01:46:51.600" style="s2">um risked by the perspective that sees</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.679" end="01:46:53.920" style="s2">this from without</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.600" end="01:46:55.360" style="s2">is is part of what helps to insole it</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.920" end="01:46:57.119" style="s2">with its possibility</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.360" end="01:46:58.960" style="s2">because perhaps if you make yourself</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.119" end="01:47:01.199" style="s2">vulnerable as well and if</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.960" end="01:47:03.679" style="s2">with through our sincerity you also</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.199" end="01:47:07.360" style="s2">become the potential object for ridicul</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.679" end="01:47:09.360" style="s2">ridicule or the potential scapegoat um</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.360" end="01:47:10.800" style="s2">totally totally but that&#39;s the virtue</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.360" end="01:47:13.280" style="s2">again the virtue</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.800" end="01:47:14.239" style="s2">virtue is what steers you between the</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.280" end="01:47:17.360" style="s2">you know the vices</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.239" end="01:47:20.639" style="s2">of deficiency and the vices of uh</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.360" end="01:47:23.280" style="s2">you know uh excess right</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.639" end="01:47:23.840" style="s2">and and and i&#39;m thinking here that part</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.280" end="01:47:27.119" style="s2">of what</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.840" end="01:47:30.239" style="s2">the chorus does i mean</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.119" end="01:47:33.040" style="s2">the chorus so the the the</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.239" end="01:47:34.719" style="s2">hero is on center stage the way the hero</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.040" end="01:47:36.000" style="s2">archetype is on center stage right now</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.719" end="01:47:38.400" style="s2">on a lot of these discourse</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.000" end="01:47:40.159" style="s2">and i keep trying to remind people that</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.400" end="01:47:42.239" style="s2">the heroic myth always needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.159" end="01:47:45.040" style="s2">counterbalanced with the hubris</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.239" end="01:47:46.480" style="s2">myths and i think that chorus often</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.040" end="01:47:48.800" style="s2">speaks the voice of</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.480" end="01:47:49.920" style="s2">the warning of hubris to counter about</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.800" end="01:47:50.880" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.920" end="01:47:53.920" style="s2">the tragedies</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.880" end="01:47:54.960" style="s2">to counterbalance right the heroism of</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.920" end="01:47:57.920" style="s2">the hero</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.960" end="01:47:59.679" style="s2">and and and you&#39;re supposed to you right</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.920" end="01:48:00.880" style="s2">the the hero especially in the tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.679" end="01:48:03.199" style="s2">ultimately is defeated</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.880" end="01:48:04.400" style="s2">but right and this is sort of more of a</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.199" end="01:48:05.440" style="s2">niching interpretation than an</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.400" end="01:48:08.480" style="s2">aristotelian</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.440" end="01:48:09.760" style="s2">but the point is that the the the person</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.480" end="01:48:12.159" style="s2">who&#39;s partaking</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.760" end="01:48:14.719" style="s2">in right the drama watching the drama</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.159" end="01:48:18.480" style="s2">right actually gets steered between</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.719" end="01:48:20.880" style="s2">right hubris and an overblown heroism</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.480" end="01:48:21.600" style="s2">and right so they don&#39;t they&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.880" end="01:48:23.840" style="s2">coward</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.600" end="01:48:26.239" style="s2">uh because they admire the beauty of the</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.840" end="01:48:27.920" style="s2">hero but they remember the mortality</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.239" end="01:48:31.520" style="s2">because the chorus speaks</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.920" end="01:48:34.000" style="s2">of hubris and we witness it&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.520" end="01:48:36.000" style="s2">witness its effects so i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.000" end="01:48:38.159" style="s2">something important about</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.000" end="01:48:39.360" style="s2">um the way we have this invisible chorus</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.159" end="01:48:42.000" style="s2">around us right now</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.360" end="01:48:43.119" style="s2">because it really helps uh us cultivate</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.000" end="01:48:45.679" style="s2">a virtue</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.119" end="01:48:46.159" style="s2">in which like a kind of courage where</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.679" end="01:48:49.119" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.159" end="01:48:49.840" style="s2">not hyper-vigilant and they&#39;re therefore</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.119" end="01:48:53.280" style="s2">terrorized</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.840" end="01:48:56.480" style="s2">into timidity or we are just overblown</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.280" end="01:48:58.719" style="s2">and just speaking um in some reckless</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.480" end="01:49:01.679" style="s2">and heedless fashion</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.719" end="01:49:04.000" style="s2">so so the word that came to me is is um</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.679" end="01:49:07.679" style="s2">the chorus</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.000" end="01:49:12.320" style="s2">keeps you humble uh humility</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.679" end="01:49:12.320" style="s2">um but also also not not</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.840" end="01:49:16.719" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.719" end="01:49:18.639" style="s2">well it encourages there&#39;s some part if</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.719" end="01:49:20.960" style="s2">you&#39;re part of a chorus you&#39;re part of a</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.639" end="01:49:22.400" style="s2">a grand story at the same time so</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.960" end="01:49:23.280" style="s2">there&#39;s this humility and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.400" end="01:49:26.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.280" end="01:49:29.679" style="s2">this uh you know this um</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.880" end="01:49:30.560" style="s2">i don&#39;t know dramatic grandiose you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.679" end="01:49:34.320" style="s2">right yes</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.560" end="01:49:36.320" style="s2">yes excitement about life or</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.320" end="01:49:37.920" style="s2">what it does i think it&#39;s actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.320" end="01:49:40.159" style="s2">a higher order of relevance</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.920" end="01:49:41.119" style="s2">it it represents a higher order of</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.159" end="01:49:44.400" style="s2">relevance</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.119" end="01:49:45.040" style="s2">that then is that then is is is is</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.400" end="01:49:47.679" style="s2">gifted</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.040" end="01:49:48.800" style="s2">to the dialogue very much very much i</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.679" end="01:49:51.520" style="s2">was going to say that</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.800" end="01:49:52.080" style="s2">in addition to the humiliation of the</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.520" end="01:49:55.280" style="s2">hero</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.080" end="01:49:59.199" style="s2">the chorus also honors the hero right</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.280" end="01:50:02.480" style="s2">um it&#39;s right the chorus will often</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.199" end="01:50:04.800" style="s2">um you know uh bespeak</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.480" end="01:50:06.000" style="s2">um the the the some of the virtues of</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.800" end="01:50:09.280" style="s2">the hero</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.000" end="01:50:10.480" style="s2">so the the right i i just want to say</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.280" end="01:50:11.119" style="s2">this because i don&#39;t want to i don&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.480" end="01:50:12.880" style="s2">don&#39;t want to make</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.119" end="01:50:14.639" style="s2">portray the chorus as just something</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.880" end="01:50:17.040" style="s2">that&#39;s humiliating the hero</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.639" end="01:50:18.560" style="s2">the chorus also honors the hero the the</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.040" end="01:50:20.159" style="s2">chorus reminds us</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.560" end="01:50:21.920" style="s2">the chorus will often remind us of</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.159" end="01:50:22.840" style="s2">elements of the hero&#39;s path that have</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.920" end="01:50:25.920" style="s2">rendered him</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.840" end="01:50:27.760" style="s2">heroic in important ways um so i just</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.920" end="01:50:29.840" style="s2">wanted to nuance that a bit andrew the</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.760" end="01:50:31.360" style="s2">the chorus is doing that you know that</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.840" end="01:50:33.440" style="s2">presentation of hubris</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.360" end="01:50:34.480" style="s2">uh but it&#39;s also bound up with a</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.440" end="01:50:37.599" style="s2">recognition</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.480" end="01:50:38.400" style="s2">on honoring of the hero uh if so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.599" end="01:50:40.800" style="s2">trying to make it</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.400" end="01:50:41.520" style="s2">what i&#39;m trying to say here here this is</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.800" end="01:50:43.360" style="s2">what i want to say</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.520" end="01:50:45.119" style="s2">the relationship between the hero and</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.360" end="01:50:46.880" style="s2">the chorus is not adversarial it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.119" end="01:50:48.719" style="s2">opponent processing</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.880" end="01:50:49.679" style="s2">component processing it&#39;s a process</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.719" end="01:50:52.480" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s supposed to be a</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.679" end="01:50:53.599" style="s2">self-correcting process</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.480" end="01:50:55.280" style="s2">i wonder if it&#39;s something like the</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.599" end="01:50:57.920" style="s2">relationship between the individual</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.280" end="01:51:00.480" style="s2">instrumentalist and the conductor</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.920" end="01:51:01.440" style="s2">of the orchestra something like that</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.480" end="01:51:04.000" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.440" end="01:51:04.639" style="s2">i mean a really good book on all of this</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.000" end="01:51:08.560" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.639" end="01:51:10.639" style="s2">how important this is is uh this book</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.560" end="01:51:12.719" style="s2">uh bearing witness to epiphany persons</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.639" end="01:51:15.199" style="s2">things and the nature of erotic life</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.719" end="01:51:16.639" style="s2">and he doesn&#39;t mean sexual eroticism uh</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.199" end="01:51:19.199" style="s2">this is john rusin&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.639" end="01:51:20.639" style="s2">uh book he&#39;s also works in canada at</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.199" end="01:51:22.239" style="s2">least he did when he wrote this book and</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.639" end="01:51:23.199" style="s2">this whole notion of bearing witness to</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.239" end="01:51:24.719" style="s2">epiphany</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.199" end="01:51:26.400" style="s2">right which is bringing together so much</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.719" end="01:51:28.320" style="s2">of what we&#39;ve said and how</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.400" end="01:51:29.679" style="s2">it&#39;s so central a process bearing</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.320" end="01:51:31.199" style="s2">witness in this right way</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.679" end="01:51:33.040" style="s2">is one of the deep ways in which we</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.199" end="01:51:37.760" style="s2">inculcate people and</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.040" end="01:51:37.760" style="s2">in which we we turn them into persons</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.760" end="01:51:46.800" style="s2">so maybe the the chorus is a person</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.880" end="01:51:48.639" style="s2">um generating function</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.800" end="01:51:50.080" style="s2">i think chris is right it&#39;s the it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.639" end="01:51:53.440" style="s2">overarching</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.080" end="01:51:56.719" style="s2">a higher order relevance realization um</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.440" end="01:51:58.560" style="s2">that is yeah contributing to um</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.719" end="01:52:00.719" style="s2">the cultivation of personhood yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.560" end="01:52:02.639" style="s2">very much and it reminds us what</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.719" end="01:52:04.080" style="s2">it reminds us what what is essential</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.639" end="01:52:06.239" style="s2">what matters what</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.080" end="01:52:08.159" style="s2">what is alive and what is what is you</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.239" end="01:52:10.880" style="s2">know what is hubios and what is</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.159" end="01:52:11.520" style="s2">what is false um what is good faith and</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.880" end="01:52:14.880" style="s2">what is</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.520" end="01:52:16.719" style="s2">bad faith precisely precisely because it</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.880" end="01:52:18.480" style="s2">because it creates</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.719" end="01:52:20.800" style="s2">because it creates the bridge of</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.480" end="01:52:23.679" style="s2">continuity between the frame</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.800" end="01:52:23.920" style="s2">and as it&#39;s a transframing device right</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.679" end="01:52:26.320" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.920" end="01:52:27.760" style="s2">is it is the continuity between what is</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.320" end="01:52:29.840" style="s2">enclosed within the frame</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.760" end="01:52:30.960" style="s2">in in in this case the narrative within</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.840" end="01:52:32.560" style="s2">this metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.960" end="01:52:34.560" style="s2">and what is beyond the frame of the</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.560" end="01:52:37.119" style="s2">narrative uh so</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.560" end="01:52:38.400" style="s2">and and you&#39;re precisely right that the</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.119" end="01:52:40.880" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.400" end="01:52:41.840" style="s2">the the the most the most apt</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.880" end="01:52:45.040" style="s2">description</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.840" end="01:52:46.400" style="s2">of that continuity is precisely the</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.040" end="01:52:49.840" style="s2">relation of faith</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.400" end="01:52:51.360" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s exactly right that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.840" end="01:52:53.760" style="s2">and then you get oh and then i think</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.360" end="01:52:56.880" style="s2">what that does uh to invoke</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.760" end="01:53:00.400" style="s2">uh both of your uh your sort of</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.880" end="01:53:03.599" style="s2">uh familiar with catholicism</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.400" end="01:53:06.639" style="s2">that&#39;s what tradition was supposed to be</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.599" end="01:53:09.920" style="s2">tradition was your faithfulness to the</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.639" end="01:53:11.920" style="s2">chorus that precedes</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.920" end="01:53:13.520" style="s2">it is beyond you and pronounces upon you</p>

<p begin="01:54:04.480" end="01:54:10.239" style="s2">spinoza has this notion of you know</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.520" end="01:54:11.360" style="s2">we can find what he calls the face of</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.239" end="01:54:14.400" style="s2">the universe</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.360" end="01:54:14.880" style="s2">uh which is this sort of gestalting</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.400" end="01:54:17.119" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.880" end="01:54:18.560" style="s2">that allows us to enter into right</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.119" end="01:54:21.280" style="s2">relationship with it</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.560" end="01:54:22.000" style="s2">right and and so yeah i think it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:54:21.280" end="01:54:23.599" style="s2">exactly that</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.000" end="01:54:25.040" style="s2">we&#39;re back to the interfacing notion</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.599" end="01:54:26.960" style="s2">again right</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.040" end="01:54:28.080" style="s2">tradition is a powerful way in which we</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.960" end="01:54:31.520" style="s2">interface</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.080" end="01:54:33.760" style="s2">um with with the universe</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.520" end="01:54:34.960" style="s2">and and make it as you said make it</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.760" end="01:54:38.159" style="s2">cosmic for us</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.960" end="01:54:41.199" style="s2">as opposed to just a a</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.159" end="01:54:42.480" style="s2">an empty set of stuff thrown together</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.199" end="01:54:43.920" style="s2">not an empty stat i&#39;m going to say a</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.480" end="01:54:45.599" style="s2">purely logic i might give me an empty</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.920" end="01:54:46.239" style="s2">set i mean a purely logical or</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.599" end="01:54:48.560" style="s2">terminally</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.239" end="01:54:50.239" style="s2">purely formal set as opposed to a logos</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.560" end="01:54:52.639" style="s2">the difference between a death star</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.239" end="01:54:54.880" style="s2">sorry yeah yeah the difference between a</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.639" end="01:54:56.639" style="s2">a you know a set is you you put any</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.880" end="01:54:58.800" style="s2">any things into it they&#39;re just bound</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.639" end="01:55:00.560" style="s2">together by the formal grouping</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.800" end="01:55:01.840" style="s2">but the logo says they things are</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.560" end="01:55:03.040" style="s2">grouped together so that they come to</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.840" end="01:55:05.199" style="s2">belong together</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.040" end="01:55:06.480" style="s2">and then and thereby and thereby they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.199" end="01:55:08.639" style="s2">belonging to each other</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.480" end="01:55:10.480" style="s2">is how they can include you and you can</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.639" end="01:55:12.000" style="s2">participate their belonging to each</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.480" end="01:55:19.840" style="s2">other is precisely how</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.000" end="01:55:21.200" style="s2">you can belong to them</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.840" end="01:55:22.880" style="s2">i should get going guys</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.200" end="01:55:26.159" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.880" end="01:55:26.639" style="s2">back to back to the the uh the world as</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.159" end="01:55:32.320" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.639" end="01:55:34.639" style="s2">the world as it is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.320" end="01:55:36.239" style="s2">do you have anything else to say</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.639" end="01:55:38.960" style="s2">christopher before</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.239" end="01:55:39.920" style="s2">luindus no nope i&#39;ll let that be the</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.960" end="01:55:43.119" style="s2">final word</p>

<p begin="01:55:47.520" end="01:55:51.840" style="s2">convening us</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.639" end="01:55:54.320" style="s2">and uh yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.840" end="01:55:55.040" style="s2">so we talked about the soul this time</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.320" end="01:55:56.320" style="s2">that was a</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.040" end="01:55:57.920" style="s2">that was the word i threw in in the</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.320" end="01:56:00.080" style="s2">beginning and and maybe if we do it</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.920" end="01:56:03.280" style="s2">again sometime</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.080" end="01:56:05.679" style="s2">i wonder what what&#39;s next i i like this</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.280" end="01:56:07.599" style="s2">andrew actually i like this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.679" end="01:56:09.840" style="s2">taking a pregnant topic</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.599" end="01:56:10.960" style="s2">and then throwing it in and we do that</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.840" end="01:56:13.360" style="s2">thing i talked about we</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.960" end="01:56:14.719" style="s2">open it up and then we recollect it and</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.360" end="01:56:17.920" style="s2">open up and recollect it</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.719" end="01:56:18.639" style="s2">as opposed to just right forming the</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.920" end="01:56:21.360" style="s2">circle</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.639" end="01:56:21.840" style="s2">uh but actually centering the circle</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.360" end="01:56:25.040" style="s2">upon</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.840" end="01:56:27.440" style="s2">a chosen topic on it</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.040" end="01:56:29.520" style="s2">i think the excellent thing we did what</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.440" end="01:56:32.320" style="s2">i really like actually is this</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.520" end="01:56:32.639" style="s2">this uh three three people um i find</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.320" end="01:56:34.719" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.639" end="01:56:36.480" style="s2">it&#39;s much more interesting for me uh in</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.719" end="01:56:38.560" style="s2">these kind of conversations</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.480" end="01:56:39.679" style="s2">if there&#39;s three people here it&#39;s seems</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.560" end="01:56:41.920" style="s2">to be a such a</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.679" end="01:56:44.880" style="s2">much more dynamic energy than just one</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.920" end="01:56:47.440" style="s2">person against another person um</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.880" end="01:56:47.920" style="s2">or so so that&#39;s one thing i really love</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.440" end="01:56:50.639" style="s2">is this</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.920" end="01:56:51.520" style="s2">trio i&#39;m doing that with other people as</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.639" end="01:56:53.280" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.520" end="01:56:55.199" style="s2">well you have the intimate chorus then</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.280" end="01:56:56.000" style="s2">because yeah because yeah the chorus is</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.199" end="01:56:58.480" style="s2">present when when</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.000" end="01:57:00.320" style="s2">we&#39;re three for some reason yep exactly</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.480" end="01:57:02.159" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re more like we&#39;re on a stage</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.320" end="01:57:04.159" style="s2">there&#39;s more than just two people that</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.159" end="01:57:05.920" style="s2">yeah again and we&#39;re actually on a real</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.159" end="01:57:06.719" style="s2">stage when there&#39;s three the chorus is</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.920" end="01:57:08.159" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.719" end="01:57:10.000" style="s2">because that because because the symbol</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.159" end="01:57:12.719" style="s2">of the third factor can emerge</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.000" end="01:57:13.199" style="s2">more apparently right the third factor</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.719" end="01:57:16.000" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.199" end="01:57:17.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a way of uh you know creating a</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.000" end="01:57:19.760" style="s2">locus for the third factor</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.760" end="01:57:21.360" style="s2">third factor to emerge very much right</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.760" end="01:57:23.040" style="s2">and if there&#39;s a fourth person somehow</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.360" end="01:57:23.840" style="s2">one person is kind of left out a little</p>
<p begin="01:57:23.040" end="01:57:25.840" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="01:57:23.840" end="01:57:27.920" style="s2">of the conversation or not always but</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.840" end="01:57:31.760" style="s2">and if it&#39;s five it&#39;s just too many</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.920" end="01:57:33.679" style="s2">so three seems beautiful what anyway</p>
