<p begin="00:02:41.010" end="00:02:45.930" style="s2">of us have been meeting here on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.080" end="00:02:47.580" style="s2">discord at 9:30 Eastern and we&#39;ll do the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.930" end="00:02:50.040" style="s2">meditation and then chat about our</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.580" end="00:02:53.910" style="s2">experience after and and one question</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.040" end="00:02:57.270" style="s2">we&#39;ve been trying to figure out is with</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.910" end="00:02:59.000" style="s2">meta so you&#39;ve described the you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.270" end="00:03:02.520" style="s2">described a mantra with these three</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.000" end="00:03:04.020" style="s2">these three parts so you know may may X</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.520" end="00:03:06.650" style="s2">be happy and healthy</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.020" end="00:03:10.709" style="s2">may I recognize X is true suchness and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.650" end="00:03:12.420" style="s2">may I see the morning X and so we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.709" end="00:03:15.750" style="s2">two questions about this the first</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.420" end="00:03:19.140" style="s2">question is when we&#39;re doing this mantra</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.750" end="00:03:27.060" style="s2">is do we pick one of those or or is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.140" end="00:03:30.269" style="s2">going through each three those are</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.060" end="00:03:31.769" style="s2">different formulations picked one and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.269" end="00:03:32.519" style="s2">gave people different ones so they could</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.769" end="00:03:35.250" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.519" end="00:03:37.470" style="s2">experiment to see which one starts to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.250" end="00:03:39.830" style="s2">resonate or work and it&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.470" end="00:03:42.720" style="s2">shift around at different times too so</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.830" end="00:03:44.420" style="s2">but yet pick one of them and then do it</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:46.950" style="s2">for sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.420" end="00:03:49.680" style="s2">okay thank you that that answer is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.950" end="00:03:51.630" style="s2">that answers that and and and the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:03:53.400" style="s2">thing I guess is we were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.630" end="00:04:05.670" style="s2">figure out what is the difference</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.400" end="00:04:07.590" style="s2">between suchness and morna&#39;s okay which</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.670" end="00:04:10.140" style="s2">they have a non logical like identity</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.590" end="00:04:12.330" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of one of the claims of all</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.140" end="00:04:14.820" style="s2">the you know of all of these mystical</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.330" end="00:04:16.919" style="s2">wisdom traditions you know fun as it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.820" end="00:04:18.660" style="s2">Brahman I just think I&#39;m so I could be</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.919" end="00:04:22.919" style="s2">very careful about distinguishing them</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.660" end="00:04:27.430" style="s2">but the difference in the way I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.919" end="00:04:30.669" style="s2">it is that the morning to</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.430" end="00:04:32.290" style="s2">the fact that everything like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.669" end="00:04:34.210" style="s2">reality is sort of common in the toilet</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.290" end="00:04:37.030" style="s2">explosive the amount of information out</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.210" end="00:04:41.740" style="s2">there ISM is both qualitatively and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.030" end="00:04:43.720" style="s2">qualitatively beyond any any you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.740" end="00:04:47.020" style="s2">any final framing it&#39;s always there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.720" end="00:04:50.139" style="s2">always going to be more than anything be</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.020" end="00:04:53.740" style="s2">afraid and that&#39;s what I that&#39;s against</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.139" end="00:04:57.490" style="s2">the morning the not that such nests have</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.740" end="00:05:00.430" style="s2">to do much more with the fact that there</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.490" end="00:05:06.250" style="s2">is a way in which every determinant</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.430" end="00:05:08.050" style="s2">thing or entity has a uniqueness to it a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.250" end="00:05:11.130" style="s2">way in which it&#39;s individuated and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.050" end="00:05:13.300" style="s2">instantiated that resists categorization</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.130" end="00:05:16.120" style="s2">it used to be in the medieval</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.300" end="00:05:17.350" style="s2">scholastics is called the you know like</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.120" end="00:05:17.919" style="s2">the quiddity of it I believe or</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.350" end="00:05:23.110" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.919" end="00:05:27.550" style="s2">the idea is that if I subtract from you</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.110" end="00:05:30.039" style="s2">all the way all that about you for long</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.550" end="00:05:33.039" style="s2">can be grasped categorically there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.039" end="00:05:35.800" style="s2">that about you in which all of those</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.039" end="00:05:41.289" style="s2">categorization in here English they in</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.800" end="00:05:43.960" style="s2">here so morning is about sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.289" end="00:05:45.639" style="s2">ultimate mystery about how you connect</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.960" end="00:05:48.700" style="s2">and participate in things beyond</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.639" end="00:05:54.750" style="s2">yourself such this is the mystery of how</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.700" end="00:05:58.599" style="s2">you are a non repeatable unique</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.750" end="00:06:01.510" style="s2">instantiation that therefore because of</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.599" end="00:06:04.330" style="s2">that uniqueness and non repeatability is</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.510" end="00:06:05.080" style="s2">not that is not properly part of any</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.330" end="00:06:07.930" style="s2">category</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.080" end="00:06:11.710" style="s2">it&#39;s the non categorical uniqueness</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.930" end="00:06:15.400" style="s2">presence here now NIST&#39;s instantiation</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.710" end="00:06:18.430" style="s2">of you or of anything right so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.400" end="00:06:21.849" style="s2">it&#39;s not just a cat a property of people</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.430" end="00:06:25.330" style="s2">I mean so when you with part of what our</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.849" end="00:06:27.820" style="s2">verb does in fact is it can remind us</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.330" end="00:06:29.889" style="s2">about you know you&#39;re saying that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.820" end="00:06:32.220" style="s2">painting of the shoes by then go right</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.889" end="00:06:35.830" style="s2">right you could you you pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.220" end="00:06:37.539" style="s2">there&#39;s something yeah their shoes and</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.830" end="00:06:40.390" style="s2">their old shoes but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.539" end="00:06:40.810" style="s2">unique and non-repeatable about them and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.390" end="00:06:42.460" style="s2">that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.810" end="00:06:44.830" style="s2">work of art is reminding us reminding</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.460" end="00:06:46.750" style="s2">you with a suchness of issues but work</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.830" end="00:06:49.270" style="s2">of art works of art can also remind you</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.750" end="00:06:51.880" style="s2">right about they can open you up to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.270" end="00:06:54.220" style="s2">sense of awe suchness gives you a sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.880" end="00:06:57.450" style="s2">of intimacy of deep connectedness to the</p>

<p begin="00:07:11.350" end="00:07:15.610" style="s2">helpful yes thank you thank you very</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.330" end="00:07:17.919" style="s2">much for that that that was exactly I</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.610" end="00:07:20.830" style="s2">think that was exactly one of what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.919" end="00:07:24.190" style="s2">know I was looking for if I could follow</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.830" end="00:07:28.870" style="s2">up on that can can we map suchness and</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.190" end="00:07:32.590" style="s2">more nests on to heidegger&#39;s critique of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.870" end="00:07:38.080" style="s2">Anto theology in that suchness is kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.590" end="00:07:53.500" style="s2">of the proper goal of ontology and more</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.080" end="00:07:58.840" style="s2">nests is the proper goal of theology as</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.500" end="00:08:01.840" style="s2">long as you&#39;re doing is right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.840" end="00:08:04.810" style="s2">picking up on yeah how that how you</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.840" end="00:08:07.030" style="s2">trying to break out of both the Anto and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.810" end="00:08:08.590" style="s2">the theology side of the arco theology I</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.030" end="00:08:09.870" style="s2">take it that you&#39;re trying to do right</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.590" end="00:08:12.850" style="s2">is that what you&#39;re trying to do right</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.870" end="00:08:15.130" style="s2">exactly that then I&#39;d say yes I think I</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.850" end="00:08:17.320" style="s2">think you&#39;re yeah I hadn&#39;t made that</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.130" end="00:08:20.169" style="s2">connection so can I congratulate Your</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.320" end="00:08:21.190" style="s2">Honor I think that&#39;s very very good yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.169" end="00:08:25.860" style="s2">I like that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.190" end="00:08:29.130" style="s2">very cool thanks for following up there</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.860" end="00:08:29.130" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.700" end="00:08:33.580" style="s2">all right so we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.390" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">it up for four questions if these</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.580" end="00:08:38.220" style="s2">questions can be basically just so you</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:40.750" style="s2">know can be on on anything related to</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.220" end="00:08:42.430" style="s2">all this I mean if you have questions</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.750" end="00:08:44.650" style="s2">from the series from leaking from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.430" end="00:08:47.770" style="s2">meaning crisis series from any of John&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.650" end="00:08:50.500" style="s2">videos to any of the topics he covers so</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.770" end="00:08:52.750" style="s2">so use use the opportunity that John&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.500" end="00:08:56.190" style="s2">given us to ask all those questions that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.750" end="00:08:58.750" style="s2">that that you&#39;ve been thinking of and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.190" end="00:09:01.510" style="s2">haven&#39;t had a chance I&#39;m also very</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.750" end="00:09:03.040" style="s2">interested in questions I don&#39;t like to</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.510" end="00:09:04.810" style="s2">call them practical because the word</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.040" end="00:09:07.450" style="s2">practical is taken on a weird me I call</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.810" end="00:09:10.630" style="s2">them practicable questions questions of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.450" end="00:09:14.470" style="s2">practice so like like you did right from</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.630" end="00:09:16.780" style="s2">the meditation with contemplation series</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.470" end="00:09:18.550" style="s2">or you know you know all the stuff I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.780" end="00:09:21.610" style="s2">doing with other people around dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.550" end="00:09:24.460" style="s2">and dialogue cultivation of wisdom you</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.610" end="00:09:28.240" style="s2">know I mean I&#39;m interested in those</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.460" end="00:09:29.890" style="s2">kinds of questions as well so just to</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.240" end="00:09:32.380" style="s2">make it clear that you know from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.890" end="00:09:34.180" style="s2">very practicable to the you know most</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.380" end="00:09:37.030" style="s2">philosophical I&#39;m really open to any</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.180" end="00:09:47.620" style="s2">questions anywhere in between and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.030" end="00:09:50.500" style="s2">including jump in in yeah I kiss it hi</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.620" end="00:09:52.750" style="s2">John that was very impressed with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.500" end="00:09:55.630" style="s2">way that you spoke to Paul after our</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.750" end="00:09:58.660" style="s2">previous Q&amp;A so that was amazing and</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.630" end="00:10:01.140" style="s2">also well thank you you were helped you</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.660" end="00:10:03.880" style="s2">were helpful you were helpful thank you</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.140" end="00:10:07.600" style="s2">well glad to be of service I&#39;m hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.880" end="00:10:09.400" style="s2">I can can be more helpful and I also</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.600" end="00:10:11.140" style="s2">wanted to just say that the you made a</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.400" end="00:10:13.240" style="s2">distinction between potentiality and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.140" end="00:10:15.850" style="s2">possibility in your recent talks and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.240" end="00:10:19.980" style="s2">very enthusiastic about that I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.850" end="00:10:25.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a good move as well my question</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.980" end="00:10:28.540" style="s2">is if I remember correctly you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.800" end="00:10:32.050" style="s2">information in your physical ontology do</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.540" end="00:10:33.640" style="s2">I have that right yes I think I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.050" end="00:10:35.170" style="s2">from it yeah you need yeah well III</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.640" end="00:10:37.450" style="s2">distinguish the two two kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.170" end="00:10:40.060" style="s2">information there&#39;s okay information</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.450" end="00:10:43.930" style="s2">which is part of the physical ontology</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.060" end="00:10:44.830" style="s2">and then there&#39;s n information which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.930" end="00:10:46.660" style="s2">meaningful information</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.830" end="00:10:49.240" style="s2">and the hope is that we&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.660" end="00:10:50.970" style="s2">explain the latter in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.240" end="00:10:54.310" style="s2">former within sort of cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.970" end="00:10:56.080" style="s2">that it just important because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.310" end="00:10:57.820" style="s2">lot of sloppy talk and fire out there</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.080" end="00:11:00.040" style="s2">that equivocates between those two</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.820" end="00:11:04.540" style="s2">senses and it really really unhelpful</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.040" end="00:11:06.820" style="s2">may never okay um yeah I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.540" end="00:11:08.290" style="s2">follow on an that maybe you can you also</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.820" end="00:11:11.920" style="s2">help me to clarify between the two</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.290" end="00:11:15.940" style="s2">common kinds of me information sure my</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.920" end="00:11:17.860" style="s2">question is basically well I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.940" end="00:11:19.840" style="s2">the case that if you have information in</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.860" end="00:11:21.760" style="s2">your physical ontology that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.840" end="00:11:24.070" style="s2">have some kind of formal cause within</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:26.320" style="s2">your physics and I was wondering if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.070" end="00:11:28.420" style="s2">agree with that or if you disagree and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.320" end="00:11:33.520" style="s2">you see a way around it no no I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.420" end="00:11:35.680" style="s2">that&#39;s I think that&#39;s right so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.520" end="00:11:37.420" style="s2">talk about the sort of the I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.680" end="00:11:40.840" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of we can get it some at</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.420" end="00:11:43.360" style="s2">math which let&#39;s avoid that the basic</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.840" end="00:11:45.880" style="s2">sense of you know of the Shannon sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.360" end="00:11:48.580" style="s2">of information and then integrating that</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.880" end="00:11:52.420" style="s2">with signal detection theory is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.580" end="00:11:53.890" style="s2">that you like a signal is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.420" end="00:11:57.220" style="s2">probabilistic relation so if the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.890" end="00:11:58.750" style="s2">probability of a given B E is greater</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.220" end="00:12:02.530" style="s2">than the probability of a on its own</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.750" end="00:12:05.890" style="s2">that B is a signal for a but B is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.530" end="00:12:08.710" style="s2">informative signal if B&#39;s prediction of</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.890" end="00:12:11.080" style="s2">a helps you rule out alternatives to</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.710" end="00:12:12.850" style="s2">which they belong so if they belongs to</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.080" end="00:12:14.800" style="s2">a set of like seven other things that</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.850" end="00:12:17.140" style="s2">could have happened and B predicts a</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.800" end="00:12:19.450" style="s2">that&#39;s quite informative because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.140" end="00:12:23.110" style="s2">ruled out all the alternatives and in</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.450" end="00:12:24.850" style="s2">that sense information information is</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.110" end="00:12:26.950" style="s2">pervasive in the universe because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.850" end="00:12:29.920" style="s2">just that probabilistic predictive</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.950" end="00:12:32.580" style="s2">relationship but notice the language</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.920" end="00:12:36.460" style="s2">that I&#39;m using right and right I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.580" end="00:12:38.200" style="s2">the language of you know probabilistic</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.460" end="00:12:40.990" style="s2">relationships and the ruling of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.200" end="00:12:43.000" style="s2">vaulter which is also a probability term</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.990" end="00:12:45.850" style="s2">and I think you&#39;re going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.000" end="00:12:48.580" style="s2">ultimately ground that in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.850" end="00:12:49.450" style="s2">formal causation yeah I think so I would</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.580" end="00:12:53.089" style="s2">agree with that some countries</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.450" end="00:12:55.309" style="s2">editability so</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.089" end="00:12:58.730" style="s2">that yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.309" end="00:13:00.790" style="s2">and so I want to be really careful here</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.730" end="00:13:03.740" style="s2">and I know as I know you do too because</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.790" end="00:13:06.290" style="s2">part of what we&#39;re doing with it</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.740" end="00:13:09.470" style="s2">no I don&#39;t think intelligibility is an</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.290" end="00:13:12.199" style="s2">equivocation between the two kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.470" end="00:13:14.749" style="s2">meaning I think it&#39;s a proper bridge the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.199" end="00:13:16.759" style="s2">trouble I have is that not enough</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.749" end="00:13:18.410" style="s2">when people talk about intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.759" end="00:13:20.290" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to be very careful here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.410" end="00:13:22.970" style="s2">wrong but when you people talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.290" end="00:13:25.009" style="s2">intelligibility they often fall into</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.970" end="00:13:26.720" style="s2">that equivocation between those two</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.009" end="00:13:28.519" style="s2">kinds of meeting you don&#39;t I mean so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.720" end="00:13:30.680" style="s2">think the concept of intelligibility is</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.519" end="00:13:32.779" style="s2">really really important that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.680" end="00:13:36.110" style="s2">structure or there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.779" end="00:13:38.360" style="s2">structure that makes there&#39;s a structure</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.110" end="00:13:41.240" style="s2">of T information that appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.360" end="00:13:43.069" style="s2">affords the generation of M information</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.240" end="00:13:44.930" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.069" end="00:13:46.790" style="s2">and that&#39;s why I&#39;m really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.930" end="00:13:49.579" style="s2">the ancient idea of logos precisely</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.790" end="00:13:52.189" style="s2">because it was an attempt an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.579" end="00:13:58.970" style="s2">talk about that affordance as bridging</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.189" end="00:14:01.009" style="s2">between the writings yeah well I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.970" end="00:14:02.629" style="s2">a long-term plan to associate the formal</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.009" end="00:14:04.850" style="s2">course with your perspective of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.629" end="00:14:07.959" style="s2">so yeah this is a good mood a good</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.850" end="00:14:12.999" style="s2">answer for first ones I&#39;m convinced okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.959" end="00:14:15.290" style="s2">I just want that was very hopeful for me</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.999" end="00:14:18.290" style="s2">that you know there&#39;s a lot of talk</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.290" end="00:14:20.809" style="s2">about sense making right now and this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.290" end="00:14:23.300" style="s2">good a culture needs it but I think we</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.809" end="00:14:25.100" style="s2">need to be very careful about you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.300" end="00:14:27.050" style="s2">getting very careful about using terms</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.100" end="00:14:29.420" style="s2">like intelligibility in terms like</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.050" end="00:14:31.670" style="s2">information there&#39;s a lot of ways in</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.420" end="00:14:33.649" style="s2">which we can fall in very confused and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.670" end="00:14:36.529" style="s2">confusing thinking and so we need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.649" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">really care around this yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.529" end="00:14:40.879" style="s2">mentioned the Cartesian dualism is also</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:47.240" style="s2">quite a thorn in your side and mr.</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.879" end="00:14:49.370" style="s2">garden yes yeah but there&#39;s some very</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.240" end="00:14:53.059" style="s2">interesting stuff happening with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.370" end="00:14:54.139" style="s2">of people right now so yeah great I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.059" end="00:14:56.179" style="s2">got more questions but I want to give</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.139" end="00:14:57.529" style="s2">other people a chance oh that was an</p>

<p begin="00:14:57.529" end="00:15:02.720" style="s2">I&#39;m continuing to find your questions</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.559" end="00:15:05.569" style="s2">and I mean this in the good sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.720" end="00:15:08.439" style="s2">term very thought-provoking well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.569" end="00:15:11.300" style="s2">great that&#39;s exactly what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.439" end="00:15:17.449" style="s2">thanks John happy mask salesman I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.300" end="00:15:20.540" style="s2">you were trying to get in before yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.449" end="00:15:23.449" style="s2">that&#39;s right thank you I have a question</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.540" end="00:15:25.309" style="s2">and I will best try to articulate it I</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.449" end="00:15:26.989" style="s2">don&#39;t know if it&#39;s fully fleshed out in</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.309" end="00:15:31.389" style="s2">my mind but nonetheless I will ask him</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.989" end="00:15:34.369" style="s2">to what extent do people other do</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.389" end="00:15:36.049" style="s2">thoughts opinions conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.369" end="00:15:40.309" style="s2">you&#39;ve had with other people say in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.049" end="00:15:43.029" style="s2">day guide or influence your meditation</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.309" end="00:15:47.329" style="s2">practice do you ever fight yourself</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.029" end="00:15:48.949" style="s2">reflecting on on events during the day</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.329" end="00:15:50.869" style="s2">throughout that practice and is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.949" end="00:15:53.899" style="s2">something that you try to shut out or do</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.869" end="00:15:55.579" style="s2">you invite into the meditation yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.899" end="00:15:57.889" style="s2">that&#39;s an excellent question that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.579" end="00:16:00.529" style="s2">often why I give novices the advice of</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.889" end="00:16:02.839" style="s2">not meditating right after having an</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.529" end="00:16:04.249" style="s2">emotionally engaged conversation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.839" end="00:16:05.989" style="s2">like I used to call it what it used to</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.249" end="00:16:08.869" style="s2">make sense to people you&#39;re playing the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.989" end="00:16:11.899" style="s2">tapes in your head so yeah one of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.869" end="00:16:15.019" style="s2">things you want to do is you want to try</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.899" end="00:16:17.119" style="s2">and treat that like a distraction label</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.019" end="00:16:19.929" style="s2">it and yeah and try to return to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.119" end="00:16:23.569" style="s2">breath yeah don&#39;t try and force it out</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.929" end="00:16:25.329" style="s2">try and make your breath more attractive</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.569" end="00:16:29.809" style="s2">in the ways I talked about in the course</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.329" end="00:16:33.649" style="s2">as a strategy now what you should do</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.809" end="00:16:36.139" style="s2">right is you should then so that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.649" end="00:16:37.399" style="s2">of one side of the other side is it you</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.139" end="00:16:41.029" style="s2">should think about taking up a practice</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.399" end="00:16:42.949" style="s2">in which you properly respond to that</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.029" end="00:16:46.339" style="s2">and one of the things that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.949" end="00:16:50.119" style="s2">to do with that that I try to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.339" end="00:16:51.589" style="s2">try to move it from room ination which</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.119" end="00:16:54.799" style="s2">is running in your head to journaling</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.589" end="00:16:58.009" style="s2">where you write it down and you you sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.799" end="00:16:59.480" style="s2">of get into like almost like a written</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.009" end="00:17:01.369" style="s2">dialogue with the person you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.480" end="00:17:03.470" style="s2">to write names like I say this and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.369" end="00:17:06.439" style="s2">say that but you sort of write write it</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.470" end="00:17:08.779" style="s2">out it&#39;s a lot of research showing that</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.439" end="00:17:11.240" style="s2">you know the simple act of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.779" end="00:17:12.919" style="s2">move of journaling and writing it allows</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.240" end="00:17:14.929" style="s2">you to move to the third-person</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.919" end="00:17:16.789" style="s2">perspective at times get the Soliman</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.929" end="00:17:18.199" style="s2">effect often notice patterns that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.789" end="00:17:19.089" style="s2">can&#39;t notice when you&#39;re keeping in and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.199" end="00:17:22.929" style="s2">working memory</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.089" end="00:17:26.559" style="s2">and this actually helps that that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.929" end="00:17:29.799" style="s2">inner conversation turned into almost</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.559" end="00:17:31.539" style="s2">like a a proper practice of dialectic in</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.799" end="00:17:33.700" style="s2">which you&#39;re starting to actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.539" end="00:17:35.380" style="s2">challenge anything ant is the knees</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.700" end="00:17:37.750" style="s2">famously said that when they asked him</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.380" end="00:17:39.070" style="s2">what he learned from Socrates and he</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.750" end="00:17:40.900" style="s2">said this in a way that was meant to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.070" end="00:17:42.400" style="s2">very provocative as he learned how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.900" end="00:17:44.470" style="s2">converse with himself he learned how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.400" end="00:17:46.600" style="s2">do this he learned how to take the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.470" end="00:17:49.990" style="s2">interactions with Socrates and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.600" end="00:17:52.029" style="s2">properly do them on his own and so I</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.990" end="00:17:55.419" style="s2">recommend doing a two prong strategy I</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.029" end="00:17:58.450" style="s2">recommend but in the sitting right and</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.419" end="00:18:00.760" style="s2">then treat it like a distraction ing</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.450" end="00:18:02.230" style="s2">word return to your breath switch really</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.760" end="00:18:04.090" style="s2">try to renew your interest in the breath</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.230" end="00:18:06.190" style="s2">make it more salient to you all the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.090" end="00:18:07.570" style="s2">stuff I talked about but also take up a</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.190" end="00:18:09.370" style="s2">practice where you say no what I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.570" end="00:18:11.320" style="s2">to do you can even talk to that part of</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.370" end="00:18:13.299" style="s2">you that wants to play the tapes and say</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.320" end="00:18:15.010" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna give you your due and but</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.299" end="00:18:16.929" style="s2">we&#39;re not just gonna run the tapes we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.010" end="00:18:18.340" style="s2">actually gonna work this through we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.929" end="00:18:20.830" style="s2">gonna we&#39;re going to actually turn this</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.340" end="00:18:24.100" style="s2">into an interactive form of reflection</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.830" end="00:18:31.690" style="s2">and restructuring of thinking so I would</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.100" end="00:18:33.510" style="s2">recommend that as as a response thank</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.690" end="00:18:37.590" style="s2">you very much that was very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.510" end="00:18:42.130" style="s2">you&#39;re welcome come could I get in next</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.590" end="00:18:45.669" style="s2">so about a year ago I realized that a</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.130" end="00:18:48.070" style="s2">lot of my problems had come from an</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.669" end="00:18:49.029" style="s2">internet addiction and so I found it</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.070" end="00:18:52.330" style="s2">very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.029" end="00:18:55.980" style="s2">when I heard you talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.330" end="00:19:01.049" style="s2">opposition between Anago gay and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.980" end="00:19:05.500" style="s2">addiction so I was just wondering</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.049" end="00:19:08.080" style="s2">whether you can either tell me immediate</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.500" end="00:19:10.270" style="s2">steps one could take to halt the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.080" end="00:19:13.210" style="s2">addictive process and turn it round to a</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.270" end="00:19:21.240" style="s2">mark okay or tell me someone who can</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.210" end="00:19:21.240" style="s2">tell me like a book or something well I</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.480" end="00:19:29.860" style="s2">think spices game could you throw in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.940" end="00:19:31.780" style="s2">definition of a negau gay for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.860" end="00:19:32.679" style="s2">if you if you could well while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.780" end="00:19:39.639" style="s2">answering that</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.679" end="00:19:41.350" style="s2">so and magog a is its electronic form</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.639" end="00:19:47.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the opposite of what the</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.350" end="00:19:48.909" style="s2">reciprocal name of it so but it has more</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.440" end="00:19:51.789" style="s2">than just the reciprocal opening because</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.909" end="00:19:54.999" style="s2">it it talks about well Plato talks about</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.789" end="00:19:57.369" style="s2">two important aspects so the let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.999" end="00:20:00.159" style="s2">about sort of the inner inner aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.369" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2">an a dog a is properly aligned in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.159" end="00:20:04.570" style="s2">different components of the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:07.929" style="s2">learning how to create an inner culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.570" end="00:20:10.330" style="s2">by which they are self-organizing in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.929" end="00:20:12.549" style="s2">mutually optimizing fashion rather than</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.330" end="00:20:14.710" style="s2">being beset by internal anxiety and</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.549" end="00:20:18.279" style="s2">inner conflict and then the idea from</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.710" end="00:20:19.480" style="s2">that at is that actually reduces the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.279" end="00:20:21.549" style="s2">degree to which you&#39;re subject to</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.480" end="00:20:24.460" style="s2">bullshitting yourself and self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.549" end="00:20:27.429" style="s2">and then that affords you picking up on</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.460" end="00:20:28.990" style="s2">patterns in the world that outward you</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.429" end="00:20:31.539" style="s2">that you would not seen before because</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.990" end="00:20:33.009" style="s2">of your self-deception and as you pick</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.539" end="00:20:35.169" style="s2">up on those patterns you get actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.009" end="00:20:38.110" style="s2">better at distinguishing real patterns</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.169" end="00:20:40.990" style="s2">from illusory one and then you</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.110" end="00:20:43.059" style="s2">internalize that ability and that right</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.990" end="00:20:44.789" style="s2">and you then look for patterns within</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.059" end="00:20:47.409" style="s2">the psyche you&#39;ve developed a taste for</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.789" end="00:20:49.450" style="s2">patterns of it more real and then that</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.409" end="00:20:51.369" style="s2">helps you notice better deeper patterns</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.450" end="00:20:53.350" style="s2">within the psyche that helps you further</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.369" end="00:20:57.639" style="s2">optimize and that reduces the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.350" end="00:20:59.440" style="s2">self-deception he&#39;s come were able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.639" end="00:21:01.450" style="s2">realize real patterns in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.440" end="00:21:02.590" style="s2">the whole thing was separately opens the</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.450" end="00:21:04.869" style="s2">world is opening up you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.590" end="00:21:07.210" style="s2">deeper and deeper into the real patterns</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.869" end="00:21:09.340" style="s2">as it is then it called them and at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.210" end="00:21:11.230" style="s2">same time you&#39;re getting sort of deeper</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.340" end="00:21:14.230" style="s2">and deeper into the real patterns within</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.230" end="00:21:16.149" style="s2">the psyche and you&#39;re satisfied with</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.230" end="00:21:19.299" style="s2">cyclical opening year simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.149" end="00:21:21.970" style="s2">satisfying the meta desire to be at</p>

<p begin="00:21:34.570" end="00:21:41.379" style="s2">wisdom but it also has the accents of a</p>

<p begin="00:24:28.070" end="00:24:35.690" style="s2">group this meeting on this discord and</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.750" end="00:24:37.190" style="s2">in general yeah I mean what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.690" end="00:24:39.560" style="s2">in the Sangha and the chat group is</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.190" end="00:24:42.830" style="s2">really good and this is what I see</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.560" end="00:24:46.040" style="s2">happening it in saying I said why people</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.830" end="00:24:48.860" style="s2">ask questions of each other they share</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.040" end="00:24:50.810" style="s2">problems things that are you know things</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.860" end="00:24:54.580" style="s2">that are finding obstacles or hindrances</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.810" end="00:24:57.770" style="s2">they also share things that are helpful</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.580" end="00:24:59.210" style="s2">things nuances of practices or things</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.770" end="00:25:01.430" style="s2">they&#39;ve read or looked at that are</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.210" end="00:25:03.400" style="s2">helping them with the practice also you</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.430" end="00:25:06.200" style="s2">should make it part of it to celebrate</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.400" end="00:25:07.550" style="s2">not in any sort of self aggrandizing way</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.200" end="00:25:09.500" style="s2">but people should bring moments where</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.550" end="00:25:11.780" style="s2">they just say hey I had this moment of</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.500" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">insight or I had this moment where I</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.780" end="00:25:16.850" style="s2">really feel really well fitted or I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:18.470" style="s2">able to really see through what a</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.850" end="00:25:23.090" style="s2">pattern that are normally locked into</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.470" end="00:25:25.550" style="s2">and so you know those things you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.090" end="00:25:28.730" style="s2">you know bringing that in those moments</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.550" end="00:25:30.260" style="s2">of celebration the moments where you</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.730" end="00:25:31.880" style="s2">found things that afford the practice</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.260" end="00:25:34.850" style="s2">the obstacles you&#39;re finding in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.880" end="00:25:36.020" style="s2">practice also anything it&#39;s unclear to</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.850" end="00:25:38.750" style="s2">you questions you might have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.020" end="00:25:40.130" style="s2">clarification those third those are sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.750" end="00:25:43.100" style="s2">of the main things you want to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.130" end="00:25:46.360" style="s2">and then finally just just a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.100" end="00:25:48.560" style="s2">you know encouraging people because</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.360" end="00:25:50.690" style="s2">everybody&#39;s motivation waxes and wanes</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.560" end="00:25:52.520" style="s2">and one of the things we can rely on a</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.690" end="00:25:54.290" style="s2">distributed cognition with other</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.520" end="00:25:57.080" style="s2">people&#39;s motivation being stronger when</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.290" end="00:25:59.450" style="s2">our is is weaker and vice versa and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.080" end="00:26:05.370" style="s2">that&#39;s very very important to that that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.450" end="00:26:12.000" style="s2">element of of encouragement thank you</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.370" end="00:26:14.370" style="s2">that incidence that helps along if there</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.000" end="00:26:20.550" style="s2">is a space could I ask a follow-up on</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.370" end="00:26:24.990" style="s2">the same topic that&#39;s fine with me so</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.550" end="00:26:27.690" style="s2">this morning after this sit we we</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.990" end="00:26:30.510" style="s2">practice Lexi Oh Davina individually and</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.690" end="00:26:32.670" style="s2">discuss it afterwards I know some church</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.510" end="00:26:34.350" style="s2">groups do this as a group practice and</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.670" end="00:26:38.010" style="s2">something we were discussion and</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.350" end="00:26:40.590" style="s2">wondering about is how to adapt the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.010" end="00:26:42.510" style="s2">version of it then you&#39;ve presented on</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.590" end="00:26:45.900" style="s2">to a group practice such as on this</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.510" end="00:26:48.030" style="s2">discord yeah I think that&#39;s excellent I</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.900" end="00:26:49.980" style="s2">mean I think ultimately that I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.030" end="00:26:56.820" style="s2">people should be doing Lexi OH both</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.980" end="00:26:58.740" style="s2">individually and part of what sorry</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.820" end="00:27:02.940" style="s2">sense promise area but part of what I</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.740" end="00:27:04.679" style="s2">would like help sort of help people to</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.940" end="00:27:06.750" style="s2">build and something I&#39;m trying to work</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.679" end="00:27:08.760" style="s2">on myself and trying to understand so</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.750" end="00:27:11.730" style="s2">there&#39;s very much work in progress is</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.760" end="00:27:13.080" style="s2">how you could have group Alexio and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.730" end="00:27:15.510" style="s2">how that would lead into something</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.080" end="00:27:17.190" style="s2">naturally like the Ilocos where people</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.510" end="00:27:20.070" style="s2">would start talking about it in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.190" end="00:27:21.030" style="s2">dialogical fashion and trying to see how</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.070" end="00:27:24.330" style="s2">those would fit together</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.030" end="00:27:27.600" style="s2">um is sort of optimal in my mind I I</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.330" end="00:27:32.820" style="s2">think for doing it at least trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.600" end="00:27:37.620" style="s2">it at least intuitively is you know pick</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.820" end="00:27:40.140" style="s2">and you should cycle right people should</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.620" end="00:27:41.340" style="s2">take turns one but up would you live in</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.140" end="00:27:45.750" style="s2">the in the group sitting I would have</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.340" end="00:27:49.110" style="s2">one person do the two readings share</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.750" end="00:27:50.670" style="s2">their personal resonances and then other</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.110" end="00:27:53.400" style="s2">you know everybody sort of do the</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.670" end="00:27:55.710" style="s2">practice initially within themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.400" end="00:27:58.980" style="s2">then like like a bit of a deal logos</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.710" end="00:28:02.040" style="s2">everybody share what their residences</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.980" end="00:28:04.710" style="s2">were and how they unfolded it and be</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.040" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">really open right you know this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.710" end="00:28:09.630" style="s2">any kind of comparison or in a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:12.059" style="s2">contrasting but everybody share you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.630" end="00:28:14.400" style="s2">how they resonated how they enacted</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.059" end="00:28:16.290" style="s2">what&#39;s disclosed what came out of it and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.400" end="00:28:18.800" style="s2">and then you&#39;re gonna have you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.290" end="00:28:20.670" style="s2">nuances of perspective and the I</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.800" end="00:28:23.220" style="s2">collectively to try and create a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.670" end="00:28:25.050" style="s2">rich shared salience landscape about all</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.220" end="00:28:28.140" style="s2">the different aspects and try and</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.050" end="00:28:29.940" style="s2">provoke each other you know you know and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.140" end="00:28:30.510" style="s2">try to be open and said oh I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.940" end="00:28:32.910" style="s2">thought about that</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.510" end="00:28:36.120" style="s2">that brings out an aspect that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.910" end="00:28:38.040" style="s2">get when in my own take on Alexio and</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.120" end="00:28:40.020" style="s2">see what would it mean to try and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.040" end="00:28:42.210" style="s2">internalize that into your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.020" end="00:28:48.330" style="s2">and vice versa that&#39;s what I would see</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.210" end="00:28:51.810" style="s2">happen happening in a group city thanks</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.330" end="00:28:53.870" style="s2">for that chunk so as it happens I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.810" end="00:28:56.460" style="s2">trying to draft a structure right now</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.870" end="00:28:59.250" style="s2">for a group of luck to you a Davina</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.460" end="00:29:02.520" style="s2">practice that I&#39;ll propose tomorrow and</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.250" end="00:29:05.010" style="s2">I&#39;m also thinking along the same lines</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.520" end="00:29:07.620" style="s2">and I&#39;m wondering if some of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.010" end="00:29:09.330" style="s2">from circling and the intersection</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.620" end="00:29:17.010" style="s2">between circling and deal overs can be</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.330" end="00:29:20.070" style="s2">incorporated I see them being almost</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.010" end="00:29:22.680" style="s2">almost on a continuum where the Alexia</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.070" end="00:29:24.990" style="s2">will just shade naturally is that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.680" end="00:29:27.600" style="s2">right word into you the DM logos and</p>

<p begin="00:34:46.649" end="00:34:53.969" style="s2">that this is more lyrical and more</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.789" end="00:34:57.079" style="s2">accessible and therefore maybe at least</p>

<p begin="00:35:24.299" end="00:35:28.019" style="s2">what I would recommend</p>

<p begin="00:35:36.239" end="00:35:40.289" style="s2">downloaded it from sorry I&#39;ve ordered I</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.759" end="00:35:42.180" style="s2">didn&#39;t download it in order to comb</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.289" end="00:35:46.140" style="s2">Amazon but it it just seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.180" end="00:35:49.410" style="s2">direct frantic so I think it&#39;s in public</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.140" end="00:35:51.269" style="s2">domain and it&#39;s just been cool so you</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.410" end="00:35:54.359" style="s2">might be able to it was very inexpensive</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.269" end="00:35:58.339" style="s2">I mean so I would recommend that I would</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.359" end="00:35:58.339" style="s2">recommend that thank you</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.279" end="00:36:11.039" style="s2">hi John I have a question yes please</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.849" end="00:36:14.190" style="s2">okay so I was just wanna give me a</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.039" end="00:36:16.650" style="s2">cognitive science account effect so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.190" end="00:36:19.410" style="s2">been reading a book called shame and</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.650" end="00:36:21.900" style="s2">pride by David Nathanson I&#39;m not sure if</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.410" end="00:36:25.740" style="s2">you&#39;ve heard of that book anyways and he</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.900" end="00:36:31.410" style="s2">tries to argue in the book that effect</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.740" end="00:36:35.510" style="s2">is is an eternal amplification of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.410" end="00:36:40.319" style="s2">stimulus of an environmental stimulus so</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.510" end="00:36:42.539" style="s2">and then young girl fear I know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.319" end="00:36:50.029" style="s2">got a lot of talks with with Todd</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.539" end="00:36:53.819" style="s2">Anderson about this yeah Anderson Todd</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.029" end="00:36:55.109" style="s2">and young makes a comment about a fact</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.819" end="00:36:56.880" style="s2">saying the effects occur where</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.109" end="00:36:59.700" style="s2">adaptation is weakest</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.880" end="00:37:01.500" style="s2">so again can you just give me a call my</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.700" end="00:37:08.430" style="s2">cognitive science account on what effect</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.500" end="00:37:11.039" style="s2">is please yeah so the amplification of</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.430" end="00:37:13.559" style="s2">stimuli because I&#39;m only is picking up</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.039" end="00:37:20.640" style="s2">on the attentional aspects of a fact</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.559" end="00:37:30.210" style="s2">they affect constrains reshapes the stop</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.640" end="00:37:31.980" style="s2">organization I think it&#39;s I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.210" end="00:37:36.510" style="s2">that&#39;s a sufficient account of what</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.980" end="00:37:40.020" style="s2">affected so good a good place to look is</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.510" end="00:37:42.059" style="s2">like DiMaggio&#39;s for Descartes Sarah when</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.020" end="00:37:45.240" style="s2">he argues that part of the role of</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.059" end="00:37:47.880" style="s2">effect it&#39;s not just amplification</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.240" end="00:37:50.339" style="s2">there&#39;s selection prioritization and</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.880" end="00:37:52.260" style="s2">then there&#39;s the wreckage there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.339" end="00:37:54.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a project of affording the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.260" end="00:37:57.420" style="s2">organism to appropriately shape itself</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.920" end="00:37:59.430" style="s2">in order to anticipate its environment</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.420" end="00:38:02.720" style="s2">so I would bring up I would bring that</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.430" end="00:38:05.190" style="s2">out to you know adaptive anticipation</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.720" end="00:38:07.140" style="s2">and maybe that&#39;s picking up a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.190" end="00:38:08.970" style="s2">young and this is coming out in the in</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.140" end="00:38:12.750" style="s2">the predictive processing models that</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.970" end="00:38:15.059" style="s2">are becoming very dominant and others</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.750" end="00:38:17.730" style="s2">then what that is doing is basically</p>

<p begin="00:38:17.730" end="00:38:21.720" style="s2">dissipation of the world is going that</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.740" end="00:38:24.000" style="s2">you know you&#39;re sort of modeling the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.720" end="00:38:26.730" style="s2">world that&#39;s translating into landscape</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.000" end="00:38:29.730" style="s2">and then that&#39;s telling and then how</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.730" end="00:38:32.700" style="s2">well is that getting you to actively not</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.730" end="00:38:34.770" style="s2">imaginatively but in action anticipate</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.700" end="00:38:36.630" style="s2">your environment and positive effect is</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.770" end="00:38:38.250" style="s2">basically saying is it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.630" end="00:38:45.180" style="s2">feedback saying you&#39;re actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.250" end="00:38:47.550" style="s2">better this homing in on getting better</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.180" end="00:38:49.590" style="s2">at you know inactive anticipation in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.550" end="00:38:51.960" style="s2">environment and negative effect is oh</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.590" end="00:38:53.340" style="s2">right your salience landscaping you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.960" end="00:38:55.859" style="s2">not paying attention to the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.340" end="00:38:58.140" style="s2">and you&#39;re not you&#39;re not activating the</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.859" end="00:38:59.790" style="s2">right skills right and you&#39;re not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.140" end="00:39:01.350" style="s2">not anticipating the right causal</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.790" end="00:39:04.050" style="s2">structures you&#39;re not picking up on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.350" end="00:39:07.320" style="s2">right patterns so that&#39;s how I would</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.050" end="00:39:10.290" style="s2">that&#39;s how I base it on the work that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.320" end="00:39:11.760" style="s2">coming out the process and model the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.290" end="00:39:16.080" style="s2">work that&#39;s coming out of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.760" end="00:39:18.180" style="s2">best neuroscience around a fact and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.080" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">this lines up with a lot of stuff I do</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.180" end="00:39:23.460" style="s2">on relevance realization and salience as</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:24.869" style="s2">well as work that out of on attention so</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.460" end="00:39:26.640" style="s2">I would put all those together that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.869" end="00:39:30.150" style="s2">how I would that&#39;s what I would say</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.640" end="00:39:31.619" style="s2">perfect is doing yeah to comment on what</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.150" end="00:39:33.510" style="s2">you said about predictive processing</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.619" end="00:39:35.790" style="s2">Nathanson gives you an example in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.510" end="00:39:39.270" style="s2">book about a little girl that takes her</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.790" end="00:39:40.650" style="s2">daddy&#39;s papers and she begins to without</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.270" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">him knowing and she begins to rip them</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.650" end="00:39:44.700" style="s2">up rip them up right and she&#39;s playing</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:47.609" style="s2">with them and then her dad comes in and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.700" end="00:39:50.070" style="s2">then she&#39;s expecting in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.609" end="00:39:53.430" style="s2">phenomenological sense right that she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.070" end="00:39:57.060" style="s2">done something right she does she her</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.430" end="00:40:00.660" style="s2">playing by airplane and her dad responds</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.060" end="00:40:02.430" style="s2">by yelling at her right so and then and</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.660" end="00:40:04.170" style="s2">then Madison says that&#39;s when Shane</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.430" end="00:40:07.740" style="s2">that&#39;s a shame happens essentially my</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.170" end="00:40:09.480" style="s2">habit is that you it&#39;s as if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.740" end="00:40:12.440" style="s2">suppression of your effect your effect</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.480" end="00:40:14.310" style="s2">is being redirected because it has</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.440" end="00:40:14.790" style="s2">essentially the positive feelings have</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.310" end="00:40:18.119" style="s2">nowhere to go</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.790" end="00:40:22.560" style="s2">um it&#39;s it&#39;s too quick of a change in</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.119" end="00:40:24.780" style="s2">the in in in the environment so but</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.560" end="00:40:26.820" style="s2">thank you for that yeah yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.780" end="00:40:29.790" style="s2">would you want that at least and say</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.820" end="00:40:30.860" style="s2">well what&#39;s happening is right you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.790" end="00:40:32.570" style="s2">she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.860" end="00:40:34.580" style="s2">is a quick sequence of effect there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.570" end="00:40:36.730" style="s2">something like disappointment and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.580" end="00:40:39.980" style="s2">there&#39;s something probably like fear and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.730" end="00:40:41.390" style="s2">what that what&#39;s that saying is maybe if</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.980" end="00:40:43.760" style="s2">you allow me to use some of my language</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.390" end="00:40:47.360" style="s2">met the frame the framing that she had</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.760" end="00:40:50.960" style="s2">but she was playing right is not picking</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.360" end="00:40:52.730" style="s2">up on like the problems trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.960" end="00:40:55.100" style="s2">which is how to have an appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.730" end="00:40:56.630" style="s2">connection to her dad and so yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.100" end="00:40:59.810" style="s2">what the athlete is doing is it&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.630" end="00:41:01.850" style="s2">to rapidly restructure or salience</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.810" end="00:41:03.980" style="s2">landscaping and her framing so that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.850" end="00:41:06.500" style="s2">the goal that she most cares about has a</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.980" end="00:41:11.300" style="s2">greater chance of being dissolved yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.500" end="00:41:14.410" style="s2">that makes a lot of sense thank you</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.300" end="00:41:14.410" style="s2">thank you for that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.110" end="00:41:22.930" style="s2">I think if I could just riff on that for</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.940" end="00:41:25.160" style="s2">a second you know this is a theme that</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.930" end="00:41:29.120" style="s2">other I mean I was just talking to</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.160" end="00:41:30.590" style="s2">somebody Mark Miller is really great</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.120" end="00:41:35.480" style="s2">where he three users coming out of in</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.590" end="00:41:37.570" style="s2">Clarks lab all the stuff that the idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.480" end="00:41:40.120" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to get sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.570" end="00:41:42.950" style="s2">cognition intelligence and it not have</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.120" end="00:41:44.750" style="s2">you know very powerful complex up</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.950" end="00:41:46.610" style="s2">organizing a fight I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.750" end="00:41:48.890" style="s2">misplaced project I think that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.610" end="00:41:51.200" style="s2">misplaced project I think effective</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.890" end="00:41:52.940" style="s2">cognition and intelligent cognition are</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.200" end="00:41:57.820" style="s2">very deeply intertwined in</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.940" end="00:41:57.820" style="s2">interdependent and for very good reason</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.540" end="00:42:09.890" style="s2">so I&#39;m open to more questions that</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.790" end="00:42:12.930" style="s2">please I had a question about the</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.890" end="00:42:16.560" style="s2">medication so I you know I see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.930" end="00:42:17.970" style="s2">a lot of resonance with meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.560" end="00:42:20.970" style="s2">work that you&#39;re doing and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.970" end="00:42:22.590" style="s2">meditation and so to some extent it</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.970" end="00:42:24.900" style="s2">looks like these two things are acting</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.590" end="00:42:28.080" style="s2">in concert with one another and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.900" end="00:42:30.660" style="s2">wondering like did the meditation inform</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.080" end="00:42:32.610" style="s2">the meaning crisis or vice versa you</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.660" end="00:42:34.680" style="s2">know yeah with dialog are they in and</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.610" end="00:42:36.540" style="s2">and what&#39;s sort of your intention for</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.680" end="00:42:37.680" style="s2">the meditation in relation to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.540" end="00:42:40.350" style="s2">meaning crisis like how do you see that</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.680" end="00:42:43.440" style="s2">fitting together okay so first of all I</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.350" end="00:42:47.040" style="s2">want to thank you for that that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.440" end="00:42:51.150" style="s2">very that dialogue is intense and trying</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.040" end="00:42:52.710" style="s2">to properly convey that to people so</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.150" end="00:42:56.010" style="s2">it&#39;s practicable for them it&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.710" end="00:42:59.250" style="s2">one of my goals so you you&#39;re I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.010" end="00:43:00.990" style="s2">encouraged by unit noting that and</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.250" end="00:43:02.850" style="s2">seeing that connection because the</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.990" end="00:43:04.140" style="s2">dialogue is it&#39;s very symmetrical it</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.850" end="00:43:07.580" style="s2">goes both ways they&#39;re mutually</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.140" end="00:43:11.010" style="s2">informing each other very very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.580" end="00:43:13.170" style="s2">now to the just thank you for that okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.010" end="00:43:18.120" style="s2">that&#39;s very encouraging to me it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.170" end="00:43:21.360" style="s2">encouraging to me the the the</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.120" end="00:43:23.460" style="s2">relationship between them is well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.360" end="00:43:26.220" style="s2">first of all there&#39;s you know proximal I</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.460" end="00:43:28.350" style="s2">think and I don&#39;t have time to repeat it</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.220" end="00:43:30.180" style="s2">here but there&#39;s a lot of the choices</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.350" end="00:43:33.060" style="s2">with verve a keys recently I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.180" end="00:43:34.890" style="s2">building this argument I think ovid the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.060" end="00:43:37.320" style="s2">Cova crisis is really increasing Dhamma</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.890" end="00:43:39.480" style="s2">side really accelerating the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.320" end="00:43:44.220" style="s2">crisis for a large number of people and</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.480" end="00:43:48.120" style="s2">I think just giving them the meditation</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.220" end="00:43:50.130" style="s2">is to try and give them not anything</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.120" end="00:43:51.960" style="s2">that&#39;s a symptom suppressant but</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.130" end="00:43:54.960" style="s2">something that really deeply connects</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.960" end="00:43:57.810" style="s2">them in a transformative way you know to</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.960" end="00:44:00.830" style="s2">to the perspectival and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.810" end="00:44:04.470" style="s2">participatory machinery that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.830" end="00:44:07.500" style="s2">re access reactivated restructured in</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.470" end="00:44:10.140" style="s2">order to give people both both the</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.500" end="00:44:12.960" style="s2">response to you know self-deception and</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.140" end="00:44:15.120" style="s2">also the capacity to enhance the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.960" end="00:44:16.980" style="s2">connectedness that&#39;s at the core of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.120" end="00:44:17.880" style="s2">sense of meaning in life so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.980" end="00:44:20.930" style="s2">sort of proximal thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.880" end="00:44:24.390" style="s2">the long-term relationship is that I see</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.930" end="00:44:26.250" style="s2">the ecology of practices that you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.390" end="00:44:27.720" style="s2">because I there&#39;s a meditative practice</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.250" end="00:44:30.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a contemplative practice there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.720" end="00:44:32.360" style="s2">now alexia practice obviously is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.600" end="00:44:35.220" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to argue that should</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.360" end="00:44:37.500" style="s2">merge in with the dialectic practice and</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.220" end="00:44:39.690" style="s2">then there&#39;s all the movement practices</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.500" end="00:44:43.440" style="s2">and there&#39;s other self examination</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.690" end="00:44:45.480" style="s2">property this ecology is right and both</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.440" end="00:44:46.950" style="s2">how it can be practiced individually and</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.480" end="00:44:48.690" style="s2">collectively and and we&#39;re all working</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.950" end="00:44:51.600" style="s2">on this right now together and I thank</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.690" end="00:44:53.100" style="s2">you all for that this this is that that</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.600" end="00:44:56.040" style="s2">dialogue in that connection that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.100" end="00:44:57.480" style="s2">beating heart of what I think the what I</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.040" end="00:44:59.600" style="s2">want I&#39;m trying to get at with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.480" end="00:45:03.330" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion that</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.600" end="00:45:05.670" style="s2">that&#39;s the long term sort of project</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.330" end="00:45:08.040" style="s2">immediately wanted speedy people real</p>

<p begin="00:52:05.599" end="00:52:09.650" style="s2">do with that that&#39;s what I was finding</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.980" end="00:52:11.839" style="s2">yeah if I could stand up in defense of</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.650" end="00:52:14.450" style="s2">type 1 and type 2 errors perhaps a</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.839" end="00:52:18.680" style="s2">moment I think maybe something that it</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.450" end="00:52:20.240" style="s2">does is it when we may be getting one of</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.680" end="00:52:22.400" style="s2">these terms incorrect is that it forces</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.240" end="00:52:24.980" style="s2">us to go into a searching mode where we</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.400" end="00:52:27.559" style="s2">we have like a minor aporia perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.980" end="00:52:31.460" style="s2">where we we have to make sense of this</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.559" end="00:52:34.160" style="s2">this dual sensing in this overlap or or</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.460" end="00:52:36.380" style="s2">disjunction and in that process we come</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.160" end="00:52:38.720" style="s2">to look for a deeper understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.380" end="00:52:40.549" style="s2">what the person is intending and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.720" end="00:52:45.170" style="s2">actually seems to be quite useful in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.549" end="00:52:48.950" style="s2">conversational space that&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.170" end="00:52:56.029" style="s2">Thank You Fred I&#39;m interested also</p>

<p begin="00:52:58.220" end="00:53:01.279" style="s2">tell you how I&#39;m wrestling with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.960" end="00:53:04.940" style="s2">problem that you&#39;re putting your finger</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.279" end="00:53:07.940" style="s2">off yeah I can I certainly see the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.940" end="00:53:10.400" style="s2">problem I you know I can just also you</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.940" end="00:53:13.069" style="s2">know especially as as this movement you</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.400" end="00:53:16.190" style="s2">know sort of grows and we try to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.069" end="00:53:20.869" style="s2">popularize these you know I can foresee</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.190" end="00:53:23.420" style="s2">sort of pushback by by by certain groups</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.869" end="00:53:25.789" style="s2">that you know about co-opting terms and</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.420" end="00:53:28.010" style="s2">so on and I and that that can cause</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.789" end="00:53:30.020" style="s2">dissonance I mean I out in my my</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.010" end="00:53:34.400" style="s2">preference and I think people in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.020" end="00:53:36.289" style="s2">form of different preferences is is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.400" end="00:53:40.970" style="s2">new word with a similar route like a</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.289" end="00:53:44.240" style="s2">religious example that keeps that keeps</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.970" end="00:53:46.789" style="s2">the connection in a very real way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.240" end="00:53:49.880" style="s2">very apparent but it&#39;s still very</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.789" end="00:53:52.640" style="s2">different so that&#39;s my preference</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.880" end="00:53:55.010" style="s2">personally but others may have may have</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.640" end="00:53:57.410" style="s2">may have different preferences no no I</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.010" end="00:54:00.500" style="s2">think that&#39;s good the problem I wrestled</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.410" end="00:54:03.020" style="s2">with that is the root words that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.500" end="00:54:04.880" style="s2">translate a soul you know they come you</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.020" end="00:54:07.880" style="s2">know you get it psyche and you get</p>

<p begin="00:54:16.069" end="00:54:23.510" style="s2">not but but I take your point really</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.279" end="00:54:30.410" style="s2">well that is the optimal strategy you</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.510" end="00:54:38.569" style="s2">could go back to the connection but then</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.410" end="00:54:43.369" style="s2">make it as a base of you thank you great</p>
