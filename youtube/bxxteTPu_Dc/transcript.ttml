<p begin="00:00:34.719" end="00:00:37.840" style="s2">in downtown portland this morning and</p>

<p begin="00:00:37.840" end="00:00:41.680" style="s2">my mask was predictably soaked with</p>

<p begin="00:00:49.120" end="00:00:52.399" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s an answer to an implied</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.920" end="00:00:54.559" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.399" end="00:00:56.879" style="s2">yes it is it is okay so we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.559" end="00:00:58.719" style="s2">start uh as has become our habit with a</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.879" end="00:01:01.359" style="s2">couple of questions from</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.719" end="00:01:03.359" style="s2">episode 32 that we didn&#39;t get to that i</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.359" end="00:01:07.040" style="s2">thought warranted us returning to</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.359" end="00:01:09.439" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll launch into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.040" end="00:01:10.400" style="s2">uh top questions from last hour the top</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.439" end="00:01:13.520" style="s2">questions in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.400" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">of monetary value one</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.520" end="00:01:17.280" style="s2">is there no merit to partially defunding</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.600" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">the police and reallocating those funds</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.280" end="00:01:20.320" style="s2">to other organizations that would handle</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:22.479" style="s2">some of the misplaced responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.320" end="00:01:26.400" style="s2">that police currently handle</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.479" end="00:01:28.799" style="s2">none let me explain no there&#39;s none</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.400" end="00:01:30.079" style="s2">um if this were an honest argument then</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.799" end="00:01:32.479" style="s2">the point is well but</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.079" end="00:01:34.479" style="s2">okay i mean go for it but i would like i</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.479" end="00:01:36.960" style="s2">think that this is asked as if</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.479" end="00:01:38.880" style="s2">you know what would the honest argument</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.960" end="00:01:40.720" style="s2">sound like and the honest argument does</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">have merit oh the honest argument has</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.720" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">merit and you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:45.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not like we haven&#39;t decried the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:48.159" style="s2">militarization of police</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.680" end="00:01:49.200" style="s2">and uh i know that for a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.159" end="00:01:52.000" style="s2">decades i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.200" end="00:01:52.560" style="s2">talking about the hazard of private</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.000" end="00:01:53.840" style="s2">prisons</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.560" end="00:01:56.079" style="s2">and the perverse incentive that it</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.840" end="00:01:57.680" style="s2">creates all these things but</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.079" end="00:01:59.280" style="s2">but specifically you know the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.680" end="00:02:01.439" style="s2">reallocation of funds</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:03.200" style="s2">for other organizations to do things</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.439" end="00:02:04.719" style="s2">that police have come to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.200" end="00:02:06.479" style="s2">right and i mean this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.719" end="00:02:09.360" style="s2">you&#39;ve talked about um before</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.479" end="00:02:11.120" style="s2">actually you know why why are police the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">first line of defense when people are</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.120" end="00:02:13.520" style="s2">having mental health crises on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:15.280" style="s2">streets</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.520" end="00:02:16.640" style="s2">right is that is that really the right</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.280" end="00:02:19.920" style="s2">job for police</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.640" end="00:02:23.280" style="s2">right so um so absolutely there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.920" end="00:02:25.360" style="s2">room to imagine reconfiguring</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.280" end="00:02:26.879" style="s2">how resources are spent and who would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.360" end="00:02:27.360" style="s2">the best people to deal with various</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.879" end="00:02:28.720" style="s2">jobs</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.360" end="00:02:30.400" style="s2">the problem is i don&#39;t want to help</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.720" end="00:02:32.560" style="s2">these people construct their mod</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.400" end="00:02:33.440" style="s2">this is a modern bailey and here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.560" end="00:02:35.360" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.440" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">there is no logical reason to connect</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.360" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">these two things</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:40.319" style="s2">okay there may be too much in police</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:42.000" style="s2">budgets</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.319" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if there is or there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.000" end="00:02:46.000" style="s2">i am certain that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:47.599" style="s2">it is not optimally allocated i do not</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.000" end="00:02:49.440" style="s2">know if anybody can spell out what the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.599" end="00:02:52.800" style="s2">optimal allocation would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.440" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2">however should there be more dedicated</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.800" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.200" end="00:02:56.879" style="s2">social programs that make the police</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:02:58.159" style="s2">less necessary of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.879" end="00:03:00.400" style="s2">should there be less in the police</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.159" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">budgets certainly following</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.400" end="00:03:07.200" style="s2">the rendering of police as unnecessary i</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:08.800" style="s2">look forward to seeing uh a reduction in</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.200" end="00:03:10.239" style="s2">police forces by virtue of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.800" end="00:03:12.800" style="s2">we&#39;re spending too much on them</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.239" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">but to link these two things as if</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.800" end="00:03:16.400" style="s2">taking the funds from the police</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.800" end="00:03:18.879" style="s2">is necessary in order to make those</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.400" end="00:03:20.879" style="s2">programs work is a garbage argument</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.879" end="00:03:22.319" style="s2">demonstrate that we&#39;re spending too much</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.879" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">demonstrate that we are spending it in</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.319" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">the wrong way</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:25.760" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a proper response</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.560" end="00:03:26.959" style="s2">demonstrate that there&#39;s a need for</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.760" end="00:03:29.440" style="s2">social programs</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.959" end="00:03:30.720" style="s2">then there&#39;s an obvious response but to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.440" end="00:03:33.760" style="s2">link these two things</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.720" end="00:03:37.200" style="s2">is the mott of amot and bailey and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.760" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">not interested in playing that game</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.200" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">good again question from last time with</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:43.440" style="s2">regard to the navy vet whom we spoke</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:45.599" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.440" end="00:03:47.599" style="s2">on either that one or the previous</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:48.959" style="s2">episode with regard to this guy having</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.599" end="00:03:49.440" style="s2">gone to the protests and having been</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.959" end="00:03:52.720" style="s2">beaten</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.440" end="00:03:54.080" style="s2">um on camera by uh homeland security</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.720" end="00:03:56.400" style="s2">officers</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.080" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">the person says so civil disobedience is</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.400" end="00:03:58.319" style="s2">not okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">sit-ins wouldn&#39;t have been very</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.319" end="00:04:03.040" style="s2">effective if activists listen to police</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:06.480" style="s2">and vacated lunch counters</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.040" end="00:04:09.040" style="s2">yep so civil disobedience is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.480" end="00:04:10.799" style="s2">okay and not okay right are you allowed</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.040" end="00:04:12.159" style="s2">to engage in civil disobedience</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.799" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">you know if you get a parking ticket and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.159" end="00:04:15.599" style="s2">you think it was illegitimate are you</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:18.079" style="s2">allowed to block a freeway</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.599" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">presumably not so the point is this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.079" end="00:04:22.240" style="s2">actually a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:23.680" style="s2">judgment a judgment call and um</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.240" end="00:04:25.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t actually know what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.680" end="00:04:27.919" style="s2">explanation is for that vet and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.520" end="00:04:30.080" style="s2">what he did and it&#39;s possible that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.919" end="00:04:31.120" style="s2">idea was to precipitate a reaction that</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:34.400" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.120" end="00:04:38.080" style="s2">uh telegenic um in which case</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.400" end="00:04:39.440" style="s2">um probably not legit uh on the other</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.080" end="00:04:40.880" style="s2">hand</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.440" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">there are certainly instances in which</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.880" end="00:04:44.160" style="s2">such a thing can be done for the right</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:45.040" style="s2">reason and maybe has to be done for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.160" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">right reason</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.040" end="00:04:48.160" style="s2">so it&#39;s a judgment call it is not</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">inherently okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.160" end="00:04:53.199" style="s2">that it is civil disobedience civil</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:55.120" style="s2">disobedience is a category that can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.199" end="00:04:58.400" style="s2">okay and can be necessary</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.120" end="00:05:00.639" style="s2">but in this case it looked like um</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.400" end="00:05:01.520" style="s2">it&#39;s feeding a false narrative which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.639" end="00:05:03.759" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.520" end="00:05:05.199" style="s2">the feds don&#39;t need to be here that they</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.759" end="00:05:08.240" style="s2">are engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.199" end="00:05:09.759" style="s2">a fascist crackdown because trump</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.240" end="00:05:12.080" style="s2">and you know that&#39;s sort of the extent</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.759" end="00:05:13.440" style="s2">of the argument and for people living in</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.080" end="00:05:16.720" style="s2">portland</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.440" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">facing uh the prospect of having</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.720" end="00:05:21.039" style="s2">police failing to enforce the laws that</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">keep us safe</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.039" end="00:05:26.880" style="s2">uh it&#39;s not so simple it just isn&#39;t yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2">and my history may fail me here but um</p>

<p begin="00:05:40.800" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">and so there was civil disobedience</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:48.000" style="s2">police but i do not believe and this is</p>

<p begin="00:05:51.759" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">con commitment move and if so it</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.280" end="00:05:57.680" style="s2">certainly wasn&#39;t a majority move</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:05:59.440" style="s2">uh to abolish all of the police so with</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.680" end="00:06:00.800" style="s2">the abolish the police move that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.440" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.800" end="00:06:04.639" style="s2">if you add that to civil disobedience</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.280" end="00:06:07.440" style="s2">you have now justified</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.960" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">had a right to eat at those lunch</p>

<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:16.399" style="s2">can you take this critter and make it</p>

<p begin="00:09:44.160" end="00:09:49.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a nightmare scenario so can we stop</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.040" end="00:09:51.680" style="s2">dreaming about this garbage and</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.120" end="00:09:53.120" style="s2">enjoy the fact that life is delightful</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.680" end="00:09:56.000" style="s2">and part of what makes it delightful is</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:56.000" style="s2">that it&#39;s not infinite</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.160" end="00:10:03.360" style="s2">good first question</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.440" end="00:10:05.040" style="s2">from last hour do the protests and riots</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.360" end="00:10:07.600" style="s2">have a stated end goal</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.040" end="00:10:09.200" style="s2">i guess it&#39;s just abolished the usa you</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.600" end="00:10:11.360" style="s2">say quote the police should enforce the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.200" end="00:10:13.040" style="s2">law and i agree but how exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.360" end="00:10:15.040" style="s2">what tactics would you use arrest</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:17.760" style="s2">everyone every night tear gas disperse</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.040" end="00:10:18.160" style="s2">money to go home it&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.760" end="00:10:19.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.160" end="00:10:21.200" style="s2">in fact it&#39;s one that i want to ask some</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.760" end="00:10:21.920" style="s2">of the people who are protesting i want</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.200" end="00:10:24.640" style="s2">to ask that</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.920" end="00:10:26.320" style="s2">uh to the people who are most most</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.640" end="00:10:30.959" style="s2">capable of answering it</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.320" end="00:10:34.240" style="s2">good um chaos but let&#39;s say this</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.959" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">the nature of a riot is that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.240" end="00:10:37.519" style="s2">failure of the ability to enforce the</p>

<p begin="00:10:41.200" end="00:10:46.320" style="s2">of the force being overwhelmed right</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.720" end="00:10:46.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing that creates looting</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.320" end="00:10:48.240" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.880" end="00:10:50.640" style="s2">you have a force built for normal</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.240" end="00:10:51.440" style="s2">circumstances when something abnormal of</p>

<p begin="00:10:53.600" end="00:10:57.760" style="s2">adequate to do it</p>

<p begin="00:12:04.480" end="00:12:08.160" style="s2">um but i will relay an anecdote that</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.160" end="00:12:11.600" style="s2">who lived here in portland for 15 years</p>

<p begin="00:12:13.120" end="00:12:16.880" style="s2">reporting for reason</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.639" end="00:12:17.760" style="s2">in one of her one of her missives that</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.880" end="00:12:20.079" style="s2">is now published</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.760" end="00:12:22.240" style="s2">at reason about what is going on here in</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.079" end="00:12:24.480" style="s2">the ground in portland she reports just</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.240" end="00:12:25.680" style="s2">the conversation with a young just a</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.480" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">slight</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.680" end="00:12:30.399" style="s2">girl really like a young woman uh who</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">probably weighs less than 100 pounds</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.399" end="00:12:34.079" style="s2">who&#39;s sort of on the front lines um at</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:36.160" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.079" end="00:12:37.760" style="s2">at the federal building as they as the</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.160" end="00:12:41.120" style="s2">protesters are trying to get in this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.760" end="00:12:44.079" style="s2">well after midnight and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.120" end="00:12:47.279" style="s2">nancy hears her ask somewhat plaintively</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.079" end="00:12:50.800" style="s2">what happens if we get in</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.279" end="00:12:51.360" style="s2">and and no one answers right and um this</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.800" end="00:12:54.399" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.360" end="00:12:55.040" style="s2">is is telling that um if there is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.399" end="00:12:57.600" style="s2">stated</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.040" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">end goal it&#39;s not shared by even all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.600" end="00:13:01.440" style="s2">people who are participating</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.120" end="00:13:02.240" style="s2">um and by which i don&#39;t mean they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.440" end="00:13:05.680" style="s2">all agree but</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.240" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">most of them don&#39;t even know it so uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.680" end="00:13:10.639" style="s2">i would say the movement has an end goal</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">and it is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:14.240" style="s2">capture and wielding of power over</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:16.639" style="s2">resources</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.240" end="00:13:17.279" style="s2">that is where it will cash out for sure</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.639" end="00:13:20.480" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.279" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">the local phenomenon does not</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.480" end="00:13:24.880" style="s2">the goal is happening the goal is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:27.120" style="s2">ability to portray what is taking place</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.880" end="00:13:28.399" style="s2">as a fascist incursion into portland</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.120" end="00:13:30.399" style="s2">um that the new york times will</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.399" end="00:13:32.320" style="s2">dutifully report as such</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.399" end="00:13:35.120" style="s2">and this is that state we&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.320" end="00:13:38.560" style="s2">there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.120" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">next question if it is permissible to</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.560" end="00:13:42.880" style="s2">litigate past crimes and extract repair</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.720" end="00:13:44.800" style="s2">from other groups descendants</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.880" end="00:13:46.240" style="s2">might the fact that europeans genome is</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.800" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">two percent neanderthal</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.240" end="00:13:49.760" style="s2">given a reparations claim against</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:50.959" style="s2">african homo sapiens and their</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.760" end="00:13:54.240" style="s2">neanderthal</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.959" end="00:13:56.720" style="s2">hominid aside yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.240" end="00:13:58.240" style="s2">well i mean this is obviously somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.720" end="00:14:01.760" style="s2">tongue-in-cheek i hope</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.240" end="00:14:05.519" style="s2">i assume uh but it does it it does</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.760" end="00:14:06.480" style="s2">point to one of the deep and abiding</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.519" end="00:14:08.880" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.480" end="00:14:10.959" style="s2">with asking for a correction of</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.880" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">historical wrongs which is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.959" end="00:14:16.399" style="s2">uh every single population on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:18.560" style="s2">has done wrong and been wronged</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.399" end="00:14:19.519" style="s2">that&#39;s just that&#39;s just part of part of</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.560" end="00:14:22.079" style="s2">what is true you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.519" end="00:14:24.000" style="s2">i had a friend in olympia you know very</p>

<p begin="00:14:31.279" end="00:14:34.320" style="s2">replaced earlier peoples who probably</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.040" end="00:14:37.040" style="s2">also weren&#39;t the first</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.320" end="00:14:37.360" style="s2">they are of the lineage that was first</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.040" end="00:14:39.519" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.360" end="00:14:41.040" style="s2">pretending that they were again noble</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:42.959" style="s2">savages</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.040" end="00:14:44.480" style="s2">who you know just lived on the land in</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.959" end="00:14:47.600" style="s2">this blissful utopia</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.480" end="00:14:50.240" style="s2">no that&#39;s that&#39;s not what happened so um</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.600" end="00:14:51.839" style="s2">yeah there was there there have been</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.240" end="00:14:53.920" style="s2">hominid against hominid</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.839" end="00:14:55.600" style="s2">uh interactions since they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.920" end="00:14:57.680" style="s2">hominids of course there have</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:14:59.040" style="s2">yeah now i must say this this feels</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.680" end="00:15:00.639" style="s2">personal to me because i strongly</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.040" end="00:15:00.959" style="s2">suspect that i have more neanderthal</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.639" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.959" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">average um but uh yeah but because of</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.480" end="00:15:08.160" style="s2">the brow ridge is that right</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:09.680" style="s2">you know it is what it is but um i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.160" end="00:15:10.800" style="s2">just wondering why i&#39;ve never heard this</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.680" end="00:15:14.880" style="s2">before i don&#39;t know i just</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.800" end="00:15:17.600" style="s2">it resonates for me um so</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.880" end="00:15:18.959" style="s2">in any case yeah um no obviously i mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:21.360" style="s2">your point is well made using the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.959" end="00:15:22.800" style="s2">neanderthals and the fact is look</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:25.040" style="s2">let&#39;s just do this the right way you</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.800" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">know um the arc of the moral universe is</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.040" end="00:15:28.079" style="s2">long and it bends towards justice that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:29.920" style="s2">obviously the right goal</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.079" end="00:15:31.839" style="s2">it remains the right goal we&#39;ve named it</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.920" end="00:15:33.600" style="s2">we have not gotten all the way</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.839" end="00:15:35.759" style="s2">to the arc of the end of the arc of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.600" end="00:15:36.240" style="s2">moral universe but the idea that we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.759" end="00:15:39.040" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.240" end="00:15:40.240" style="s2">losing the plot of that and going into a</p>

<p begin="00:18:42.640" end="00:18:47.120" style="s2">really a shame publishing</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:49.840" style="s2">has been captured books uh get cancelled</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.120" end="00:18:53.120" style="s2">by their publishers before they even</p>

<p begin="00:19:04.320" end="00:19:07.919" style="s2">is that it&#39;s possible to self-publish</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.120" end="00:19:10.880" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.919" end="00:19:11.600" style="s2">uh i i do think just like you know it</p>

<p begin="00:19:11.600" end="00:19:15.679" style="s2">ages ago but three years ago we were</p>

<p begin="00:19:35.440" end="00:19:38.080" style="s2">seems to be falling into line along with</p>

<p begin="00:19:38.080" end="00:19:42.880" style="s2">which i can&#39;t quite fully uh understand</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.039" end="00:19:44.000" style="s2">i would say that there are certainly</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.880" end="00:19:46.559" style="s2">many many people</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.000" end="00:19:49.200" style="s2">out here who are looking for good</p>

<p begin="00:19:49.200" end="00:19:52.480" style="s2">so there has to be an audience figuring</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.520" end="00:19:54.799" style="s2">out how to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.480" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">uh the books that are excellent and not</p>

<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:20:00.000" style="s2">looking for such books</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.360" end="00:20:00.000" style="s2">is trickier</p>

<p begin="00:20:17.679" end="00:20:21.039" style="s2">as a web dev and college student with</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.520" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">zero biology background</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.039" end="00:20:23.919" style="s2">where should i go to get an introduction</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:25.600" style="s2">to evolutionary biology which book</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.919" end="00:20:26.960" style="s2">should i read first or podcast or else</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.600" end="00:20:28.159" style="s2">wish you both the best keep up the great</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.960" end="00:20:31.520" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.159" end="00:20:35.280" style="s2">um so what i would say is</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.520" end="00:20:38.880" style="s2">for years we have recommended dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.280" end="00:20:40.320" style="s2">selfish gene as the starting point</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.880" end="00:20:41.760" style="s2">it&#39;s what we often started with in our</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.320" end="00:20:42.559" style="s2">own programs yeah it was the first book</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.760" end="00:20:43.760" style="s2">we assigned</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.559" end="00:20:45.360" style="s2">had them had them read it before they</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.760" end="00:20:46.159" style="s2">showed up for the first day class and if</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.360" end="00:20:48.799" style="s2">you get a</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.159" end="00:20:49.919" style="s2">the most recent edition it comes with</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.799" end="00:20:52.240" style="s2">extensive</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.919" end="00:20:54.720" style="s2">endnotes where dawkins himself has</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.240" end="00:20:56.799" style="s2">tracked so the book was written in 76 or</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.720" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">it was published in 76</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.799" end="00:20:59.840" style="s2">and he tracks where he was right where</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:01.600" style="s2">he was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.840" end="00:21:02.960" style="s2">what we now know that kind of thing so</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.600" end="00:21:05.200" style="s2">it&#39;s very well done</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.960" end="00:21:06.720" style="s2">i will say there is a missing there are</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.200" end="00:21:10.080" style="s2">a couple of missing elements</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.720" end="00:21:14.320" style="s2">and maybe most important is</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.080" end="00:21:15.919" style="s2">the fact that in 76 there was almost</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.320" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">nothing to say about molecular</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.919" end="00:21:20.799" style="s2">epigenetics and it is playing such an</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.000" end="00:21:23.200" style="s2">important role in our understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.799" end="00:21:24.640" style="s2">of mechanistic biology that its absence</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.200" end="00:21:27.919" style="s2">from the book does</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.640" end="00:21:28.880" style="s2">result in it being dated but in any case</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.919" end="00:21:30.559" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.880" end="00:21:31.760" style="s2">an excellent starting place that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.559" end="00:21:33.039" style="s2">you&#39;ve asked for it&#39;s an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.760" end="00:21:34.960" style="s2">starting place it deals with</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.039" end="00:21:36.400" style="s2">the introductory game theory it deals</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.960" end="00:21:39.840" style="s2">with the introductory</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.400" end="00:21:41.520" style="s2">genetics it deals with um all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.840" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.520" end="00:21:45.760" style="s2">that are well worth understanding so i</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:46.960" style="s2">would say start there yeah uh i guess</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.760" end="00:21:48.480" style="s2">on sort of the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.960" end="00:21:49.919" style="s2">evolutionary biology probably that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.480" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">exactly what you&#39;re looking for and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.919" end="00:21:53.360" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly where we started but if</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:56.080" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for the</p>

<p begin="00:23:28.640" end="00:23:31.919" style="s2">which is that basically we got it all</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.320" end="00:23:33.760" style="s2">right which can&#39;t possibly be true given</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.919" end="00:23:35.600" style="s2">what we still don&#39;t understand</p>

<p begin="00:27:37.440" end="00:27:43.760" style="s2">there is an uh an</p>

<p begin="00:27:55.760" end="00:27:58.960" style="s2">you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.559" end="00:28:00.320" style="s2">these two things you have to develop the</p>

<p begin="00:28:00.960" end="00:28:06.320" style="s2">without creating the loophole for people</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:06.320" style="s2">who would exploit it that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:10.000" style="s2">oh thank you bretton heather you all</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.159" end="00:28:13.360" style="s2">stay safe we will</p>

<p begin="00:28:28.640" end="00:28:34.080" style="s2">it&#39;s troubling but i mean we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.279" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">exactly this phenomenon without quite so</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.080" end="00:28:36.640" style="s2">many parameters</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.200" end="00:28:38.240" style="s2">right we there you know there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">evidence that this is not simply some</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.200" end="00:28:54.000" style="s2">conclusion that we&#39;ve all arrived at</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:56.399" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.000" end="00:28:58.080" style="s2">um because it&#39;s clear basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.399" end="00:28:59.200" style="s2">everybody who&#39;s thinking carefully knows</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.080" end="00:29:02.320" style="s2">that it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.200" end="00:29:05.039" style="s2">what&#39;s being portrayed so yeah anyway</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.320" end="00:29:06.480" style="s2">well stated been watching these for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.039" end="00:29:08.480" style="s2">past few weeks and i&#39;ve never been so</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.480" end="00:29:10.080" style="s2">delightfully terrified</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.480" end="00:29:12.159" style="s2">thank you for doing these yes we aim to</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.080" end="00:29:15.600" style="s2">delightfully terrify</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.159" end="00:29:17.279" style="s2">yeah what probability would you assign</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.600" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">the hypothesis that the woke movement</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.279" end="00:29:20.159" style="s2">slash ponzi scheme</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:22.240" style="s2">is in part the result of another country</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.159" end="00:29:23.679" style="s2">conducting social media inception</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.240" end="00:29:26.880" style="s2">on america&#39;s young progressive</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.679" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">population well there&#39;s a question about</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.880" end="00:29:30.559" style="s2">cause and amplification i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.600" end="00:29:33.960" style="s2">what i would say</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.559" end="00:29:36.880" style="s2">about the chances that it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.960" end="00:29:37.600" style="s2">fundamentally initiated as an experiment</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.880" end="00:29:40.240" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.600" end="00:29:42.320" style="s2">outside the country but i would say the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.240" end="00:29:45.039" style="s2">chances that none of our enemies</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.320" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">are amplifying this online is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.039" end="00:29:49.200" style="s2">small</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:49.760" style="s2">because obviously the hazard that it</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.200" end="00:29:52.559" style="s2">poses</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.760" end="00:29:53.279" style="s2">to the through the mighty u.s is so</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.559" end="00:29:55.120" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.279" end="00:29:56.960" style="s2">that if we can get us to self-sabota if</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.120" end="00:29:58.399" style="s2">some they can get us to self-sabotage</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.960" end="00:30:01.440" style="s2">they will do it</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.399" end="00:30:04.080" style="s2">um so yes but you know is it enough to</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.440" end="00:30:06.000" style="s2">have altered things substantially</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.080" end="00:30:08.480" style="s2">who knows it&#39;s a question that should be</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.000" end="00:30:10.080" style="s2">studied using something like logic and</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.480" end="00:30:12.640" style="s2">science were it not for the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:14.240" style="s2">those are apparently white supremacists</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.640" end="00:30:16.000" style="s2">and tools of the patriarchy and tools of</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.240" end="00:30:17.390" style="s2">the patriots yes well said</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.000" end="00:30:20.419" style="s2">and cis people</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.390" end="00:30:20.419" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.720" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">this i&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s apropos i</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.480" end="00:30:24.480" style="s2">don&#39;t remember if one of us said</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:26.799" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.480" end="00:30:28.559" style="s2">uh to this effect there are no</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.799" end="00:30:30.159" style="s2">accidental discharges there were only</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.559" end="00:30:32.159" style="s2">negligent discharges</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.159" end="00:30:33.279" style="s2">full stop yeah now that must be</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.159" end="00:30:36.240" style="s2">referring to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.279" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">rally in louisville and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.240" end="00:30:43.279" style="s2">somebody apparently discharged a weapon</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.000" end="00:30:43.279" style="s2">so anyway i think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.919" end="00:30:53.520" style="s2">a a literally false metaphorically true</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.440" end="00:30:55.120" style="s2">extension of all firearms are loaded</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.520" end="00:30:57.039" style="s2">you know there are no accidental</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.120" end="00:30:59.360" style="s2">discharges</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.039" end="00:31:01.519" style="s2">because you loaded the weapon something</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.360" end="00:31:02.559" style="s2">like that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.519" end="00:31:04.640" style="s2">and now for something completely</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.559" end="00:31:06.399" style="s2">different you spoke of how dreams could</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.640" end="00:31:07.440" style="s2">be a way of your subconscious offering</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.399" end="00:31:08.480" style="s2">you insights</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.440" end="00:31:10.240" style="s2">can you speak further of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.480" end="00:31:11.600" style="s2">evolutionary reasons for dreams and do</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.240" end="00:31:13.519" style="s2">you suppose lucid dreaming could be a</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.600" end="00:31:17.440" style="s2">further enhancement of this process</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.519" end="00:31:21.120" style="s2">sweet question yeah all right</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.440" end="00:31:23.120" style="s2">i will say the primary</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.120" end="00:31:24.559" style="s2">value of dreams so first of all i should</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.120" end="00:31:25.600" style="s2">say the more you dig into this the more</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.559" end="00:31:26.960" style="s2">you discover that there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.600" end="00:31:28.399" style="s2">different kinds of dreams and that one</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.960" end="00:31:30.240" style="s2">person&#39;s dreams don&#39;t look like another</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.399" end="00:31:31.360" style="s2">and so there is a huge landscape to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.240" end="00:31:33.360" style="s2">explored here</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.360" end="00:31:34.320" style="s2">and one thing i have been saying forever</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.360" end="00:31:35.760" style="s2">is that we should figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.320" end="00:31:37.840" style="s2">hunter-gatherers</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.760" end="00:31:39.279" style="s2">uh dream about before there are no more</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.840" end="00:31:40.880" style="s2">hunter-gatherers because it would be</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.279" end="00:31:41.360" style="s2">wonderful to know what the base state</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.880" end="00:31:44.880" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.360" end="00:31:47.440" style="s2">but what we can say is that an</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.880" end="00:31:48.240" style="s2">awful large percentage of dreams appear</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.440" end="00:31:50.720" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.240" end="00:31:52.720" style="s2">scenario building that is to say while</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.720" end="00:31:55.519" style="s2">your brain is not occupied</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.720" end="00:31:56.320" style="s2">by processing active incoming data it</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.519" end="00:31:59.200" style="s2">takes</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.320" end="00:32:01.760" style="s2">probabilistic uh it takes a</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.200" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">probabilistic look at things that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.760" end="00:32:05.919" style="s2">fear things opportunities you might uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:07.679" style="s2">avail yourself of</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.919" end="00:32:09.200" style="s2">and it runs you through scenarios so</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.679" end="00:32:10.799" style="s2">that when you get to these things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.200" end="00:32:12.320" style="s2">not your first time through</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.799" end="00:32:14.159" style="s2">right it doesn&#39;t have to be fully</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.320" end="00:32:16.000" style="s2">rendered it just has to be good enough</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.159" end="00:32:16.559" style="s2">and you have to suspend your disbelief</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.000" end="00:32:18.799" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.559" end="00:32:20.399" style="s2">that when the scenario hits you can sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.799" end="00:32:21.760" style="s2">of try it out</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.399" end="00:32:24.000" style="s2">and i will say i&#39;ve learned one thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.760" end="00:32:25.120" style="s2">about scenarios from my own experiments</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.000" end="00:32:27.279" style="s2">with lucid dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.120" end="00:32:29.039" style="s2">which is if i&#39;m lucid dreaming it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.279" end="00:32:30.080" style="s2">difficult state to get to but if i can</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.039" end="00:32:33.039" style="s2">get there</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.080" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">and then i say well this is my brain</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.039" end="00:32:36.559" style="s2">writing this story i should be able to</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.880" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">predict what&#39;s going to happen next</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.559" end="00:32:41.600" style="s2">it never works it literally has never</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:43.440" style="s2">once worked right that tells you</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.600" end="00:32:44.720" style="s2">something it tells you you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.440" end="00:32:47.600" style="s2">that the prediction has been wrong</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.720" end="00:32:49.760" style="s2">every time every single time as if to</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.600" end="00:32:50.960" style="s2">have predicted it is to invalidate that</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.760" end="00:32:53.679" style="s2">storyline like</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.960" end="00:32:54.320" style="s2">the whole point of scenario building</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.679" end="00:32:55.840" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.320" end="00:32:58.000" style="s2">to run you through things that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.840" end="00:33:00.320" style="s2">see coming so right</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.000" end="00:33:02.080" style="s2">and so my point would be whatever part</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.320" end="00:33:04.080" style="s2">of your brain makes the movies</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.080" end="00:33:05.360" style="s2">the conscious part of your brain is not</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.080" end="00:33:06.799" style="s2">allowed in because the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.360" end="00:33:08.559" style="s2">thing wouldn&#39;t work it wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.799" end="00:33:12.720" style="s2">valuable to you if it was so</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.559" end="00:33:15.600" style="s2">yeah um your dreams are not a safe space</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.720" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">my dreams are very dangerous i have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.600" end="00:33:17.440" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.159" end="00:33:19.039" style="s2">i&#39;m not talking about your dunes in</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.440" end="00:33:21.120" style="s2">particular but i mean i think that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.039" end="00:33:23.039" style="s2">the hypothesis here is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.120" end="00:33:24.480" style="s2">dreams are explicitly not a safe space</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.039" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">they are where your consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.480" end="00:33:29.440" style="s2">goes to actually make you safer in your</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:31.360" style="s2">waking life but that means that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.440" end="00:33:32.880" style="s2">going to put you in in apparent danger</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.360" end="00:33:34.480" style="s2">in your sleep space yeah there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.880" end="00:33:35.600" style="s2">point in running you through scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.480" end="00:33:37.039" style="s2">in which</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.600" end="00:33:39.120" style="s2">things are all cool and nothing&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.039" end="00:33:42.080" style="s2">to go wrong so my dreams are really</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.120" end="00:33:43.679" style="s2">about stuff going wrong all the time</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.080" end="00:33:45.360" style="s2">but that explains why you sleep the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.679" end="00:33:48.559" style="s2">you do i guess it does it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.360" end="00:33:50.399" style="s2">a little bit chaotic but um okay as to</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.559" end="00:33:53.519" style="s2">your final question about</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.399" end="00:33:56.399" style="s2">lucid dreams lucid dreams i believe</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.519" end="00:33:57.039" style="s2">are an occasional phenomenon which may</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.399" end="00:33:59.039" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.039" end="00:34:00.559" style="s2">adaptive that is to say the discovery</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.039" end="00:34:01.360" style="s2">that you are in a dream which usually</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.559" end="00:34:04.399" style="s2">wakes you up</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:06.720" style="s2">so learning to stay asleep through that</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:08.960" style="s2">is um not easy but nonetheless it</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.720" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">happens at some low rate</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.960" end="00:34:12.079" style="s2">under normal circumstances for people</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:15.359" style="s2">who have not trained themselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.079" end="00:34:17.599" style="s2">but training yourself to stay asleep</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.359" end="00:34:19.520" style="s2">even when you become lucid which</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.599" end="00:34:21.280" style="s2">it&#39;s exhausting but it&#39;s fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.520" end="00:34:22.639" style="s2">what you will discover you do and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.280" end="00:34:25.440" style="s2">have control over</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.639" end="00:34:27.200" style="s2">that is a hack right you&#39;re not supposed</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.440" end="00:34:28.879" style="s2">to have conscious access to your dreams</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.200" end="00:34:30.639" style="s2">you can gain it you will lose stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.879" end="00:34:33.760" style="s2">will gain stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.639" end="00:34:35.919" style="s2">so i would say to the extent that humans</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.760" end="00:34:37.919" style="s2">hack their own cognition this is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.919" end="00:34:40.960" style="s2">totally valid hack and i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.919" end="00:34:44.320" style="s2">that it has important uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.960" end="00:34:48.320" style="s2">positive evolutionary outgrowths</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.320" end="00:34:50.079" style="s2">but probably mostly it is not um</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.320" end="00:34:52.240" style="s2">the reason that we don&#39;t have lucid</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.079" end="00:34:54.639" style="s2">dreams is that in general that does not</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.240" end="00:34:55.839" style="s2">bring you the highest value</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.639" end="00:34:58.560" style="s2">let&#39;s just do a couple more here and</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.839" end="00:35:01.440" style="s2">then we&#39;ll switch to the next</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.560" end="00:35:02.880" style="s2">live stream questions interested to know</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.440" end="00:35:05.040" style="s2">if the two of you have an opinion on</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.880" end="00:35:06.480" style="s2">submitting data to 23andme</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.040" end="00:35:08.240" style="s2">with an adopted father and maternal</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.480" end="00:35:09.920" style="s2">grandmother it&#39;s very tempting</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.240" end="00:35:11.440" style="s2">i&#39;m not into conspiracy theories but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.920" end="00:35:13.839" style="s2">also aware that they&#39;d have my dna</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.440" end="00:35:16.720" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.839" end="00:35:17.599" style="s2">yeah we haven&#39;t done it for exactly this</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.720" end="00:35:20.960" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.599" end="00:35:23.040" style="s2">concerns about privacy and uh it</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.960" end="00:35:24.880" style="s2">it looks like you have to sign away your</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.040" end="00:35:28.000" style="s2">rights to your own dna</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.880" end="00:35:29.680" style="s2">in order to to get results now you could</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.000" end="00:35:32.800" style="s2">do it anonymously</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.680" end="00:35:34.400" style="s2">which means that your data won&#39;t plug in</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.800" end="00:35:36.480" style="s2">and be able to help other people</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.400" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">understand their own</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.480" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">genealogies if you slot into a</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.079" end="00:35:42.480" style="s2">particular place etc</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:43.040" style="s2">but it would protect you in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.480" end="00:35:44.800" style="s2">linking</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.040" end="00:35:47.520" style="s2">anything that is learned um to your</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.800" end="00:35:50.000" style="s2">personal identity um that seems like</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.520" end="00:35:50.960" style="s2">the only way that i know we haven&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.000" end="00:35:53.119" style="s2">done that</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.960" end="00:35:55.280" style="s2">it might protect you yeah exactly it</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.119" end="00:35:57.520" style="s2">might protect you if somebody was</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.280" end="00:35:58.560" style="s2">really interested they could figure out</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.520" end="00:36:01.599" style="s2">who you were</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.560" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">using a composite of who you&#39;re related</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.599" end="00:36:04.320" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.000" end="00:36:06.240" style="s2">and other available information right so</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.320" end="00:36:08.320" style="s2">i would say none of this is safe</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.240" end="00:36:09.280" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s one way in which</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.320" end="00:36:11.599" style="s2">you know a large</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.280" end="00:36:12.400" style="s2">part of 23andme may in fact be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.599" end="00:36:15.119" style="s2">like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.400" end="00:36:15.760" style="s2">facebook gamble where yeah the point is</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.119" end="00:36:17.680" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.760" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">you&#39;re the product your information is</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.680" end="00:36:20.880" style="s2">the valuable commodity</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:22.320" style="s2">and that you get a free service for it</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.880" end="00:36:25.520" style="s2">so this would be a nominal</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.320" end="00:36:26.640" style="s2">charge to collect your dna and i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.520" end="00:36:28.160" style="s2">your concerns are</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.640" end="00:36:30.160" style="s2">are warranted they&#39;re they&#39;re warranted</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.160" end="00:36:31.520" style="s2">and yet um</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.160" end="00:36:33.200" style="s2">you know having an adopted father a</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.520" end="00:36:34.160" style="s2">maternal grandmother of course you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.200" end="00:36:36.800" style="s2">curious</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.160" end="00:36:37.599" style="s2">my brother&#39;s adopted i think that um i</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.800" end="00:36:41.200" style="s2">think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.599" end="00:36:43.119" style="s2">even more intriguing if you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.200" end="00:36:44.880" style="s2">if it&#39;s not just i wonder if the family</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.119" end="00:36:48.400" style="s2">stories are true or</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.880" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">can i add more detail uh to the family</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.400" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">stories but i actually don&#39;t have family</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.920" end="00:36:53.440" style="s2">stories and i&#39;d really like some i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:56.560" style="s2">really like to have some sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.440" end="00:36:59.760" style="s2">um and of course it can also aid in um</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.560" end="00:37:02.480" style="s2">in disease prediction yep</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.760" end="00:37:03.599" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s tricky and i think we just</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.480" end="00:37:05.040" style="s2">we need</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.599" end="00:37:06.960" style="s2">we need better regulation of this</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.040" end="00:37:08.160" style="s2">particular industry before you or i are</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.960" end="00:37:11.680" style="s2">gonna feel safe doing it</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.160" end="00:37:15.359" style="s2">yeah i agree yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.680" end="00:37:17.119" style="s2">um i want the freedom to fight against</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.359" end="00:37:18.480" style="s2">brett&#39;s ideas in an honest forum</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.119" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">thank you both for your dedication to</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:21.599" style="s2">the republic and next question same</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.800" end="00:37:23.200" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.599" end="00:37:24.800" style="s2">also thank you for bringing the concept</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.200" end="00:37:27.280" style="s2">of game theory and tragedy of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.800" end="00:37:30.000" style="s2">comments into common conversation</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.280" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">so does this person find my stuff</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.000" end="00:37:35.200" style="s2">particularly objectionable is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:36.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t know this is someone who&#39;s asked</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.200" end="00:37:39.839" style="s2">questions before</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.400" end="00:37:41.920" style="s2">um uh i think you know the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.839" end="00:37:43.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t think particularly my guess is</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.920" end="00:37:45.440" style="s2">but um it&#39;s hard to imagine that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.760" end="00:37:47.599" style="s2">here asking</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.440" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">questions in the super chat if they find</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.599" end="00:37:52.240" style="s2">me particularly terrible but</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:53.839" style="s2">honest forum honest form all right well</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.240" end="00:37:57.560" style="s2">i&#39;m all for honest forums</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.839" end="00:37:58.720" style="s2">yeah for uh i think for uh yeah not</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.560" end="00:38:00.720" style="s2">foreign</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.720" end="00:38:01.839" style="s2">yeah uh last question here and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.720" end="00:38:04.480" style="s2">we&#39;ll switch to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.839" end="00:38:05.760" style="s2">next um this one is a two-part totally</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.480" end="00:38:07.920" style="s2">different questions would you consider</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">having youtube lectures on game theory</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.920" end="00:38:11.599" style="s2">and do you have any thoughts on the eu</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:13.280" style="s2">as a european myself i&#39;m worried that</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.599" end="00:38:16.079" style="s2">this project is fundamentally flawed and</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.280" end="00:38:16.079" style="s2">undemocratic</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.839" end="00:38:21.760" style="s2">um yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.280" end="00:38:22.320" style="s2">the first question what i&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.760" end="00:38:24.880" style="s2">forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.320" end="00:38:27.200" style="s2">uh youtube lectures on game theory well</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.880" end="00:38:29.920" style="s2">there definitely is a need for</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.200" end="00:38:30.640" style="s2">some sort of lectures on game theory um</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.920" end="00:38:33.520" style="s2">i do think</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.640" end="00:38:35.119" style="s2">you can be you can teach yourself game</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.520" end="00:38:36.800" style="s2">theory well but i mean we we get this</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.119" end="00:38:37.440" style="s2">question a lot and the fact is there</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.800" end="00:38:39.680" style="s2">aren&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.440" end="00:38:41.200" style="s2">there there is no good text to point</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.680" end="00:38:42.079" style="s2">people to there are a couple of papers</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.200" end="00:38:45.680" style="s2">here and there</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.079" end="00:38:46.000" style="s2">um and it is far easier to do it in real</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.680" end="00:38:47.359" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.000" end="00:38:49.359" style="s2">with people who already have facility</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.359" end="00:38:50.800" style="s2">with the tools and can who can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.359" end="00:38:52.079" style="s2">show you when you&#39;ve when you&#39;ve made an</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.800" end="00:38:55.760" style="s2">error in your thinking yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.079" end="00:38:57.359" style="s2">um i feel like i&#39;m surprised if there is</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.760" end="00:38:57.680" style="s2">not and therefore i wonder if there in</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.359" end="00:39:00.640" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.680" end="00:39:01.040" style="s2">is not a good youtube series on game</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.640" end="00:39:03.040" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.040" end="00:39:04.160" style="s2">already i don&#39;t know of one i&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.040" end="00:39:06.160" style="s2">curious um</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.160" end="00:39:07.920" style="s2">to hear about it if if people think that</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.160" end="00:39:11.599" style="s2">there are david</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.920" end="00:39:14.400" style="s2">sirock oh yeah was working on one</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.599" end="00:39:15.680" style="s2">and i saw very good stuff from him</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.400" end="00:39:17.040" style="s2">initially so i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.680" end="00:39:18.560" style="s2">i should check in on that project and</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.040" end="00:39:19.440" style="s2">see but you know you kind of need</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.560" end="00:39:21.440" style="s2">animations</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.440" end="00:39:23.119" style="s2">yeah um to make these things clear and</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.440" end="00:39:24.400" style="s2">so anyway i&#39;m very hopeful that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.119" end="00:39:25.440" style="s2">produced exactly the thing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.400" end="00:39:28.800" style="s2">looking for</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.440" end="00:39:31.920" style="s2">okay let&#39;s rock s-a-r-a-c yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:34.079" style="s2">uh and then the eu oh the eu right</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.920" end="00:39:37.280" style="s2">well i&#39;m in favor of the eu but i&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.079" end="00:39:37.280" style="s2">to see it move offshore</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:44.160" style="s2">no um</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.200" end="00:39:45.760" style="s2">well it all depends on the structure you</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.160" end="00:39:46.320" style="s2">put water in my water i did put water in</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.760" end="00:39:48.560" style="s2">your water</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.320" end="00:39:49.760" style="s2">um it&#39;s a little practical joke i was</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.560" end="00:39:52.800" style="s2">playing on you</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.760" end="00:39:54.320" style="s2">um yeah let&#39;s put it this way i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.800" end="00:39:56.400" style="s2">i&#39;m not an expert on the structure</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.320" end="00:39:58.400" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously an advantage</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.400" end="00:40:00.640" style="s2">to federation there&#39;s a hazard to</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.400" end="00:40:02.960" style="s2">federation the brits are now</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.640" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">involved in both the hazard of</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.960" end="00:40:05.760" style="s2">federation and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:07.359" style="s2">hazard of trying to extract themselves</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.760" end="00:40:10.640" style="s2">from it um</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.359" end="00:40:12.079" style="s2">so uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.640" end="00:40:14.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t know enough about it to say but</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.079" end="00:40:16.160" style="s2">i would say uh my guess is</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.720" end="00:40:18.240" style="s2">was not done very well because it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.160" end="00:40:21.359" style="s2">naive about things like um</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.240" end="00:40:24.160" style="s2">game theory but um</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.359" end="00:40:24.800" style="s2">was some sort of federation necessary is</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.160" end="00:40:27.280" style="s2">it a</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.800" end="00:40:29.280" style="s2">proper hedge against another world war</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.280" end="00:40:34.319" style="s2">started in europe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.280" end="00:40:34.319" style="s2">so anyway mixed bag would be the answer</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.400" end="00:40:38.880" style="s2">okay questions from this live stream</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.599" end="00:40:40.800" style="s2">the latest glenn show with john</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.880" end="00:40:42.480" style="s2">mcwhorter was stellar john mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.800" end="00:40:43.280" style="s2">that we need a word for the identitarian</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.480" end="00:40:46.480" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.280" end="00:40:48.319" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen and like thinkquisitors other</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.480" end="00:40:51.599" style="s2">ideas</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.319" end="00:40:53.280" style="s2">um yeah we&#39;ve called it the works golds</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.599" end="00:40:57.119" style="s2">the woke army</p>

<p begin="00:40:59.440" end="00:41:07.359" style="s2">um oh uh how about this one</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.720" end="00:41:10.079" style="s2">um the civil wrongs movement</p>

<p begin="00:41:10.079" end="00:41:13.599" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.480" end="00:41:17.280" style="s2">movement level name rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.599" end="00:41:19.920" style="s2">you know the civil wrongs activists yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.280" end="00:41:21.280" style="s2">i have a feeling they won&#39;t like it well</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.920" end="00:41:23.359" style="s2">they&#39;re not like the inquisitors</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.280" end="00:41:25.040" style="s2">or plague of locusts or wokes golds</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.359" end="00:41:27.440" style="s2">either there&#39;s a lot to work with</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:28.880" style="s2">there i mean they just did you know they</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.440" end="00:41:30.319" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.880" end="00:41:32.079" style="s2">i was going to mock them a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.319" end="00:41:33.680" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s not not</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.079" end="00:41:35.599" style="s2">nice and maybe not accurate you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.680" end="00:41:39.040" style="s2">they don&#39;t like social justice warriors</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.599" end="00:41:41.040" style="s2">because it&#39;s been used as a as a epithet</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.040" end="00:41:42.560" style="s2">um but it seems to me that that is what</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.040" end="00:41:43.200" style="s2">they are trying to do that that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.560" end="00:41:46.240" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.200" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">an an honest and just just thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.240" end="00:41:50.960" style="s2">the words</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:51.839" style="s2">um a description of what they claim to</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.960" end="00:41:54.079" style="s2">be doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.839" end="00:41:55.040" style="s2">now those of us who are speaking against</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.079" end="00:41:57.119" style="s2">it say ah</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.040" end="00:41:59.040" style="s2">that&#39;s not justice guys um you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.119" end="00:42:01.760" style="s2">that&#39;s civil wrongs not civil rights</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.040" end="00:42:02.319" style="s2">uh but that does actually seem to</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.760" end="00:42:04.160" style="s2">describe</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.319" end="00:42:06.079" style="s2">what they are but that&#39;s now seen as an</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.160" end="00:42:09.359" style="s2">epithet and so calling them that</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.079" end="00:42:09.920" style="s2">is seen as aggressive i i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.359" end="00:42:11.040" style="s2">totally</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.920" end="00:42:12.880" style="s2">illegitimate that it&#39;s seen as</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.040" end="00:42:13.440" style="s2">aggressive because it&#39;s basically them</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.880" end="00:42:15.359" style="s2">viewed</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.440" end="00:42:16.800" style="s2">from their own lens they are warriors on</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.359" end="00:42:18.560" style="s2">behalf of social justice it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.800" end="00:42:19.680" style="s2">calling antifa antifa even though you</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.560" end="00:42:21.119" style="s2">don&#39;t think they&#39;re really fighting for</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.680" end="00:42:23.280" style="s2">that i&#39;m the anti-racist yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.119" end="00:42:24.960" style="s2">yeah so um at some level if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.280" end="00:42:26.319" style="s2">accepting somebody else&#39;s viewpoint to</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.960" end="00:42:27.200" style="s2">name their movement you&#39;re doing them a</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.319" end="00:42:29.760" style="s2">favor</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.200" end="00:42:30.800" style="s2">and um to be chastised for it because</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.760" end="00:42:34.480" style="s2">you&#39;re on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:34.480" style="s2">is preposterous so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.880" end="00:42:38.000" style="s2">are the dna strands</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.640" end="00:42:42.960" style="s2">are the dna strands in a tit-for-tat</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.119" end="00:42:46.000" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.960" end="00:42:48.160" style="s2">are the dna are</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.000" end="00:42:50.160" style="s2">you talking about chromatids uh no like</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.160" end="00:42:54.160" style="s2">the the five prime and the theoprime</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.160" end="00:42:56.880" style="s2">strands oh right i think i think i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.160" end="00:42:58.720" style="s2">um uh it continues would you agree that</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.880" end="00:42:59.359" style="s2">all living things are engineered by tit</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.720" end="00:43:02.880" style="s2">for tat</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.359" end="00:43:05.119" style="s2">except for the number of variables e.g</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.880" end="00:43:06.160" style="s2">a fur tree responds to less outside</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.119" end="00:43:09.520" style="s2">stimuli than an</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.160" end="00:43:10.079" style="s2">oak so this echo who&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.520" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2">smart</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.079" end="00:43:14.240" style="s2">but also often tries to fit more into</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:14.880" style="s2">her questions than we could quite make</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.240" end="00:43:17.920" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.880" end="00:43:20.160" style="s2">yeah um i i don&#39;t it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.920" end="00:43:21.040" style="s2">if we&#39;re talking five prime if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.160" end="00:43:23.920" style="s2">talking uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.040" end="00:43:24.400" style="s2">sense and inverse sense right we are</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.920" end="00:43:27.680" style="s2">looking</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.400" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">at i an identity relationship</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.680" end="00:43:32.240" style="s2">right basically the same information</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.720" end="00:43:33.680" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s just error correction</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.240" end="00:43:34.400" style="s2">so you thought maybe chromatids but that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.680" end="00:43:36.800" style="s2">would be that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.400" end="00:43:37.839" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not dna strands it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.800" end="00:43:40.319" style="s2">strands yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.839" end="00:43:41.680" style="s2">so i don&#39;t think so but it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.319" end="00:43:42.720" style="s2">given that it&#39;s echo there&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.680" end="00:43:43.920" style="s2">chance that there&#39;s something in that</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.720" end="00:43:46.079" style="s2">question that we&#39;re just not</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.920" end="00:43:47.520" style="s2">getting from it um and then the so the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.079" end="00:43:49.599" style="s2">second part the question would you agree</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.520" end="00:43:52.400" style="s2">that all living things are engineered</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.599" end="00:43:53.119" style="s2">by tit for tat except for the number of</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.400" end="00:43:56.240" style="s2">variables</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.119" end="00:43:59.839" style="s2">well i guess i would say um</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.240" end="00:44:01.200" style="s2">equilibrium is a very powerful concept</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.839" end="00:44:03.920" style="s2">if you have not spent time</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.200" end="00:44:05.440" style="s2">thinking about equilibrium it is worth</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.920" end="00:44:07.040" style="s2">doing and that in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.440" end="00:44:09.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s tit for tat because</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.040" end="00:44:12.240" style="s2">well it&#39;s a tit-for-tat sorry but</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.040" end="00:44:14.960" style="s2">uh almost as assumes diatic right</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.240" end="00:44:15.520" style="s2">it seems to be back and forth a b a b a</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.960" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">b</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.520" end="00:44:20.000" style="s2">right and equilibrium accommodates more</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.560" end="00:44:22.960" style="s2">variables and so it&#39;s sort of built into</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.000" end="00:44:26.560" style="s2">the question but you can you</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.960" end="00:44:28.960" style="s2">the dog does not like this explanation</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.560" end="00:44:30.960" style="s2">you end up reaching equilibrium as many</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.960" end="00:44:34.400" style="s2">more than two often variables</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.960" end="00:44:36.560" style="s2">come to a sort of an uh an agreeable</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.400" end="00:44:40.000" style="s2">tension with one another</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.560" end="00:44:41.200" style="s2">um yeah i also don&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.000" end="00:44:42.319" style="s2">explanation but you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.200" end="00:44:44.000" style="s2">groan at me like the dog</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.319" end="00:44:46.640" style="s2">no i wouldn&#39;t grant it you like the dog</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.000" end="00:44:47.599" style="s2">does um for one thing i&#39;d be second best</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.640" end="00:44:51.119" style="s2">at it and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.599" end="00:44:52.800" style="s2">she&#39;s really good yeah she is um no i</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.119" end="00:44:54.319" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t see it i don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.800" end="00:44:57.520" style="s2">tit for tat i think it&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.319" end="00:44:59.359" style="s2">a higher order process that uh manifests</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.520" end="00:45:00.800" style="s2">tit for tat under some circumstances but</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.359" end="00:45:02.640" style="s2">tit for tat basically</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.800" end="00:45:04.000" style="s2">is limited to the universe where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.640" end="00:45:07.520" style="s2">something to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.000" end="00:45:09.040" style="s2">one um and</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.520" end="00:45:10.640" style="s2">you know in the case of the strands of</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.040" end="00:45:12.480" style="s2">dna</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.640" end="00:45:14.400" style="s2">um the sense strand does not win at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.480" end="00:45:16.560" style="s2">expense of the inverse strand so</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.400" end="00:45:18.079" style="s2">i think it&#39;s just not not right whereas</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.560" end="00:45:20.480" style="s2">sister chromatids</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.079" end="00:45:21.920" style="s2">will be in in conflict with one another</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.480" end="00:45:23.040" style="s2">you know parent and offspring are in</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.920" end="00:45:24.400" style="s2">conflict but you know there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.040" end="00:45:25.680" style="s2">plenty of conflict to be found there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.400" end="00:45:28.319" style="s2">plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.680" end="00:45:30.839" style="s2">evolutionary theory to be had right but</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.319" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">not not in terms of the strands of dna</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.839" end="00:45:36.160" style="s2">yep um oh</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.839" end="00:45:38.160" style="s2">final part of the same of echo&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.160" end="00:45:42.000" style="s2">question are explorer modes</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.160" end="00:45:42.000" style="s2">tit for tat looking for new partners</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.839" end="00:45:49.280" style="s2">um again i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.960" end="00:45:50.160" style="s2">i think it&#39;s not quite the right</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.280" end="00:45:52.000" style="s2">expansion</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.160" end="00:45:53.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t think tit for tat is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.000" end="00:45:54.319" style="s2">that we&#39;re trying to expand here i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.599" end="00:45:56.079" style="s2">think it quite</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.319" end="00:45:58.000" style="s2">works if an explorer mode let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.079" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">simplest version of an explorer mode is</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.000" end="00:46:00.319" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.880" end="00:46:01.760" style="s2">you know critters trying to find a</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.319" end="00:46:03.520" style="s2">watershed they haven&#39;t found yet let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.760" end="00:46:05.760" style="s2">say we&#39;re talking about salmon</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.520" end="00:46:07.280" style="s2">um then it&#39;s not really looking you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.760" end="00:46:08.079" style="s2">the watershed isn&#39;t a partner to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.280" end="00:46:09.359" style="s2">salmon</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.079" end="00:46:11.119" style="s2">the watershed is indifferent to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.359" end="00:46:12.560" style="s2">salmon yeah um so</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.119" end="00:46:14.319" style="s2">yeah not quite no and that&#39;s actually i</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.560" end="00:46:15.280" style="s2">mean that&#39;s another that&#39;s something i</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.319" end="00:46:16.079" style="s2">don&#39;t think i don&#39;t know that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.280" end="00:46:18.000" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.079" end="00:46:19.599" style="s2">ever yet in our live streams but this</p>

<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:47:00.240" style="s2">you know when a when a volcano erupts</p>

<p begin="00:47:00.240" end="00:47:03.280" style="s2">don&#39;t give a damn there&#39;s there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.599" end="00:47:04.640" style="s2">response there whereas predators</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.280" end="00:47:06.400" style="s2">competitors con specifics</p>

<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:12.640" style="s2">and therefore there&#39;s a tit-for-tat</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.599" end="00:47:14.160" style="s2">that&#39;s possible you can&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.640" end="00:47:18.000" style="s2">tit-for-tat with a river</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.160" end="00:47:20.000" style="s2">no you&#39;ll lose for one thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.000" end="00:47:22.480" style="s2">it starts to betray the point i just</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.000" end="00:47:25.520" style="s2">invalidated your entire explanation</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.480" end="00:47:28.079" style="s2">one glib remark but uh well and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.520" end="00:47:29.200" style="s2">actually you know with with a river you</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.079" end="00:47:30.720" style="s2">can you can change you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.200" end="00:47:32.400" style="s2">actively change the course of a river</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.720" end="00:47:34.079" style="s2">and the river will then you know move</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.400" end="00:47:38.240" style="s2">away from you but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.079" end="00:47:40.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.240" end="00:47:41.680" style="s2">as if it was an organism yeah it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.640" end="00:47:44.000" style="s2">the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.680" end="00:47:45.680" style="s2">realms in which there&#39;s uh an objective</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.000" end="00:47:49.920" style="s2">in realms in which there&#39;s no objective</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.680" end="00:47:51.599" style="s2">right i had a vision yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.920" end="00:47:53.200" style="s2">standing between writers and federal</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.599" end="00:47:55.200" style="s2">officers what are the chances that a</p>

<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:47:58.480" style="s2">various backgrounds could peacefully</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.720" end="00:48:01.680" style="s2">protest the rioters</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.480" end="00:48:05.200" style="s2">would there be violence no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.680" end="00:48:08.240" style="s2">um yeah uh good thought</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.200" end="00:48:09.920" style="s2">yeah question is who&#39;s who&#39;s ready um</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.240" end="00:48:11.440" style="s2">it has to be a large enough group and a</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.920" end="00:48:12.319" style="s2">reasonable enough group and a careful</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.440" end="00:48:14.960" style="s2">enough group</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.319" end="00:48:17.359" style="s2">uh to pull it off and a group that</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.960" end="00:48:17.359" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.000" end="00:48:23.680" style="s2">somehow it has to</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.119" end="00:48:24.160" style="s2">not be reducible even if this is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.680" end="00:48:27.599" style="s2">complete</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.160" end="00:48:29.680" style="s2">lie by the rioters to that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:49:33.119" end="00:49:38.079" style="s2">heather um</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.400" end="00:49:39.599" style="s2">let me go with the wood frog first uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.079" end="00:49:42.640" style="s2">that&#39;s a new genus you&#39;re giving it</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.599" end="00:49:44.160" style="s2">um i assume that this is um this is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.640" end="00:49:45.839" style="s2">just had a name change since i last</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.160" end="00:49:48.720" style="s2">checked in with this frog</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.839" end="00:49:49.440" style="s2">um if it is the frog i&#39;m thinking of it</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.720" end="00:49:52.720" style="s2">is in</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.440" end="00:49:56.079" style="s2">um is present in sort of the middle uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.720" end="00:49:59.280" style="s2">mid-continental uh north america us</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.079" end="00:49:59.920" style="s2">up into uh southern canada and these</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.280" end="00:50:03.280" style="s2">frogs</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.920" end="00:50:05.599" style="s2">actually uh get frozen solid frozen</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.280" end="00:50:06.960" style="s2">solid not just their hearts but during</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.599" end="00:50:07.280" style="s2">hard winters they they estimate they</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.960" end="00:50:10.079" style="s2">bare</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.280" end="00:50:10.400" style="s2">they bury under and then they don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.079" end="00:50:12.480" style="s2">keep</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.400" end="00:50:14.079" style="s2">anything going they just become ice</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.480" end="00:50:17.520" style="s2">cubes like if you dig them up</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.079" end="00:50:19.119" style="s2">and uh you drop them they shatter</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.520" end="00:50:20.800" style="s2">and then we are not advising that you do</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.119" end="00:50:21.359" style="s2">that they don&#39;t restart after they</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.800" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">shatter</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.359" end="00:50:25.359" style="s2">frogs you heard it here first frogs do</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:28.400" style="s2">not restart after they shatter</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.359" end="00:50:31.359" style="s2">um unlike starfish</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.400" end="00:50:32.559" style="s2">you could shatter a starfish uh you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.359" end="00:50:33.680" style="s2">prune the legs off</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.559" end="00:50:35.680" style="s2">ah it&#39;s a little different from</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.680" end="00:50:37.920" style="s2">shattering it&#39;s less dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.680" end="00:50:39.280" style="s2">yeah yeah okay well these are the tools</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.920" end="00:50:43.119" style="s2">we have as biologists</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.280" end="00:50:46.319" style="s2">yeah so what is the actual mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.119" end="00:50:47.359" style="s2">of restarting i i don&#39;t know at like the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.319" end="00:50:51.520" style="s2">cellular level</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.359" end="00:50:54.720" style="s2">um but there is a kind of anti-freeze</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.520" end="00:50:56.480" style="s2">um i think in these guys um that</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.720" end="00:50:59.680" style="s2">basically begins to circulate</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.480" end="00:51:01.520" style="s2">as the frog begins to thaw and they can</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.680" end="00:51:04.480" style="s2">only deal with so many</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.520" end="00:51:06.079" style="s2">well so so slow a freeze thaw cycle and</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.480" end="00:51:08.720" style="s2">so many of them within</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.079" end="00:51:09.920" style="s2">x number of weeks and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.720" end="00:51:13.359" style="s2">particularly</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.920" end="00:51:15.040" style="s2">chaotic springs for instance can leave a</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.359" end="00:51:16.559" style="s2">you know an iowa landscape bereft of</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.040" end="00:51:18.559" style="s2">these frogs because they just they</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.559" end="00:51:20.079" style="s2">they don&#39;t come out of it successfully</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.559" end="00:51:23.200" style="s2">but if they thaw slowly</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.079" end="00:51:25.119" style="s2">and better off if it&#39;s just once um they</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.200" end="00:51:26.400" style="s2">uh they restart but i don&#39;t i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.119" end="00:51:28.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a big black box there in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.400" end="00:51:30.079" style="s2">explanation that i don&#39;t know more about</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.240" end="00:51:32.319" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna take a crack at it okay i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.079" end="00:51:33.920" style="s2">gonna predict that um</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.319" end="00:51:35.280" style="s2">predict is one of these things where</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.920" end="00:51:37.359" style="s2">it&#39;s a prediction because i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.280" end="00:51:40.480" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean nobody knows</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.359" end="00:51:44.000" style="s2">but i&#39;m going to predict that there is</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.480" end="00:51:47.040" style="s2">a battery-like</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.000" end="00:51:50.559" style="s2">set of cells that</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.040" end="00:51:53.359" style="s2">is positioned in the tissue</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.559" end="00:51:55.760" style="s2">such that it does not take what little</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.359" end="00:51:57.680" style="s2">energy it has accumulated</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.760" end="00:51:59.200" style="s2">and fire it off too early that is to say</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.680" end="00:52:00.720" style="s2">while the heart is still partly frozen</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.200" end="00:52:02.240" style="s2">and therefore would damage itself or be</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.720" end="00:52:05.520" style="s2">unable to start</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.240" end="00:52:07.920" style="s2">there is some battery that on that</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.520" end="00:52:09.599" style="s2">thaws at the right moment that the heart</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.920" end="00:52:10.960" style="s2">is capable of restarting it&#39;s not too</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.599" end="00:52:13.200" style="s2">early it&#39;s not too late</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.960" end="00:52:15.200" style="s2">and that it sends a signal to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.200" end="00:52:18.160" style="s2">pacemaker which basically</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.200" end="00:52:18.960" style="s2">functions as a defibrillator hmm oh i</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.160" end="00:52:21.680" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.960" end="00:52:22.720" style="s2">yeah yeah i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.680" end="00:52:24.960" style="s2">nope neither do i</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.720" end="00:52:26.400" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a prediction uh with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.960" end="00:52:29.839" style="s2">the white&#39;s tree frogs</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.400" end="00:52:30.319" style="s2">uh what causes them to change color i do</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.839" end="00:52:32.800" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.319" end="00:52:34.880" style="s2">remember what the mechanism is on those</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.800" end="00:52:36.000" style="s2">guys there are a number of mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.880" end="00:52:39.280" style="s2">color change in</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.000" end="00:52:41.359" style="s2">mostly reptiles but also a few frogs um</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.280" end="00:52:42.880" style="s2">that involve basically chromatophores</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.359" end="00:52:45.280" style="s2">these you know just</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.880" end="00:52:46.000" style="s2">the things in the skin that can that can</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.280" end="00:52:49.599" style="s2">flip that are</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:51.280" style="s2">often usually uh effectively a toggle</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.599" end="00:52:52.880" style="s2">and they&#39;re binary and they can go from</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.280" end="00:52:53.359" style="s2">one to the other but obviously there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.880" end="00:52:55.119" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.359" end="00:52:56.640" style="s2">um over in reptile space not just</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.119" end="00:52:58.800" style="s2">chameleons that have a</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.640" end="00:53:00.800" style="s2">of a continuum and that&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.800" end="00:53:03.280" style="s2">mechanism and i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.800" end="00:53:04.240" style="s2">i do cephalopod mollusks have i think a</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.280" end="00:53:05.920" style="s2">wide range</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.240" end="00:53:07.440" style="s2">yeah i think they i think that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.920" end="00:53:08.480" style="s2">different evolution entirely whereas i</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.440" end="00:53:11.599" style="s2">think what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.480" end="00:53:13.920" style="s2">a few frogs and many more squamates um</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.599" end="00:53:16.000" style="s2">is a shared i think a shared evolution</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.920" end="00:53:17.280" style="s2">whereas the cephalopods is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.000" end="00:53:19.040" style="s2">you know a different different evolution</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.280" end="00:53:20.640" style="s2">of color change i&#39;m going to say</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.040" end="00:53:22.160" style="s2">and then some fish too and so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.640" end="00:53:23.839" style="s2">know if the fish like the actinops like</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.160" end="00:53:25.520" style="s2">rayfin fish that do this</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.839" end="00:53:26.960" style="s2">um is a separate evolution from the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.520" end="00:53:28.880" style="s2">other vertebrates</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.960" end="00:53:30.240" style="s2">don&#39;t know yeah and even if they are</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.880" end="00:53:31.520" style="s2">separate evolutions probably there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.240" end="00:53:33.680" style="s2">some precursor that they</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.520" end="00:53:36.240" style="s2">share yes this is the way it is with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.680" end="00:53:38.160" style="s2">vision pigments and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.240" end="00:53:39.760" style="s2">but uh i think it&#39;s melancholy that</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.160" end="00:53:42.960" style="s2">causes these frogs to</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.760" end="00:53:44.000" style="s2">change color melancholy yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.960" end="00:53:47.280" style="s2">that&#39;s probably right</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.000" end="00:53:51.040" style="s2">frogs are a sad lot oh sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.280" end="00:53:51.599" style="s2">um i did see probably on reddit recently</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.040" end="00:53:54.640" style="s2">somebody</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.599" end="00:53:58.240" style="s2">posted in uh maybe it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.640" end="00:54:01.760" style="s2">nature is fucking lit subreddit um</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.240" end="00:54:02.720" style="s2">a video of a cephalopod i think an</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.760" end="00:54:06.079" style="s2">octopus</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.720" end="00:54:09.119" style="s2">um it&#39;s a child&#39;s question man oh sorry</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.079" end="00:54:10.960" style="s2">well it&#39;s just it&#39;s a subreddit i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.119" end="00:54:14.559" style="s2">quoting i didn&#39;t name it</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.960" end="00:54:18.240" style="s2">um in any case they posted a video of</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.559" end="00:54:21.520" style="s2">a and i&#39;m sure it was an octopus um</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.240" end="00:54:22.880" style="s2">changing color in its dream state which</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.520" end="00:54:25.440" style="s2">raises all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.880" end="00:54:26.480" style="s2">dream state did you say how do we how do</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.440" end="00:54:28.480" style="s2">we know</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.480" end="00:54:30.880" style="s2">well because it appears to be an</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.480" end="00:54:33.040" style="s2">adornment also cephalopod&#39;s dream</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.880" end="00:54:34.559" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing is it&#39;s like how many</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.040" end="00:54:37.200" style="s2">different convergences</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.559" end="00:54:38.240" style="s2">are because so you know how is it that</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.200" end="00:54:40.240" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.240" end="00:54:41.440" style="s2">uh can so quickly say oh well color</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.240" end="00:54:43.359" style="s2">change and cephalopods it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.440" end="00:54:46.160" style="s2">a different evolution from color change</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.359" end="00:54:47.680" style="s2">in vertebrates and even more easily</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.160" end="00:54:49.920" style="s2">immediately conclude well if</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.680" end="00:54:50.880" style="s2">cephalopods if octopi and squid or some</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.920" end="00:54:51.920" style="s2">of them dream</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.880" end="00:54:54.720" style="s2">then it&#39;s going to be a separate</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.920" end="00:54:56.799" style="s2">evolution of dreaming than what we have</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.720" end="00:54:58.720" style="s2">because we see evidence of dreams in</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.799" end="00:55:00.160" style="s2">many mammals</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.720" end="00:55:02.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any evidence in</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.160" end="00:55:04.960" style="s2">birds</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.160" end="00:55:06.000" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think that i&#39;ve seen anyone</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.960" end="00:55:07.119" style="s2">discuss the possibility</p>

<p begin="00:55:25.520" end="00:55:29.040" style="s2">and those organisms weren&#39;t dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.520" end="00:55:31.280" style="s2">because we have</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.040" end="00:55:34.160" style="s2">no evidence of dreaming in almost any</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.280" end="00:55:35.839" style="s2">organisms that we&#39;ve looked at so</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.160" end="00:55:37.200" style="s2">these guys are dreaming says who looks</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.839" end="00:55:39.520" style="s2">like how do we know well</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.200" end="00:55:40.240" style="s2">you know i guess you would say uh you</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.520" end="00:55:43.760" style="s2">would have</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.240" end="00:55:45.200" style="s2">brain activity uh incidentally</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.760" end="00:55:46.559" style="s2">different evolution of brains yep</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.200" end="00:55:48.799" style="s2">different evolution of brains but you</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.559" end="00:55:51.839" style="s2">would be able to detect the electrical</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.799" end="00:55:53.280" style="s2">impulses associated with processing that</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.839" end="00:55:54.319" style="s2">is taking place while the animal&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.280" end="00:55:56.960" style="s2">taking in new</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.319" end="00:55:58.319" style="s2">data yeah and i would say you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.960" end="00:56:01.520" style="s2">painting with a broad brush</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.319" end="00:56:02.240" style="s2">that&#39;s dreams okay um it&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.520" end="00:56:05.280" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.240" end="00:56:07.440" style="s2">whether or not there&#39;s i guess</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.280" end="00:56:08.559" style="s2">dreams for us is always tied into visual</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.440" end="00:56:10.880" style="s2">cortex stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.559" end="00:56:11.920" style="s2">yep there&#39;s there&#39;s at least memory of</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.880" end="00:56:15.680" style="s2">visual</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.920" end="00:56:19.680" style="s2">stuff uh even i believe for blind people</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.680" end="00:56:22.400" style="s2">right uh so uh we obviously can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.680" end="00:56:24.000" style="s2">interview the occupy yet we cannot they</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.400" end="00:56:25.040" style="s2">just don&#39;t cooperate yeah they really</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.000" end="00:56:28.799" style="s2">they&#39;re not interested</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.040" end="00:56:30.319" style="s2">no no so we can see that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.799" end="00:56:31.760" style="s2">processing going on but we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.319" end="00:56:32.319" style="s2">what the subjective experience is like</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.760" end="00:56:36.079" style="s2">for them</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.319" end="00:56:38.240" style="s2">can we what would it take for you guys</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.079" end="00:56:40.559" style="s2">to pick up and leave portland</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.240" end="00:56:42.160" style="s2">you trying to get us to leave well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.559" end="00:56:43.599" style="s2">see i&#39;ve had several phone calls in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.160" end="00:56:45.040" style="s2">last week suggesting that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.599" end="00:56:46.880" style="s2">good idea</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.040" end="00:56:48.960" style="s2">interestingly several of those calls</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.880" end="00:56:51.200" style="s2">came from california where people are</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.960" end="00:56:54.720" style="s2">actually picking up and leaving so</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.200" end="00:56:58.960" style="s2">um yeah we&#39;re in kind of a pickle</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.720" end="00:57:02.400" style="s2">when we moved here from olympia</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.960" end="00:57:04.000" style="s2">we told our children that we wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.400" end="00:57:06.160" style="s2">move again we wouldn&#39;t move them again</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.000" end="00:57:07.839" style="s2">before they were done with school um</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.160" end="00:57:08.480" style="s2">which seemed really important because of</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.839" end="00:57:11.040" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.480" end="00:57:12.880" style="s2">the total chaos that they experienced</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.040" end="00:57:16.319" style="s2">because of what happened at evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.880" end="00:57:17.040" style="s2">yeah um so that is that is something</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.319" end="00:57:19.760" style="s2">that keep</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.040" end="00:57:21.440" style="s2">and and you know there&#39;s so much about</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.760" end="00:57:22.319" style="s2">portland and the pacific northwest to</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.440" end="00:57:25.200" style="s2">love</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.319" end="00:57:26.720" style="s2">uh but uh certainly there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.200" end="00:57:27.920" style="s2">there are things that could cause us to</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.720" end="00:57:31.440" style="s2">leave</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.920" end="00:57:32.160" style="s2">for example like perhaps um defunding</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.440" end="00:57:34.400" style="s2">the police</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.160" end="00:57:36.640" style="s2">and leaving us to fend for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.400" end="00:57:36.640" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.839" end="00:57:41.520" style="s2">i i just don&#39;t know what else to think i</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.000" end="00:57:42.480" style="s2">mean at some level it&#39;s such a dumb</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.520" end="00:57:45.920" style="s2">experiment to run</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.480" end="00:57:48.319" style="s2">but uh how successful</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.920" end="00:57:49.440" style="s2">are we likely to be defending ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.319" end="00:57:52.839" style="s2">against</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.440" end="00:57:55.839" style="s2">who knows what yeah we have a dog that</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.839" end="00:57:55.839" style="s2">moans</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.920" end="00:57:58.960" style="s2">what is the likelihood of a free and</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.200" end="00:58:00.559" style="s2">fair election in november</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.960" end="00:58:01.760" style="s2">i am concerned that the current unrest</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.559" end="00:58:03.680" style="s2">could emerge on election day and</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.760" end="00:58:05.280" style="s2">undermine the democratic process</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.680" end="00:58:08.480" style="s2">widespread violence can suppress and</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.280" end="00:58:11.359" style="s2">intimidate voters</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.480" end="00:58:13.520" style="s2">um yeah unity 2020 might be the way to</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.359" end="00:58:14.960" style="s2">go on that</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.520" end="00:58:16.880" style="s2">i mean one of the i don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.960" end="00:58:18.799" style="s2">chances are what are the chances</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.880" end="00:58:20.640" style="s2">that it&#39;s going to be a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.799" end="00:58:21.440" style="s2">free and fair there&#39;s zero because no</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.640" end="00:58:23.359" style="s2">election</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.440" end="00:58:24.960" style="s2">in a large population is going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.359" end="00:58:26.160" style="s2">hundred percent free and fair will</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.960" end="00:58:28.640" style="s2">somebody file a</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.160" end="00:58:30.160" style="s2">phony ballot somewhere but what are the</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.640" end="00:58:31.520" style="s2">chances that the election is free enough</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.160" end="00:58:34.319" style="s2">and fair enough that it actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.520" end="00:58:36.799" style="s2">represents the will of the people</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.319" end="00:58:38.960" style="s2">pretty high what are the chances that</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.799" end="00:58:41.440" style="s2">the will of the people is coherent</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.960" end="00:58:43.680" style="s2">pretty low unless of course you consider</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.440" end="00:58:45.040" style="s2">unity 2020 then of course it could but</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.680" end="00:58:46.640" style="s2">you know voting for either of these</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.040" end="00:58:48.480" style="s2">major parties that&#39;s not really the will</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.640" end="00:58:49.920" style="s2">of the people so much that&#39;s the will of</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.480" end="00:58:53.359" style="s2">the people</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.920" end="00:58:56.559" style="s2">given constraints that are absolutely</p>

<p begin="01:00:59.119" end="01:01:02.799" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.839" end="01:01:04.480" style="s2">okay mainstream anthropology explains</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.799" end="01:01:06.240" style="s2">that humans have become agriculturalists</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.480" end="01:01:07.599" style="s2">only 10 000 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.240" end="01:01:09.520" style="s2">could this have been a re-emergence of</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.599" end="01:01:11.520" style="s2">culture following a global cataclysm</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.520" end="01:01:14.240" style="s2">might there be an evolutionary bio-angle</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.520" end="01:01:18.160" style="s2">to this idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.240" end="01:01:19.599" style="s2">so the evidence the archaeological</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.160" end="01:01:22.480" style="s2">evidence suggests that</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.599" end="01:01:23.200" style="s2">agriculture evolved convergently</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.480" end="01:01:26.000" style="s2">separately</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.200" end="01:01:27.359" style="s2">many places uh ranging from ten to</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.000" end="01:01:28.880" style="s2">twelve thousand years ago and then a few</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.359" end="01:01:32.720" style="s2">places like the new world</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.880" end="01:01:34.480" style="s2">um probably more recently than that um</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.720" end="01:01:36.839" style="s2">but certainly in isolation in the new</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.480" end="01:01:40.000" style="s2">world uh and</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.839" end="01:01:41.440" style="s2">um there&#39;s there&#39;s no archaeological</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.000" end="01:01:44.640" style="s2">evidence to suggest</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.440" end="01:01:47.839" style="s2">agriculture from you know 20 or 30 or</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.640" end="01:01:48.640" style="s2">more than that thousand years ago uh so</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.839" end="01:01:51.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.640" end="01:01:52.240" style="s2">uh i and you know we have both gone</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.440" end="01:01:54.799" style="s2">looking for</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.240" end="01:01:55.359" style="s2">the the strange the fringe the what-if</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.799" end="01:01:58.160" style="s2">ideas</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.359" end="01:01:59.520" style="s2">um around you know a lot of human</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.160" end="01:02:00.559" style="s2">prehistory including the origins of</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.520" end="01:02:03.760" style="s2">agriculture so</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.559" end="01:02:05.359" style="s2">i don&#39;t think um i also i&#39;ve just never</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.760" end="01:02:06.960" style="s2">even seen any glimmerings of like i</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.359" end="01:02:08.160" style="s2">found this and it&#39;s been buried because</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.960" end="01:02:09.920" style="s2">mainstream</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.160" end="01:02:11.920" style="s2">anthropology doesn&#39;t want to hear this</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.920" end="01:02:15.119" style="s2">that said um</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.920" end="01:02:17.200" style="s2">i will be anything but shocked if there</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.119" end="01:02:19.440" style="s2">are precursors that are more</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.200" end="01:02:21.520" style="s2">agricultural than we understand</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.440" end="01:02:23.599" style="s2">in other words yes um people having</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.520" end="01:02:25.359" style="s2">noticed that seeds produce plants</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.599" end="01:02:27.599" style="s2">who may drop those seeds in places that</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.359" end="01:02:32.160" style="s2">they would find convenient to go</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.599" end="01:02:32.960" style="s2">forage later likely it exists just as</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.160" end="01:02:35.839" style="s2">there are</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.960" end="01:02:38.240" style="s2">precursors of uh evolutionary thinking</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.839" end="01:02:42.079" style="s2">that have largely been lost to history</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.240" end="01:02:44.240" style="s2">some things are um so important</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.079" end="01:02:46.480" style="s2">canonical clear for those who have been</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.240" end="01:02:48.480" style="s2">thinking about them that my guess is</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.480" end="01:02:50.240" style="s2">there will be precursors yeah and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.480" end="01:02:51.920" style="s2">order of operations isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.240" end="01:02:54.079" style="s2">inherently what it would seem so for</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.920" end="01:02:56.960" style="s2">instance bread seems to predate</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.079" end="01:02:58.480" style="s2">agriculture in boy i think it&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.960" end="01:03:00.319" style="s2">places i think maybe south china</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.480" end="01:03:02.720" style="s2">agriculture seems to have emerged twice</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.319" end="01:03:04.240" style="s2">probably independently within within</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.720" end="01:03:05.839" style="s2">modern china and i think it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.240" end="01:03:07.920" style="s2">southern china and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.839" end="01:03:09.440" style="s2">in sort of mesopotamia uh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.920" end="01:03:12.000" style="s2">evidence of bread</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.440" end="01:03:14.000" style="s2">before agriculture so um that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.000" end="01:03:15.839" style="s2">exactly to this point but the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.000" end="01:03:17.359" style="s2">things go in this you know obviously</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.839" end="01:03:20.960" style="s2">linear progression</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.359" end="01:03:23.680" style="s2">uh and you know ceramics too uh were</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.960" end="01:03:24.960" style="s2">widespread in some places long before</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.680" end="01:03:27.119" style="s2">agriculture whereas</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.960" end="01:03:28.960" style="s2">in some places probably agriculture you</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.119" end="01:03:32.160" style="s2">know basically created the need</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.960" end="01:03:34.160" style="s2">for vessels in which to hold grains</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.160" end="01:03:35.599" style="s2">so these things these things are very</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.160" end="01:03:39.119" style="s2">different in the many</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.599" end="01:03:39.119" style="s2">many places where they have evolved</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.000" end="01:03:43.440" style="s2">hi this question begins i believe that j</p>

<p begin="01:05:05.280" end="01:05:08.720" style="s2">um but then you know it it falls apart a</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.760" end="01:05:12.000" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.720" end="01:05:13.520" style="s2">the the very question isn&#39;t quite um</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.000" end="01:05:14.799" style="s2">accurate in terms of what i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.520" end="01:05:16.400" style="s2">looked into this in the last month and a</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.799" end="01:05:19.119" style="s2">half or so or two months</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.400" end="01:05:20.480" style="s2">um but early on it looked like oh was</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.119" end="01:05:23.359" style="s2">resistant</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.480" end="01:05:24.480" style="s2">um to cover 19 but a was particularly</p>

<p begin="01:05:24.480" end="01:05:28.000" style="s2">b and a b were not particularly</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.240" end="01:05:30.000" style="s2">susceptible so it wouldn&#39;t just be a</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.000" end="01:05:32.480" style="s2">blanket like do you have</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.000" end="01:05:33.200" style="s2">um you know do you have things stuck to</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.480" end="01:05:35.599" style="s2">your your</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.200" end="01:05:37.839" style="s2">to your blood or not right it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.599" end="01:05:40.559" style="s2">o versus a b and a b</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.839" end="01:05:41.680" style="s2">a b and a b um so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not at</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.559" end="01:05:43.359" style="s2">least clean but there</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.680" end="01:05:45.760" style="s2">there might be something here this is a</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.359" end="01:05:48.400" style="s2">question we need to engage with</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.760" end="01:05:49.520" style="s2">the person to get more out of it final</p>

<p begin="01:05:53.440" end="01:06:00.799" style="s2">t-a-m-u i don&#39;t remember i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.440" end="01:06:03.599" style="s2">wait texas a m oh texas a m yep</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.799" end="01:06:05.200" style="s2">texas a m i&#39;ve tried to inoculate him</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.599" end="01:06:06.640" style="s2">against the mind virus</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.200" end="01:06:08.400" style="s2">i&#39;m more worried about him catching the</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.640" end="01:06:11.839" style="s2">mind virus than coronavirus</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.400" end="01:06:15.680" style="s2">which do you think is worse um</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.839" end="01:06:17.680" style="s2">oh wow well hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.680" end="01:06:19.520" style="s2">you have laid the groundwork to make</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.680" end="01:06:23.839" style="s2">resistance to</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.520" end="01:06:27.359" style="s2">the woke virus highly likely</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.839" end="01:06:28.960" style="s2">i would say the thing about coronavirus</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.359" end="01:06:30.640" style="s2">is we just don&#39;t know how bad it is yet</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.960" end="01:06:32.240" style="s2">because we don&#39;t know whether or not you</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.640" end="01:06:34.000" style="s2">gain immunity</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.240" end="01:06:36.160" style="s2">that&#39;s long lasting we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.000" end="01:06:37.039" style="s2">whether it hides in some tissue and</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.160" end="01:06:38.640" style="s2">recurs</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.039" end="01:06:40.240" style="s2">if it&#39;s evolving towards more virulence</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.640" end="01:06:43.359" style="s2">or less right</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.240" end="01:06:44.839" style="s2">towards more transmissibility outside we</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.359" end="01:06:47.599" style="s2">do know that it</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.839" end="01:06:51.119" style="s2">um does an awful lot of organ damage</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.599" end="01:06:53.920" style="s2">in some people so i would say</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.119" end="01:06:54.480" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this way if your son comes</p>

<p begin="01:06:58.960" end="01:07:05.200" style="s2">awaken from that zombie-like state and</p>

<p begin="01:07:05.680" end="01:07:08.640" style="s2">you&#39;re just rolling the dice with</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.039" end="01:07:11.119" style="s2">respect to what kind of damage it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.640" end="01:07:14.480" style="s2">gonna do and how long-lasting it is so</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.119" end="01:07:14.880" style="s2">um i honestly don&#39;t i i appreciate the</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.480" end="01:07:17.440" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.880" end="01:07:19.119" style="s2">very much um and i don&#39;t even know how</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.440" end="01:07:20.880" style="s2">to put the two things next to each other</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.119" end="01:07:21.359" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how to compare the risks</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.880" end="01:07:24.160" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.359" end="01:07:26.400" style="s2">yeah um even though you know the mind</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.160" end="01:07:28.799" style="s2">virus the woke mind virus very much</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.400" end="01:07:30.160" style="s2">is acting like a virus and so it seems</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.799" end="01:07:30.960" style="s2">like we should be able to answer this</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.160" end="01:07:34.640" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.960" end="01:07:34.640" style="s2">um but they pose</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.280" end="01:07:39.760" style="s2">we believe as if you&#39;re watching this</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.359" end="01:07:42.000" style="s2">you know that the woke virus poses</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.760" end="01:07:43.280" style="s2">actually an existential threat to</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.000" end="01:07:45.359" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.280" end="01:07:46.799" style="s2">um yes but your son&#39;s participation and</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.359" end="01:07:47.760" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t change how threatening it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.799" end="01:07:50.880" style="s2">to civilization</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.760" end="01:07:53.599" style="s2">right and your sense your son&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.880" end="01:07:56.079" style="s2">you know brief dipping into it and</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.599" end="01:07:58.000" style="s2">emerging perhaps inoculated more</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.079" end="01:08:00.480" style="s2">strongly than he would have been</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.000" end="01:08:01.039" style="s2">um might render him more powerful in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.480" end="01:08:05.039" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.039" end="01:08:08.480" style="s2">whereas a brief dip into coronavirus um</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.039" end="01:08:11.359" style="s2">probably does not make him stronger so</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.480" end="01:08:12.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a tough question and i&#39;m sort of</p>
