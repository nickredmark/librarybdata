<p begin="00:01:08.000" end="00:01:11.680" style="s2">essences or potential um in the service</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.400" end="00:01:14.960" style="s2">to a larger hole</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.680" end="00:01:18.159" style="s2">as i have understood it so um</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.960" end="00:01:20.159" style="s2">how how did you get into this work um</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.159" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">because you started off as an artist and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.159" end="00:01:26.080" style="s2">also as a permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:29.520" style="s2">and landscape gardener a few decades ago</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.080" end="00:01:32.560" style="s2">yeah well um</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.520" end="00:01:33.040" style="s2">yeah so i studied i studied humanities</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.560" end="00:01:36.079" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.040" end="00:01:39.119" style="s2">i trained to become a painter an artist</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.079" end="00:01:41.360" style="s2">um but very early on</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:43.680" style="s2">i realized that i needed to take that</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.360" end="00:01:45.280" style="s2">training and apply it to design if i was</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.680" end="00:01:48.320" style="s2">going to make a living</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.280" end="00:01:50.960" style="s2">and i grew up in santa fe new mexico</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.320" end="00:01:51.600" style="s2">which is it&#39;s right at the interface</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.960" end="00:01:55.439" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.600" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">kind of dry desert</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.439" end="00:01:59.600" style="s2">grasslands and mountains high mountains</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:02.960" style="s2">the rocky mountains</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.600" end="00:02:05.840" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a kind of harsh place</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.960" end="00:02:06.399" style="s2">and learning how to garden here and how</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.840" end="00:02:09.759" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.399" end="00:02:12.879" style="s2">landscape designs homes is challenging</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.759" end="00:02:16.080" style="s2">um luckily i grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.879" end="00:02:17.200" style="s2">my stepmother was a botanist and she</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.080" end="00:02:21.040" style="s2">started the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.200" end="00:02:23.440" style="s2">native plant nursery here in new mexico</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.040" end="00:02:24.959" style="s2">and so i grew up sort of learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.440" end="00:02:27.760" style="s2">work with native species</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.959" end="00:02:28.160" style="s2">collect the seeds grow them and so on</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.760" end="00:02:29.840" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.160" end="00:02:31.519" style="s2">that was where i really started out i</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.840" end="00:02:34.000" style="s2">was always a gardener and always</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.519" end="00:02:37.360" style="s2">interested in design</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.000" end="00:02:40.480" style="s2">but um the impulse behind doing that</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.360" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">uh native plant work was you know how to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.480" end="00:02:43.360" style="s2">bring</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:44.319" style="s2">the way we live in this very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.360" end="00:02:46.959" style="s2">fragile</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.319" end="00:02:47.440" style="s2">and challenging landscape how to bring</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.959" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.440" end="00:02:53.599" style="s2">into harmony with that landscape using</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:55.920" style="s2">native species and so on</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.599" end="00:02:57.680" style="s2">so that&#39;s really where i launched and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.920" end="00:03:00.640" style="s2">i&#39;d always been a big fan</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.680" end="00:03:01.519" style="s2">of rodale and the roedale institute and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.640" end="00:03:03.599" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.519" end="00:03:04.720" style="s2">and through that i became aware of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.599" end="00:03:07.840" style="s2">permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.720" end="00:03:12.159" style="s2">right when the first book was published</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.840" end="00:03:14.000" style="s2">in the 70s maybe um and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.159" end="00:03:15.760" style="s2">so i was tracking it but sort of very</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.000" end="00:03:18.800" style="s2">busy with my little</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.760" end="00:03:23.200" style="s2">you know career and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.800" end="00:03:26.319" style="s2">um then at some point in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.200" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">mid seventh or mid 80s uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.319" end="00:03:32.799" style="s2">i actually met bill mollison</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:35.599" style="s2">and he was a big charismatic</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.799" end="00:03:36.080" style="s2">megafauna kind of guy and he sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.599" end="00:03:39.200" style="s2">swept</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.080" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">up a bunch of us in the in new mexico</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.200" end="00:03:44.319" style="s2">and and also in arizona and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">within a year we had formed something</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.319" end="00:03:49.760" style="s2">called permaculture dryland since</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:52.159" style="s2">two which was about joel uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.760" end="00:03:54.080" style="s2">what was joel already involved in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.159" end="00:03:55.120" style="s2">well joel and i went to the same college</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.080" end="00:03:58.560" style="s2">so we knew each other</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.120" end="00:04:00.959" style="s2">when we were like kids really</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.560" end="00:04:03.040" style="s2">yeah and um and we have been friends and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.959" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">he worked with me in my landscape</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.040" end="00:04:06.560" style="s2">company</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:09.200" style="s2">for some years and then he went off and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.560" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">specialized in organic agriculture that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.200" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">became his focus for a while</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:14.720" style="s2">and we came back together around the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:16.880" style="s2">permaculture work</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.720" end="00:04:19.040" style="s2">along with other kind of you know tim</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">murphy who</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.040" end="00:04:24.000" style="s2">was practicing in uh southern arizona</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:27.280" style="s2">with his wife vic margaret</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.000" end="00:04:30.080" style="s2">and um and scott pittman who was based</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.280" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">near santa fe and so on anyway it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:33.919" style="s2">kind of an interesting wild west period</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:36.960" style="s2">in the permaculture movement</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.919" end="00:04:38.800" style="s2">and um in the here in</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.960" end="00:04:41.040" style="s2">north america there hadn&#39;t been a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.800" end="00:04:42.960" style="s2">work yet in dry land so we formed</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.040" end="00:04:45.120" style="s2">to really focus on dry lands which meant</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.960" end="00:04:48.960" style="s2">that a lot of what we were</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.120" end="00:04:50.720" style="s2">interested in was um how</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.960" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">mollison and holmgren were thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.720" end="00:04:55.280" style="s2">about water</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.479" end="00:04:56.240" style="s2">in relationship you know managing water</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.280" end="00:04:58.240" style="s2">and soil</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.240" end="00:04:59.440" style="s2">in relationship to establishing</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.240" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">permanent</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.440" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">productive landscapes and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:07.120" style="s2">i got very very involved in that spent</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">some years</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.120" end="00:05:12.479" style="s2">you know teaching and and designing and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">working in the field</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:16.880" style="s2">mainly doing contract work for designs</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:18.479" style="s2">for people</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.880" end="00:05:20.960" style="s2">yeah and so on and then doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.479" end="00:05:24.160" style="s2">permaculture pdc courses and</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.960" end="00:05:26.479" style="s2">yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.160" end="00:05:28.720" style="s2">of course as our experience grew and i</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.479" end="00:05:31.520" style="s2">you know i teamed up with other people</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.720" end="00:05:32.400" style="s2">and as our experience grew both on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.520" end="00:05:34.639" style="s2">teaching side</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.400" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">and on the consulting side you know we</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.639" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">were able to take on</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">larger and increasingly sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:43.600" style="s2">projects so we started out</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:45.840" style="s2">working you know people&#39;s backyards that</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.600" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">kind of stuff and small farms</p>

<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:21.680" style="s2">taking on larger and larger development</p>

<p begin="00:06:25.360" end="00:06:31.280" style="s2">i felt like i hit kind of a wall</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.039" end="00:06:32.560" style="s2">uh this is a very long-winded way of</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.280" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">sort of saying that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.560" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">interesting regenesis grew out of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.680" end="00:06:39.360" style="s2">two streams two schools of thought</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.560" end="00:06:42.639" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:44.960" style="s2">about what regeneration is and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.639" end="00:06:46.960" style="s2">uh so one of those schools of thought</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.960" end="00:06:50.639" style="s2">one of those streams of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.960" end="00:06:53.680" style="s2">came out of robert rodale&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.639" end="00:06:55.680" style="s2">and um and then especially</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.680" end="00:06:57.520" style="s2">bill mollison and to some extent people</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:06:58.319" style="s2">like fukuoka and so there was a whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.520" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.319" end="00:07:04.639" style="s2">of people around you know the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:08.680" style="s2">of human beings to live</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.639" end="00:07:11.599" style="s2">uh as um</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.680" end="00:07:14.160" style="s2">collaborators and</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.599" end="00:07:16.240" style="s2">uh and enablers of the potential of</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.160" end="00:07:18.720" style="s2">natural systems</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.240" end="00:07:20.880" style="s2">and that so that whole school of thought</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.720" end="00:07:23.199" style="s2">uh was working on regeneration mollison</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.880" end="00:07:26.800" style="s2">made the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.199" end="00:07:29.840" style="s2">degenerative generative and regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.800" end="00:07:32.319" style="s2">investments he um called it</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.840" end="00:07:33.919" style="s2">course robert rodale was really starting</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.319" end="00:07:34.560" style="s2">when he died he was right in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.919" end="00:07:37.039" style="s2">of a deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.560" end="00:07:39.199" style="s2">investigation into what is regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.039" end="00:07:42.000" style="s2">and what&#39;s it all about</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.199" end="00:07:42.720" style="s2">and um so that was very very influential</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.000" end="00:07:45.759" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.720" end="00:07:48.479" style="s2">you know when i was younger and uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.759" end="00:07:49.039" style="s2">but i kept sort of bumping up against a</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.479" end="00:07:51.759" style="s2">wall</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">and i couldn&#39;t quite figure out what it</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.759" end="00:07:55.520" style="s2">was but</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:59.360" style="s2">at the time the way i described it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.520" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">um we can unders we can understand</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.360" end="00:08:07.120" style="s2">how to design these complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:09.759" style="s2">biomimetic landscapes</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.120" end="00:08:10.720" style="s2">but the people that we&#39;re designing them</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.759" end="00:08:12.240" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.720" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">whether they&#39;re individuals or</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.240" end="00:08:17.440" style="s2">communities or institutions</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:20.080" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to live in them uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.440" end="00:08:22.800" style="s2">and so the wall i kept or there was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.080" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">wall or a ceiling maybe that i kept</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.800" end="00:08:27.199" style="s2">hitting up against was the capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:28.240" style="s2">the people that we were or the systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.199" end="00:08:31.520" style="s2">we were designing</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.240" end="00:08:33.440" style="s2">for and i realized that you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.520" end="00:08:35.039" style="s2">so my kind of default was well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.440" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2">just train them up in permaculture and</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.039" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">then they&#39;ll get it</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.000" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">but it wasn&#39;t working it wasn&#39;t enough</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">and as a result you know a fair number</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.399" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">of the projects that we designed</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:50.880" style="s2">either never adequately got implemented</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:52.800" style="s2">or they would be implemented but then</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.880" end="00:08:55.360" style="s2">people didn&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.800" end="00:08:56.080" style="s2">grow and evolve and change with them</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.360" end="00:08:57.839" style="s2">yeah i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.080" end="00:08:59.519" style="s2">the list of examples as you were</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.839" end="00:09:00.240" style="s2">describing this pattern i was just</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.519" end="00:09:03.200" style="s2">thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.240" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">um bedset in london where they tried</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.200" end="00:09:06.959" style="s2">this bedding zero emissions initiative</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:08.560" style="s2">urban eco village in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.959" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">london and they had it all planned out</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.560" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:13.040" style="s2">one planet living people involved in</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:15.680" style="s2">this this</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.040" end="00:09:18.000" style="s2">architect bill dunster and once people</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.680" end="00:09:19.600" style="s2">moved into these structures</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.000" end="00:09:21.680" style="s2">you could see that they hadn&#39;t thought</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.600" end="00:09:22.720" style="s2">of the social dimension of it on how to</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:25.440" style="s2">onboard people</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.720" end="00:09:26.080" style="s2">behaviorally and how to live in them and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.440" end="00:09:27.760" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.080" end="00:09:29.440" style="s2">some of it worked and some of it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.760" end="00:09:32.800" style="s2">work and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.440" end="00:09:36.160" style="s2">yeah i was i was really uh um</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.800" end="00:09:39.600" style="s2">absorbed in or really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.160" end="00:09:42.399" style="s2">a project in uh in california called</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.600" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">village homes that was also a real</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.399" end="00:09:46.880" style="s2">david yeah in previous yeah it was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:48.640" style="s2">pioneering project bill mollison was</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.880" end="00:09:50.080" style="s2">very enthusiastic about it</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.640" end="00:09:52.320" style="s2">and so you had a bunch of permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.080" end="00:09:54.000" style="s2">people associated with that back in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.320" end="00:09:57.200" style="s2">70s i guess</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.000" end="00:09:59.519" style="s2">and um it was the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.200" end="00:10:00.399" style="s2">right very sophisticated in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.519" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">land use</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.399" end="00:10:08.399" style="s2">and management of resources and solar</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:11.680" style="s2">design and layout of parking and so on</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.399" end="00:10:12.800" style="s2">but no not sophisticated enough about</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.680" end="00:10:16.160" style="s2">the design</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.800" end="00:10:19.200" style="s2">of the culture and governance process</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.160" end="00:10:22.240" style="s2">that would allow people to not only</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.200" end="00:10:23.040" style="s2">live harmoniously with this what was</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.240" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">built</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.040" end="00:10:27.120" style="s2">but to actually continue to evolve it</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.800" end="00:10:30.959" style="s2">and as a result it started really</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.120" end="00:10:34.320" style="s2">sometime in the i guess it was in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.959" end="00:10:35.760" style="s2">early 90s i went back there with a group</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.320" end="00:10:39.120" style="s2">to have a look at it i&#39;ve been so</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.760" end="00:10:42.240" style="s2">swept away by it when i first visited</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.120" end="00:10:45.120" style="s2">and it was really dispiriting um</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.240" end="00:10:47.360" style="s2">you know the way all of the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.120" end="00:10:50.000" style="s2">premises of the design</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.360" end="00:10:51.920" style="s2">were being slowly dismantled by you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.000" end="00:10:53.360" style="s2">second and third generation owners</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.920" end="00:10:55.440" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.360" end="00:10:57.200" style="s2">there was no culture to sustain it to</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.440" end="00:10:59.920" style="s2">evolve with it</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.200" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">so that it was that was the problem the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.920" end="00:11:04.399" style="s2">way i was seeing it</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.360" end="00:11:05.920" style="s2">at the time and in the middle of all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.399" end="00:11:09.519" style="s2">this i met up with</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.920" end="00:11:12.000" style="s2">bob pamela mang who had been deeply</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.519" end="00:11:12.800" style="s2">uh immersed in another stream of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.000" end="00:11:15.600" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.800" end="00:11:16.399" style="s2">about regeneration that you alluded to</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.600" end="00:11:18.720" style="s2">earlier</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.399" end="00:11:19.680" style="s2">that had you know that has also been</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.720" end="00:11:23.440" style="s2">around since</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.680" end="00:11:26.160" style="s2">the late 50s really and it had its roots</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.440" end="00:11:26.720" style="s2">in the work of people like david baum</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.160" end="00:11:30.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.720" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">um jg bennett and people like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.240" end="00:11:35.519" style="s2">and they were interested in uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:37.200" style="s2">the application of regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:40.320" style="s2">principles to com</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.200" end="00:11:42.000" style="s2">to community culture organizational</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.320" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">design and development</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.000" end="00:11:45.920" style="s2">and they were part of a group that were</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:47.680" style="s2">one of the most pioneering</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.920" end="00:11:49.839" style="s2">networks of practitioners of</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.680" end="00:11:54.079" style="s2">organizational development back at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.839" end="00:11:54.079" style="s2">you know birth of that movement</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.399" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">studying with a guy named charlie crone</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.720" end="00:12:00.079" style="s2">who did really sophisticated work in</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:02.880" style="s2">some very large</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.079" end="00:12:04.720" style="s2">companies and when we met they</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.880" end="00:12:06.399" style="s2">immediately recognized that</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.720" end="00:12:07.839" style="s2">we were working on something that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.399" end="00:12:10.240" style="s2">missing in their work that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.839" end="00:12:12.160" style="s2">felt like if they needed it and we</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.240" end="00:12:13.600" style="s2">immediately recognized that they had</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.160" end="00:12:15.839" style="s2">something that we were missing</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.600" end="00:12:17.440" style="s2">which could address the ceiling that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.839" end="00:12:20.720" style="s2">kept bumping into</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.440" end="00:12:22.000" style="s2">and um after i don&#39;t know a couple years</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.720" end="00:12:24.399" style="s2">of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.000" end="00:12:25.279" style="s2">it and doing projects and trying things</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.399" end="00:12:27.200" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.279" end="00:12:28.800" style="s2">we decided to come together and form</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.200" end="00:12:32.480" style="s2">regenesis to see</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.800" end="00:12:36.320" style="s2">if we could um</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.480" end="00:12:37.120" style="s2">integrate or yeah create something new</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.320" end="00:12:38.880" style="s2">out of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:41.279" style="s2">bringing these two schools of thought</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.880" end="00:12:44.880" style="s2">together was it just</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.279" end="00:12:47.839" style="s2">simply coincident or the luck of</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.880" end="00:12:48.240" style="s2">um pamela also being in new mexico or</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.839" end="00:12:51.519" style="s2">did</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.240" end="00:12:54.240" style="s2">how did you actually meet</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.519" end="00:12:54.880" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of weird i i had been</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.240" end="00:12:57.920" style="s2">working</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.880" end="00:13:00.959" style="s2">i spent four years working on a really</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.920" end="00:13:04.320" style="s2">kind of massive project it was a</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:07.440" style="s2">it was like a retreat center but very</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.320" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">um exclusive retreat center</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.440" end="00:13:12.560" style="s2">um at the home of</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.800" end="00:13:13.839" style="s2">the former home of georgia o&#39;keeffe</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.560" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">actually when she lived the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.839" end="00:13:17.120" style="s2">last part of her life she she was in</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:20.240" style="s2">santa fe</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.120" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">and um pamela brought a group called the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.240" end="00:13:25.440" style="s2">world business academy there</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:25.839" style="s2">um that had all these kind of luminaries</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.440" end="00:13:28.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.839" end="00:13:29.360" style="s2">that&#39;s where we met and i took this</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.880" end="00:13:31.839" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.360" end="00:13:33.760" style="s2">of that she had brought there around and</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.839" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">exposed them to what we were doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.760" end="00:13:37.920" style="s2">and the underlying philosophy of it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.320" end="00:13:39.199" style="s2">you know sort of the whole systems</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.920" end="00:13:43.760" style="s2">thinking involved in</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.199" end="00:13:46.000" style="s2">you know a garden right and um</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.760" end="00:13:47.120" style="s2">we had very deliberately designed that</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.000" end="00:13:49.440" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.120" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">to have this effect it would you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.440" end="00:13:53.760" style="s2">the the retreat center hosted very high</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:56.160" style="s2">level conferences and gatherings</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.760" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">but in order to use it they had to agree</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.160" end="00:14:00.639" style="s2">to go out and walk the grounds with</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:02.560" style="s2">you know some member of the team that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.639" end="00:14:04.800" style="s2">was working there on the grounds</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.560" end="00:14:06.800" style="s2">so they could be exposed to living</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.800" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">systems thinking</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.800" end="00:14:13.199" style="s2">in practical application</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">and uh so i would take these groups</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.199" end="00:14:15.600" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:17.040" style="s2">and talk to them about how all of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.600" end="00:14:19.279" style="s2">things work together</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.040" end="00:14:20.560" style="s2">and after half an hour an hour they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.279" end="00:14:22.800" style="s2">just be like</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.560" end="00:14:25.360" style="s2">lit up ecstatic because they could</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.800" end="00:14:27.519" style="s2">immediately translate</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.360" end="00:14:29.120" style="s2">what was functioning as a metaphor for</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.519" end="00:14:32.240" style="s2">them right you know they could</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.120" end="00:14:34.000" style="s2">these practical applications in concrete</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.240" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">material terms they could see how it</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.000" end="00:14:41.040" style="s2">applied to whatever they were working on</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:44.639" style="s2">policy business transformation</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.040" end="00:14:47.680" style="s2">you know whatever cultural questions</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.639" end="00:14:50.240" style="s2">um and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.680" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">it was through that interaction that she</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.240" end="00:14:53.440" style="s2">said she invited me to dinner she said</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.000" end="00:14:56.800" style="s2">wow that was really cool</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.440" end="00:14:58.800" style="s2">come meet my husband we hit it off i</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.800" end="00:15:00.720" style="s2">introduced them to my colleagues and</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.800" end="00:15:01.920" style="s2">you know like i said over a couple year</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:04.000" style="s2">period</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.920" end="00:15:05.519" style="s2">they attended permaculture courses to</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.000" end="00:15:08.399" style="s2">find out what we were doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.519" end="00:15:10.320" style="s2">and um by the end of it we had decided</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.399" end="00:15:13.360" style="s2">to form regenesis</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.320" end="00:15:16.880" style="s2">and and we at that point like you you</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:17.920" style="s2">we was um your outfit with joe glansberg</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.880" end="00:15:19.519" style="s2">or the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.920" end="00:15:22.000" style="s2">still the permaculture drylands</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.519" end="00:15:22.000" style="s2">institute</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.639" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">well i was still very involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.839" end="00:15:30.079" style="s2">um joel was also a faculty member for</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:31.120" style="s2">the institute he had his own little</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.079" end="00:15:34.880" style="s2">institute going</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.120" end="00:15:35.839" style="s2">out at one of the native american</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.880" end="00:15:39.199" style="s2">pueblos</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.839" end="00:15:41.199" style="s2">nearby so he was pursuing his own line</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.199" end="00:15:45.040" style="s2">of work he was primarily interested</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.199" end="00:15:45.839" style="s2">in kind of agricultural application and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.040" end="00:15:48.399" style="s2">especially</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.839" end="00:15:50.399" style="s2">in indigenous communities right so that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.399" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">was that had been his focus</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.399" end="00:15:54.079" style="s2">whereas we were trying to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:15:56.639" style="s2">to influence we meaning tim</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.079" end="00:15:58.240" style="s2">and and i and several other colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.639" end="00:16:01.680" style="s2">were trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.240" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">shift development patterns um</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.680" end="00:16:05.680" style="s2">we weren&#39;t so much working on urban</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:06.639" style="s2">systems at that point it was more like</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.680" end="00:16:08.240" style="s2">suburban</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.639" end="00:16:09.920" style="s2">or village development that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.240" end="00:16:13.279" style="s2">thing and</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.920" end="00:16:14.399" style="s2">um but we we continued to work together</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.279" end="00:16:16.800" style="s2">through the auspices</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.399" end="00:16:18.639" style="s2">of being friends and being in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.800" end="00:16:21.759" style="s2">permaculture drylands institute</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.639" end="00:16:24.079" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t until we formed regenesis that</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.759" end="00:16:26.480" style="s2">it sort of pulled us all back together</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.079" end="00:16:30.160" style="s2">under one roof</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.480" end="00:16:32.079" style="s2">bringing you know 10 15 years of</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.160" end="00:16:34.560" style="s2">experience from these</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.079" end="00:16:35.759" style="s2">different specialties we&#39;d all gone out</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.560" end="00:16:37.040" style="s2">and tested</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.759" end="00:16:39.519" style="s2">in terms of the application of</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.040" end="00:16:42.240" style="s2">permaculture or the application of this</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.519" end="00:16:45.279" style="s2">regenerative thinking in organizations</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.240" end="00:16:47.759" style="s2">and when we came together we had</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.279" end="00:16:48.800" style="s2">huge ambitions about really shifting the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.759" end="00:16:52.160" style="s2">paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.800" end="00:16:53.040" style="s2">with regard to development users</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.160" end="00:16:54.959" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.040" end="00:16:56.240" style="s2">said okay what are we going to work on</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.959" end="00:16:57.920" style="s2">and then looked at the development</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.240" end="00:17:01.040" style="s2">sector and then actually went out</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.920" end="00:17:01.360" style="s2">to pursue developers to work with you on</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.040" end="00:17:04.000" style="s2">new</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.360" end="00:17:05.439" style="s2">projects yeah i mean it made sense that</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.000" end="00:17:08.480" style="s2">had been our field</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.439" end="00:17:11.120" style="s2">right uh was land land use the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.480" end="00:17:11.919" style="s2">even bob uh although he&#39;s part of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.120" end="00:17:14.959" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.919" end="00:17:15.280" style="s2">his primary focus had been first of all</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.959" end="00:17:18.160" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.280" end="00:17:20.000" style="s2">land development and secondly working at</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.160" end="00:17:22.400" style="s2">very large scales on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.000" end="00:17:23.120" style="s2">impact of development and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.400" end="00:17:26.240" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.120" end="00:17:29.440" style="s2">governing structures and systems</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.240" end="00:17:32.080" style="s2">to manage development kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.440" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">at urban and larger scales so that was</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:36.720" style="s2">beneficial and not destructive</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:38.559" style="s2">and i just as you were speaking because</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.720" end="00:17:41.280" style="s2">all of this is happening in new mexico</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.559" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">um on not all of it but you you meeting</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.280" end="00:17:44.799" style="s2">i just suddenly thought</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:47.280" style="s2">what have the overlaps been over the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.799" end="00:17:50.240" style="s2">years with the the sort of tribe that</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.280" end="00:17:50.640" style="s2">is stewarding the pioneers and and also</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.240" end="00:17:52.720" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.640" end="00:17:53.919" style="s2">when they did their dreaming new mexico</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.720" end="00:17:56.559" style="s2">projects um</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.919" end="00:17:57.760" style="s2">in the and was it um actually that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.559" end="00:18:01.039" style="s2">that&#39;s much more recent</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.760" end="00:18:04.240" style="s2">um yeah that was the early 2000s i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.039" end="00:18:06.799" style="s2">yeah so we were always</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.240" end="00:18:08.320" style="s2">friendly with those guys and we actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:11.360" style="s2">did some work</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.320" end="00:18:12.880" style="s2">uh we did a story of place process with</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.360" end="00:18:16.559" style="s2">them on their property</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.880" end="00:18:18.559" style="s2">outside of santa fe and over the years</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.559" end="00:18:20.240" style="s2">you know a number of us have spoken at</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.559" end="00:18:23.919" style="s2">the big bioneers conferences</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.240" end="00:18:24.559" style="s2">and so on um and then when they put</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.919" end="00:18:28.320" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.559" end="00:18:31.520" style="s2">the um dreaming new mexico project</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.320" end="00:18:33.840" style="s2">uh we hosted that actually we</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.520" end="00:18:36.000" style="s2">they they set up an office inside we had</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.840" end="00:18:37.760" style="s2">a kind of complex of offices</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.000" end="00:18:39.520" style="s2">where a bunch of different you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.760" end="00:18:42.400" style="s2">of like-minded organizations</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.520" end="00:18:44.559" style="s2">shared the space together and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.400" end="00:18:47.679" style="s2">dreaming new mexico set up its offices</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.559" end="00:18:49.200" style="s2">inside of our little complex and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.679" end="00:18:50.080" style="s2">worked with them on it quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.200" end="00:18:52.280" style="s2">especially</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.080" end="00:18:54.840" style="s2">in the initial stages you know around</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.280" end="00:18:58.240" style="s2">conceptualization</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.840" end="00:19:02.720" style="s2">um so yeah there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.240" end="00:19:05.440" style="s2">there was a lot of kind of cross</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.720" end="00:19:06.720" style="s2">fertilization and interaction in those</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.440" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">early years</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.720" end="00:19:10.799" style="s2">at some point regenesis became much more</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:13.520" style="s2">global</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.799" end="00:19:15.440" style="s2">in its you know once we&#39;d really</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.520" end="00:19:17.679" style="s2">established ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.440" end="00:19:18.960" style="s2">uh we started getting called to do work</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.679" end="00:19:22.240" style="s2">all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.960" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">and um and so santa fe</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.240" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">and it had always been difficult to set</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:26.240" style="s2">you know profit in his hometown kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:29.520" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.240" end="00:19:30.240" style="s2">it had always been difficult to find</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.520" end="00:19:34.880" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.240" end="00:19:37.520" style="s2">uh or to be um what taken seriously</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.880" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">here in our own backyard it&#39;s partly new</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.520" end="00:19:42.720" style="s2">mexico is very very poor</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">and um and so there&#39;s just not all that</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.720" end="00:19:46.880" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:48.480" style="s2">opportunity um so we we took a stab at</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.880" end="00:19:50.320" style="s2">it i mean we worked in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.480" end="00:19:52.720" style="s2">institutions and continue to work in</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.320" end="00:19:55.679" style="s2">institutions in new mexico but</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.720" end="00:19:56.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a slow process from like in order</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.679" end="00:20:01.120" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.000" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">for me to get a more profitable sense of</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.120" end="00:20:04.640" style="s2">a large client in that like as you were</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.919" end="00:20:08.080" style="s2">beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.640" end="00:20:10.720" style="s2">find work all over the world and like</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.080" end="00:20:12.159" style="s2">every time i&#39;ve looked into some of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.720" end="00:20:14.320" style="s2">case studies or the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.159" end="00:20:15.760" style="s2">the projects that you that you speak</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.320" end="00:20:18.400" style="s2">about when you explain</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.760" end="00:20:19.200" style="s2">how to work regeneratively in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.400" end="00:20:21.200" style="s2">regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.200" end="00:20:22.640" style="s2">practitioner program for example or in</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.200" end="00:20:26.720" style="s2">your book with pamela</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.640" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">and it always feels like</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.720" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">they&#39;re quite long-term large projects</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.240" end="00:20:37.039" style="s2">that require a level of buy-in</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:40.159" style="s2">by some form of client</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.039" end="00:20:44.400" style="s2">the developer or the wider community</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.159" end="00:20:47.039" style="s2">that isn&#39;t in itself so easily come by</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.400" end="00:20:49.200" style="s2">how do you make that engagement and are</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.039" end="00:20:51.679" style="s2">all these projects projects where</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.200" end="00:20:53.039" style="s2">we&#39;re really from the outset people say</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.679" end="00:20:54.720" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be with you for at least</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.039" end="00:20:56.240" style="s2">two years or two and a half three years</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.720" end="00:20:58.400" style="s2">and this is a process</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.240" end="00:20:59.440" style="s2">and you better be ready for it and sign</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.400" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">the dotted line</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.440" end="00:21:05.520" style="s2">that that we&#39;re committed to this or</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:07.360" style="s2">have they also been kind of like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.520" end="00:21:08.080" style="s2">just engage and see where this is going</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.360" end="00:21:11.280" style="s2">type of pro</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.080" end="00:21:12.799" style="s2">approaches some of some some all of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.280" end="00:21:14.559" style="s2">above</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.799" end="00:21:16.400" style="s2">and you know obviously we started out</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:20.320" style="s2">doing tiny projects i mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.400" end="00:21:22.640" style="s2">i started out as like a little gardener</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.320" end="00:21:25.039" style="s2">and sort of built it over a very long</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.640" end="00:21:27.360" style="s2">period of time</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.039" end="00:21:29.520" style="s2">and that in itself i think may be</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.360" end="00:21:32.559" style="s2">relevant because</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.520" end="00:21:36.799" style="s2">because we were working from a</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.559" end="00:21:38.240" style="s2">um a technology a fairly sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.799" end="00:21:41.600" style="s2">set of principles</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.240" end="00:21:42.320" style="s2">frameworks ways of thinking what i could</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.600" end="00:21:45.120" style="s2">learn</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.320" end="00:21:45.919" style="s2">on a very small scale then could be</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.120" end="00:21:47.919" style="s2">applied</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.919" end="00:21:49.120" style="s2">you know as i took on more and more</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.919" end="00:21:51.840" style="s2">ambitious</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.120" end="00:21:52.559" style="s2">uh more and more complex projects right</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.840" end="00:21:56.320" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.559" end="00:21:59.360" style="s2">the same underlying principles and</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.320" end="00:22:00.640" style="s2">ways of thinking applied just the</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.360" end="00:22:03.039" style="s2">complexity grew</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.640" end="00:22:04.799" style="s2">right what you had to be able to embrace</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.039" end="00:22:06.400" style="s2">and understand got more and more</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.799" end="00:22:12.159" style="s2">difficult to hold</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.400" end="00:22:13.280" style="s2">and so we had to grow into that um it</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.159" end="00:22:15.919" style="s2">with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.280" end="00:22:18.080" style="s2">your ques it&#39;s a it&#39;s a kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.919" end="00:22:18.640" style="s2">insider&#39;s question daniel this thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.080" end="00:22:21.520" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.640" end="00:22:22.000" style="s2">how do you how do you engage somebody</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.520" end="00:22:25.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.000" end="00:22:27.280" style="s2">ideally you engage with them um</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.360" end="00:22:28.480" style="s2">with full consciousness of what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.280" end="00:22:30.880" style="s2">getting into</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.480" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">right they may not know what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.880" end="00:22:33.440" style="s2">going to happen or how it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.559" end="00:22:35.440" style="s2">work but they</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.440" end="00:22:37.280" style="s2">they do need to know that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.440" end="00:22:40.559" style="s2">developmental process</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.280" end="00:22:42.799" style="s2">if it&#39;s to um realize all of its</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.559" end="00:22:46.240" style="s2">potential</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.799" end="00:22:47.120" style="s2">and um but does doesn&#39;t that mean that</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.240" end="00:22:49.440" style="s2">you very</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.120" end="00:22:50.320" style="s2">like precisely because we live in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.440" end="00:22:53.640" style="s2">culture that</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.320" end="00:22:54.799" style="s2">that tends to kind of be very</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.640" end="00:22:57.520" style="s2">solutioneering</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.799" end="00:22:59.039" style="s2">and and and problem solution</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.520" end="00:23:02.799" style="s2">implementation</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.039" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">focused um when you then say okay no we</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.799" end="00:23:06.559" style="s2">we really want to do a series of</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:08.159" style="s2">interviews and really get close to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.559" end="00:23:09.600" style="s2">story of place through different</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.159" end="00:23:11.840" style="s2">perspectives of people</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.600" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">involved in this area and and then begin</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.840" end="00:23:14.559" style="s2">a process of</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:17.600" style="s2">mirroring back to them what you&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.559" end="00:23:18.320" style="s2">them speak to about the place to to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.600" end="00:23:22.400" style="s2">closer to</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.320" end="00:23:23.200" style="s2">to a a shared access to the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.400" end="00:23:24.799" style="s2">essence of</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.200" end="00:23:26.480" style="s2">of what what what are you actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.799" end="00:23:29.360" style="s2">working with um</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.480" end="00:23:30.559" style="s2">isn&#39;t isn&#39;t that very often than quite a</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.360" end="00:23:32.559" style="s2">tension with a</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.559" end="00:23:33.760" style="s2">client like a developer of saying well</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.559" end="00:23:36.640" style="s2">we just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.760" end="00:23:38.000" style="s2">build 400 units and we have problems</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.640" end="00:23:39.440" style="s2">with these guys who are saying</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.000" end="00:23:41.200" style="s2">that it&#39;s a wetland that we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.440" end="00:23:43.520" style="s2">touch um</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.200" end="00:23:44.720" style="s2">and we just want to resolve that issue</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.520" end="00:23:46.799" style="s2">and like how</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.720" end="00:23:47.919" style="s2">how do you dance with that is that me</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.799" end="00:23:49.600" style="s2">projecting something into it that</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.919" end="00:23:53.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.600" end="00:23:56.400" style="s2">oh no it happens all the time and um</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.200" end="00:23:59.200" style="s2">to some extent i think as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.400" end="00:24:00.400" style="s2">matured right and gotten clearer and</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.200" end="00:24:02.159" style="s2">clearer about what</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.400" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">we we had to invent this as we went</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.159" end="00:24:06.559" style="s2">along i couldn&#39;t speak</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:07.030" style="s2">with this level of confidence 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.559" end="00:24:08.320" style="s2">ago</p>

<p begin="00:24:08.320" end="00:24:12.320" style="s2">so we went out and made every mistake</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.320" end="00:24:13.440" style="s2">you can make and learn from them and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.320" end="00:24:16.159" style="s2">know had</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.440" end="00:24:16.559" style="s2">some successes and some i don&#39;t know if</p>

<p begin="00:24:16.559" end="00:24:22.240" style="s2">ever failures because everyone learns</p>

<p begin="00:24:23.679" end="00:24:32.240" style="s2">but more and more</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.880" end="00:24:35.679" style="s2">uh one it&#39;s like you can begin to</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.240" end="00:24:39.440" style="s2">discern who has</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.679" end="00:24:42.720" style="s2">the readiness if you will</p>

<p begin="00:25:00.799" end="00:25:05.360" style="s2">to want to pursue you know they have</p>

<p begin="00:25:07.039" end="00:25:12.159" style="s2">right it&#39;s the people who have really</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.080" end="00:25:13.679" style="s2">dedicated their lives to the work so</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.159" end="00:25:14.320" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re continually in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.679" end="00:25:16.720" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.320" end="00:25:18.799" style="s2">of working on creating better and more</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.720" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">successful projects they&#39;re the ones</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.799" end="00:25:22.400" style="s2">where you have the potential to learn</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">with them so any individual project</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.400" end="00:25:25.679" style="s2">no project is ever going to be perfect</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:28.080" style="s2">there is no such</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.679" end="00:25:29.039" style="s2">thing as perfect but every project can</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.080" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.039" end="00:25:33.200" style="s2">an opportunity to move up to the next</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:36.400" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.200" end="00:25:37.840" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.400" end="00:25:39.279" style="s2">so that&#39;s one way of answering a</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.840" end="00:25:40.000" style="s2">question another way of answering a</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.279" end="00:25:42.720" style="s2">question is</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.000" end="00:25:45.039" style="s2">we would not have gotten off the ground</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.720" end="00:25:48.080" style="s2">if this were not incredibly effective</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.039" end="00:25:51.760" style="s2">as a way to create successful projects</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.080" end="00:25:53.200" style="s2">and um often the effectiveness is kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.760" end="00:25:56.880" style="s2">of indirect</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.200" end="00:25:58.240" style="s2">so for example um one of the core things</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.880" end="00:26:01.120" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.240" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">articulate now i&#39;m speaking strictly in</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.120" end="00:26:06.159" style="s2">the arena of</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:06.159" style="s2">land development at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.039" end="00:26:14.080" style="s2">land development is uh has become</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.159" end="00:26:16.720" style="s2">a really um i don&#39;t know degraded</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.080" end="00:26:18.400" style="s2">profession uh it&#39;s highly for the most</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.720" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">part it&#39;s highly degenerate it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.400" end="00:26:22.720" style="s2">very destructive</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:26.240" style="s2">practice and for on for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.720" end="00:26:27.440" style="s2">and so people for good reason often are</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.240" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">really resistant</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.440" end="00:26:31.840" style="s2">when a developer wants to come in and</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:35.200" style="s2">like do their fabulous</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.840" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">shiny whatever it is subdivision</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.200" end="00:26:42.080" style="s2">or office tower and</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:45.120" style="s2">uh so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.080" end="00:26:47.279" style="s2">they are faced with is how do we engage</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.120" end="00:26:48.799" style="s2">a community that&#39;s resistant to what we</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.279" end="00:26:50.720" style="s2">want to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.799" end="00:26:52.880" style="s2">in a way that they will embrace it</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.720" end="00:26:55.200" style="s2">because if they embrace it the project</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.880" end="00:26:56.559" style="s2">for multiple reasons project&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.200" end="00:26:59.360" style="s2">likely to be successful</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.559" end="00:27:00.559" style="s2">right you&#39;ve got kind of a welcoming</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.360" end="00:27:03.679" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.559" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">um you have a willingness to work with</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.679" end="00:27:07.679" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.720" end="00:27:08.640" style="s2">with the developer around approvals and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.679" end="00:27:11.679" style="s2">all of that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.640" end="00:27:13.679" style="s2">and that those are the biggest risks and</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.679" end="00:27:15.039" style="s2">hurdles for a developer</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.679" end="00:27:16.799" style="s2">is you know am i going to get the</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.039" end="00:27:18.640" style="s2">entitlement am i going to be approved to</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.799" end="00:27:22.080" style="s2">do this project</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.640" end="00:27:25.840" style="s2">uh in in something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.080" end="00:27:28.960" style="s2">more or less likely to be viable and</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.840" end="00:27:31.600" style="s2">uh the key to all of this</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.960" end="00:27:32.960" style="s2">is that for a developer to successful</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.600" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">this from our perspective</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.960" end="00:27:36.880" style="s2">for a developer to successfully engage a</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.600" end="00:27:38.720" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.880" end="00:27:40.799" style="s2">the developer needs to be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.720" end="00:27:44.480" style="s2">join with the community</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.799" end="00:27:46.399" style="s2">to achieve its larger aspirations</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.480" end="00:27:48.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s not about talking the community</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.399" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">into supporting me</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.080" end="00:27:53.919" style="s2">it&#39;s about joining with the community</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:55.039" style="s2">to help the community evolve to become</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.919" end="00:27:57.440" style="s2">more of what it</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.039" end="00:27:58.559" style="s2">wants and needs to be and that will</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.440" end="00:28:01.440" style="s2">always end up</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.559" end="00:28:04.320" style="s2">shaping what the project ends up being i</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.440" end="00:28:06.559" style="s2">mean it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.320" end="00:28:09.360" style="s2">wonderful and from from everything that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.559" end="00:28:11.520" style="s2">that i&#39;ve sort of been involved in</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.360" end="00:28:12.880" style="s2">i would like the thoughts that come up</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.520" end="00:28:15.440" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.880" end="00:28:17.840" style="s2">again there&#39;s a selection process of how</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.440" end="00:28:17.840" style="s2">do you</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:21.760" style="s2">as you engage the community you have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.799" end="00:28:23.440" style="s2">commit to</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.760" end="00:28:25.279" style="s2">what was most likely going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:25.840" style="s2">slower process because it is actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.279" end="00:28:28.159" style="s2">listening</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.840" end="00:28:29.360" style="s2">to place and sourced from place and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.159" end="00:28:32.480" style="s2">pattern by place</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.360" end="00:28:33.919" style="s2">and that takes time to engage in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.480" end="00:28:37.279" style="s2">certain process before you</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.919" end="00:28:39.679" style="s2">before you pull out the plans and</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.279" end="00:28:41.279" style="s2">or the willingness to to say we started</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.679" end="00:28:42.240" style="s2">with these plans and now that we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.279" end="00:28:43.919" style="s2">this process</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.240" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">we&#39;re actually going to despite the fact</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.919" end="00:28:47.120" style="s2">that we invested in having people work</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.840" end="00:28:50.240" style="s2">on these plans</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.120" end="00:28:50.720" style="s2">rip them up and draw new plans and all</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.240" end="00:28:53.120" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.720" end="00:28:54.240" style="s2">is ultimately making things a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.120" end="00:28:57.440" style="s2">expensive</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.240" end="00:29:00.080" style="s2">um in the short term probably has</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.440" end="00:29:02.240" style="s2">huge financial benefits in the long term</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.080" end="00:29:03.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s precisely that where most</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.240" end="00:29:06.640" style="s2">projects today</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.440" end="00:29:08.799" style="s2">have that have the difficulty connecting</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.640" end="00:29:09.679" style="s2">the systemic longer vision and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.799" end="00:29:12.159" style="s2">systemic</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.679" end="00:29:13.279" style="s2">positive impacts with the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.159" end="00:29:17.360" style="s2">with one or two</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.279" end="00:29:19.039" style="s2">clients that um that just</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.360" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">say like we have a pipeline and we want</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.039" end="00:29:25.679" style="s2">to get on to the next project um</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:27.360" style="s2">any kind of well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.679" end="00:29:29.840" style="s2">it&#39;s actually it turns out to be just</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.360" end="00:29:34.000" style="s2">the opposite that um</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:37.200" style="s2">that um by it&#39;s you know that</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.000" end="00:29:40.960" style="s2">truism that the japanese introduced</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:45.120" style="s2">around go slow to go fast um</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.960" end="00:29:47.919" style="s2">that the the more time you spend at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.120" end="00:29:48.880" style="s2">very before you ever actually put a</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.919" end="00:29:52.159" style="s2">drawing</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.880" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">down right the more time you spend</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.159" end="00:29:57.840" style="s2">understanding what this particular</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:29:58.640" style="s2">ecosystem landscape community is all</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.840" end="00:30:02.960" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.640" end="00:30:05.200" style="s2">right what uh what it&#39;s trying to become</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.960" end="00:30:06.960" style="s2">how our project could relate to that and</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.200" end="00:30:09.679" style="s2">then building relationships</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.960" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">in the community with you know people</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.679" end="00:30:15.520" style="s2">who are respected in the community</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.600" end="00:30:18.080" style="s2">around you know this project being an</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.520" end="00:30:20.480" style="s2">investment in the community the faster</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.080" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">the whole process goes</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.480" end="00:30:25.679" style="s2">it really it can cut years off of</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:27.039" style="s2">years and just countless amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.679" end="00:30:29.200" style="s2">litigation</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.039" end="00:30:30.960" style="s2">uh off of a process and we&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.200" end="00:30:34.559" style="s2">over and over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.960" end="00:30:36.000" style="s2">uh and it it takes a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.559" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">sophistication on the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.000" end="00:30:39.919" style="s2">developer to understand this</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">right the shift from doing a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.919" end="00:30:45.440" style="s2">linear process</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:48.480" style="s2">that&#39;s about basically um</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.440" end="00:30:51.520" style="s2">manipulating public opinion</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.480" end="00:30:54.799" style="s2">trying to manage the you know manage the</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.520" end="00:30:56.640" style="s2">approvals process and so on uh versus</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.799" end="00:31:00.080" style="s2">actually engaging</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.640" end="00:31:02.440" style="s2">with the community to become um</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.080" end="00:31:04.720" style="s2">you know a trusted investor in that</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.440" end="00:31:07.200" style="s2">community uh and that</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.720" end="00:31:09.360" style="s2">you know bill love bill reid loves</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.200" end="00:31:11.360" style="s2">telling the story about a huge project</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.360" end="00:31:13.679" style="s2">that we were working on down in</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.360" end="00:31:15.519" style="s2">vina del mar in chile where they were</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.679" end="00:31:17.679" style="s2">looking at a minimum</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.519" end="00:31:20.480" style="s2">of 10 years being tied up in the courts</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.679" end="00:31:24.159" style="s2">with a high likelihood of the project</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.480" end="00:31:26.080" style="s2">it was such a big um impactful project</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.159" end="00:31:28.640" style="s2">of the project being</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.080" end="00:31:30.399" style="s2">disallowed at the end of that years and</p>

<p begin="00:31:42.799" end="00:31:47.760" style="s2">so 10 years of litigation with a high</p>

<p begin="00:31:47.760" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">two weeks of community engagement which</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.679" end="00:31:55.120" style="s2">required the developer</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">to say okay we&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.120" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">we&#39;re willing to actually engage meaning</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:02.559" style="s2">this is not about you know window</p>

<p begin="00:32:10.880" end="00:32:15.120" style="s2">the deeper reason we want to develop</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.720" end="00:32:16.720" style="s2">this project is to bring life back to</p>

<p begin="00:32:16.720" end="00:32:22.559" style="s2">and that we need to work with you and we</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.200" end="00:32:26.960" style="s2">need to build relationships of trust</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.080" end="00:32:36.240" style="s2">for the um communities surrounding this</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.200" end="00:32:40.240" style="s2">massive project</p>

<p begin="00:32:40.240" end="00:32:45.200" style="s2">earlier you spoke about these two</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.840" end="00:32:48.320" style="s2">streams um coming together and you then</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.200" end="00:32:50.000" style="s2">forming regenesis how did your work</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.320" end="00:32:51.600" style="s2">since you were mainly in one of those</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.000" end="00:32:54.880" style="s2">two streams how did your work</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.600" end="00:32:58.640" style="s2">change once the pieces that pamela</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.880" end="00:33:03.360" style="s2">um and and folks brought in were added</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.640" end="00:33:03.360" style="s2">um what what transformed yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:12.480" style="s2">so i said that um we</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.039" end="00:33:15.039" style="s2">kept bumping into the ceiling where the</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.480" end="00:33:17.679" style="s2">the client group whatever it was the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.039" end="00:33:19.900" style="s2">system that we were designing for</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.679" end="00:33:21.360" style="s2">uh wasn&#39;t able to</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.900" end="00:33:24.399" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.360" end="00:33:24.960" style="s2">absorb and work with the designs the</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.399" end="00:33:26.799" style="s2">actual</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.960" end="00:33:28.399" style="s2">functioning designs that we were giving</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.799" end="00:33:30.720" style="s2">them and</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.399" end="00:33:30.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.760" end="00:33:39.679" style="s2">over time what i came to realize</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.000" end="00:33:42.080" style="s2">is that uh the core thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.679" end="00:33:45.039" style="s2">that needed to be worked on was the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.080" end="00:33:45.039" style="s2">people were thinking</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.679" end="00:33:53.519" style="s2">um that it uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.600" end="00:33:56.799" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t about any particular topic</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.519" end="00:33:58.240" style="s2">any particular project any particular</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.799" end="00:34:00.559" style="s2">problem or issue that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.240" end="00:34:02.000" style="s2">people were trying to address that it</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.559" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">had to do with</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.000" end="00:34:09.040" style="s2">the way the basic structure of the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:12.240" style="s2">they were thinking uh and that that was</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.040" end="00:34:13.119" style="s2">if we wanted to move we went into land</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.240" end="00:34:14.879" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.119" end="00:34:16.639" style="s2">because we saw it having an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.879" end="00:34:16.960" style="s2">impact on the planet and that if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.639" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.960" end="00:34:22.960" style="s2">move the dial with regard to that</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:25.440" style="s2">it could you know it could really make a</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.960" end="00:34:25.440" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.839" end="00:34:32.879" style="s2">but over the over the years i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.520" end="00:34:35.040" style="s2">become increasingly aware that where you</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.879" end="00:34:37.359" style="s2">move the dial is in the way people are</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.040" end="00:34:40.800" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.359" end="00:34:43.440" style="s2">and so that and the idea is to build</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.800" end="00:34:47.280" style="s2">capacity in people&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.440" end="00:34:48.000" style="s2">everybody&#39;s thinking so that the choices</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.280" end="00:34:50.000" style="s2">that we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.000" end="00:34:52.079" style="s2">individually and collectively are</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.000" end="00:34:53.520" style="s2">choices that are regenerative that are</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.079" end="00:34:59.119" style="s2">harmonious</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.520" end="00:34:59.119" style="s2">with you know with the planet with place</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.839" end="00:35:05.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.079" end="00:35:06.480" style="s2">one of the things that was invisible to</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.760" end="00:35:08.560" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.480" end="00:35:10.800" style="s2">when i was practicing permaculture and</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.560" end="00:35:13.280" style="s2">it&#39;s taken a long time for me to realize</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.800" end="00:35:16.000" style="s2">is that the reason that was so difficult</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:19.200" style="s2">to do from within the permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.000" end="00:35:22.880" style="s2">kind of milieu was that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.200" end="00:35:26.400" style="s2">uh functional in its orientation</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.880" end="00:35:27.760" style="s2">right the and that&#39;s the way mollison</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.400" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">characterized it he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.760" end="00:35:32.320" style="s2">functional landscapes</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">meaning as opposed to dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.320" end="00:35:35.359" style="s2">landscapes right</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:38.960" style="s2">landscapes that have been robbed of</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.359" end="00:35:42.000" style="s2">their ability to function</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.960" end="00:35:44.400" style="s2">and uh there was always some sense that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.000" end="00:35:46.480" style="s2">we needed to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.400" end="00:35:47.440" style="s2">the social and cultural systems around</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.480" end="00:35:49.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.440" end="00:35:51.520" style="s2">but there wasn&#39;t a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.200" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">understanding of how to work on that</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.520" end="00:35:54.720" style="s2">right other than let&#39;s see if we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.000" end="00:35:56.000" style="s2">apply</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.720" end="00:35:58.079" style="s2">these functional things that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.000" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">learned about designing landscapes to</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.079" end="00:36:02.800" style="s2">functionally designing community</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:06.000" style="s2">governance or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.800" end="00:36:08.400" style="s2">and by leaving</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.000" end="00:36:09.200" style="s2">by focusing on function what gets left</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.400" end="00:36:12.800" style="s2">out in there</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.200" end="00:36:16.880" style="s2">is the sense of being and of will right</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.800" end="00:36:20.640" style="s2">how do you actually cultivate or awaken</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.880" end="00:36:20.640" style="s2">collective will political will</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.200" end="00:36:25.119" style="s2">you know if the this kind of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.119" end="00:36:28.400" style="s2">behind your question earlier if the will</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.119" end="00:36:31.440" style="s2">isn&#39;t present you know it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.400" end="00:36:33.680" style="s2">how great my design is</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.440" end="00:36:35.040" style="s2">you know if the developer does not have</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.680" end="00:36:38.400" style="s2">the will</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.040" end="00:36:40.640" style="s2">to transform the way they are thinking</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.400" end="00:36:42.720" style="s2">and working</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.640" end="00:36:43.839" style="s2">we can give them great ideas till the</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.720" end="00:36:47.839" style="s2">cows come home</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.839" end="00:36:47.839" style="s2">it won&#39;t ultimately make any difference</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.160" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">and if people aren&#39;t able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.920" end="00:36:57.920" style="s2">kind of manage their own thinking</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:37:00.400" style="s2">right and see that as a critical place</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.920" end="00:37:02.160" style="s2">to intervene in the system</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.400" end="00:37:03.680" style="s2">you remember danella meadows and</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.160" end="00:37:07.839" style="s2">paradigms right</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.680" end="00:37:10.000" style="s2">that um that if if we don&#39;t develop the</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.839" end="00:37:14.160" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.000" end="00:37:17.280" style="s2">of a community to like pause reflect</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.160" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">right and make better choices</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.280" end="00:37:23.520" style="s2">um you get</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.800" end="00:37:27.119" style="s2">things like the current response to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.520" end="00:37:29.359" style="s2">pandemic going on here in the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.119" end="00:37:29.359" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.400" end="00:37:40.720" style="s2">that i don&#39;t want to make an</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.440" end="00:37:41.359" style="s2">artificial uh or false distinction</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.720" end="00:37:45.599" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.359" end="00:37:47.520" style="s2">doing and being or at taking action</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.599" end="00:37:49.359" style="s2">functional action and thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.520" end="00:37:52.720" style="s2">right the two are seamless</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.359" end="00:37:55.839" style="s2">right uh what i&#39;m what i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.720" end="00:37:59.040" style="s2">is that if we want to really transform</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.839" end="00:38:00.000" style="s2">the way we&#39;re working and inhabiting the</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.040" end="00:38:02.240" style="s2">planet</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.000" end="00:38:04.000" style="s2">we need to become more intelligent about</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.240" end="00:38:04.880" style="s2">the actions that we take</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.000" end="00:38:06.400" style="s2">there are a lot of people that are</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.880" end="00:38:08.400" style="s2">really gung-ho about going out and</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.400" end="00:38:11.839" style="s2">taking actions to</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.400" end="00:38:15.599" style="s2">um to fix all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.839" end="00:38:16.320" style="s2">problems clean up plastic waste in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.599" end="00:38:19.119" style="s2">oceans</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.320" end="00:38:20.720" style="s2">and you know change transportation</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.119" end="00:38:21.760" style="s2">networks and all of that stuff it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.720" end="00:38:25.359" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.760" end="00:38:27.680" style="s2">right uh how do we use every action that</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.359" end="00:38:31.200" style="s2">we take to build our intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:33.119" style="s2">about systemic interventions</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.200" end="00:38:34.560" style="s2">and in in that case because one one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.119" end="00:38:35.599" style="s2">the things that i found a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.560" end="00:38:38.320" style="s2">resident</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.599" end="00:38:40.320" style="s2">or resonance with when when digging</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.320" end="00:38:44.880" style="s2">deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.320" end="00:38:44.880" style="s2">the regenesis work um is</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.280" end="00:38:48.720" style="s2">your conception of nested wholeness and</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.240" end="00:38:51.359" style="s2">and</p>

<p begin="00:38:51.359" end="00:38:55.119" style="s2">in front of me but place</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.960" end="00:38:57.359" style="s2">being fractal in a way that whatever i</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.119" end="00:39:00.160" style="s2">do to the place in front of me</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.359" end="00:39:00.800" style="s2">also affects the the entire nested</p>

<p begin="00:39:00.800" end="00:39:05.119" style="s2">so it affects the planet and then i just</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.920" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">recently watched</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.119" end="00:39:11.760" style="s2">um a presentation that you gave in in um</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.560" end="00:39:13.920" style="s2">i think denver colorado in 2017 and</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.760" end="00:39:15.040" style="s2">we actually spoke to the fact that this</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.920" end="00:39:18.400" style="s2">nestedness</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.040" end="00:39:20.400" style="s2">is why working regener</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.400" end="00:39:22.320" style="s2">regeneratively even at the small scale</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.400" end="00:39:25.680" style="s2">with a small group of people in a small</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.320" end="00:39:30.079" style="s2">project has efficacy</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.680" end="00:39:35.119" style="s2">or agency um beyond that little project</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.079" end="00:39:35.119" style="s2">um how would you</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.359" end="00:39:39.760" style="s2">like in in terms of advising people what</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.960" end="00:39:44.320" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.760" end="00:39:44.320" style="s2">like is there a scale at which</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.560" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">things get too complicated and too messy</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.119" end="00:39:50.480" style="s2">to really have</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:52.079" style="s2">feedback on what you&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.480" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">therefore there is actually some</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.079" end="00:39:57.119" style="s2">like in order to to wisely stir</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:40:00.160" style="s2">into an evolving future that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.119" end="00:40:01.839" style="s2">uncertain um</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.160" end="00:40:03.280" style="s2">are we better off working at local and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.839" end="00:40:06.640" style="s2">regional scales because</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.280" end="00:40:07.520" style="s2">feedback is quicker um simply for that</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.640" end="00:40:10.480" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.520" end="00:40:13.440" style="s2">or um or do you think it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.480" end="00:40:13.440" style="s2">possible to have</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.520" end="00:40:18.000" style="s2">this approach apply at all scales of</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.400" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">that nested wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.000" end="00:40:21.040" style="s2">it approaches it it applies at all</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:24.319" style="s2">scales</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.040" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">um so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.319" end="00:40:30.000" style="s2">it&#39;s almost the right question but not</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:31.280" style="s2">quite let me see if i can reframe it</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.000" end="00:40:33.599" style="s2">slightly</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.280" end="00:40:33.599" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.319" end="00:40:40.400" style="s2">so you&#39;re right that the issue is</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.079" end="00:40:43.200" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.400" end="00:40:44.160" style="s2">but the reason it&#39;s an issue is because</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.200" end="00:40:47.760" style="s2">of our ability</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.160" end="00:40:47.760" style="s2">to manage complexity</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.079" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">uh and so uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.359" end="00:40:59.119" style="s2">there it there are</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:41:02.480" style="s2">one of the reasons that we&#39;ve focused</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.119" end="00:41:05.760" style="s2">from the very beginning on place</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.480" end="00:41:07.760" style="s2">is it was a scale of system</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.760" end="00:41:08.960" style="s2">that was complex enough that you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.760" end="00:41:12.000" style="s2">work systemically</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.960" end="00:41:15.839" style="s2">i mean and have huge systemic</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.000" end="00:41:18.160" style="s2">consequences and yet it&#39;s small enough</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.839" end="00:41:19.040" style="s2">that people first of all can understand</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.160" end="00:41:21.920" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.040" end="00:41:23.359" style="s2">and more importantly they can relate to</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.920" end="00:41:25.520" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.359" end="00:41:27.040" style="s2">how would you define place then because</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.520" end="00:41:30.240" style="s2">place seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.040" end="00:41:33.520" style="s2">very different scales yeah it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.240" end="00:41:35.280" style="s2">everything&#39;s a place yeah right so</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.520" end="00:41:37.440" style="s2">planet earth happens to be a place</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.280" end="00:41:41.119" style="s2">within our solar system</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.440" end="00:41:46.640" style="s2">um and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.119" end="00:41:50.240" style="s2">we tend to think about plate</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.640" end="00:41:51.119" style="s2">it&#39;s a so we tend to work with this idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.240" end="00:41:54.160" style="s2">of place</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.119" end="00:41:56.400" style="s2">for most people in most contexts we work</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.160" end="00:41:58.960" style="s2">on it at a kind of cultural scale</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.400" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">meaning what does the local culture</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.960" end="00:42:05.520" style="s2">recognize as being the natural boundary</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.400" end="00:42:07.440" style="s2">of what it takes into account</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.520" end="00:42:09.839" style="s2">so if you look at indigenous cultures</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.440" end="00:42:11.680" style="s2">those things are laid out very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.839" end="00:42:13.520" style="s2">you know they&#39;re often laid out in terms</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.680" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">of very specific</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.520" end="00:42:20.240" style="s2">landmarks you know and</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.839" end="00:42:21.839" style="s2">naturally occurring phenomena rivers</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.240" end="00:42:25.040" style="s2">mountains and so on</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.839" end="00:42:27.599" style="s2">uh within urban</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.040" end="00:42:29.359" style="s2">systems you know there&#39;s people kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.599" end="00:42:31.520" style="s2">know where their neighborhood boundary</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.359" end="00:42:34.160" style="s2">is within small towns people know where</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.520" end="00:42:36.480" style="s2">the watershed boundary is</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.160" end="00:42:38.160" style="s2">they may not given those they may not</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.480" end="00:42:38.720" style="s2">think about it much they just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.160" end="00:42:41.520" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.720" end="00:42:42.400" style="s2">i live in this part of town right i live</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.520" end="00:42:44.720" style="s2">in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.400" end="00:42:46.720" style="s2">i live in this part of new mexico right</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.720" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">and i know immediately when i&#39;m no</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.720" end="00:42:52.240" style="s2">longer in my part of new mexico</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:55.359" style="s2">um because i grew up here you just know</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.240" end="00:42:59.680" style="s2">uh so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.359" end="00:43:02.000" style="s2">what we do in a given context is try and</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.680" end="00:43:04.800" style="s2">understand or suss out</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.000" end="00:43:05.680" style="s2">where that kind of collective agreement</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.800" end="00:43:08.400" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.680" end="00:43:09.599" style="s2">about this is ours this is what we care</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.400" end="00:43:11.599" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.599" end="00:43:13.680" style="s2">you know over there is over there but</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.599" end="00:43:16.880" style="s2">here is here</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.680" end="00:43:20.079" style="s2">and uh because if we can understand that</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.880" end="00:43:20.480" style="s2">and identify it it&#39;s much much easier to</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.079" end="00:43:23.920" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.480" end="00:43:24.400" style="s2">on that question of will what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.920" end="00:43:26.800" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.400" end="00:43:28.640" style="s2">really love really care about really are</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.800" end="00:43:29.440" style="s2">willing to do something about if they</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.640" end="00:43:31.440" style="s2">saw</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.440" end="00:43:32.640" style="s2">that there was some possibility of doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.440" end="00:43:35.680" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.640" end="00:43:36.480" style="s2">um so that&#39;s one way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.680" end="00:43:40.800" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.480" end="00:43:42.720" style="s2">yeah as different people are going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.800" end="00:43:44.000" style="s2">see that at different levels some people</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.720" end="00:43:46.400" style="s2">need to keep it very</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.000" end="00:43:49.200" style="s2">bounded and close in other people can</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.400" end="00:43:54.079" style="s2">see it in a very large sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.200" end="00:43:57.440" style="s2">but the key is can i relate to it</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.079" end="00:44:00.400" style="s2">do can i actually feel caring for it</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.440" end="00:44:01.599" style="s2">not as an intellectual thing but as</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.400" end="00:44:05.280" style="s2">something that i</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.599" end="00:44:08.960" style="s2">i know and understand and am willing</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.280" end="00:44:12.880" style="s2">to dedicate myself to this</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.960" end="00:44:15.680" style="s2">um this something else to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.880" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">and and then once i&#39;ve got that bounded</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.680" end="00:44:18.160" style="s2">then i can understand its nestedness i</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.599" end="00:44:21.760" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.160" end="00:44:25.040" style="s2">how i&#39;m fit inside of it and i know</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.760" end="00:44:28.560" style="s2">how it fits you know in</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.040" end="00:44:31.359" style="s2">whatever the next system is uh so</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.560" end="00:44:33.520" style="s2">if i just arbitrarily talk about my own</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.359" end="00:44:36.480" style="s2">town i sort of know</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.520" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">my town which fits is pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.480" end="00:44:40.800" style="s2">bounded by and defined by a particular</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.800" end="00:44:42.880" style="s2">watershed</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.800" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">and i know kind of where that watershed</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.880" end="00:44:46.560" style="s2">ends and</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.480" end="00:44:48.720" style="s2">how that fits within a region that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.560" end="00:44:51.520" style="s2">call north northern new mexico or</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.720" end="00:44:52.800" style="s2">north central new mexico and it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.520" end="00:44:56.400" style="s2">very distinctive</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.800" end="00:44:59.760" style="s2">cultural geological ecological region</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.400" end="00:45:04.960" style="s2">so i can immediately see you know how</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.760" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">things fit together um</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.960" end="00:45:09.359" style="s2">this understanding of nessa because we</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.000" end="00:45:11.520" style="s2">started out in</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.359" end="00:45:13.119" style="s2">kind of i started as a gardener we</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.520" end="00:45:14.079" style="s2">started out in the field of land</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.119" end="00:45:16.400" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.079" end="00:45:17.760" style="s2">place became the thing that we focused</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.400" end="00:45:21.280" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.760" end="00:45:23.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a really really useful concept</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.280" end="00:45:26.160" style="s2">for working on the relationship of</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.920" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">people in ecological systems</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.160" end="00:45:31.359" style="s2">which is one of the huge topics in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.040" end="00:45:35.280" style="s2">world at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.359" end="00:45:37.599" style="s2">however the pattern behind it the way of</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.280" end="00:45:40.800" style="s2">thinking behind it applies to</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.599" end="00:45:42.560" style="s2">any field so just to</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.800" end="00:45:43.839" style="s2">make sure that i understood you there</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.560" end="00:45:44.960" style="s2">and i think because this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.839" end="00:45:47.119" style="s2">important point that</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.960" end="00:45:48.560" style="s2">for me it&#39;s been a journey like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.119" end="00:45:53.839" style="s2">testing something out here</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.560" end="00:45:53.839" style="s2">with my own work on mallorca um</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.319" end="00:46:00.560" style="s2">the nested hole that</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.319" end="00:46:03.359" style="s2">well the the proximate hole that in</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.560" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">order to shift something</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.359" end="00:46:11.359" style="s2">in the patterns on this island</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:14.480" style="s2">drawn from the deep</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.359" end="00:46:16.240" style="s2">recognition of people here that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.480" end="00:46:17.760" style="s2">something unique about mallorca that</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.240" end="00:46:20.800" style="s2">that only majorca can</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.760" end="00:46:24.079" style="s2">give to the world that is beyond</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.800" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">um what the knee-jerk</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.079" end="00:46:30.000" style="s2">response might be right now um well</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:32.079" style="s2">some sex in sangria or whatever they</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.000" end="00:46:35.839" style="s2">advertise cheap mass tourism</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.079" end="00:46:39.119" style="s2">um with but is is the uniqueness of this</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.839" end="00:46:42.720" style="s2">this this particular location and its</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.119" end="00:46:45.280" style="s2">history and so on um working</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.720" end="00:46:47.280" style="s2">with mallorca it it&#39;s not always that i</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.280" end="00:46:49.200" style="s2">then have to say oh the nested hole of</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.280" end="00:46:51.280" style="s2">course is the balearic islands and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.200" end="00:46:52.720" style="s2">it sits in southern europe or in spain</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.280" end="00:46:55.200" style="s2">and then it sits in europe</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.720" end="00:46:57.359" style="s2">which would be the entire sort of linear</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.200" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">geographical nestedness</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.359" end="00:47:02.000" style="s2">um but it could be that</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:05.040" style="s2">working on mallorca you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.000" end="00:47:07.599" style="s2">working on the transformation of tourism</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.040" end="00:47:10.400" style="s2">and and that that transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.599" end="00:47:11.440" style="s2">tourism then would also help the</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:14.960" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.440" end="00:47:17.280" style="s2">of this island am i getting it</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.960" end="00:47:19.599" style="s2">sort of i mean if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.280" end="00:47:21.680" style="s2">working on tourism</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.599" end="00:47:24.319" style="s2">right then working on tourism in</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.680" end="00:47:27.359" style="s2">mallorca as a way of working on tourism</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.319" end="00:47:30.960" style="s2">generally yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.359" end="00:47:34.079" style="s2">you could say there is an entity</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.960" end="00:47:34.559" style="s2">called tourism in mallorca right that</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.079" end="00:47:37.680" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.559" end="00:47:39.599" style="s2">are choosing to care about right and</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.680" end="00:47:42.400" style="s2">you&#39;re choosing to evolve it</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.599" end="00:47:43.920" style="s2">just as there is an entity called land</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.400" end="00:47:46.960" style="s2">development in mallorca that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.920" end="00:47:52.079" style="s2">choosing to do something about</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.960" end="00:47:54.960" style="s2">and uh so</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.079" end="00:47:57.760" style="s2">and the same would be true of i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.960" end="00:47:57.760" style="s2">trying to think of</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.760" end="00:48:09.040" style="s2">wine for example right</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.520" end="00:48:11.599" style="s2">that if your passion is wine right</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.040" end="00:48:14.160" style="s2">understanding and developing the way</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.599" end="00:48:18.160" style="s2">wine happens on mallorca</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.160" end="00:48:21.200" style="s2">compared to wine in a larger spanish or</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.160" end="00:48:25.599" style="s2">southern european context right</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.200" end="00:48:25.920" style="s2">that wine&#39;s an easy example because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.599" end="00:48:28.480" style="s2">fun</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.920" end="00:48:29.359" style="s2">it is inherently place based right one</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.480" end="00:48:32.079" style="s2">of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.359" end="00:48:33.280" style="s2">makes wine so popular is that it</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.079" end="00:48:35.520" style="s2">actually can express</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.280" end="00:48:37.680" style="s2">the distinctiveness of the place so when</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.520" end="00:48:39.200" style="s2">you work on wine you&#39;re inherently also</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.680" end="00:48:40.800" style="s2">working on the place</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.200" end="00:48:42.800" style="s2">if you&#39;re doing something other than</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.800" end="00:48:45.359" style="s2">mass-produced you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.800" end="00:48:45.359" style="s2">low-grade</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.839" end="00:48:54.079" style="s2">stuff um</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.559" end="00:48:56.400" style="s2">so the the point</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.079" end="00:48:56.400" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.760" end="00:49:03.520" style="s2">that what distinguish the pattern behind</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.680" end="00:49:06.079" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing around place</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.520" end="00:49:08.480" style="s2">is we&#39;re trying to understand who is</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.079" end="00:49:12.000" style="s2">this place what is its essence</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.480" end="00:49:13.680" style="s2">what is its unique character uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.000" end="00:49:17.440" style="s2">because that&#39;s the thing people are</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.680" end="00:49:21.599" style="s2">relating to so would you say that again</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.440" end="00:49:25.359" style="s2">because like i i looked up</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.599" end="00:49:26.880" style="s2">your bio briefly um and one of them that</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.359" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">pops up is the one that you&#39;ve got on</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.880" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">the regenesis webpage and in it you say</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:32.480" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:34.240" style="s2">you specialize in holistic systems-based</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.480" end="00:49:36.880" style="s2">approach to understanding</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.240" end="00:49:39.280" style="s2">and building upon the complex human</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.880" end="00:49:42.160" style="s2">natural and economic relationships</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.280" end="00:49:43.040" style="s2">that create and sustain the vitality and</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.160" end="00:49:46.800" style="s2">viability</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.040" end="00:49:48.800" style="s2">of a place and</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.800" end="00:49:50.400" style="s2">that resonates very strongly with me</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.800" end="00:49:53.920" style="s2">that&#39;s what i would say</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.400" end="00:49:58.640" style="s2">i came to mallorca to do that very thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.920" end="00:50:01.599" style="s2">to learn how to do that and at the time</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.640" end="00:50:02.559" style="s2">my experience of having tried to do</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.599" end="00:50:04.480" style="s2">similar things</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.559" end="00:50:06.319" style="s2">in experimental communities equal</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.480" end="00:50:08.559" style="s2">villages or with</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.319" end="00:50:09.760" style="s2">small subgroups of the willing in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.559" end="00:50:12.640" style="s2">particular place</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.760" end="00:50:13.359" style="s2">transition town groups and so on let me</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.640" end="00:50:16.800" style="s2">personally</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.359" end="00:50:18.559" style="s2">at the time to an insight that to really</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.800" end="00:50:21.599" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.559" end="00:50:24.640" style="s2">systemic change where</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.599" end="00:50:25.680" style="s2">you could leverage certain economics of</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.640" end="00:50:28.240" style="s2">scale and</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.680" end="00:50:29.520" style="s2">and provide certain needs for a regional</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.240" end="00:50:31.920" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.520" end="00:50:32.880" style="s2">brought me more and more or closer and</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.920" end="00:50:36.480" style="s2">closer to</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.880" end="00:50:36.880" style="s2">regional scale of work and that&#39;s why i</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.480" end="00:50:38.800" style="s2">moved</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.880" end="00:50:40.720" style="s2">to mallorca 10 years ago because i</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.800" end="00:50:43.760" style="s2">thought okay i want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.720" end="00:50:44.800" style="s2">commit to place anyway for my own sake</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.760" end="00:50:49.440" style="s2">and lifestyle and</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.800" end="00:50:52.880" style="s2">grounding and myocar is a great place</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.440" end="00:50:57.200" style="s2">to study what one can do</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.880" end="00:51:01.680" style="s2">over the long term humbly to</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.200" end="00:51:05.200" style="s2">do systemic acupuncture and help</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.680" end="00:51:07.520" style="s2">create conversations and projects that</p>

<p begin="00:51:07.520" end="00:51:13.280" style="s2">contribute hopefully in a catalytic way</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.720" end="00:51:14.000" style="s2">um to the positive transformation of a</p>

<p begin="00:51:14.000" end="00:51:19.760" style="s2">is is that in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.440" end="00:51:22.079" style="s2">mistaken to some extent to just because</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.760" end="00:51:23.200" style="s2">because then the question there is if</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.079" end="00:51:26.240" style="s2">you do that in one</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.200" end="00:51:28.800" style="s2">island of the mediterranean of course</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.240" end="00:51:29.760" style="s2">every other island will be different but</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:32.160" style="s2">there is this</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.760" end="00:51:32.800" style="s2">question to what extent can you can you</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.160" end="00:51:35.680" style="s2">transfer</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.800" end="00:51:38.160" style="s2">patterns and processes that you learn in</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.680" end="00:51:40.400" style="s2">one place by regionally to then</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.160" end="00:51:42.640" style="s2">build networks with other islands that</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.400" end="00:51:45.599" style="s2">are on the same journey and</p>

<p begin="00:51:45.599" end="00:51:48.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.079" end="00:51:49.359" style="s2">that where people can we come across a</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.000" end="00:51:51.200" style="s2">similar project</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.359" end="00:51:53.599" style="s2">problems and this is how we work around</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.200" end="00:51:56.880" style="s2">them but also</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.599" end="00:51:57.680" style="s2">to inspire anybody in the mediterranean</p>

<p begin="00:51:57.680" end="00:52:06.720" style="s2">that at the regional scale</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.760" end="00:52:06.720" style="s2">it is possible to revitalize</p>

<p begin="00:52:14.960" end="00:52:18.640" style="s2">you actually build resilience against</p>

<p begin="00:52:22.000" end="00:52:27.599" style="s2">in what way is is that whole framing</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.359" end="00:52:28.720" style="s2">not aligned with with the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.599" end="00:52:31.359" style="s2">would work</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.720" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">regeneratively so you you could tell</p>

<p begin="00:52:53.920" end="00:52:58.720" style="s2">resilience even permaculture is a very</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.319" end="00:53:00.319" style="s2">characteristic way of thinking within a</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.720" end="00:53:03.520" style="s2">permaculture context</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.319" end="00:53:05.280" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.520" end="00:53:08.079" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to try and slow this down</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.280" end="00:53:12.079" style="s2">so we can really get to it if we can</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.079" end="00:53:12.079" style="s2">um that</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.040" end="00:53:21.359" style="s2">you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.480" end="00:53:21.359" style="s2">the system of majorca as an it</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.800" end="00:53:29.280" style="s2">right and and and you made it a</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.839" end="00:53:30.079" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a great it it&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.280" end="00:53:32.400" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.079" end="00:53:34.000" style="s2">you know has these it&#39;s just an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.400" end="00:53:36.319" style="s2">place right</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.000" end="00:53:36.319" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.599" end="00:53:42.160" style="s2">and but looked at from that point of</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.839" end="00:53:44.160" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.160" end="00:53:45.440" style="s2">there are any number of islands you</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.160" end="00:53:48.480" style="s2">could have chosen</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.440" end="00:53:50.240" style="s2">to work on in a similar way right you</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.480" end="00:53:51.920" style="s2">know so if i thought about it in those</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.240" end="00:53:53.440" style="s2">terms if i was really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.920" end="00:53:55.359" style="s2">shopping around and deciding which</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.440" end="00:53:57.680" style="s2">island am i going to do this on</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.359" end="00:53:58.720" style="s2">you know i&#39;d make lists and i&#39;d sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.680" end="00:54:00.800" style="s2">weigh the</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.720" end="00:54:04.000" style="s2">pros and cons and i&#39;d select the one</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.800" end="00:54:04.000" style="s2">that worked best for me</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.160" end="00:54:09.200" style="s2">i&#39;m guessing that uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.520" end="00:54:11.200" style="s2">in the 10 years that you&#39;ve lived in</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.200" end="00:54:13.200" style="s2">mallorca</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.200" end="00:54:14.880" style="s2">something else has happened and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.200" end="00:54:16.800" style="s2">may have already happened before you</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.880" end="00:54:22.160" style="s2">made the choice</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.800" end="00:54:22.160" style="s2">which is you also feel drawn to it</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.680" end="00:54:30.319" style="s2">yeah i mean that is you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.280" end="00:54:30.319" style="s2">relate to it</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.480" end="00:54:35.440" style="s2">and that relatedness that sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.640" end="00:54:38.960" style="s2">at home</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.440" end="00:54:41.920" style="s2">or um i really care about this place</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.960" end="00:54:43.280" style="s2">you know i love the relationships i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:45.760" style="s2">building here</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.280" end="00:54:47.839" style="s2">i love the way it feels to take that</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.760" end="00:54:49.040" style="s2">particular walk and see that mountain in</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.839" end="00:54:52.640" style="s2">that particular way</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.040" end="00:54:54.400" style="s2">all of that stuff you know is happening</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.640" end="00:54:56.240" style="s2">it&#39;s the distinction i mentioned earlier</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.400" end="00:54:56.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a functional way of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.240" end="00:54:59.680" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.720" end="00:55:00.079" style="s2">and there&#39;s a being way of looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.680" end="00:55:03.680" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.079" end="00:55:05.680" style="s2">for me in my experience of how i&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.680" end="00:55:09.280" style="s2">this work now for 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.680" end="00:55:12.400" style="s2">is that while i might have looked at</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.280" end="00:55:14.160" style="s2">functional issues and made lists of</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.400" end="00:55:15.040" style="s2">transformation and agriculture and</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.160" end="00:55:17.440" style="s2">energy and</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.040" end="00:55:18.880" style="s2">transport sector and urban development</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.440" end="00:55:21.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.880" end="00:55:22.160" style="s2">all sorts of potential for transforming</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.440" end="00:55:24.720" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.160" end="00:55:26.799" style="s2">dominant economy which is of course</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.720" end="00:55:29.040" style="s2">tourism</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.799" end="00:55:31.760" style="s2">but i feel that the the way of actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.040" end="00:55:33.599" style="s2">working with it for example bringing</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.760" end="00:55:35.359" style="s2">a whole group of local people together</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.599" end="00:55:38.400" style="s2">working around the project</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.359" end="00:55:39.200" style="s2">where echo belgium detergent company</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.400" end="00:55:43.119" style="s2">wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.200" end="00:55:45.839" style="s2">explore um the production of</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.119" end="00:55:48.400" style="s2">soaps and cleaning products from local</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.839" end="00:55:50.160" style="s2">waste products</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.400" end="00:55:51.520" style="s2">for me and and you mentioned this</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.160" end="00:55:53.119" style="s2">alluded to this earlier with some</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.520" end="00:55:54.160" style="s2">projects were successful in some</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.119" end="00:55:58.000" style="s2">projects</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.160" end="00:56:00.160" style="s2">is it you basically didn&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.000" end="00:56:01.119" style="s2">they also had their successes even if</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.160" end="00:56:03.520" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.119" end="00:56:04.160" style="s2">what the main aim was wasn&#39;t successful</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.520" end="00:56:05.760" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.160" end="00:56:07.520" style="s2">it they introduced a way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.760" end="00:56:10.720" style="s2">with people and in a similar way</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.520" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">i feel like a lot of the projects both</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.720" end="00:56:14.839" style="s2">educational programs i&#39;ve brought here</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:18.240" style="s2">work with universities work with this</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.839" end="00:56:20.640" style="s2">different like corporate clients</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.240" end="00:56:22.960" style="s2">they all invite that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.640" end="00:56:24.799" style="s2">conversation maybe less structured but</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.960" end="00:56:26.319" style="s2">but they create that conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.799" end="00:56:27.440" style="s2">what really matters about this play how</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.319" end="00:56:31.200" style="s2">is this place unique</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.440" end="00:56:32.400" style="s2">what are from what what is the potential</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.200" end="00:56:35.440" style="s2">here in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.400" end="00:56:39.359" style="s2">unused resources that we can</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.440" end="00:56:40.079" style="s2">um connect and unuse connections between</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.359" end="00:56:43.440" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.079" end="00:56:47.200" style="s2">that that would unleash potential um</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.440" end="00:56:48.880" style="s2">can i can i pause you right here so</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.200" end="00:56:51.440" style="s2">i was tracking you and then you fell off</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.880" end="00:56:56.240" style="s2">a little cliff right</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.440" end="00:56:59.599" style="s2">um all i&#39;m trying to do is make explicit</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.240" end="00:57:01.440" style="s2">um this distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.599" end="00:57:03.040" style="s2">functional development and development</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.440" end="00:57:05.520" style="s2">of being</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.040" end="00:57:06.240" style="s2">because our premise is that when you</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.520" end="00:57:08.559" style="s2">work them</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.240" end="00:57:09.440" style="s2">together you get a completely different</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.559" end="00:57:12.319" style="s2">kind of result</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.440" end="00:57:14.160" style="s2">completely different level of</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.319" end="00:57:16.799" style="s2">effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.160" end="00:57:16.799" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.079" end="00:57:25.280" style="s2">i can think about the</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.440" end="00:57:28.720" style="s2">development of the potential of a place</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.280" end="00:57:29.760" style="s2">in terms of translating underutilized</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.720" end="00:57:33.200" style="s2">resources</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.760" end="00:57:36.319" style="s2">into some kind of productive</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.200" end="00:57:38.400" style="s2">new use right or i can</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.319" end="00:57:40.480" style="s2">yeah human relationship and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.400" end="00:57:43.680" style="s2">that&#39;s a perfectly legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.480" end="00:57:46.319" style="s2">way of working on it um but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.680" end="00:57:48.720" style="s2">one-sided</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.319" end="00:57:50.720" style="s2">and the other way of looking at it is</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.720" end="00:57:54.079" style="s2">the potential of this place</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.720" end="00:57:57.520" style="s2">has to do with um</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.079" end="00:58:01.280" style="s2">allowing its</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.520" end="00:58:02.510" style="s2">essence its soul to manifest more fully</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.280" end="00:58:03.920" style="s2">into the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.510" end="00:58:06.559" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.920" end="00:58:06.960" style="s2">and the reason that&#39;s and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.559" end="00:58:10.400" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.960" end="00:58:12.960" style="s2">it is people do care about the places</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.400" end="00:58:13.680" style="s2">they live and when you gather a group</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.960" end="00:58:15.280" style="s2">that has an</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.680" end="00:58:17.359" style="s2">interest in working something like the</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.280" end="00:58:18.319" style="s2">zero waste initiative it&#39;s there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.359" end="00:58:21.040" style="s2">implicit</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.319" end="00:58:23.839" style="s2">right and certain kinds of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.040" end="00:58:23.839" style="s2">will lift it up</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.079" end="00:58:28.000" style="s2">but if the conversations are not</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.960" end="00:58:32.079" style="s2">conceived</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.000" end="00:58:35.280" style="s2">in in a developmental way</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.079" end="00:58:39.680" style="s2">then they don&#39;t actually build</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.280" end="00:58:43.599" style="s2">people&#39;s ability to conceptualize</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.680" end="00:58:43.599" style="s2">the um</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.799" end="00:58:50.319" style="s2">you know that aspect</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.240" end="00:58:51.359" style="s2">of the potential of what they&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.319" end="00:58:53.760" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.359" end="00:58:54.559" style="s2">and that ends up making a huge</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.760" end="00:58:57.200" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.559" end="00:58:58.000" style="s2">in terms of what what they end up being</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.200" end="00:59:01.680" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.000" end="00:59:03.839" style="s2">enact like</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.680" end="00:59:04.880" style="s2">because we&#39;ve only got about 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.839" end="00:59:07.359" style="s2">left or so</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.880" end="00:59:08.640" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to try something zooming</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.359" end="00:59:11.359" style="s2">out this might or might not</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.640" end="00:59:12.960" style="s2">not work because it relates very much um</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.359" end="00:59:15.280" style="s2">to this</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.960" end="00:59:17.359" style="s2">earlier briefly alluded to donnella</p>

<p begin="00:59:17.359" end="00:59:20.640" style="s2">and i i had a look and i&#39;m still working</p>

<p begin="00:59:20.640" end="00:59:24.400" style="s2">and i would love to have a another</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.480" end="00:59:27.040" style="s2">conversation separate with um</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.400" end="00:59:28.880" style="s2">about this paper that you wrote recently</p>

<p begin="00:59:28.880" end="00:59:33.359" style="s2">a framework for working on economics</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.760" end="00:59:36.400" style="s2">regeneratively</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.359" end="00:59:38.799" style="s2">um and in that you also bring up the</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.400" end="00:59:40.559" style="s2">leverage points and you bring up that</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.799" end="00:59:43.599" style="s2">places to intervene</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.559" end="00:59:45.680" style="s2">and and you frame it in a way that she</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.599" end="00:59:46.160" style="s2">did in her first version of that paper</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.680" end="00:59:49.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.160" end="00:59:51.040" style="s2">where the highest point is um</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.760" end="00:59:53.599" style="s2">to intervene at the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.040" end="00:59:54.960" style="s2">paradigm and at that point when she</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.599" end="00:59:57.440" style="s2">wrote it she framed it</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.960" end="00:59:59.040" style="s2">around that that&#39;s the fundamental sort</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.440" end="01:00:00.799" style="s2">of cuny and paradigm shift and</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.040" end="01:00:02.799" style="s2">everything else changes</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.799" end="01:00:04.079" style="s2">the whole understanding of the system</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.799" end="01:00:05.920" style="s2">changes and</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.079" end="01:00:08.000" style="s2">and when she first wrote it she did the</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.920" end="01:00:09.119" style="s2">same thing as you do in that paper which</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.000" end="01:00:11.760" style="s2">is to say</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.119" end="01:00:13.520" style="s2">um paradigms are mutually exclusive and</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.760" end="01:00:15.680" style="s2">so once you&#39;re in that new paradigm you</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.520" end="01:00:19.280" style="s2">see things completely differently</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.680" end="01:00:22.319" style="s2">um but donna herself</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.280" end="01:00:25.440" style="s2">in the later part of her life</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.319" end="01:00:26.880" style="s2">then rewrote that paper and added</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.440" end="01:00:29.359" style="s2">another level to it which</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.880" end="01:00:31.599" style="s2">is um the highest leverage point is</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.359" end="01:00:34.720" style="s2">moving beyond paradigms</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.599" end="01:00:35.920" style="s2">and what i think she was alluding to and</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.720" end="01:00:40.160" style="s2">bringing that close to</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.920" end="01:00:42.480" style="s2">regenerous language would be that</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.160" end="01:00:43.200" style="s2">what she was saying is that in order to</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.480" end="01:00:45.040" style="s2">p pick</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.200" end="01:00:47.359" style="s2">people up and keep the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.040" end="01:00:48.559" style="s2">going as you dance with complexity and</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.359" end="01:00:52.640" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.559" end="01:00:55.680" style="s2">and you keep all the levels of work</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.640" end="01:00:58.720" style="s2">open at the same time and</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.680" end="01:01:00.880" style="s2">you can actually work and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.720" end="01:01:03.520" style="s2">and i i&#39;m noticing that of course the</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.880" end="01:01:05.200" style="s2">the the long apprenticeship and practice</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.520" end="01:01:07.760" style="s2">to really work</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.200" end="01:01:10.240" style="s2">purely regeneratively and and train your</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.760" end="01:01:12.640" style="s2">mind and your ability to do it is a long</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.240" end="01:01:13.920" style="s2">deep journey and i have a long way to go</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.640" end="01:01:17.040" style="s2">there but i guess where i</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.920" end="01:01:20.799" style="s2">sometimes bump into</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.040" end="01:01:23.040" style="s2">wanting to keep learning from</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.799" end="01:01:24.000" style="s2">those technologies and how to apply them</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.040" end="01:01:26.799" style="s2">but then</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.000" end="01:01:28.559" style="s2">i where i don&#39;t see eye to eye where</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.799" end="01:01:31.119" style="s2">there&#39;s a different perspective maybe is</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.559" end="01:01:32.079" style="s2">is that i actually believe that as you</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.119" end="01:01:33.839" style="s2">say yourself</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.079" end="01:01:35.680" style="s2">that all the other levels of work are</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.839" end="01:01:38.799" style="s2">also really important and they all</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.680" end="01:01:41.680" style="s2">you in for a system to stay viable</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.799" end="01:01:43.599" style="s2">and evolving and and all that it needs</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.680" end="01:01:46.640" style="s2">to actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.599" end="01:01:47.119" style="s2">do all the levels of work um and so for</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.640" end="01:01:49.200" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.119" end="01:01:51.839" style="s2">the question is when when working in</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.200" end="01:01:55.039" style="s2">these ways don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.839" end="01:01:56.319" style="s2">over time bring sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.039" end="01:01:58.720" style="s2">in the right moment with the right</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.319" end="01:01:59.440" style="s2">people for the right amount of time the</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.720" end="01:02:01.520" style="s2">deeper</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.440" end="01:02:02.559" style="s2">regenerative level work into the</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.520" end="01:02:05.680" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.559" end="01:02:08.799" style="s2">as we capture people and engage them</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.680" end="01:02:10.000" style="s2">because some of the finance flows and</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.799" end="01:02:12.480" style="s2">decision makers</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.000" end="01:02:14.319" style="s2">might not quite be ready for that</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.480" end="01:02:15.440" style="s2">conversation yet but so they get drawn</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.319" end="01:02:17.039" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.440" end="01:02:18.720" style="s2">to a project that that is actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.039" end="01:02:22.799" style="s2">working on maintain level</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.720" end="01:02:25.599" style="s2">um or improve level but is um</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.799" end="01:02:25.920" style="s2">is keeping at least aspirationally and</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.599" end="01:02:28.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.920" end="01:02:29.359" style="s2">and in terms of energetic holding the</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.400" end="01:02:31.440" style="s2">the regenerate</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.359" end="01:02:32.960" style="s2">like the evolutionary dimension the</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.440" end="01:02:35.920" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.960" end="01:02:37.119" style="s2">dimension open does that make any sense</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.920" end="01:02:39.119" style="s2">whatsoever like do you get</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.119" end="01:02:41.440" style="s2">what i&#39;m trying like do you understand</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.119" end="01:02:45.680" style="s2">what i&#39;m trying to ask</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.440" end="01:02:49.760" style="s2">uh yeah and so here here&#39;s how i would</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.680" end="01:02:52.799" style="s2">say it back to you um that</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.760" end="01:02:56.559" style="s2">with my own little twist on it that um</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.799" end="01:02:59.280" style="s2">that the we tend to</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.559" end="01:03:00.480" style="s2">work within the regenerative within the</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.280" end="01:03:03.440" style="s2">genesis</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.480" end="01:03:04.319" style="s2">you know frame we talk about five levels</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.440" end="01:03:07.280" style="s2">of work</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.319" end="01:03:07.599" style="s2">right all of which need to be present uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.280" end="01:03:10.480" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.599" end="01:03:11.920" style="s2">an entity is to remain vital viable and</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.480" end="01:03:15.200" style="s2">capable of evolution</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.920" end="01:03:17.760" style="s2">yeah and the bottom level is stabilized</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.200" end="01:03:20.799" style="s2">right so if you get a wound it can heal</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.760" end="01:03:21.680" style="s2">right uh you know the body&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.799" end="01:03:24.480" style="s2">you get a flu</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.680" end="01:03:26.240" style="s2">the body needs to heal itself but once</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.480" end="01:03:30.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve got that then you can move</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.240" end="01:03:34.960" style="s2">into these other levels and um</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.960" end="01:03:37.680" style="s2">being able to uh understand</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.960" end="01:03:39.039" style="s2">and think and work from those different</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.680" end="01:03:42.160" style="s2">levels of work</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.039" end="01:03:45.520" style="s2">requires development right</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.160" end="01:03:46.960" style="s2">so people enter at various levels in</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.520" end="01:03:49.119" style="s2">terms of their</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.960" end="01:03:51.520" style="s2">the existing capacity they&#39;ve developed</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.119" end="01:03:54.240" style="s2">what they&#39;re just naturally able to do</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.520" end="01:03:55.760" style="s2">and the idea is to continually help them</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.240" end="01:03:58.640" style="s2">extend and expand</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.760" end="01:03:59.359" style="s2">their thinking so that they can hold the</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.640" end="01:04:02.480" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.359" end="01:04:04.240" style="s2">of a dynamic living changing evolving</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.480" end="01:04:08.000" style="s2">operating system</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.240" end="01:04:10.880" style="s2">um yeah so obviously i mean regeneration</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.000" end="01:04:12.400" style="s2">has to do the way i inve you know image</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.880" end="01:04:15.039" style="s2">it uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.400" end="01:04:17.039" style="s2">regeneration is about going back to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.039" end="01:04:18.960" style="s2">essence of something and bringing it</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.039" end="01:04:22.160" style="s2">forward in a new way</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.960" end="01:04:23.920" style="s2">as the world is changing right so if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.160" end="01:04:25.599" style="s2">keep on doing what you&#39;ve always done</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.920" end="01:04:26.799" style="s2">and the world is changing around you you</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.599" end="01:04:30.559" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.799" end="01:04:32.880" style="s2">most things become decreasingly viable</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.559" end="01:04:34.880" style="s2">right so they have to sort of take that</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.880" end="01:04:39.440" style="s2">core</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.880" end="01:04:41.839" style="s2">genius whether it&#39;s genetic or you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.440" end="01:04:42.799" style="s2">in terms of essence or or nature or</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.839" end="01:04:46.240" style="s2">character</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.799" end="01:04:48.559" style="s2">and sort of bring it into a new</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.240" end="01:04:50.559" style="s2">situation a new context and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.559" end="01:04:51.680" style="s2">that&#39;s how we grow and develop as human</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.559" end="01:04:54.319" style="s2">beings from</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.680" end="01:04:56.720" style="s2">you know infancy on to the end of our</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.319" end="01:04:56.720" style="s2">lives</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.799" end="01:05:03.280" style="s2">so yes of course it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.760" end="01:05:05.119" style="s2">appropriate to engage people where</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.280" end="01:05:06.240" style="s2">they&#39;re at it would be disrespectful not</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.119" end="01:05:09.280" style="s2">to engage people</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.240" end="01:05:12.400" style="s2">where they&#39;re at while holding</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.280" end="01:05:15.760" style="s2">it&#39;s equally disrespectful to not</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.400" end="01:05:17.440" style="s2">hold the assumption and expectation that</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.760" end="01:05:20.839" style="s2">they can grow from where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.440" end="01:05:23.839" style="s2">at whoever they are yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.839" end="01:05:24.799" style="s2">everyone you know this is this is why</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.839" end="01:05:27.599" style="s2">it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.799" end="01:05:29.920" style="s2">appropriate to involve children in</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.599" end="01:05:31.760" style="s2">decision-making processes</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.920" end="01:05:33.760" style="s2">you know that have to do with the body</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.760" end="01:05:35.680" style="s2">politic is completely appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.760" end="01:05:37.760" style="s2">right understanding that they&#39;re at a</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.680" end="01:05:38.160" style="s2">certain stage in their development but</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.760" end="01:05:40.880" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.160" end="01:05:42.480" style="s2">also need to be growing along with the</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.880" end="01:05:44.799" style="s2">rest of us</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.480" end="01:05:44.799" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.599" end="01:05:53.039" style="s2">the way i hear sort of your</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.440" end="01:05:55.760" style="s2">comment on the on danella meadows</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.039" end="01:05:58.000" style="s2">evolution and her thinking the way i</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.760" end="01:06:00.960" style="s2">hear that is a recognition</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.000" end="01:06:00.960" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.039" end="01:06:10.480" style="s2">that beyond paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.440" end="01:06:13.200" style="s2">right uh there is an ability to look at</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.480" end="01:06:14.079" style="s2">where and how paradigms are sourced</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.200" end="01:06:16.799" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.079" end="01:06:18.880" style="s2">so we talk about paradigm as kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.799" end="01:06:20.640" style="s2">frame of reference within which we live</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.880" end="01:06:23.039" style="s2">you know sort of how we frame and</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.640" end="01:06:25.039" style="s2">understand reality</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.039" end="01:06:27.039" style="s2">but it&#39;s possible to step out of that</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.039" end="01:06:27.440" style="s2">and say okay what is the process by</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.039" end="01:06:30.960" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.440" end="01:06:33.359" style="s2">reality framing is occurring</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.960" end="01:06:35.359" style="s2">and what do i need to what do i need to</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.359" end="01:06:38.640" style="s2">be able to observe in myself</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.359" end="01:06:41.680" style="s2">and then observe in my cosmos</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.640" end="01:06:44.480" style="s2">to be able to look at that uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.680" end="01:06:46.319" style="s2">and so i was thinking about this coming</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.480" end="01:06:48.880" style="s2">into this conversation that</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.319" end="01:06:49.839" style="s2">these levels of work is not the whole</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.880" end="01:06:52.319" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.839" end="01:06:54.480" style="s2">right there are levels of work below and</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.319" end="01:06:57.839" style="s2">levels of work beyond</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.480" end="01:06:59.760" style="s2">what we talk about you know regeneration</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.839" end="01:07:02.079" style="s2">is a particular level of work it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.760" end="01:07:03.680" style="s2">the end of the story</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.079" end="01:07:05.440" style="s2">it just happens to be a level of work</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.680" end="01:07:07.520" style="s2">that we collectively need to learn how</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.440" end="01:07:10.559" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.520" end="01:07:13.039" style="s2">you know and uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.559" end="01:07:14.079" style="s2">and there&#39;s not a huge capacity out</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.039" end="01:07:16.880" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.079" end="01:07:19.119" style="s2">you know yet to be able to think at that</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.880" end="01:07:22.160" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.119" end="01:07:23.200" style="s2">there&#39;s not even that much capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.160" end="01:07:27.839" style="s2">be able to think</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.200" end="01:07:28.240" style="s2">uh at the evolution of systems level</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.839" end="01:07:31.520" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.240" end="01:07:34.880" style="s2">like briefly coming back to donella&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.520" end="01:07:34.880" style="s2">point there um</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.200" end="01:07:39.760" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering whether it&#39;s it what she</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.359" end="01:07:42.960" style="s2">was trying to get it or the way i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.760" end="01:07:47.599" style="s2">often interpreted her is that yes</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.960" end="01:07:50.799" style="s2">it&#39;s understanding the very</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.599" end="01:07:53.680" style="s2">participation participatory nature of</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.799" end="01:07:53.680" style="s2">mind in</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.520" end="01:07:59.839" style="s2">in mattering literally like in creating</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.799" end="01:08:01.680" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.839" end="01:08:02.880" style="s2">bringing forth a world together in</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.680" end="01:08:05.440" style="s2">relationship all those</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.880" end="01:08:07.520" style="s2">kind of frames that madorana and varila</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.440" end="01:08:09.839" style="s2">and all those people brought into</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.520" end="01:08:11.119" style="s2">this more dynamic evolutionary way of</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.839" end="01:08:14.319" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.119" end="01:08:18.000" style="s2">about evolving systems</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.319" end="01:08:20.560" style="s2">and i i believe that she was also</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.000" end="01:08:21.199" style="s2">speaking to a more developmental</p>

<p begin="01:08:33.199" end="01:08:38.510" style="s2">we also need to keep the older paradigms</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.120" end="01:08:41.359" style="s2">so to speak um</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.510" end="01:08:44.319" style="s2">[Music]</p>

<p begin="01:09:28.640" end="01:09:31.359" style="s2">that</p>

<p begin="01:09:33.120" end="01:09:39.359" style="s2">but that means in one moment you can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:09:39.359" end="01:09:42.640" style="s2">but you can learn from one perspective</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.359" end="01:09:44.319" style="s2">and then you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.640" end="01:09:46.839" style="s2">shift perspective and learn from the</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.319" end="01:09:50.159" style="s2">other perspective and then you can build</p>

<p begin="01:10:05.520" end="01:10:08.719" style="s2">okay well i i think it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.679" end="01:10:13.920" style="s2">thing to</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.719" end="01:10:18.560" style="s2">to investigate um i i&#39;m skeptical</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.920" end="01:10:18.560" style="s2">what makes you skeptical well i</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.840" end="01:10:32.320" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.000" end="01:10:33.520" style="s2">i mean if i just look at myself</p>

<p begin="01:10:33.520" end="01:10:38.480" style="s2">i&#39;m perfectly capable of dropping down</p>

<p begin="01:10:38.480" end="01:10:44.400" style="s2">paradigm i do it daily right</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.000" end="01:10:45.679" style="s2">uh it&#39;s like what&#39;s in it for me you</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.400" end="01:10:47.679" style="s2">know you you want this</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.679" end="01:10:49.840" style="s2">what&#39;s in it for me why would i bother</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.679" end="01:10:53.280" style="s2">you know engaging in this</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.840" end="01:10:59.840" style="s2">interaction um</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.280" end="01:10:59.840" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.239" end="01:11:07.280" style="s2">my experience of stepping out of that</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.760" end="01:11:11.040" style="s2">kind of level of consciousness is that</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.280" end="01:11:15.920" style="s2">um when i have stepped out of it</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.040" end="01:11:15.920" style="s2">i view having been in it as regressive</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.120" end="01:11:23.520" style="s2">meaning that it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.800" end="01:11:25.040" style="s2">i&#39;m no longer ext in exchange with my</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.520" end="01:11:27.840" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.040" end="01:11:29.120" style="s2">it&#39;s just that what&#39;s in it for me is no</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.840" end="01:11:32.159" style="s2">longer</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.120" end="01:11:36.239" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.159" end="01:11:40.480" style="s2">a question that uh needs to orient</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.239" end="01:11:44.159" style="s2">or you know um</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.480" end="01:11:47.199" style="s2">shape the choices that i&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.159" end="01:11:48.960" style="s2">so i don&#39;t mean to be belittling or</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.199" end="01:11:51.440" style="s2">denigrating</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.960" end="01:11:52.719" style="s2">um people operating in different</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.440" end="01:11:54.400" style="s2">different paradigms i mean we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.719" end="01:11:55.920" style="s2">surrounded by people operating from</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.400" end="01:11:59.040" style="s2">different paradigms</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.920" end="01:12:01.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not that it&#39;s that i my sense is</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.040" end="01:12:04.800" style="s2">what it and it&#39;s not about perspective</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.600" end="01:12:08.080" style="s2">right uh it&#39;s about um which</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.800" end="01:12:11.040" style="s2">reality am i moving through</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.080" end="01:12:13.520" style="s2">in my life right and to what extent have</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.040" end="01:12:17.840" style="s2">i developed my ability</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.520" end="01:12:23.840" style="s2">to operate from within a reality</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.840" end="01:12:23.840" style="s2">that um is life generating</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.480" end="01:12:27.520" style="s2">so uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.600" end="01:12:36.480" style="s2">so again for me i kind of get where your</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.560" end="01:12:37.840" style="s2">question is coming from</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.480" end="01:12:39.760" style="s2">and i can see how you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.840" end="01:12:41.760" style="s2">create a parallel between that and the</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.760" end="01:12:42.560" style="s2">idea of levels of work all of which need</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.760" end="01:12:45.280" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.560" end="01:12:46.320" style="s2">you know healthy and dynamically related</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.280" end="01:12:48.960" style="s2">and so on</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.320" end="01:12:51.840" style="s2">um but it&#39;s not my experience that it</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.960" end="01:12:55.280" style="s2">works that way</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.840" end="01:12:59.520" style="s2">that i experience myself</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.280" end="01:13:02.080" style="s2">almost as a different person</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.520" end="01:13:03.679" style="s2">when i&#39;m operating from a higher order</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.080" end="01:13:06.880" style="s2">paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.679" end="01:13:10.480" style="s2">the the me who shows up the i who shows</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.880" end="01:13:10.480" style="s2">up is a different nature of i</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.679" end="01:13:18.480" style="s2">you know i i guess</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.640" end="01:13:21.120" style="s2">for me it comes from from an experience</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.480" end="01:13:22.560" style="s2">of having tried to build bridges</p>

<p begin="01:14:36.320" end="01:14:43.280" style="s2">in a conversation that allows them</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.840" end="01:14:44.880" style="s2">to tap into what it is they really want</p>

<p begin="01:14:44.880" end="01:14:51.199" style="s2">uh and to find ways to</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.159" end="01:14:52.000" style="s2">to begin to move toward that you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.199" end="01:14:53.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.000" end="01:14:56.239" style="s2">you know we we talked about that in</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.760" end="01:14:58.640" style="s2">terms of caring</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.239" end="01:15:01.120" style="s2">we sometimes have this conversation</p>

<p begin="01:15:01.120" end="01:15:05.440" style="s2">which is wanting people</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.239" end="01:15:06.880" style="s2">you know seeing that people are</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.440" end="01:15:08.480" style="s2">suffering and wanting to remove their</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.880" end="01:15:11.280" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.480" end="01:15:13.199" style="s2">and caring which is seeing the inherent</p>

<p begin="01:15:16.400" end="01:15:22.239" style="s2">and really wanting to help them like</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.679" end="01:15:22.880" style="s2">express that because it&#39;s a drive in all</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.239" end="01:15:25.840" style="s2">of us</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.880" end="01:15:27.040" style="s2">right and so if our paradigm or our way</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.840" end="01:15:30.080" style="s2">of viewing the world</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.040" end="01:15:33.120" style="s2">or our way of thinking is</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.080" end="01:15:35.440" style="s2">um is like</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.120" end="01:15:37.120" style="s2">a barrier to being able to express that</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.440" end="01:15:39.440" style="s2">potential</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.120" end="01:15:41.120" style="s2">then you know it&#39;s our responsibility to</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.440" end="01:15:44.320" style="s2">one another to help one another</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.120" end="01:15:46.800" style="s2">like dismantle those barriers</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.320" end="01:15:48.239" style="s2">not everybody is particularly driven to</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.800" end="01:15:49.840" style="s2">dismantle those barriers</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.239" end="01:15:51.440" style="s2">you know not everybody&#39;s interested in</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.840" end="01:15:55.719" style="s2">these conversations</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.440" end="01:15:58.880" style="s2">but a lot of people are i mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.719" end="01:16:00.960" style="s2">amazingly it it&#39;s i think</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.880" end="01:16:02.480" style="s2">i experience it as deeply respectful and</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.960" end="01:16:05.520" style="s2">i think other people</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.480" end="01:16:07.440" style="s2">experience it as deeply respectful when</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.520" end="01:16:10.320" style="s2">someone is willing to listen</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.440" end="01:16:12.719" style="s2">deeply into enough into what they aspire</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.320" end="01:16:16.239" style="s2">to be and to become</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.719" end="01:16:18.640" style="s2">to want to help them no</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.239" end="01:16:20.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not about imposing my world view</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.640" end="01:16:22.560" style="s2">it&#39;s about trying to see what it is that</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.560" end="01:16:25.520" style="s2">people are trying to accomplish</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.560" end="01:16:27.120" style="s2">not just material but through the luck</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.520" end="01:16:28.800" style="s2">through their lives through the meaning</p>

<p begin="01:16:32.560" end="01:16:37.520" style="s2">commit to helping them you&#39;ve modeled</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.920" end="01:16:38.320" style="s2">exactly that with just giving me the</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.520" end="01:16:40.960" style="s2">time for this</p>
