<p begin="00:00:01.370" end="00:00:11.110" style="s2">Alright, so I was thinking today about how<br />to explain this a little bit further.</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.110" end="00:00:23.310" style="s2">So let’s say you’re going for a job interview.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.310" end="00:00:27.240" style="s2">And you’re nervous about it.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.240" end="00:00:34.100" style="s2">And you go into the job interview and there<br />are some people there, and some chairs and</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.100" end="00:00:40.640" style="s2">tables, and a room that’s like this, maybe<br />not quite this ugly, but something like this.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.640" end="00:00:44.059" style="s2">What’s in the room?</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.059" end="00:00:47.079" style="s2">You’re nervous.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.079" end="00:00:51.070" style="s2">You’ve seen chairs and tables before, you’ve<br />seen people.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.070" end="00:00:56.809" style="s2">What’s in the room?</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.809" end="00:01:01.010" style="s2">How about a set of alternate futures?</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.010" end="00:01:03.620" style="s2">Right?</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.620" end="00:01:05.050" style="s2">You know, that isn’t how we think.</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.050" end="00:01:07.640" style="s2">It’s how we act.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.640" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">And you know, if you talk about it, I was<br />nervous about going to this job interview.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:13.720" style="s2">Why?</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.720" end="00:01:15.380" style="s2">Well I thought I might be evaluated.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.380" end="00:01:17.550" style="s2">Okay, well why does that matter?</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.550" end="00:01:21.970" style="s2">Well, we know partly why it matters if we<br />look at this figure again.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.970" end="00:01:28.200" style="s2">I’m pretty happy with this figure, all things<br />considered.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.200" end="00:01:35.680" style="s2">You know, and you might say, well if I…<br />maybe it’ll shape my faith and my belief</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.680" end="00:01:37.950" style="s2">that I’m a good person.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.950" end="00:01:40.640" style="s2">That would be a little silly for an interview.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.640" end="00:01:46.360" style="s2">So if you’re thinking that way I would say<br />you’re not thinking specifically enough.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.360" end="00:01:50.200" style="s2">Because there’s lots of reasons you might<br />not do well at the job interview, including</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.200" end="00:01:54.140" style="s2">the fact that they might have already given<br />the job to someone else, for all you know.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.140" end="00:02:03.750" style="s2">So you don’t want to leap to the top of<br />the hierarchy without cause.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.750" end="00:02:09.149" style="s2">So one of the things you might say is that<br />in the room there, there are threats that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.149" end="00:02:17.870" style="s2">might be posed to any level of the hierarchy<br />of beliefs and behaviours that you use to</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.870" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">interact with the world.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.780" end="00:02:23.879" style="s2">Now the terror management people would tell<br />you…</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.879" end="00:02:26.249" style="s2">let’s assume that this [points to figure<br />on board] is a belief structure.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.249" end="00:02:30.689" style="s2">I don’t care whether you agree with the<br />way it’s represented graphically or not,</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.689" end="00:02:34.930" style="s2">for the time being, but let’s just assume<br />that what we’re talking about is a belief</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.930" end="00:02:35.930" style="s2">structure.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.930" end="00:02:42.319" style="s2">Now the terror management people would tell<br />you that you have that belief structure, in</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.319" end="00:02:46.950" style="s2">large part to protect you from the fear of<br />death, from death anxiety.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.950" end="00:02:53.269" style="s2">But there’s a bunch of problems with that<br />idea, not least that it actually side-steps</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.269" end="00:02:56.390" style="s2">the issue of the function of the belief system.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.390" end="00:03:01.170" style="s2">It’s like, you don’t exactly have a belief<br />system to make philosophical sense out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.170" end="00:03:02.790" style="s2">the world.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.790" end="00:03:12.439" style="s2">You have a system of tools, that are embodied,<br />that allow you to actually act in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.439" end="00:03:18.719" style="s2">Now you might also have an articulated representation<br />of that on top that’s more or less accurate.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.719" end="00:03:22.209" style="s2">Probably less, all things considered.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.209" end="00:03:26.079" style="s2">And you know, maybe if your faith in that<br />is shaken, your faith in what you do will</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.079" end="00:03:29.650" style="s2">also be shaken, because the two things are<br />associated.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.650" end="00:03:34.680" style="s2">But we should always remember that a belief<br />system doesn’t just protect you from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.680" end="00:03:37.859" style="s2">fear of death, it protects you from death.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.859" end="00:03:39.319" style="s2">And that’s a lot different, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.319" end="00:03:46.849" style="s2">I mean, this whole thing is your set of skills,<br />and the perceptions and thoughts and emotions</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.849" end="00:03:51.300" style="s2">that go along with those skills, and then<br />it’s an integrated structure consisting</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.300" end="00:03:56.269" style="s2">of the particular manner in which you’ve<br />integrated all your own little sub-parts and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.269" end="00:03:57.569" style="s2">then in relationship to the whole community.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.569" end="00:04:03.810" style="s2">You could also think about it, in some sense,<br />as a holographic representation of the culture.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.810" end="00:04:07.980" style="s2">Now, I don’t know how much you guys know<br />about holographs.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.980" end="00:04:10.099" style="s2">I don’t know very much about them either.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.099" end="00:04:15.279" style="s2">But there are some things I know about them…<br />so if you shine a light on a holograph, you’ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.279" end="00:04:21.949" style="s2">get a 3D image of whatever was there when<br />the holograph was created; it’s created</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.949" end="00:04:24.930" style="s2">by lasers.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.930" end="00:04:28.889" style="s2">And if you take a holograph and you break<br />it into pieces, and then you shine a light</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.889" end="00:04:33.220" style="s2">on the pieces, you get the object in each<br />piece.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.220" end="00:04:35.639" style="s2">But it’s low resolution.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.639" end="00:04:39.879" style="s2">It’s a nice way of thinking about a person.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.879" end="00:04:45.729" style="s2">Like if your brain is damaged you’ll be<br />there, but as a lower resolution representation</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.729" end="00:04:46.729" style="s2">of yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.729" end="00:04:49.530" style="s2">But it’s also a really nice way of thinking<br />about what culture is.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.530" end="00:05:00.349" style="s2">You know, culture is this massive structure<br />of multiple levels and domains, but it’s</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.349" end="00:05:01.349" style="s2">reflected in each of us.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.349" end="00:05:03.460" style="s2">Like, we’re each partial carriers of it.</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.460" end="00:05:08.610" style="s2">So we embody a partial representation of the<br />structure.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.610" end="00:05:10.940" style="s2">I mean literally, we embody it.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.940" end="00:05:12.289" style="s2">And then we also represent it abstractly.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.289" end="00:05:18.740" style="s2">And you know, part of the reason that you<br />go to a university is to, in some sense, improve</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.740" end="00:05:21.360" style="s2">your capacity to articulate your structure.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.360" end="00:05:25.650" style="s2">Right, because you’re a cultural creature…<br />it’s like, why are you the way you are?</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.650" end="00:05:29.879" style="s2">Well, some of it is psychological, some of<br />it is sociological, some of it is historical.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.879" end="00:05:31.580" style="s2">Like a lot of it is historical.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.580" end="00:05:37.550" style="s2">So when you go and you study a social science<br />or a humanity, you’re studying your own</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.550" end="00:05:38.789" style="s2">personality.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.789" end="00:05:48.560" style="s2">Now, I wrote a paper a while back with a couple<br />of my graduate students, and I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.560" end="00:05:50.110" style="s2">called The Entropy…</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.110" end="00:05:54.669" style="s2">God, you’d think I would remember this…</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.669" end="00:05:57.050" style="s2">The Entropy… doesn’t matter.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.050" end="00:06:02.750" style="s2">The hypothesis was, and this is something<br />I’ve been think about for a long time, that</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.750" end="00:06:07.400" style="s2">the world is very, very complex, and so what<br />that means is that the act of getting from</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.400" end="00:06:10.810" style="s2">one place to another is often very, very difficult.</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.810" end="00:06:14.880" style="s2">And part of what you’re doing when you put<br />together a functional sub-module is you’re</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.880" end="00:06:19.820" style="s2">putting together a little routine that will<br />enable you to transform some part of time</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.820" end="00:06:23.990" style="s2">and space from what it is into what you want<br />it to be.</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.990" end="00:06:27.919" style="s2">And in some sense what you’re doing is reducing<br />the complexity of that situation.</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.919" end="00:06:30.930" style="s2">So imagine this, you’re going for your job<br />interview.</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.930" end="00:06:33.509" style="s2">And you’re knocking ‘em dead.</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.509" end="00:06:34.520" style="s2">What happens?</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.520" end="00:06:42.229" style="s2">Well, a whole bunch of possibilities, all<br />that set of possibilities that was concerning</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.229" end="00:06:46.730" style="s2">you, starts to collapse towards a single solution.</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.730" end="00:06:52.229" style="s2">And that single solution is, if you’re doing<br />very well in the interview, it’s a positive</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.229" end="00:06:53.229" style="s2">solution.</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.229" end="00:06:56.560" style="s2">So you’re anxiety disappears and it’s<br />replaced with positive emotion.</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.560" end="00:07:01.060" style="s2">You get enthusiastic and excited, because<br />what’s happening in that room is that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.060" end="00:07:04.030" style="s2">path to a desirable future is opening.</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.030" end="00:07:07.910" style="s2">Now you can’t see any of this, you know,<br />because we’re so blinded by the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.910" end="00:07:14.910" style="s2">we see objects… we fail to perceive, in<br />any articulated sense, what it is that we’re</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.910" end="00:07:15.910" style="s2">actually dealing with.</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.910" end="00:07:21.110" style="s2">And I think that one way of thinking about<br />it is that you’re always on the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.110" end="00:07:24.539" style="s2">something that’s potential, and that’s<br />where you exist.</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.539" end="00:07:30.099" style="s2">You exist on this moving boundary of potential.</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.099" end="00:07:37.449" style="s2">And you can interact with it such that you<br />form it and it passes by you into the past.</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.449" end="00:07:45.729" style="s2">And hopefully you’re forming it in a way<br />that is in concordance with your better health</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.729" end="00:07:50.229" style="s2">and perhaps with the better health of the<br />people around you, that would be optimal.</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.229" end="00:07:54.159" style="s2">So you’re realising the potential in a genuine,<br />non-metaphorical sense.</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.159" end="00:07:58.740" style="s2">And that’s the thing about these representations,<br />you know.</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.740" end="00:08:03.110" style="s2">They’re often described as mythical, or<br />mythological, or metaphorical.</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.110" end="00:08:05.469" style="s2">But you know, they’re really not metaphorical.</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.469" end="00:08:11.509" style="s2">Well, that’s not exactly right, because<br />the Great Mother, the Great Father, they’re</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.509" end="00:08:17.720" style="s2">partially metaphorical but the thing that<br />they stand for as metaphors is something other</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.720" end="00:08:21.849" style="s2">than the things that we conceptualise when<br />we look at the world from an objective perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.849" end="00:08:26.969" style="s2">Now, we’ve talked a little bit about the<br />figure of the Dragon of Chaos, and I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.969" end="00:08:32.560" style="s2">that out of all the metaphorical images, it’s<br />the most difficult to grasp, because it’s</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.560" end="00:08:37.820" style="s2">that which has not yet been encountered, so<br />it’s neither unknown nor known.</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.820" end="00:08:41.029" style="s2">And you think, well you can’t even describe<br />that.</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.029" end="00:08:45.230" style="s2">Yeah, but you can encounter it, and you can<br />encounter it when you go into a situation</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.230" end="00:08:46.290" style="s2">that’s radically new.</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.290" end="00:08:51.871" style="s2">Let’s say it’s just the second before<br />you walk into a high-stakes interview, you</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.871" end="00:08:54.070" style="s2">know, just before you open the door.</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.070" end="00:08:58.920" style="s2">I would say that’s as close as you get,<br />in a normal day, to a direct encounter with</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.920" end="00:09:01.860" style="s2">the dragon of chaos, because you don’t know<br />what’s going to happen.</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.860" end="00:09:05.870" style="s2">And to say, well, you’re in a room and there’s<br />a door in front of you, you know it’s almost</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.870" end="00:09:07.820" style="s2">moronic to think of it that way, right?</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.820" end="00:09:10.360" style="s2">Because what the hell does that have to do<br />with anything?</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.360" end="00:09:17.970" style="s2">It’s… what’s in there is unbelievably…<br />like it’s the localisation of unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.970" end="00:09:19.530" style="s2">complex webs of causality.</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.530" end="00:09:22.149" style="s2">That’s what’s waiting for you inside that<br />room.</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.149" end="00:09:27.089" style="s2">And then you might say, well is it structured<br />in any real way, and the answer to that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.089" end="00:09:28.089" style="s2">not really.</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.089" end="00:09:33.190" style="s2">It’s no more structured than… it’s even<br />less structured than a book you’re reading.</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.190" end="00:09:37.139" style="s2">You know, if you’re reading a book you might<br />say, well where’s the meaning in this book?</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.139" end="00:09:40.399" style="s2">And the answer to that is, well it’s not<br />in the book.</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.399" end="00:09:44.910" style="s2">Like it’s partly there, because you need<br />the words and the sentences and the paragraphs</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.910" end="00:09:49.320" style="s2">and all that, but you need the whole cultural<br />context around it in order to interpret it.</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.320" end="00:09:52.160" style="s2">So you’re not reading it blank.</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:56.760" style="s2">You come to it with a set of, a very large<br />set of presuppositions.</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.760" end="00:10:00.350" style="s2">Enough of them so that you can understand<br />the author.</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.350" end="00:10:05.450" style="s2">Now maybe you can’t, and the book’s over<br />your head, or it’s badly written, but typically,</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.450" end="00:10:11.339" style="s2">you come at it with the machinery in place,<br />so that when you interact with the words and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.339" end="00:10:17.170" style="s2">the phrases and the sentences and so forth,<br />revelations of new meaning pour forth.</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.170" end="00:10:21.829" style="s2">And so, I don’t know how to say it any clearer<br />than that, that’s what the meaning of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.829" end="00:10:22.829" style="s2">book is.</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.829" end="00:10:26.279" style="s2">And it’s in the dialectical interaction<br />between you and the book.</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.279" end="00:10:31.060" style="s2">Well, if you walk into an interview room,<br />it’s even less given, in some sense, than</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.060" end="00:10:32.060" style="s2">the book, right.</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.060" end="00:10:36.170" style="s2">Because what’s going to happen in there,<br />which really means which of the many futures</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.170" end="00:10:41.660" style="s2">that that room contains is going to manifest<br />itself, depends very much on how you act.</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.660" end="00:10:48.410" style="s2">So, it’s in that way that you collapse the<br />potential that’s in a particular place and</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.410" end="00:10:53.860" style="s2">you extract something out of it that’s…<br />well, and that’s when it gets tricky…</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.860" end="00:10:56.100" style="s2">neutral, positive, or negative?</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.100" end="00:10:57.760" style="s2">Maybe you bomb the interview, right?</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.760" end="00:10:59.850" style="s2">And then you might say, well what’s happened?</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.850" end="00:11:00.850" style="s2">What happened?</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.850" end="00:11:04.300" style="s2">Well that’s a very complicated question.</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.300" end="00:11:05.890" style="s2">Then you’re stuck with this hierarchy, right.</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.890" end="00:11:08.190" style="s2">And that’s what you’re going to do when<br />you go home.</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.190" end="00:11:12.079" style="s2">You’re going to say “well maybe I didn’t<br />dress properly, or maybe I didn’t get to</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.079" end="00:11:15.720" style="s2">the interview on time, or they asked me a<br />bunch of questions I wasn’t prepared for,</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.720" end="00:11:20.320" style="s2">or Jesus, I didn’t know anything about what’s<br />going on, my whole education was a waste of</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.320" end="00:11:22.199" style="s2">time, and what the hell am I doing”?</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.199" end="00:11:24.889" style="s2">And then you might go “I’m never going<br />to get a job”.</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.889" end="00:11:29.790" style="s2">And you know, you could say in some sense<br />that all of those hypotheses, as you move</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.790" end="00:11:37.510" style="s2">up and down the hierarchy, you move from trivial<br />trouble to really not good trouble, as you</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.510" end="00:11:43.220" style="s2">bounce, and all of that is an attempt to specify,<br />in some sense, what that room contained.</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.220" end="00:11:44.970" style="s2">And it’s not easy.</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.970" end="00:11:51.460" style="s2">It’s weird too, because the room can contain<br />things that alter your past.</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.460" end="00:11:56.920" style="s2">Because maybe you say, well maybe you’re<br />going for a computer science job, maybe you’re</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.920" end="00:11:57.920" style="s2">not, whatever.</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.920" end="00:12:01.150" style="s2">You go in there and you think you’re the<br />top person in your class, and maybe you were,</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.150" end="00:12:04.260" style="s2">but you know the people in there are so far<br />ahead of you that you can’t even imagine</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.260" end="00:12:05.260" style="s2">ever catching up.</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.260" end="00:12:11.279" style="s2">And you know, when you come out of there,<br />the manner in which you construe your educational</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.279" end="00:12:14.399" style="s2">history is going to be radically transformed.</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.399" end="00:12:18.339" style="s2">So there’s a lot of trouble in that room.</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.339" end="00:12:20.170" style="s2">There’s a lot.</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.170" end="00:12:24.200" style="s2">Now one of the things we though in this paper…<br />you can think of each of those little eggs,</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.200" end="00:12:32.260" style="s2">they’re really eggs, as a container, and<br />what they contain is entropy, trouble.</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.260" end="00:12:35.470" style="s2">And the smaller ones contain smaller amounts<br />of entropy and the bigger ones contain bigger</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.470" end="00:12:36.470" style="s2">amounts of entropy.</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.470" end="00:12:38.880" style="s2">And so, here’s another example.</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.880" end="00:12:44.080" style="s2">You’re driving down the highway and your<br />car sputters and grinds to a halt.</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.080" end="00:12:48.230" style="s2">Maybe it makes a nice radical noise while<br />it’s doing it.</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.230" end="00:12:51.130" style="s2">So okay, well, what happened?</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.130" end="00:12:58.630" style="s2">Well the answer is, the simple answer is,<br />your car malfunctioned and you had to pull</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.630" end="00:12:59.630" style="s2">off the road.</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.630" end="00:13:00.630" style="s2">That’s a really object-oriented analysis.</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.630" end="00:13:04.800" style="s2">But what’s actually happened is that you<br />had a conceptualisation of the car as a pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.800" end="00:13:11.279" style="s2">tool, because what do you know about the damn<br />car?</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.279" end="00:13:17.600" style="s2">The car was an affordance, that’s the right<br />word, that would get you from point A to point</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.600" end="00:13:20.170" style="s2">B, and you could have a very low-resolution<br />model of it, right?</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.170" end="00:13:24.680" style="s2">It can just look like a plastic shell, which<br />is sort of what a car looks like.</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.680" end="00:13:29.360" style="s2">And as long as you see how low-resolution<br />that is, you could replace it with a cartoon</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.360" end="00:13:32.339" style="s2">and you wouldn’t even notice.</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.339" end="00:13:36.089" style="s2">That’s good enough representation as long<br />as the thing is doing what it’s supposed</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.089" end="00:13:37.089" style="s2">to be doing.</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.089" end="00:13:40.560" style="s2">But as soon as it stops doing what it’s<br />supposed to be doing then it could be any</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.560" end="00:13:42.130" style="s2">old thing.</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.130" end="00:13:43.930" style="s2">And you think, well what does any old thing<br />mean?</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.930" end="00:13:47.160" style="s2">Well maybe you’re on a deserted highway<br />and it’s one o’clock in the morning.</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.160" end="00:13:49.430" style="s2">And you know, someone pulls over to help you.</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.430" end="00:13:51.470" style="s2">Okay, well, what’s that?</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.470" end="00:13:56.290" style="s2">Well, you know, believe me, your imagination<br />will rapidly span the world of possibility</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.290" end="00:14:00.290" style="s2">from “oh good, someone’s come to help”<br />to “I’m going to be dragged off in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.290" end="00:14:01.560" style="s2">bush and killed”.</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.560" end="00:14:05.670" style="s2">And that’s all contained in that sequence<br />of events.</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.670" end="00:14:11.440" style="s2">And then even if no one does stop, and you<br />have to worry about exactly what’s gone</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.440" end="00:14:13.880" style="s2">wrong, and you have to worry about how you’re<br />going to fix it and you have to worry about</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.880" end="00:14:16.950" style="s2">the mechanic that might help you, and you<br />have to concern yourself with whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.950" end="00:14:19.779" style="s2">you’re going to need a new car, and then<br />you have to think about your finances.</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.779" end="00:14:28.160" style="s2">It’s like, the idea that that car is a bounded<br />entity, like it looks, is only true when it</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.160" end="00:14:29.160" style="s2">works.</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.160" end="00:14:33.029" style="s2">And as soon as it doesn’t work, then God,<br />it’s any old thing.</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.029" end="00:14:36.100" style="s2">And that, in some sense, is the dragon of<br />chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.100" end="00:14:40.670" style="s2">Now, what seems to me to have happened…<br />because you might think, well how did people</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.670" end="00:14:44.480" style="s2">come to conceptualise such a thing, because<br />I would think that, of all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.480" end="00:14:50.310" style="s2">are difficult to conceptualise, the category<br />of all things that you have not yet encountered</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.310" end="00:14:52.839" style="s2">is the most difficult thing to discover, right?</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.839" end="00:14:53.839" style="s2">It’s kind of like zero.</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:14:57.550" style="s2">It took people a long time to figure out zero,<br />and no wonder.</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.550" end="00:15:00.010" style="s2">We need a symbol for nothing.</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.010" end="00:15:02.470" style="s2">Well, this is even worse.</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.470" end="00:15:05.149" style="s2">We need a representation for potential.</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.149" end="00:15:06.610" style="s2">Well, you think, why?</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.610" end="00:15:11.290" style="s2">Well it’s because it’s actually potential<br />that you’re interacting with all the time.</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.290" end="00:15:17.569" style="s2">Now what seems to me to have happened was<br />that… you know, this is an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.569" end="00:15:23.730" style="s2">just-so story, so I’m not assuming that<br />it worked precisely this way, but it doesn’t</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.730" end="00:15:24.730" style="s2">matter.</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.730" end="00:15:28.290" style="s2">Because I’m going to touch on the appropriate<br />features.</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.290" end="00:15:30.940" style="s2">Well one of the things we know about social<br />animals, generally speaking, and animals in</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.940" end="00:15:34.769" style="s2">general, is that they have a territory, right?</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.769" end="00:15:37.829" style="s2">And so you think, well what is their territory<br />exactly?</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.829" end="00:15:40.330" style="s2">And you might say, well you can mark it out.</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.330" end="00:15:46.410" style="s2">Here’s a… oh, what would have a territory?</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.410" end="00:15:50.230" style="s2">Like a tiger, they’re pretty solitary, so<br />it’ll be simple.</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.230" end="00:15:51.949" style="s2">They have a big territory, right?</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.949" end="00:15:54.950" style="s2">And it’s hundreds of square miles.</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.950" end="00:15:57.899" style="s2">And the reason for that is, well they’re<br />tigers.</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.899" end="00:16:01.740" style="s2">You can’t have like fifty of them, because<br />they’ll just eat everything that’s there.</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.740" end="00:16:06.630" style="s2">You know, you have to have a big territory<br />to support one apex predator.</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.630" end="00:16:09.560" style="s2">So then you might say, well what exactly is<br />the territory of the tiger?</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.560" end="00:16:13.000" style="s2">And you’d say well here are its boundaries.</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.000" end="00:16:15.050" style="s2">This is where it roams.</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.050" end="00:16:18.690" style="s2">But that’s not the right way of thinking<br />about the territory of the tiger.</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.690" end="00:16:24.930" style="s2">Because the territory of the tiger is actually<br />all the places where, when the tiger does</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.930" end="00:16:29.319" style="s2">its thing, the things that the tiger wants<br />or expects, happen.</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.319" end="00:16:30.730" style="s2">That’s the tiger’s territory.</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.730" end="00:16:32.709" style="s2">It’s the same with you.</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.709" end="00:16:36.650" style="s2">You’re at home wherever you know what to<br />do.</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.650" end="00:16:42.970" style="s2">And what you’re doing when you know what<br />to do is you know how to match this hierarchy,</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.970" end="00:16:47.240" style="s2">which is partly action-oriented, you know<br />how to match the hierarchy with the situation.</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.240" end="00:16:53.819" style="s2">So that when you put it into practice, the<br />potential that’s there transforms itself</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.819" end="00:16:55.480" style="s2">into what you’re aiming at.</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.480" end="00:16:57.430" style="s2">And that’s your territory.</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.430" end="00:17:01.699" style="s2">And you need to think about it that way because<br />your territory can shift very rapidly on you,</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.699" end="00:17:05.350" style="s2">and if you think about it geographically,<br />it’s kind of confusing.</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.350" end="00:17:08.250" style="s2">So let’s say you’re on the subway that<br />you always take.</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.250" end="00:17:11.882" style="s2">And then someone sits down beside you and<br />they’re muttering away madly and they have</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.882" end="00:17:14.020" style="s2">a pretty malevolent look on their face.</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.020" end="00:17:17.189" style="s2">And you get a glimpse inside their coat and<br />there’s a knife.</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.189" end="00:17:20.410" style="s2">It’s like, you’re not in your territory<br />anymore!</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.410" end="00:17:26.870" style="s2">And the fact that all of the objective entities<br />are still there arrayed around you is just</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.870" end="00:17:32.960" style="s2">a… it’s nothing more than a… it’s<br />a delusion at that point to think that those</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.960" end="00:17:35.730" style="s2">things characterise where you are.</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.730" end="00:17:41.630" style="s2">Okay so, if you’re willing to consider territory<br />as that… it’s a space-time continuum,</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.630" end="00:17:42.630" style="s2">okay?</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.630" end="00:17:43.960" style="s2">And the reason I’m stressing that…</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.960" end="00:17:49.020" style="s2">I mean, first of all, whatever reality is,<br />is a space-time continuum, right?</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.020" end="00:17:52.090" style="s2">It’s got three dimensions of space and one<br />dimension of time.</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.090" end="00:17:58.280" style="s2">And everyone knows that, as we sit here, more<br />or less stable in three dimensions, time flows</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.280" end="00:18:00.289" style="s2">past us, in some sense.</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.289" end="00:18:05.409" style="s2">And so the three-dimensional reality is transforming<br />all by itself, just because of time.</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.409" end="00:18:11.130" style="s2">Okay, and so when we’re mapping out our<br />territories, we map out space-time territories.</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.130" end="00:18:16.410" style="s2">And so, that means that not only do you know<br />where you are, you know when you are.</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.410" end="00:18:20.110" style="s2">And if you’re in your territory you know<br />how to act through that place and that time</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.110" end="00:18:24.820" style="s2">so that you transform the potential that’s<br />there into whatever it is that you’re aiming</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.820" end="00:18:25.820" style="s2">at.</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.820" end="00:18:28.110" style="s2">Okay, so that’s your territory.</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.110" end="00:18:36.440" style="s2">Now, that territory is isomorphic evolutionarily<br />with lots of things, which you could also</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.440" end="00:18:37.870" style="s2">confuse geographically.</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.870" end="00:18:44.570" style="s2">So you might think of a human territory as<br />something like… it’s probably, the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.570" end="00:18:48.270" style="s2">human territory is probably a fire.</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.270" end="00:18:53.950" style="s2">And so the fire is a place of light in the<br />darkness and then you could think of rings,</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.950" end="00:19:00.350" style="s2">concentric rings of relative safety surrounding<br />the fire.</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.350" end="00:19:04.140" style="s2">So right beside the fire, where it’s warm<br />and light and there’s lots of other people,</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.140" end="00:19:06.840" style="s2">man that’s explored territory, you know?</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.840" end="00:19:10.600" style="s2">But then if you start wandering away from<br />the fire into the bush, especially if you’re</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.600" end="00:19:16.840" style="s2">in a very biologically active area, then the<br />farther away you get from the fire the more</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.840" end="00:19:18.390" style="s2">you’re going outside your territory.</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.390" end="00:19:21.910" style="s2">And you can tell that’s happening because<br />your whole nervous system starts to function</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.910" end="00:19:22.910" style="s2">differently.</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.910" end="00:19:29.000" style="s2">What happens is that the nervous system parts<br />that you were using while you were in known</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.000" end="00:19:34.080" style="s2">territory, they just shut down, and then other<br />nervous system elements that you used in unknown</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.080" end="00:19:35.860" style="s2">territory start to turn on.</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.860" end="00:19:38.770" style="s2">And generally you’re not very happy about<br />that.</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.770" end="00:19:46.610" style="s2">Because when you’re aware you’ve mastered<br />the territory, you can presume that neutral</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.610" end="00:19:51.480" style="s2">or moderately good things are going to happen,<br />with the possibility of something great now</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.480" end="00:19:53.070" style="s2">and then.</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.070" end="00:19:58.640" style="s2">But as you move away from that, it flips in<br />some sense to “I don’t know what’s going</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.640" end="00:20:02.610" style="s2">on here and I might fall” to “something’s<br />going to bite me” to “I’m going to die</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.610" end="00:20:08.270" style="s2">a painful death”, you know, and you don’t<br />use the same circuits to process the first</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.270" end="00:20:10.670" style="s2">situation to process the first situation as<br />you do to process the second.</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.670" end="00:20:14.130" style="s2">You don’t even like having the second one<br />on.</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.130" end="00:20:18.840" style="s2">So you know what it’s like… maybe you’ve<br />been feeling a bit down, because that always</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.840" end="00:20:22.789" style="s2">helps, and you wake up at three in the morning<br />and you’re worrying about six things and</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.789" end="00:20:26.880" style="s2">you hear some random noise somewhere there<br />shouldn’t be a random noise.</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.880" end="00:20:33.110" style="s2">Well, how you feel right then, that’s what<br />it is like to have the system that deals with</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.110" end="00:20:34.500" style="s2">the unexpected ‘on’.</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.500" end="00:20:36.539" style="s2">You’re like a prey animal.</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.539" end="00:20:41.020" style="s2">Really, really, exactly like one, because<br />that’s what you actually are in many ways.</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.020" end="00:20:46.240" style="s2">So you know, your whole biology transforms<br />so that you’re prepared for God only knows</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.240" end="00:20:47.250" style="s2">what.</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.250" end="00:20:51.789" style="s2">Well, what seemed to have happened in the<br />course of evolution was that, when we were</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.789" end="00:21:01.380" style="s2">smaller creatures, and far after that, before<br />let’s say we figured out how to use throwing</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.380" end="00:21:09.289" style="s2">sticks and slings, and then later maybe bows<br />and arrows, or maybe even sticks, like, we</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.289" end="00:21:10.740" style="s2">were getting eaten a lot.</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.740" end="00:21:14.830" style="s2">I think I told you guys last week that they<br />just discovered this damn cat in Africa that</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.830" end="00:21:16.470" style="s2">looks like it preyed on our fore-bearers.</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.470" end="00:21:21.490" style="s2">And we have pretty hard skulls so the normal<br />cat can’t really gnaw through them, but</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.490" end="00:21:24.779" style="s2">this cat had a special set of teeth, and if<br />it grabbed the front of your head it would</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.779" end="00:21:27.830" style="s2">drive one of its teeth right through the back<br />of your skull.</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.830" end="00:21:32.610" style="s2">So you know, the hominids were preyed on enough<br />so that they had their own predators.</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.610" end="00:21:37.230" style="s2">Well, so you know, that’s just not very<br />pleasant.</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.230" end="00:21:39.380" style="s2">And then, that’s by the time we were hominids.</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.380" end="00:21:43.110" style="s2">You can go back farther than that to when<br />we were little tree rats, roughly speaking,</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.110" end="00:21:44.770" style="s2">and then all sorts of things were eating us.</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.770" end="00:21:49.760" style="s2">There were a lot of reptiles back then, sixty<br />million years ago, and they weren’t pleasant.</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.760" end="00:21:54.210" style="s2">There were still dinosaurs around sixty million<br />years ago.</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.210" end="00:21:59.080" style="s2">You know, that’s a lot of evolutionary time<br />for us to have developed biological systems</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.080" end="00:22:03.440" style="s2">that distinguish between places we’re safe<br />and places we’re not safe.</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.440" end="00:22:12.480" style="s2">Well, you roughly have one set of neuropsychological,<br />neuropsychophysiological functions for familiar</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.480" end="00:22:15.210" style="s2">territory and another set for unfamiliar territory.</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.210" end="00:22:21.160" style="s2">Now what I would say… this is where this<br />becomes, I think, radically different to terror</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.160" end="00:22:27.560" style="s2">management theory, what these hierarchy is<br />doing when it’s functioning is shutting</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.560" end="00:22:32.570" style="s2">off… is keeping a system that operates in<br />unexplored territory shut off.</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.570" end="00:22:33.570" style="s2">And you like that.</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.570" end="00:22:36.419" style="s2">And that’s when you’re calm.</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.419" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">Like you are in here, you’re relatively<br />at home here, because you assume that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.120" end="00:22:45.909" style="s2">know how to act here, as long as you sit and<br />ask questions more or less appropriately and</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.909" end="00:22:49.190" style="s2">you don’t bother people and you don’t<br />talk on your phone, and various other things,</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.190" end="00:22:55.520" style="s2">the probability that you’re going to confronted<br />by an angry primate or some other predator</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.520" end="00:22:57.679" style="s2">is very, very low.</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.679" end="00:23:03.210" style="s2">And so, you’d say, well you’re normal.</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.210" end="00:23:05.059" style="s2">You feel like you do normally here.</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.059" end="00:23:08.970" style="s2">But I would say the only reason you feel that<br />way normally to begin with is because you</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.970" end="00:23:12.220" style="s2">don’t go places where you feel not normal.</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.220" end="00:23:13.520" style="s2">You stay away from them.</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.520" end="00:23:17.309" style="s2">And everyone knows what those places are like.</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.309" end="00:23:20.669" style="s2">I saw a real cool example of this once.</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.669" end="00:23:26.620" style="s2">I was down by OCAD at about midnight on a<br />Saturday night.</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.620" end="00:23:32.159" style="s2">You know, it was in the summer so there were<br />all these kids, really, wandering around in</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.159" end="00:23:34.700" style="s2">their party clothes and going to the clubs.</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.700" end="00:23:40.610" style="s2">And I was standing there watching and I looked<br />through a park at this street that runs by</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.610" end="00:23:44.559" style="s2">near OCAD and there were these houses.</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.559" end="00:23:49.419" style="s2">There was a row of houses and there were three<br />houses here and they were all really nicely</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.419" end="00:23:52.820" style="s2">taken care of, then there was a house here,<br />and then there were some more houses over</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.820" end="00:23:54.299" style="s2">here that were well taken care of.</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.299" end="00:23:57.289" style="s2">And that house in the middle was condemned.</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.289" end="00:24:01.100" style="s2">So the roof was rotting and they’d boarded<br />up all the windows, and the fence was falling</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.100" end="00:24:05.320" style="s2">off and there was garbage in the yard, it<br />was a derelict place, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.320" end="00:24:07.559" style="s2">So that’s kind of a spooky place.</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.559" end="00:24:13.470" style="s2">Well, while I was standing there this guy<br />walked down the street, and he was very intoxicated,</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.470" end="00:24:16.140" style="s2">and he wasn’t very happy and he was sort<br />of muttering to himself.</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.140" end="00:24:20.470" style="s2">And he passed the three houses that were in<br />pretty good shape, and then as soon as he</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.470" end="00:24:25.120" style="s2">got in front of the house that was derelict,<br />he just started to rant, and he was pounding</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.120" end="00:24:29.909" style="s2">up and down and muttering paranoid things,<br />and you know, sounding really dangerous.</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.909" end="00:24:34.809" style="s2">But he kept more or less moving forward, and<br />then just after he got back past that borderline</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.809" end="00:24:39.610" style="s2">and back into the more or less normal neighbourhood,<br />he switched back to just mumbling quietly</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.610" end="00:24:40.610" style="s2">and kept moving forward.</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.610" end="00:24:43.820" style="s2">And you know he was just so damn intoxicated,<br />there isn’t a possibility that he noticed</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.820" end="00:24:48.260" style="s2">what had happened, but he was being cued by<br />the surroundings, you know, and it was a different</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.260" end="00:24:54.419" style="s2">‘him’ when he was in unexplored territory,<br />something that had degenerated back into chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.419" end="00:24:58.029" style="s2">So the anger and aggression came out of him<br />because that’s often necessary if you’re</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.029" end="00:25:00.460" style="s2">going to be where there’s chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.460" end="00:25:04.720" style="s2">You know, and chaos can burst forth, and does,<br />all the time in people’s lives, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.720" end="00:25:07.970" style="s2">If you’re sitting around the dinner table<br />with your family, and everything’s going</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.970" end="00:25:12.820" style="s2">pretty well but someone touches on one of<br />those topics that you should just shut the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.820" end="00:25:16.710" style="s2">hell up about, it can take almost no time<br />at all before the whole thing unravels, and</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.710" end="00:25:19.169" style="s2">then God only knows where you are.</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.169" end="00:25:20.880" style="s2">And it’s not pleasant.</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.880" end="00:25:28.320" style="s2">So instead of our belief systems protecting<br />us from death anxiety, our hierarchical pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.320" end="00:25:33.860" style="s2">systems for interacting with the world stop<br />the parts of our brain that deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.860" end="00:25:35.919" style="s2">unexpected from being on.</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.919" end="00:25:42.290" style="s2">And they don’t do that because we believe,<br />they do that because when we enact those structures,</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.290" end="00:25:44.880" style="s2">all hell doesn’t break loose.</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.880" end="00:25:46.770" style="s2">So there’s nothing illusory about it.</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.770" end="00:25:50.580" style="s2">Now, you know, you might say, well, in the<br />final analysis, does it really protect you</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.580" end="00:25:51.899" style="s2">from chaos?</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.899" end="00:25:56.850" style="s2">And you know, that’s an okay question, but<br />most of the time that’s irrelevant.</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.850" end="00:26:02.060" style="s2">It isn’t always irrelevant, but most of<br />the time it just doesn’t matter.</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.060" end="00:26:08.080" style="s2">And the other thing is that much of the time<br />it doesn’t even matter if you believe this.</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.080" end="00:26:14.549" style="s2">By which I would mean, you have an articulated<br />representation of it, it’s also a self-representation,</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.549" end="00:26:18.340" style="s2">and you carry that around, and maybe you have<br />a crisis of faith and you don’t believe</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.340" end="00:26:20.470" style="s2">in that, you still act all this stuff out.</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.470" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">And most of the time you’re still extremely<br />well-protected by it.</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:29.280" style="s2">So it’s more robust than merely the articulated<br />or imagined version.</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.280" end="00:26:30.710" style="s2">It’s a lot deeper than that.</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.710" end="00:26:33.130" style="s2">It’s only a tiny part of its structure.</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.130" end="00:26:38.419" style="s2">And so, we should never really talk about<br />‘belief systems’ exactly, especially not</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.419" end="00:26:43.610" style="s2">if they’re shared with very many other people,<br />because they’re not structures of belief,</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.610" end="00:26:45.820" style="s2">they’re much deeper structures than that.</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.820" end="00:26:50.980" style="s2">And the belief part is only a pale reflection<br />of the underlying reality.</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.980" end="00:26:52.700" style="s2">Okay, so that…</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.700" end="00:26:56.520" style="s2">I presume that makes sense, and you can make<br />sense of that in your own life.</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.520" end="00:27:00.169" style="s2">You know, there’s other things that can<br />happen too that I should mention, is lots</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.169" end="00:27:05.450" style="s2">of times people have chaos… you know, you<br />think your body is explored territory, it’s</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.450" end="00:27:06.970" style="s2">sort of the ultimate explored territory.</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.970" end="00:27:11.480" style="s2">But I would say, don’t get too convinced<br />about that.</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.480" end="00:27:15.039" style="s2">That can also switch in a moment, and it happens<br />to people all the time.</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.039" end="00:27:20.720" style="s2">So if you get a tooth pulled, it takes your<br />tongue like three months to map the inside</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.720" end="00:27:22.080" style="s2">of your mouth again.</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.080" end="00:27:26.769" style="s2">So that’s re-familiarising your brain with<br />the new territory, right?</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.769" end="00:27:28.370" style="s2">And that’s very, very complicated.</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.370" end="00:27:31.130" style="s2">So your body representation is extremely complicated.</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.130" end="00:27:34.330" style="s2">And it’s really easy to screw up.</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.330" end="00:27:37.100" style="s2">So if you have someone go like that [crosses<br />forearms and hands and fingers] and then you</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.100" end="00:27:41.049" style="s2">point to one of their fingers in the middle<br />and get them to move it (don’t touch it),</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.049" end="00:27:46.059" style="s2">they often can’t, because just that’s<br />enough to boggle up their visual representation</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.059" end="00:27:47.130" style="s2">of their body.</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.130" end="00:27:51.580" style="s2">And so you can play all sorts of tricks on<br />people that way.</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.580" end="00:27:57.460" style="s2">So you know, your map of your body and your<br />body are sort of reasonably well associated,</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.460" end="00:28:03.659" style="s2">but they can be dissociated quite rapidly,<br />and you know that happens when, maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.659" end="00:28:06.570" style="s2">get a little hypochondriacal and start worrying<br />about your health.</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.570" end="00:28:09.530" style="s2">Something’s bugging you and you don’t<br />exactly know what it is.</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.530" end="00:28:13.700" style="s2">It’s like, well, all of a sudden you get<br />alienated from your body.</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.700" end="00:28:15.450" style="s2">And that can get really serious.</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.450" end="00:28:21.860" style="s2">And I’ve seen people after a car accident,<br />this was the most striking of this, this client</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.860" end="00:28:25.960" style="s2">I had had her shoulder up like this [stiffens<br />right shoulder].</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.960" end="00:28:30.120" style="s2">And I noticed she never really looked in the<br />direction of that arm and when she moved it</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.120" end="00:28:31.539" style="s2">she’d only move it about this far.</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.539" end="00:28:35.740" style="s2">And after seeing her for a while I thought<br />“oh, she’s afraid of that arm”.</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.740" end="00:28:37.850" style="s2">Now it had been hurt.</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.850" end="00:28:39.779" style="s2">Well why would you get afraid of your arm?</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.779" end="00:28:43.320" style="s2">Well, it doesn’t act like it used to, so<br />that’s annoying.</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.320" end="00:28:47.460" style="s2">And then when you move it wrong it hurts,<br />and then you also don’t know that if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.460" end="00:28:50.840" style="s2">move it wrong and it hurts, whether you’re<br />making it worse.</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.840" end="00:28:55.059" style="s2">So then you just kind of ignore it, and then<br />it’s sort of your arm and sort of not your</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.059" end="00:28:56.059" style="s2">arm.</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.059" end="00:29:00.990" style="s2">And I had her at one point, we just practiced<br />just doing this [loosens shoulder].</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.990" end="00:29:03.620" style="s2">I’d say, I’d do the action and say “can<br />you do this?”</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.620" end="00:29:04.620" style="s2">[Raises left arm slightly].</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.620" end="00:29:05.620" style="s2">She’d do it.</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.620" end="00:29:06.620" style="s2">And then I’d go “well can you do this?”</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.620" end="00:29:07.620" style="s2">[Raises arm slightly higher].</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.620" end="00:29:08.620" style="s2">And she’d do it.</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.620" end="00:29:09.620" style="s2">And then I’d say “can you do this?”</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.620" end="00:29:10.620" style="s2">[Raises arm even higher].</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.620" end="00:29:13.860" style="s2">We just kept doing this, it only took about<br />half an hour until she was up here [arm fully</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.860" end="00:29:17.340" style="s2">raised], and she said “I haven’t put my<br />arm up there for two years!”</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.340" end="00:29:19.159" style="s2">And then I did the same thing with her shoulder.</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.159" end="00:29:22.740" style="s2">I said, “Can you lift your shoulder?”</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.740" end="00:29:23.740" style="s2">“No.”</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.740" end="00:29:25.760" style="s2">“Can you lift it one-sixteenth of an inch?”</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.760" end="00:29:27.250" style="s2">Well, she could do that.</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.250" end="00:29:31.450" style="s2">Well, you know, sixteen times one-sixteenth<br />of an inch is an inch, and that’s starting</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.450" end="00:29:32.450" style="s2">to get there.</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.450" end="00:29:35.340" style="s2">And you know, she did this a bunch and then<br />her arm went down.</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.340" end="00:29:39.049" style="s2">So she’d been holding the damn arm up for<br />two years.</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.049" end="00:29:40.769" style="s2">Just try that.</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.769" end="00:29:44.350" style="s2">You know, I mean you do this [raises arm]<br />for five minutes and see what happens, just</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.350" end="00:29:48.299" style="s2">hold your shoulder up there for two years<br />and see what that does to the entire right</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.299" end="00:29:49.299" style="s2">side of your body.</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.299" end="00:29:51.100" style="s2">Like it’s really, really stressful.</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.100" end="00:29:56.919" style="s2">And then I did something strange, then, which<br />was a whim, but I think it was because I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.919" end="00:29:59.169" style="s2">embodying her because I was paying so close<br />attention.</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.169" end="00:30:02.740" style="s2">I asked her to come lean over my desk because<br />there was something about the way she was</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.740" end="00:30:05.220" style="s2">holding herself that was really bugging me.</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.220" end="00:30:09.700" style="s2">And so I asked her just to lean over my desk<br />and I pounded on her back down her spinal</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.700" end="00:30:14.340" style="s2">cord and she drooped her shoulders again and<br />then she cried for about half an hour.</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.340" end="00:30:19.409" style="s2">And again, it was because, she’d got hit<br />by a car, that’s just how she was, she just</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.409" end="00:30:23.680" style="s2">walked around like that, permanently, more<br />or less.</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.680" end="00:30:27.429" style="s2">And we worked it out of her reasonably well.</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.429" end="00:30:32.250" style="s2">But even your own damn body can become unexplored<br />territory.</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.250" end="00:30:37.820" style="s2">And that’s another way of understanding<br />that yin-yang symbol, right?</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.820" end="00:30:43.350" style="s2">You’ve got the black serpent, paisley, and<br />it’s got a little white dot in it.</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.350" end="00:30:48.260" style="s2">Which means that sometimes when things are<br />really broken all to hell a solution can come</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.260" end="00:30:52.110" style="s2">blasting forth and chaos turns into order.</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.110" end="00:30:58.590" style="s2">But more likely, you know, everything’s<br />going pretty nicely and up something comes</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.590" end="00:31:02.389" style="s2">and the chaos spills into the order.</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.389" end="00:31:04.460" style="s2">And that’s the world you live in.</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.460" end="00:31:06.720" style="s2">And that’s not a metaphor.</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.720" end="00:31:10.840" style="s2">And it’s really interesting to know that,<br />because then the question becomes “okay,</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.840" end="00:31:13.980" style="s2">well, what do you do in order and what do<br />you do in chaos?’</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.980" end="00:31:16.010" style="s2">Those are useful things to know.</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.010" end="00:31:19.720" style="s2">We kind of know what to do in order because<br />that sort of defines order.</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.720" end="00:31:23.769" style="s2">But we don’t really know what to do in chaos,<br />you know.</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.769" end="00:31:28.730" style="s2">In fact the field of mental health is in some<br />sense an attempt to figure that out.</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.730" end="00:31:32.340" style="s2">But I can tell you some things to do when<br />you’re in chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.340" end="00:31:35.430" style="s2">So let’s say you’re dealing with someone<br />who’s very, very ill.</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.430" end="00:31:38.010" style="s2">Or maybe it’s you that’s very, very ill.</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.010" end="00:31:41.530" style="s2">And so God only knows what’s going to happen<br />in the future.</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.530" end="00:31:43.050" style="s2">Or even next week.</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.050" end="00:31:47.779" style="s2">Well, the first thing you do is stop thinking<br />about next week and the future.</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.779" end="00:31:50.549" style="s2">Because it’s not calculable, right?</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.549" end="00:31:57.419" style="s2">The pathways have become so multiple and so<br />uncontrollable that if you think about them</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.419" end="00:31:59.740" style="s2">it’s just going to hurt you.</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.740" end="00:32:04.400" style="s2">And so, you know, you can’t just not think<br />about it, because that doesn’t work.</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.400" end="00:32:08.019" style="s2">But what you can do is narrow your time-frame<br />of analysis.</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.019" end="00:32:11.200" style="s2">You know, so instead of worrying about the<br />week, you think okay, well let’s make this</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.200" end="00:32:13.450" style="s2">day as good as it can be.</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.450" end="00:32:16.460" style="s2">And then if you’re really stressed, it’s<br />like, no we’re going to really work on this</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.460" end="00:32:17.990" style="s2">hour.</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.990" end="00:32:25.420" style="s2">And so what happens is you hyper-attend to<br />the local space-time area and that’s what</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.420" end="00:32:26.420" style="s2">you’ve got.</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.420" end="00:32:27.420" style="s2">You can work with that.</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.420" end="00:32:28.420" style="s2">And it really works.</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.420" end="00:32:31.120" style="s2">Like if you’re dealing with people who are<br />dying, for example, that’s what you do.</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.120" end="00:32:37.250" style="s2">You zero in to the right level of resolution,<br />fundamentally.</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.250" end="00:32:42.200" style="s2">And you can tell when it’s the right level<br />of resolution because you don’t feel like</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.200" end="00:32:43.210" style="s2">you don’t know what you’re doing anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.210" end="00:32:46.490" style="s2">“What am I doing here, what am I supposed<br />to do here, what does all this mean?”</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.490" end="00:32:47.679" style="s2">You don’t feel that anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.679" end="00:32:50.780" style="s2">Because those are the wrong questions at that<br />point in time.</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.780" end="00:32:54.740" style="s2">And you know, maybe you try to make the person<br />comfortable, and you pay attention, so you</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.740" end="00:33:00.400" style="s2">can take the right micro-movements and the<br />right micro-attitudes in those critical moments,</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.400" end="00:33:02.100" style="s2">and that’s what you do.</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.100" end="00:33:05.930" style="s2">And so that’s one way of dealing with the<br />underworld and you need to know that, because</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.930" end="00:33:08.299" style="s2">it’s going to happen.</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.299" end="00:33:13.770" style="s2">So if you’re really stressed, you think<br />about smaller amounts of space and time.</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.770" end="00:33:19.169" style="s2">And you try to get them right, it’s still<br />important to get it right, but the entropy</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.169" end="00:33:24.559" style="s2">is so high at that point, the landscape is<br />so complicated, that there’s no that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.559" end="00:33:28.760" style="s2">can map more than a few moments at a time.</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.760" end="00:33:31.250" style="s2">But it turns out often that that’s okay.</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.250" end="00:33:32.929" style="s2">That’s good enough.</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.929" end="00:33:37.250" style="s2">You know, obviously it’s not optimal, but<br />one thing you can be sure of is you can take</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.250" end="00:33:41.799" style="s2">a terrible situation and you can make it a<br />hell of a lot worse.</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.799" end="00:33:46.010" style="s2">So you know, if it’s a terrible situation<br />and you manage it as well as it can be managed,</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.010" end="00:33:48.019" style="s2">then maybe it’s only terrible.</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.019" end="00:33:51.899" style="s2">But if you take a terrible situation and you<br />manage it really badly, then it can be something</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.899" end="00:33:53.980" style="s2">that you never, ever recover from.</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.980" end="00:33:59.519" style="s2">So, I’m not trying to be hyper-optimistic<br />about this, I know people go through rough</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.519" end="00:34:00.519" style="s2">times.</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.519" end="00:34:03.070" style="s2">But there’s a difference between tragedy<br />and hell.</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.070" end="00:34:05.909" style="s2">And tragedy is when something happens and<br />you’re awake.</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.909" end="00:34:10.810" style="s2">And hell is when something terrible happens<br />and you’re not awake.</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.810" end="00:34:13.450" style="s2">And that’s a place you really don’t want<br />to go.</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.450" end="00:34:17.620" style="s2">So then the death of your father could turn<br />into the obliteration of your entire family.</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.620" end="00:34:22.680" style="s2">Well, you know, the first is bad enough, but<br />the second might well be unbearable.</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.680" end="00:34:27.670" style="s2">You know, because people often fight in circumstances<br />like that, and the family gets very, very</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.670" end="00:34:28.670" style="s2">stressed.</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.670" end="00:34:32.820" style="s2">It’s very common, for example, if a couple<br />has a sick child or a child that dies that</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.820" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2">they get divorced.</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.000" end="00:34:35.970" style="s2">It’s not surprising, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.970" end="00:34:40.100" style="s2">It’s not like they have a psychological<br />problem, they have a real problem.</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.100" end="00:34:44.410" style="s2">And they might be amplifying it with their<br />psychological problems, but all problems are</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.410" end="00:34:45.730" style="s2">not psychological.</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.730" end="00:34:50.740" style="s2">And that’s also useful to know, because<br />if you end up somewhere that you don’t expect,</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.740" end="00:34:54.610" style="s2">you’re going to be thinking (especially<br />if you’re conscientious): “If I wasn’t</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.610" end="00:34:58.520" style="s2">such a useless fool, I would have never ended<br />up here”.</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.520" end="00:35:02.521" style="s2">And there’s a much more pessimistic thought<br />than that that’s much more useful, which</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.521" end="00:35:07.380" style="s2">is: whether you were a fool or not you were<br />going to end up somewhere like this now and</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.380" end="00:35:08.380" style="s2">then.</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.380" end="00:35:13.420" style="s2">And you might think, God, that’s a horrible<br />thing to think, because that means that our</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.420" end="00:35:16.210" style="s2">destinies are uncontrollable, at least in<br />part.</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.210" end="00:35:18.110" style="s2">It’s like, yeah they are.</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.110" end="00:35:22.710" style="s2">So partly what that means is prepare yourself<br />for that, and don’t pound yourself into</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.710" end="00:35:25.070" style="s2">the ground when you get there.</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.070" end="00:35:29.470" style="s2">Because it happens to people, and it isn’t<br />necessarily the case that the reason it happened</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.470" end="00:35:31.020" style="s2">to you is because you’re useless.</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.020" end="00:35:35.050" style="s2">Now, that might have furthered the process<br />and all that, but you just don’t need those</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.050" end="00:35:37.440" style="s2">thoughts at that time.</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.440" end="00:35:39.010" style="s2">All they do is undermine you.</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.010" end="00:35:46.450" style="s2">And when you know “yeah, you know, everybody’s<br />dog dies” (which is true), it’s like,</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.450" end="00:35:53.160" style="s2">well, it takes some of the guilt out of it,<br />and the guilt is something that at that point</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.160" end="00:35:54.910" style="s2">you don’t really need.</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.910" end="00:36:01.000" style="s2">Okay, so, you’ve got your explored territory,<br />and we’ve kind of walked through what that</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.000" end="00:36:04.330" style="s2">is, and then you have your unexplored territory.</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.330" end="00:36:07.310" style="s2">And then you have the things that sort of<br />exist on the fringe.</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.310" end="00:36:11.780" style="s2">I would say in some sense the things that<br />exist on the fringe closer to the unknown,</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.780" end="00:36:15.770" style="s2">those are usually symbolised by the Terrible<br />Mother.</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.770" end="00:36:18.440" style="s2">And then the order is symbolised by the Terrible<br />Father.</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.440" end="00:36:24.490" style="s2">And then the chaos that’s beyond order…<br />the unknown that’s beyond order and chaos,</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.490" end="00:36:26.560" style="s2">that’s the Dragon of Chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.560" end="00:36:29.400" style="s2">Now it’s a reptile, right, a reptilian carnivore.</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.400" end="00:36:33.290" style="s2">It’s a reptilian carnivore that has a variety<br />of interesting properties.</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.290" end="00:36:39.560" style="s2">So let me show you some of the pictures that<br />I’ve got of the dragon of chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.560" end="00:36:42.930" style="s2">This is a good one.</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.930" end="00:36:47.250" style="s2">So that’s a figure called an ‘Ouroboros’,<br />and you can say in some sense that that’s</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.250" end="00:36:50.110" style="s2">one of the first graphical representations<br />of the infinite.</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.110" end="00:36:56.600" style="s2">You know, we have a symbol for infinity, right,<br />which is another thing that’s pretty weird</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.600" end="00:37:00.770" style="s2">to symbolise, because you’re encapsulating<br />something that can’t be encapsulated inside</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.770" end="00:37:02.070" style="s2">a capsule, right.</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.070" end="00:37:04.080" style="s2">It’s very sneaky to be able to do that.</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.080" end="00:37:07.830" style="s2">And you actually need it to do advanced mathematics<br />of all sorts of kinds.</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.830" end="00:37:13.340" style="s2">So it’s real, at least insofar as you can<br />use it as a tool.</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.340" end="00:37:17.880" style="s2">So let me tell you a few things about this<br />symbol, this representation.</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.880" end="00:37:24.360" style="s2">It’s kind of like the Judeo-Christian idea<br />of God being the Alpha and Omega.</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.360" end="00:37:29.230" style="s2">Which is this thing that exists from the beginning<br />of time all the way to the end of time.</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.230" end="00:37:32.930" style="s2">So it’s something that exists outside of<br />time.</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.930" end="00:37:39.500" style="s2">So you could think about this, at one level,<br />as the eternal presence of The Predator.</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.500" end="00:37:44.080" style="s2">Predators come and go; The Predator never<br />goes away.</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.080" end="00:37:48.540" style="s2">So it’s got this God-like… you could say<br />the spirit of The Predator never disappears.</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.540" end="00:37:52.430" style="s2">And as soon as you think that way then you<br />have some idea about what archaic people were</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.430" end="00:37:55.330" style="s2">doing when they were populating the world<br />with spirits.</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.330" end="00:38:01.070" style="s2">The difference between a spirit and an abstract<br />idea is like, there’s no difference.</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.070" end="00:38:03.840" style="s2">The spirit of The Predator inhabits the jungle.</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.840" end="00:38:06.200" style="s2">It’s like, yeah, that’s for sure.</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.200" end="00:38:09.890" style="s2">And you should be very careful of disturbing<br />such spirits when you go in there.</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.890" end="00:38:13.270" style="s2">Well so then you might ask yourself, well,<br />what is a predator?</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.270" end="00:38:20.460" style="s2">Well, that’s a complicated thing, because<br />we would say, because we’re scientifically-minded,</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.460" end="00:38:26.030" style="s2">that you can take predators and you can classify<br />according to their species and their sub-species</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.030" end="00:38:30.440" style="s2">and their phyla and all that sort of thing,<br />right.</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.440" end="00:38:34.060" style="s2">We think about classifying them as objects,<br />and then maybe in terms of their evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.060" end="00:38:35.060" style="s2">origins.</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.060" end="00:38:37.830" style="s2">But that’s not very helpful.</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.830" end="00:38:43.090" style="s2">You know, if something jumps out and wants<br />to eat you, I mean, knowing what it is might</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.090" end="00:38:46.930" style="s2">help you plot your escape but all those additional<br />complexities, they’re just not the relevant</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.930" end="00:38:48.200" style="s2">issue at that point.</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.200" end="00:38:53.780" style="s2">The relevant issue is, how do you keep the<br />predators away from your explored territory?</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.780" end="00:39:03.000" style="s2">Well, now that’s a complicated question,<br />because you might say: what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.000" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">that?</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:06.200" style="s2">Do you mean right now, while you’re walking<br />through the bush?</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.200" end="00:39:11.650" style="s2">Do you mean right now for you and your family,<br />while all of you are walking through the bush?</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.650" end="00:39:17.130" style="s2">There’s this old joke about these two guys<br />that go out in the forest, and one guy says</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.130" end="00:39:23.740" style="s2">to the other: “There’s grizzly bears here,<br />so you have to be careful.”</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.740" end="00:39:28.820" style="s2">And then the other guy says, “Well, how<br />fast can you run?”</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.820" end="00:39:34.180" style="s2">And the first guy says “Well, don’t you<br />mean how fast does the grizzly bear run?”</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.180" end="00:39:38.431" style="s2">And the other guy says “No that isn’t<br />what I mean I just want to know if I can run</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.431" end="00:39:39.650" style="s2">faster than you.”</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.650" end="00:39:40.650" style="s2">[Laughter].</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.650" end="00:39:41.690" style="s2">Right, right.</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.690" end="00:39:48.650" style="s2">So the reason I’m telling you that stupid<br />joke is because what you want as an answer</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.650" end="00:39:53.100" style="s2">to a question depends on exactly how you put<br />the question.</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.100" end="00:39:58.490" style="s2">And so, the answer there was “well I don’t<br />care if the grizzly bear eats someone as long</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.490" end="00:39:59.490" style="s2">as it’s not me.”</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.490" end="00:40:01.540" style="s2">Okay, fine, so that’s one answer to the<br />question.</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.540" end="00:40:07.010" style="s2">But then you might think, well let’s keep<br />the grizzly bears away from me now, my family</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.010" end="00:40:16.610" style="s2">now, my tribe now, me tomorrow, my family<br />tomorrow, my tribe tomorrow, then across the</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.610" end="00:40:20.750" style="s2">week, then across the month, then across the<br />years, then maybe forever.</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.750" end="00:40:24.500" style="s2">Okay so how is it that you have to act so<br />that you keep the predators away?</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.500" end="00:40:28.570" style="s2">Well, that starts to become an extraordinarily<br />complicated problem.</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.570" end="00:40:32.890" style="s2">Because the simple solution might be, well<br />when there’s a predator around, climb a</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.890" end="00:40:36.620" style="s2">tree or run into a hole, which is what lots<br />of animals do.</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.620" end="00:40:38.480" style="s2">But it’s a pretty partial solution.</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.480" end="00:40:43.360" style="s2">They don’t get eaten that day, but what<br />about tomorrow, when the predator’s a little</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.360" end="00:40:44.360" style="s2">hungrier.</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.360" end="00:40:47.650" style="s2">It’s kind of a bone-headed solution, all<br />things considered.</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.650" end="00:40:53.250" style="s2">So then you might say, well, if we thought<br />of the spirit of the predator, which is more</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.250" end="00:41:00.240" style="s2">like the fact that there is a class of predators<br />and they’re never going to go away, then</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.240" end="00:41:05.130" style="s2">the question that we have to answer is, how<br />do we act so that that class that’s eternal</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.130" end="00:41:07.640" style="s2">doesn’t bother us any more than necessary?</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.640" end="00:41:09.930" style="s2">Well that’s really complicated.</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.930" end="00:41:12.520" style="s2">Really, really complicated.</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.520" end="00:41:15.660" style="s2">Because it might mean, in some sense, well,<br />how should you act?</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.660" end="00:41:22.470" style="s2">Because conquering the problem of having your<br />territory invaded, there’s not just reptilian</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.470" end="00:41:27.690" style="s2">and mammalian predators, right, like bird-things<br />with teeth, there’s other people.</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.690" end="00:41:31.890" style="s2">And they’re a lot worse than anything else<br />that’s going to come at you, so you also</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.890" end="00:41:36.350" style="s2">have that problem, how do you keep yourself<br />away from the predatory people and the foreign</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.350" end="00:41:40.390" style="s2">tribes that are going to invade your land<br />and take it.</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.390" end="00:41:46.660" style="s2">So there’s no difference between that question<br />and how do you establish the security of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.660" end="00:41:48.470" style="s2">nation, roughly speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.470" end="00:41:50.850" style="s2">Or maybe even how do you establish peace?</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.850" end="00:41:51.850" style="s2">You know what I mean?</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.850" end="00:41:54.910" style="s2">It’s a question that doesn’t have obvious<br />borders.</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.910" end="00:41:59.270" style="s2">Okay, so one answer might be, stay away from<br />the damn predators.</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.270" end="00:42:02.930" style="s2">So you build a big wall, or someone else does,<br />and you hide inside the walls.</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.930" end="00:42:07.420" style="s2">Well, that’s not a bad solution, and of<br />course, that’s what people started to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.420" end="00:42:08.930" style="s2">when they originally built cities, right?</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.930" end="00:42:15.650" style="s2">They built these big walls, like Trump is<br />going to build between Canada and the US,</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.650" end="00:42:17.330" style="s2">and it’ll keep the predators out.</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.330" end="00:42:22.880" style="s2">But of course, what do we know from the story<br />of Genesis, and from the Daoist symbol?</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.880" end="00:42:26.320" style="s2">No matter how big the wall is, you can’t<br />keep out the damn snakes.</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.320" end="00:42:31.820" style="s2">So you build a wall and all the snakes pop<br />up inside, so it’s not a very good solution.</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.820" end="00:42:34.090" style="s2">And you know, that’s pretty obvious, right?</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.090" end="00:42:40.190" style="s2">I mean, my suspicions are that mass shooters<br />who are native to the United States kill a</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.190" end="00:42:44.820" style="s2">lot more people in the US every week than<br />illegal Mexican immigrants.</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.820" end="00:42:55.550" style="s2">Well, so it’s like, what problem exactly<br />are you solving?</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.550" end="00:43:05.330" style="s2">Okay, so the first question you have to solve<br />when you’re… see there’s just no solution</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.330" end="00:43:16.580" style="s2">to this problem [open doors in the classroom?][Laughter].</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.580" end="00:43:25.770" style="s2">So, why did you laugh at that, do you think?</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.770" end="00:43:28.130" style="s2">[Student: Because it opened again and it was<br />unexpected?]</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.130" end="00:43:29.920" style="s2">Yeah, but why didn’t that terrify you?</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.920" end="00:43:33.680" style="s2">Well, you know, it’s related to the hierarchy<br />issue, right?</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.680" end="00:43:35.660" style="s2">Because the door isn’t behaving properly.</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.660" end="00:43:37.340" style="s2">So what’s funny about that?</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.340" end="00:43:45.340" style="s2">Well, it’s funny to watch someone’s little<br />routine not work when the consequences are</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.340" end="00:43:46.340" style="s2">trivial.</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.340" end="00:43:48.310" style="s2">It’s like, oh well he knows how to close<br />the door.</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.310" end="00:43:49.310" style="s2">Hahaha it’s not working.</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.310" end="00:43:52.910" style="s2">So now he’s got the problem of this door<br />and that’s a stupid problem, so everyone</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.910" end="00:43:55.820" style="s2">can laugh about it, you know?</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.820" end="00:44:02.550" style="s2">So, little anomalies, that you can bind quickly,<br />are common.</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.550" end="00:44:06.740" style="s2">And I think it’s an indication, to tell<br />you the truth, I think it’s an indication</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.740" end="00:44:09.530" style="s2">of people’s transcendent ability.</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.530" end="00:44:12.830" style="s2">Because what happens, comedians do this with<br />you too, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.830" end="00:44:16.151" style="s2">So you’ll be sitting in the audience, and<br />the comedian will say this thing and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.151" end="00:44:19.370" style="s2">this thing, and they’re connected in some<br />way, but it’s not obvious.</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.370" end="00:44:21.090" style="s2">And then you go, click!</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.090" end="00:44:24.640" style="s2">And it’s like everybody celebrates their<br />brilliance together, like “Oh I get it!</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.640" end="00:44:25.640" style="s2">Hahaha!</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.640" end="00:44:26.840" style="s2">Aren’t I smart?”</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.840" end="00:44:32.030" style="s2">And it transforms you from the puzzled thing<br />into the solving thing.</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.030" end="00:44:33.310" style="s2">And everyone really likes that.</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.310" end="00:44:34.310" style="s2">It’s like, “Yes!</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.310" end="00:44:35.310" style="s2">We solved it.</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.310" end="00:44:37.730" style="s2">We can go and combat the unknown together.”</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.730" end="00:44:43.530" style="s2">Okay, so you have this chaos thing here [points<br />to figure].</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.530" end="00:44:46.560" style="s2">As I said, that’s called an Ouroboros.</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.560" end="00:44:52.530" style="s2">The reason it’s got its tail in its mouth<br />is… it’s a… the idea that that’s trying</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.530" end="00:44:55.510" style="s2">to represent is that this thing is complete<br />unto itself.</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.510" end="00:44:58.520" style="s2">So it’s a symbol of totality.</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.520" end="00:45:00.600" style="s2">It’s everything.</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.600" end="00:45:01.640" style="s2">How?</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.640" end="00:45:05.910" style="s2">Well, you walk into the room where your interview<br />is.</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.910" end="00:45:07.320" style="s2">You might say, what’s in there?</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.320" end="00:45:10.720" style="s2">Well a better question is, what’s not in<br />there?</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.720" end="00:45:15.590" style="s2">That’s a better question, because your whole<br />damn future’s in there.</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.590" end="00:45:17.520" style="s2">And you don’t even know how much that branches.</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.520" end="00:45:18.950" style="s2">Your future’s in there.</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.950" end="00:45:22.860" style="s2">The future of your children is in there.</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.860" end="00:45:23.860" style="s2">The future of your grandchildren is in there.</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.860" end="00:45:27.810" style="s2">There’s these waves that go out from that<br />room that in some sense, especially if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.810" end="00:45:31.950" style="s2">stretch them forward in time, have almost<br />no boundary.</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.950" end="00:45:35.440" style="s2">You know, I mean, I don’t know, each of<br />us is descended from one person.</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.440" end="00:45:39.340" style="s2">I don’t remember how many millions of years<br />ago, but it’s not that many.</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.340" end="00:45:40.590" style="s2">Two?</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.590" end="00:45:42.630" style="s2">Maybe it’s even earlier than that.</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.630" end="00:45:43.630" style="s2">650,000 years?</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.630" end="00:45:44.630" style="s2">Something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.630" end="00:45:48.910" style="s2">So for all you know, one of you could be the<br />person through whom the entire human race</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.910" end="00:45:53.420" style="s2">lived, and maybe it’s because you made the<br />right decision in that interview.</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.420" end="00:45:58.290" style="s2">My point is that potential itself has no boundary,<br />no obvious boundary.</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.290" end="00:46:00.850" style="s2">And you don’t know what you’re messing<br />with when you’re messing with it.</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.850" end="00:46:02.600" style="s2">It’s very, very complicated.</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.600" end="00:46:05.020" style="s2">So how should you do it?</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.020" end="00:46:09.120" style="s2">Well, this figure says, well you better watch<br />out, because some of it is predatory, and</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.120" end="00:46:13.210" style="s2">it crawls along the ground, and it’s got<br />teeth, and it’s no damn joke.</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.210" end="00:46:18.790" style="s2">And then you can think it’s sort of snake-like,<br />because snakes sneak around through the grass.</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.790" end="00:46:22.790" style="s2">And then it’s sort of crocodile-like, because<br />snakes don’t have teeth but crocodiles sure</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.790" end="00:46:25.050" style="s2">the hell do, and so do other predatory lizards.</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.050" end="00:46:31.920" style="s2">And you know, as we’ve talked about before,<br />the probability that our ancestral plains-dwelling</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.920" end="00:46:37.030" style="s2">African ancestors were regularly lunched upon<br />by crocodiles is pretty damn high.</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.030" end="00:46:38.810" style="s2">Because how else would they get water?</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.810" end="00:46:43.010" style="s2">And you’ve got to be pretty mean before<br />you can take on a Nile crocodile.</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.010" end="00:46:47.670" style="s2">I mean, I’m sure we did that fairly early<br />in our evolutionary history, but before that</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.670" end="00:46:50.230" style="s2">a lot of us were snacks for lizards.</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.230" end="00:46:56.850" style="s2">Which seems… just not good, you know?</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.850" end="00:47:00.800" style="s2">So this thing also lives in a hole, dragons<br />usually live in holes or underground, like</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.800" end="00:47:02.500" style="s2">Harry Potter’s basilisk.</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.500" end="00:47:03.770" style="s2">And usually they’re immortal.</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.770" end="00:47:06.130" style="s2">They live in a cave, they’re immortal, right?</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.130" end="00:47:09.090" style="s2">They live forever, and you don’t want to<br />bother them, because then they pop out of</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.090" end="00:47:12.470" style="s2">their hole, like they do in The Hobbit, and<br />they come and burn down your village.</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.470" end="00:47:14.890" style="s2">It’s like, leave the damn dragon alone.</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.890" end="00:47:17.140" style="s2">Well, yes and no.</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.140" end="00:47:19.960" style="s2">Why not leave it alone?</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.960" end="00:47:24.250" style="s2">Well, maybe it would be better to go get the<br />dragon before it gets you.</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.250" end="00:47:26.180" style="s2">That’s certainly possible.</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.180" end="00:47:30.400" style="s2">And then there’s this other weird thing<br />about dragons which is that they hoard treasure.</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.400" end="00:47:33.490" style="s2">So maybe you can go and confront the dragon<br />and you get the treasure.</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.490" end="00:47:35.540" style="s2">And the treasure basically takes two forms.</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.540" end="00:47:43.250" style="s2">So there’s the St. George story, where the<br />treasure is often a trapped, young female.</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.250" end="00:47:46.340" style="s2">And the other version is the dragon sits on<br />gold.</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.340" end="00:47:49.380" style="s2">So what’s the whole idea there?</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.380" end="00:47:55.130" style="s2">Well, maybe the best way to overcome the predator,<br />the spirit of the predator, is to confront</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.130" end="00:47:56.130" style="s2">it.</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.130" end="00:48:00.130" style="s2">Well, that’s a hell of an idea.</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.130" end="00:48:03.600" style="s2">Then you might think, well how deep an idea<br />is that?</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.600" end="00:48:05.460" style="s2">You confront the predator, you get the gold.</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.460" end="00:48:11.170" style="s2">Well, this is that you confront infinite possibility<br />and you get the reward.</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.170" end="00:48:14.760" style="s2">You encounter infinite possibility properly.</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.760" end="00:48:17.620" style="s2">You derive from it the rewards that it offers.</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.620" end="00:48:21.200" style="s2">What are the rewards that infinite possibility<br />offers?</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.200" end="00:48:23.600" style="s2">Who knows?</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.600" end="00:48:24.600" style="s2">We have no idea.</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.600" end="00:48:29.350" style="s2">And it’s so interesting, because we live<br />at a time in history where that’s literally</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.350" end="00:48:30.350" style="s2">true.</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.350" end="00:48:35.570" style="s2">Like I would hesitate to predict anything<br />about fifty years from now.</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.570" end="00:48:38.990" style="s2">I quit worrying about the future about twenty<br />years ago.</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.990" end="00:48:41.630" style="s2">Because I thought, oh, I get it.</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.630" end="00:48:45.750" style="s2">No matter what happens, the probability that<br />it’s something I predict is zero.</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.750" end="00:48:49.550" style="s2">So it’s like, whatever you’re worried<br />about, well, go ahead and worry about it,</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.550" end="00:48:51.810" style="s2">but something completely different is going<br />to happen.</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.810" end="00:48:54.610" style="s2">So it’s not really all that useful.</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.610" end="00:48:59.000" style="s2">You should just be ready for whatever comes,<br />because here it comes.</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.000" end="00:49:04.450" style="s2">You know, like I think we’ll have fully-functional<br />autonomous robots within three or four years.</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.450" end="00:49:07.850" style="s2">And that’s a real game-changer.</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.850" end="00:49:10.920" style="s2">And God only knows what’s going to happen<br />after that.</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.920" end="00:49:17.420" style="s2">Transplantable organs… those things are…<br />you can print those on 3D printers already.</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.420" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">Well, augmented intelligence.</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:22.640" style="s2">You all have augmented intelligence already.</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.640" end="00:49:23.640" style="s2">What good are facts?</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.640" end="00:49:26.260" style="s2">You just look them up, right?</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.260" end="00:49:30.230" style="s2">Everyone’s an infinite supply of facts.</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.230" end="00:49:38.220" style="s2">[Student: Can you explain, in different words,<br />why the dragon is eating its own tail?]</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.220" end="00:49:40.420" style="s2">Because it has everything it needs.</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.420" end="00:49:42.930" style="s2">That’s another way of thinking about it.</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.930" end="00:49:45.700" style="s2">So it’s self-contained.</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.700" end="00:49:50.550" style="s2">It doesn’t need anything outside of itself,<br />and there isn’t anything outside of itself.</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.550" end="00:49:54.090" style="s2">So it doesn’t rely on anything to exist.</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.090" end="00:49:55.500" style="s2">That’s another way of thinking about it.</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.500" end="00:49:56.820" style="s2">It’s just there.</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.820" end="00:50:03.950" style="s2">And so there’s an echo there of the idea<br />that… of an idea of beyond time.</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.950" end="00:50:07.401" style="s2">Or I don’t know so much beyond space, but<br />certainly beyond time.</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.401" end="00:50:10.500" style="s2">Time has no effect on it.</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.500" end="00:50:13.830" style="s2">So it’s beyond time, in that sense.</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.830" end="00:50:14.830" style="s2">Yeah?</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.830" end="00:50:20.290" style="s2">[Student: There’s another reason it has<br />its tail in its mouth.</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.290" end="00:50:26.490" style="s2">And that’s because it represents the border<br />between the known world, in all its goodness</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.490" end="00:50:28.540" style="s2">and badness, and the unknown world.</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.540" end="00:50:32.990" style="s2">And that border can get smaller as it eats<br />more of its tail.]</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.990" end="00:50:34.010" style="s2">Mhm, right, right.</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.010" end="00:50:39.080" style="s2">Okay, so, now it has wings, why does it have<br />wings?</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.080" end="00:50:43.350" style="s2">Well, this is another horribly complicated<br />thing.</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.350" end="00:50:45.770" style="s2">I’ll show you a diagram.</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.770" end="00:50:49.460" style="s2">This is the closest I’ve been able to get<br />to it.</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.460" end="00:51:05.900" style="s2">I often don’t talk about this diagram, but<br />I guess I am today.</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.900" end="00:51:26.320" style="s2">Yeah, okay, we might as well go through this<br />completely.</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.320" end="00:51:35.910" style="s2">Okay so here’s you.</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.910" end="00:51:42.090" style="s2">So if you look right in the middle there,<br />here I’ll make it bigger so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.090" end="00:51:45.530" style="s2">see it.</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.530" end="00:51:47.110" style="s2">You kind of think that you’re right here.</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.110" end="00:51:49.640" style="s2">This is where your consciousness normally<br />sits.</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.640" end="00:51:53.780" style="s2">Like, you know, are you yourself, that’s<br />sort of your conscious body envelope and all</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.780" end="00:51:55.670" style="s2">that, or are you your family?</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.670" end="00:52:01.330" style="s2">Well you know, the border there is rather<br />pliable.</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.330" end="00:52:05.460" style="s2">Well then, you can drill down into the cell,<br />and this is sort of the idea of hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.460" end="00:52:10.550" style="s2">You know, you can look at principles, so those<br />are your general philosophical beliefs and</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.550" end="00:52:16.140" style="s2">then your programs, and the sequence of behaviours<br />that you instantiate that in and then your</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.140" end="00:52:17.140" style="s2">behaviours.</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.140" end="00:52:22.300" style="s2">And then you can go below that even and you<br />can think of yourself as… well because when</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.300" end="00:52:25.530" style="s2">you’re behaving, what’s under that?</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.530" end="00:52:27.390" style="s2">What’s the support for that?</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.390" end="00:52:28.390" style="s2">The platform for that?</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.390" end="00:52:29.700" style="s2">Well it’s your body, right?</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.700" end="00:52:31.000" style="s2">Well, what’s there?</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.000" end="00:52:34.990" style="s2">Well, once you get past the level of arm,<br />it’s sort of like musculature.</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.990" end="00:52:39.900" style="s2">And then you might say, what’s under that,<br />what’s next?</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.900" end="00:52:44.720" style="s2">Well you have your cellular structure, and<br />so that’s what cellular biologists study,</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.720" end="00:52:46.720" style="s2">God that’s so complex.</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.720" end="00:52:49.880" style="s2">And then below that you have your molecular<br />structures, like DNA, and then underneath</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.880" end="00:52:50.880" style="s2">that there’s the atomic structure.</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.880" end="00:52:57.370" style="s2">And then underneath that there’s the sub-atomic<br />structure, and what are you going to say about</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.370" end="00:52:58.370" style="s2">that?</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.370" end="00:53:04.820" style="s2">There isn’t even time at that level.</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.820" end="00:53:06.630" style="s2">And then you can do the same thing if you<br />go up.</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.630" end="00:53:10.600" style="s2">It’s like, people say you shouldn’t just<br />pay attention to your family, you’re in</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.600" end="00:53:12.330" style="s2">a cultural group, they’re important too.</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.330" end="00:53:16.250" style="s2">And well, what about the biological group<br />that that’s nested in, and maybe you should</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.250" end="00:53:20.240" style="s2">be paying more attention to the ecosystem<br />rather than to yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.240" end="00:53:26.280" style="s2">And you know, you shade upward into this thing<br />that you can’t really dissociate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.280" end="00:53:28.790" style="s2">from either.</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.790" end="00:53:33.450" style="s2">So that’s what you are, make no mistake<br />about it.</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.450" end="00:53:40.110" style="s2">Your consciousness is such that you only are<br />located, in some sense, at one level of observation,</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.110" end="00:53:42.050" style="s2">and God only knows why that is.</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.050" end="00:53:49.360" style="s2">It’s almost as if being has to come to a<br />pinpoint in order for things to exist.</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.360" end="00:53:53.610" style="s2">The way I’ve been thinking about it, in<br />some sense, is you could take all of this</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.610" end="00:53:59.760" style="s2">structure and you know, narrow it down to<br />a single point of a pencil that’s writing.</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.760" end="00:54:05.020" style="s2">And the writing is the transformation of potential<br />into actuality, but in order to do that there</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.020" end="00:54:11.100" style="s2">has to be a point of contact between you and<br />the potential, and that’s your body in part,</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.100" end="00:54:12.640" style="s2">but it’s even narrower than that.</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.640" end="00:54:18.730" style="s2">It’s whatever occupies this tiny little<br />laser beam of attention while you’re wandering</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.730" end="00:54:19.730" style="s2">through the world.</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.730" end="00:54:22.420" style="s2">And it’s like burning reality into being.</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.420" end="00:54:26.990" style="s2">So why that is, I mean, God, who knows?</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.990" end="00:54:29.390" style="s2">It’s beyond strange.</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.390" end="00:54:35.570" style="s2">Now, you know, one way of thinking about this<br />whole structure is you could think about it</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.570" end="00:54:40.240" style="s2">as the psychological world, because you’re<br />at the centre of it, or you could think about</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.240" end="00:54:44.680" style="s2">it as the spiritual world if you think about<br />spirit as a matter of consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.680" end="00:54:49.540" style="s2">It’s not the material world anyways, or<br />if it is it’s the material world insofar</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.540" end="00:54:53.470" style="s2">as it’s you as a living conscious being.</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.470" end="00:54:57.150" style="s2">So you know, we tend to separate out consciousness<br />and matter, right?</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.150" end="00:55:00.260" style="s2">I mean, I’m conscious, that’s something<br />weird.</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.260" end="00:55:05.290" style="s2">We don’t think this table is so we think<br />of them as separate substances in a sense,</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.290" end="00:55:06.290" style="s2">spirit and matter.</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.290" end="00:55:09.850" style="s2">Well that’s what the dragon is: it’s half<br />matter, that’s the thing that’s crawling</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.850" end="00:55:13.260" style="s2">around on the ground, and it’s half spirit,<br />and that’s the wings.</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.260" end="00:55:19.460" style="s2">And then you might say, well why the hell<br />is the dragon half spirit and half matter?</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.460" end="00:55:21.220" style="s2">Well we’ve got the spirit part, I just showed<br />you it.</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.220" end="00:55:32.960" style="s2">So now I’m going to show you the matter<br />part.</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.960" end="00:55:48.060" style="s2">Okay, so we could say, well what’s that?</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.060" end="00:55:51.880" style="s2">Well it’s a chair.</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.880" end="00:55:53.260" style="s2">You think, that’s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.260" end="00:55:56.430" style="s2">It’s actually not, and I can tell you why<br />pretty rapidly.</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.430" end="00:55:58.650" style="s2">Why is it a chair?</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.650" end="00:56:01.650" style="s2">[Student: The legs?]</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.650" end="00:56:05.670" style="s2">How about a beanbag?</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.670" end="00:56:06.740" style="s2">Is that a chair?</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.740" end="00:56:09.100" style="s2">That’s right because we can sit in it!</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.100" end="00:56:12.210" style="s2">And that seems to be the fundamental issue:<br />is this a chair?</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.210" end="00:56:13.360" style="s2">Is this a chair?</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.360" end="00:56:15.120" style="s2">[Points to desk]<br />[Student: It can be.]</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.120" end="00:56:16.120" style="s2">It can be, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.120" end="00:56:18.610" style="s2">You’d say it’s not a canonical chair,<br />and neither is a beanbag.</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.610" end="00:56:21.810" style="s2">Because a chair could be a beanbag or a stump.</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.810" end="00:56:24.380" style="s2">But you know, that’s sort of a canonical<br />chair.</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.380" end="00:56:29.580" style="s2">But part of my point is, you know, the typical<br />answer that people will give when you ask</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.580" end="00:56:34.170" style="s2">“why is that a chair?” is that they’ll<br />lay out the objective structure, that’s</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.170" end="00:56:36.600" style="s2">only a tiny bit of a chair.</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.600" end="00:56:40.360" style="s2">You know, if it was that high, would it be<br />a chair?</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.360" end="00:56:45.530" style="s2">It has to have the right structure and the<br />right function in order for it to be a chair.</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.530" end="00:56:50.790" style="s2">And so what that means is that thing which<br />is an object is already only existing in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.790" end="00:56:52.140" style="s2">to you, in some important sense.</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.140" end="00:56:56.430" style="s2">But I could also say well, it’s part of<br />the classroom.</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.430" end="00:56:57.970" style="s2">What’s the classroom part of?</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.970" end="00:56:59.580" style="s2">Well it’s part of Sid Smith.</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.580" end="00:57:00.970" style="s2">This chair is part of Sid Smith.</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.970" end="00:57:02.490" style="s2">And what’s Sid Smith part of?</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.490" end="00:57:03.650" style="s2">Well it’s part of the university.</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.650" end="00:57:05.370" style="s2">And what’s the university part of?</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.370" end="00:57:09.730" style="s2">Well God, it’s part of all sorts of things,<br />but we could say it’s a piece of the city,</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.730" end="00:57:15.000" style="s2">it’s a chunk of the province, it’s a bit<br />of the country, and then it’s nested inside</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.000" end="00:57:17.560" style="s2">a much broader civilisation than that.</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.560" end="00:57:19.930" style="s2">So that’s sort of going up from the chair.</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.930" end="00:57:23.950" style="s2">And you could say, well, that’s not really<br />a chair, and I could say, well if that thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.950" end="00:57:29.270" style="s2">was floating at some point halfway between<br />the Sun and Pluto, I don’t think considering</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.270" end="00:57:31.930" style="s2">it a chair would be reasonable.</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.930" end="00:57:34.050" style="s2">Because, well for obvious reasons.</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.050" end="00:57:38.370" style="s2">You know, you can decontextualize something<br />so completely that it isn’t what it is anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.370" end="00:57:40.800" style="s2">It’s not that hard.</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.800" end="00:57:44.180" style="s2">You know, and you kind of do that to yourself<br />when you say, well, who cares, why is this</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.180" end="00:57:45.180" style="s2">important?</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.180" end="00:57:46.610" style="s2">Who’s going to know in a million years?</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.610" end="00:57:47.610" style="s2">Poof!</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.610" end="00:57:48.610" style="s2">You’re decontextualized.</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.610" end="00:57:51.120" style="s2">It’s a stupid trick, it’s like a party<br />trick for intellects.</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.120" end="00:57:53.880" style="s2">It’s a stupid trick, you know?</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.880" end="00:57:55.470" style="s2">Because anybody can do it?</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.470" end="00:57:56.770" style="s2">And what does it mean?</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.770" end="00:58:00.280" style="s2">It means you’re looking at it from the wrong<br />perspective, that’s what it means.</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.280" end="00:58:02.770" style="s2">So it’s not like it’s an ‘ultimate question’.</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.770" end="00:58:08.330" style="s2">You wouldn’t be able to think about it in<br />fifteen seconds if it was an ultimate question.</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.330" end="00:58:11.460" style="s2">But then you could do the same thing with<br />the chair that you did that you did with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.460" end="00:58:12.940" style="s2">when you zoom in to it, right?</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.940" end="00:58:17.410" style="s2">So it’s made of parts, well obviously, and<br />then the parts are made out of sub-parts and</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.410" end="00:58:20.210" style="s2">so forth, all the way down to the sub-atomic<br />level.</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.210" end="00:58:23.460" style="s2">And the chair is all those things at the same<br />time.</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.460" end="00:58:30.830" style="s2">Okay, so then you might say, well what do<br />you encounter when you encounter the unknown?</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.830" end="00:58:35.940" style="s2">And that’s what you encounter, I think.</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.940" end="00:58:37.460" style="s2">So let’s take a look at this.</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.460" end="00:58:38.990" style="s2">And you can think about it.</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.990" end="00:58:41.060" style="s2">It’s a weird idea.</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.060" end="00:58:44.300" style="s2">Okay, so you’ve got your little frame of<br />reference, right?</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.300" end="00:58:48.440" style="s2">You’re going from point A to point B. And<br />when you’re going from point A to point</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.440" end="00:58:51.890" style="s2">B something that you didn’t want to happen<br />happens.</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.890" end="00:58:55.290" style="s2">And we already know that it can be a little<br />thing that happens, and then you know, haha</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.290" end="00:58:59.700" style="s2">it’s funny, or it can be your whole world<br />falls apart, and then it’s a catastrophe.</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.700" end="00:59:04.200" style="s2">But let’s say it’s something like the<br />interview.</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.200" end="00:59:07.710" style="s2">So I would say that’s sort of a mid-level<br />anomaly, right?</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.710" end="00:59:12.520" style="s2">You walk in, there’s a lot in there, but<br />you can handle it, weirdly enough.</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.520" end="00:59:16.050" style="s2">And I suppose that’s because there are other<br />places that you can go where there are potential</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.050" end="00:59:20.060" style="s2">futures lying, so it’s not like you’re<br />out of potential futures just because you</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.060" end="00:59:22.020" style="s2">walk through that.</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.020" end="00:59:26.160" style="s2">So you say, well, what’s in that room is<br />anomalous, you don’t understand it.</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.160" end="00:59:28.830" style="s2">It’s unformed matter.</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.830" end="00:59:34.280" style="s2">Now you might say, someone might say, does<br />this interview matter to you?</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.280" end="00:59:40.020" style="s2">You think, that’s a pretty weird question,<br />because things are made out of matter.</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.020" end="00:59:42.740" style="s2">So what do you mean when you say does this<br />matter to you?</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.740" end="00:59:47.220" style="s2">Well, partly what it means is that before<br />matter was our matter, it was a matter that</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.220" end="00:59:50.610" style="s2">was more complicated, linguistically speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.610" end="00:59:57.690" style="s2">So if you go back far enough, what people<br />meant by matter wasn’t this [raps on desk].</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.690" end="01:00:00.990" style="s2">It was more like, I would say, it’s more<br />like potential.</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.990" end="01:00:02.830" style="s2">Or it’s more like information.</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.830" end="01:00:04.550" style="s2">That’s another way of thinking about it.</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.550" end="01:00:08.020" style="s2">So you could certainly say that room is chock-full<br />of information.</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.020" end="01:00:11.700" style="s2">So let’s go with the information idea, just<br />for the sake of argument.</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.700" end="01:00:15.970" style="s2">We already talked about it as potential, let’s<br />talk about it as information, both of those</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.970" end="01:00:16.990" style="s2">work.</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.990" end="01:00:19.770" style="s2">You walk in there and you start interacting<br />with people.</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.770" end="01:00:26.220" style="s2">And then you leave later and you know, you<br />tell your partner “Well I went for this</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.220" end="01:00:27.220" style="s2">interview.”</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.220" end="01:00:28.220" style="s2">And they say “How did it go?”</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.220" end="01:00:31.060" style="s2">And you say “Well, it didn’t go very well<br />but I learned some things.”</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.060" end="01:00:33.150" style="s2">Because you could say that, right?</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.150" end="01:00:39.090" style="s2">Well so I would say you went into that room<br />and you extracted some spirit out of the potential.</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.090" end="01:00:43.380" style="s2">Now that’s exactly how Piaget looked at<br />it by the way.</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.380" end="01:00:47.650" style="s2">Well, I shouldn’t say ‘exactly’ because<br />it’s probably not exactly the way he looked</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.650" end="01:00:48.650" style="s2">at it.</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.650" end="01:00:52.760" style="s2">But basically what Piaget proclaimed with<br />children was that children will try out a</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.760" end="01:00:57.780" style="s2">little routine, and then something will happen<br />that doesn’t fit in their little routine.</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.780" end="01:01:01.290" style="s2">And so they’ll investigate it using whatever<br />tools they have at hand.</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.290" end="01:01:06.110" style="s2">Some of it’s trial and error, and some of<br />it’s… you know, they try out other tool-like</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.110" end="01:01:09.480" style="s2">embodiments of their body that have worked<br />in the past.</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.480" end="01:01:15.920" style="s2">So for example, the first thing a nine-month<br />old will do crawling around on the floor if</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.920" end="01:01:20.450" style="s2">it encounters something that’s roughly mouth-sized<br />is put it in their mouth.</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.450" end="01:01:21.450" style="s2">Why?</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.450" end="01:01:24.370" style="s2">Well they don’t know what it is, but they<br />kind of know how to use their mouth.</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.370" end="01:01:27.840" style="s2">So they throw it into their mouth, and then<br />they tongue it, and they get some sense of</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.840" end="01:01:31.320" style="s2">sort of how it tastes, which is very important,<br />and what its shape is and all that, because</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.320" end="01:01:35.290" style="s2">they’re very wired up in their mouth, and<br />so they can investigate like mad.</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.290" end="01:01:41.800" style="s2">And so what they encounter is a thing and<br />then when they throw it in their mouth they</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.800" end="01:01:46.180" style="s2">practice doing something with it, you know,<br />getting its shape, so now they know something</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.180" end="01:01:47.180" style="s2">about it.</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.180" end="01:01:50.860" style="s2">So that changes them from a spiritual perspective,<br />a psychological perspective.</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.860" end="01:01:55.190" style="s2">Now they’re slightly different than they<br />were, they’ve incorporated some information,</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.190" end="01:02:00.550" style="s2">and they’ve also transformed the thing into<br />a specific thing with specific features.</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.550" end="01:02:04.800" style="s2">And so what you might say is that out of potential<br />spirit and matter arise.</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.800" end="01:02:08.360" style="s2">And that’s a very interesting way of looking<br />at it.</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.360" end="01:02:11.900" style="s2">Also it fits well with the phenomenological<br />philosophers.</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.900" end="01:02:22.350" style="s2">Because they believe that we encountered phenomena<br />and phenomena were those things that shone</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.350" end="01:02:23.350" style="s2">forth.</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.350" end="01:02:25.910" style="s2">And so that’s like a reversion to the idea<br />of meaning.</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.910" end="01:02:30.170" style="s2">Because you’ve got to think about it this<br />way too… it’s like when you walk into</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.170" end="01:02:34.690" style="s2">a library, God, what’s in there?</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.690" end="01:02:38.070" style="s2">Well, it’s inexhaustible, a library.</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.070" end="01:02:40.040" style="s2">Well, how come you just don’t get exhausted?</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.040" end="01:02:44.810" style="s2">Well, it’s because you’re not actually<br />interacting with the whole library.</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.810" end="01:02:49.670" style="s2">You’ve got this focal point like a laser<br />again, and you’ve made it into a focal point</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.670" end="01:02:52.850" style="s2">because you’re inside that hierarchical<br />structure, right?</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.850" end="01:02:56.790" style="s2">So you say, well I’m in the library to get<br />this book, I’m getting this book to read</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.790" end="01:02:58.060" style="s2">this chapter.</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.060" end="01:03:00.130" style="s2">So chapter, book, library.</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.130" end="01:03:05.420" style="s2">I’m going to university, I need to become<br />educated and get a job so I’ll be a good</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.420" end="01:03:06.810" style="s2">citizen and a good person.</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.810" end="01:03:08.680" style="s2">And so that’s what you’re doing in the<br />library.</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.680" end="01:03:10.710" style="s2">You’re just doing one little fragment of<br />that.</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.710" end="01:03:15.392" style="s2">And the more you have that whole model developed,<br />right, all the way from good person all the</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.392" end="01:03:20.340" style="s2">way down to why you’re in the library, the<br />more precise your aim is, the more you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.340" end="01:03:24.520" style="s2">what you’re doing, the less encumbered by<br />doubt and uncertainty you are, and the higher</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.520" end="01:03:31.220" style="s2">probability you have of focusing on your task<br />and then writing the path that you want to</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.220" end="01:03:32.440" style="s2">be into being.</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.440" end="01:03:37.150" style="s2">And so, well, so it’s very useful to think<br />about things this way and it’s also very</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.150" end="01:03:39.380" style="s2">interesting to note that that’s how you<br />act.</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.380" end="01:03:41.790" style="s2">You actually act like the world is made this<br />way.</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.790" end="01:03:46.170" style="s2">And it’s even weirder because, and this<br />is the case I made for you when we were talking</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.170" end="01:03:48.030" style="s2">about the structure of the brain.</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.030" end="01:03:52.910" style="s2">It actually looks like this is how your brain<br />construes the world.</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.910" end="01:03:56.390" style="s2">Because you have systems, you’ve got a system<br />that works when you know what you’re doing</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.390" end="01:03:59.460" style="s2">and you’ve got the other system that works<br />when you don’t know what you’re doing.</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.460" end="01:04:04.840" style="s2">And so basically the world is divided, just<br />like the Daoists say, into the orderly domain</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.840" end="01:04:06.490" style="s2">and the chaotic domain.</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.490" end="01:04:10.410" style="s2">And you need to know how to operate in both,<br />and you need to balance them.</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.410" end="01:04:12.340" style="s2">And you need to transform one into the other.</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.340" end="01:04:16.210" style="s2">And that’s basically what you’re doing<br />when you’re interacting with reality.</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.210" end="01:04:22.560" style="s2">And you know, one of the things that I will<br />claim, and this will become more important</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.560" end="01:04:27.420" style="s2">as the course progresses, is that when you’re<br />doing something meaningful, you’re doing</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.420" end="01:04:28.820" style="s2">that properly.</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.820" end="01:04:35.460" style="s2">And the sense of meaning that you have, is<br />actually an indication that your psychophysiology</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.460" end="01:04:40.330" style="s2">is manifesting that you’re in the right<br />place at the right time doing the right thing.</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.330" end="01:04:41.900" style="s2">And it’s real.</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.900" end="01:04:45.460" style="s2">It’s not only real, it’s like it’s the<br />most real thing.</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.460" end="01:04:50.730" style="s2">It’s where potential is transformed into<br />reality.</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.730" end="01:04:53.301" style="s2">And it’s hard to get any more real than<br />that.</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.301" end="01:04:57.360" style="s2">So that’s partly why I’m telling you that<br />these things aren’t exactly metaphors, you</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.360" end="01:04:58.360" style="s2">know.</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.360" end="01:05:01.270" style="s2">They have to be represented by metaphor in<br />some sense.</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.270" end="01:05:06.300" style="s2">But the reality that’s underlying them…<br />it’s not just a story.</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.300" end="01:05:08.980" style="s2">Even though it is a story, it’s not just<br />a story.</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.980" end="01:05:12.780" style="s2">It’s a real representation of reality.</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.780" end="01:05:16.882" style="s2">So, you know, the other thing I kind of outlined<br />here is that when you hit an anomaly… you</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.882" end="01:05:23.940" style="s2">know an anomaly is sort of the thing from<br />which everything shines forth, when it’s</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.940" end="01:05:28.490" style="s2">still really anomalous what happens is that<br />it manifests itself to you in sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.490" end="01:05:31.300" style="s2">a burst of contradictory meanings.</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.300" end="01:05:33.290" style="s2">And that can be paralysing.</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.290" end="01:05:36.810" style="s2">You know, you could be really, really, really<br />excited and really, really, really nervous.</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.810" end="01:05:40.620" style="s2">Which might happen, for example, if you were<br />going to a job interview and you actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.620" end="01:05:41.620" style="s2">wanted the job.</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.620" end="01:05:47.020" style="s2">It would be even worse if you went to a job<br />interview and like 30% of you wanted the job</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.020" end="01:05:52.300" style="s2">because that’s the 30% of you that wants<br />to develop, and another 30% would just as</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.300" end="01:05:55.830" style="s2">soon fail so that you can crawl under your<br />bed at home and stay there with the dust bunnies</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.830" end="01:05:56.830" style="s2">until you’re forty.</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.830" end="01:06:01.820" style="s2">And another 25% of you is resentful about<br />the fact that you have to get a stupid job</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.820" end="01:06:02.880" style="s2">at all.</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.880" end="01:06:06.320" style="s2">And so then you go in there and it’s really,<br />really complicated.</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.320" end="01:06:11.560" style="s2">Because not only is all that potential there<br />but you’re fractured and those fractures</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.560" end="01:06:16.420" style="s2">make the whole situation way more complicated<br />and unstable than it would otherwise have</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.420" end="01:06:17.540" style="s2">to be.</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.540" end="01:06:20.380" style="s2">And that happens to people all the time.</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.380" end="01:06:23.550" style="s2">I mean, people hedge their bets in job interviews<br />all the time.</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.550" end="01:06:25.880" style="s2">Because they think “eh, I don’t really<br />care.”</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.880" end="01:06:28.580" style="s2">It’s like no, you care.</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.580" end="01:06:31.870" style="s2">You just want to have a story to tell yourself<br />if you fail.</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.870" end="01:06:35.770" style="s2">Well, and then if you have that story, well<br />then probably you’re going to fail, because</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.770" end="01:06:36.770" style="s2">you don’t get to do that.</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.770" end="01:06:40.550" style="s2">You can’t go in there at 60% and hope to<br />win.</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.550" end="01:06:42.610" style="s2">You have to go in there at 100%.</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.610" end="01:06:47.281" style="s2">Now that’s cool too, because what it implies<br />is just what the clinical psychologists have</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.281" end="01:06:52.270" style="s2">been telling people for sixty years or seventy<br />years.</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.270" end="01:06:55.530" style="s2">You have to voluntarily face the things that<br />you’re afraid of.</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.530" end="01:06:59.030" style="s2">Now it’s a little more complicated than<br />that because otherwise you could just go play</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.030" end="01:07:00.560" style="s2">in traffic.</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.560" end="01:07:02.910" style="s2">So it’s not a call to stupid adventure.</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.910" end="01:07:08.710" style="s2">What it does is assume that you’ve got a<br />direction and the direction is a valid direction.</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.710" end="01:07:15.560" style="s2">And then what happens is, as you pursue that,<br />obstacles emerge, anomalous, threatening obstacles,</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.560" end="01:07:20.570" style="s2">and then you either confront them, or you<br />abandon the whole project.</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.570" end="01:07:25.180" style="s2">Well generally speaking if you chop them into<br />little pieces then you can confront them and</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.180" end="01:07:26.900" style="s2">digest them.</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.900" end="01:07:29.680" style="s2">And then you get stronger because you’re<br />doing all this digesting.</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.680" end="01:07:33.720" style="s2">It’s like you’re eating the monster of<br />chaos.</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.720" end="01:07:38.610" style="s2">And that’s a classic metaphor for developing<br />wisdom to ingest.</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.610" end="01:07:40.680" style="s2">Piaget even uses that, right?</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.680" end="01:07:41.680" style="s2">Assimilate.</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.680" end="01:07:43.460" style="s2">It’s exactly the same idea as ingesting.</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.460" end="01:07:47.870" style="s2">What you’re eating is information instead<br />of matter.</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.870" end="01:07:51.890" style="s2">And the information restructures you and makes<br />you more informed.</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.890" end="01:07:56.270" style="s2">And that puts you more in formation.</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.270" end="01:08:00.330" style="s2">So you know you encounter the anomaly and<br />it’s a burst of contradictory potential,</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.330" end="01:08:02.930" style="s2">and so that’s exactly how you respond to<br />it.</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.930" end="01:08:07.210" style="s2">Your body’s going everywhere at once, because<br />God only knows what’s going to happen.</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.210" end="01:08:09.760" style="s2">And then as you interact with it, it collapses.</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.760" end="01:08:10.760" style="s2">You’re collapsing it.</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.760" end="01:08:13.530" style="s2">That’s what happens when you take control<br />of the situation.</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.530" end="01:08:19.420" style="s2">And then you reduce it to a single path where<br />everything is going properly.</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.420" end="01:08:24.340" style="s2">And you might say well you’re bending it<br />to your own selfish will, but that’s not</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.340" end="01:08:25.340" style="s2">right.</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.340" end="01:08:27.601" style="s2">Because if you’re in… let’s say you’re<br />in an interview and there’s five or six</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.601" end="01:08:32.050" style="s2">people in there, you can’t just bend the<br />damn thing to your will, because you have</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.050" end="01:08:33.980" style="s2">to interact with those people.</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.980" end="01:08:37.660" style="s2">And so if you don’t do that with… you<br />know, you could be a psychopath and manipulate,</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.660" end="01:08:41.510" style="s2">but that’ll only work for a short period<br />of time, you’ll get caught, and then you’ll</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.510" end="01:08:46.200" style="s2">have to move, because that’s what psychopaths<br />do, that’s how they keep being psychopaths.</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.200" end="01:08:49.839" style="s2">They exhaust everyone’s trust and then they<br />have to move.</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.839" end="01:08:54.339" style="s2">And then they go find some other people who<br />are trustworthy because they build up trust</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.339" end="01:08:57.290" style="s2">capital with other people and then they betray<br />them.</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.290" end="01:08:58.290" style="s2">But they have to keep moving.</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.290" end="01:09:00.549" style="s2">So it’s an unstable solution.</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.549" end="01:09:04.060" style="s2">So you go in there and you do it properly.</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.060" end="01:09:05.660" style="s2">Well what are you doing exactly?</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.660" end="01:09:06.930" style="s2">You know?</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.930" end="01:09:11.620" style="s2">I would say that if you’re really, really<br />nailing that interview, you’re saying, well</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.620" end="01:09:16.390" style="s2">here’s a future that we could all march<br />together into confidently and happily.</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.390" end="01:09:18.750" style="s2">That’s what you’re saying.</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.750" end="01:09:19.910" style="s2">And I’m the person to do that.</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.910" end="01:09:22.530" style="s2">Now you might be saying that on a relatively<br />low scale.</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.530" end="01:09:27.080" style="s2">Like, if I’m your assistant you’re never<br />going to have to worry about me.</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.080" end="01:09:29.770" style="s2">Because I’m always going to be there.</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.770" end="01:09:35.470" style="s2">And then maybe if you’re the CEO, you’re<br />going to say well, you know, this is the way</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.470" end="01:09:38.839" style="s2">that all of us are going, and here’s why,<br />and this is what it’s going to look like.</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.839" end="01:09:46.040" style="s2">And the better you are at that, the more that<br />potential will turn into… it multiplies,</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.040" end="01:09:47.220" style="s2">that’s what happens.</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.220" end="01:09:52.800" style="s2">If you’re good at dealing with it the potential<br />that’s accessible to you multiplies.</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.800" end="01:09:56.130" style="s2">Which is really cool.</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.130" end="01:09:58.570" style="s2">And also how you’d hope it would be.</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.570" end="01:10:01.980" style="s2">Because you know, you’d hope that more potential<br />would manifest itself to people who are more</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.980" end="01:10:02.980" style="s2">competent.</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.980" end="01:10:07.290" style="s2">Well, if things work well that would be good.</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.290" end="01:10:13.230" style="s2">So that’s the spirit and matter idea.</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.230" end="01:10:17.790" style="s2">And so that’s represented in that dragon.</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.790" end="01:10:27.210" style="s2">So let’s go back to it.</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.210" end="01:10:36.400" style="s2">Now, okay, so you remember this character<br />here.</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.400" end="01:10:37.520" style="s2">So what to do about that?</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.520" end="01:10:41.060" style="s2">What to do about chaos?</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.060" end="01:10:46.710" style="s2">Well one thing you might want to start by<br />doing is admitting that it exists.</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.710" end="01:10:51.220" style="s2">So let’s say that you’re not a terror<br />management advocate.</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.220" end="01:10:53.900" style="s2">Let’s say you’re an advocate of positive<br />illusions.</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.900" end="01:10:55.541" style="s2">Does everyone know what those are?</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.541" end="01:11:01.460" style="s2">Are you still taught about those in social<br />psychology, positive illusions?</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.460" end="01:11:02.460" style="s2">Yes?</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.460" end="01:11:03.460" style="s2">No.</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.460" end="01:11:05.710" style="s2">How many people know about them?</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.710" end="01:11:07.830" style="s2">Okay, where did you learn about them?</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.830" end="01:11:10.230" style="s2">[Student: In your class, PSY230.]</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.230" end="01:11:11.230" style="s2">In 230?</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.230" end="01:11:16.050" style="s2">No one else has taught you about this?</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.050" end="01:11:17.380" style="s2">Anybody else learn it anywhere else?</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.380" end="01:11:18.380" style="s2">[Student: I learned it online.]</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.380" end="01:11:19.380" style="s2">You learned it online.</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.380" end="01:11:21.640" style="s2">Okay, well thank God for that.</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.640" end="01:11:27.480" style="s2">Well, what happened was, the paper where positive<br />illusions were first touted, and that was</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.480" end="01:11:32.040" style="s2">in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,<br />it was the most cited… was it the most cited</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.040" end="01:11:33.880" style="s2">paper ever in social psychology?</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.880" end="01:11:35.190" style="s2">It’s up there.</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.190" end="01:11:37.370" style="s2">And it’s an appalling paper!</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.370" end="01:11:43.270" style="s2">Because it basically says… it says something<br />like this, if you scrape away all the nonsense:</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.270" end="01:11:46.840" style="s2">things are so horrible that if you just looked<br />at them, you’ll be so depressed you’ll</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.840" end="01:11:47.840" style="s2">want to die.</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.840" end="01:11:48.840" style="s2">So you better not.</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.840" end="01:11:53.290" style="s2">You better weave around yourself an illusion<br />that things are better than they are and that</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.290" end="01:11:56.270" style="s2">you’re more powerful and wonderful than<br />you actually are.</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.270" end="01:12:01.410" style="s2">And if you do that, but not too much, then<br />you’re going to be happier.</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.410" end="01:12:04.920" style="s2">Well, you know, the errors in that are just<br />manifold.</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.920" end="01:12:07.640" style="s2">First it’s like, well, who cares if you’re<br />happy, what the hell does that have to do</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.640" end="01:12:08.640" style="s2">with anything?</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.640" end="01:12:11.190" style="s2">You’d be happy stepping on ants.</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.190" end="01:12:12.190" style="s2">[Laughter].</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.190" end="01:12:13.190" style="s2">Well really!</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.190" end="01:12:14.800" style="s2">It’s like what the hell stupid idea is that?</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.800" end="01:12:16.630" style="s2">You’ve got positive emotion.</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.630" end="01:12:17.790" style="s2">Cocaine will do that.</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.790" end="01:12:21.410" style="s2">You know, bullies are pretty happy when they’re<br />pounding out someone like Milhouse.</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.410" end="01:12:25.630" style="s2">So you know, happiness, what the hell’s<br />that?</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.630" end="01:12:26.880" style="s2">It’s shallow.</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.880" end="01:12:29.370" style="s2">It’s a dopey idea.</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.370" end="01:12:33.560" style="s2">And then, well, how big should these lies<br />that you’re telling yourself be?</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.560" end="01:12:37.300" style="s2">And the answer to that is just exactly the<br />size that will make you happy.</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.300" end="01:12:40.810" style="s2">Well that’s not helpful, because if you’re<br />going to have a theory, let’s hear about</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.810" end="01:12:42.640" style="s2">exactly how big they should be.</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.640" end="01:12:46.580" style="s2">Well sometimes they should be this big and<br />other times they should be this big, but there’s</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.580" end="01:12:48.980" style="s2">no real way of telling a priori.</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.980" end="01:12:53.300" style="s2">Well so that’s not really very helpful either.</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.300" end="01:12:57.130" style="s2">And then there’s another idea underneath<br />that that’s even worse, which is reality</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.130" end="01:12:59.500" style="s2">is so awful that you can’t look at it.</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.500" end="01:13:05.590" style="s2">Well that’s nasty man, because that means<br />(and that’s what the positive illusion stuff</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.590" end="01:13:09.900" style="s2">meant, sort of like the terror management<br />theorists) if you got an unvarnished look</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.900" end="01:13:13.480" style="s2">at reality, it would just destroy you.</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.480" end="01:13:20.040" style="s2">Because you’re not strong enough to look<br />at reality in an unvarnished manner.</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.040" end="01:13:24.390" style="s2">Well, you can imagine why people would believe<br />that.</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.390" end="01:13:30.180" style="s2">You could think God yes, it’s pretty damn<br />awful.</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.180" end="01:13:35.730" style="s2">But then you think, well wait a minute.</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.730" end="01:13:41.000" style="s2">Is it really the case that everyone who’s<br />out there coping with the world is blind and</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.000" end="01:13:42.000" style="s2">deluded?</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.000" end="01:13:45.300" style="s2">Or maybe is it that the people who are not<br />coping with the world very well are blind</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.300" end="01:13:46.300" style="s2">and deluded?</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.300" end="01:13:47.840" style="s2">I mean, ask yourself that.</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.840" end="01:13:52.780" style="s2">You’ve seen people in your life that you<br />admire, I presume, and certainly you’ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.780" end="01:13:54.640" style="s2">seen people you don’t admire.</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.640" end="01:13:57.790" style="s2">Well, so let’s take the ones you don’t<br />admire.</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.790" end="01:14:02.270" style="s2">Well, how about blind and deluded, does that<br />partially describe them?</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.270" end="01:14:05.020" style="s2">It would be blind, deluded, bitter, resentful,<br />and mean.</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.020" end="01:14:08.380" style="s2">That sort of covers the territory.</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.380" end="01:14:10.240" style="s2">And then the people you admire?</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.240" end="01:14:13.810" style="s2">Well, they’re strong people, generally.</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.810" end="01:14:18.210" style="s2">They can do things that are really, ridiculously<br />difficult, like have a baby, and raise it</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.210" end="01:14:19.750" style="s2">without destroying it.</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.750" end="01:14:23.970" style="s2">Or work in a palliative care ward or be a<br />nurse in a cancer ward for children.</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.970" end="01:14:27.500" style="s2">I mean, there’s a lot of awful things.</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.500" end="01:14:29.060" style="s2">I talked to this guy the other day.</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.060" end="01:14:31.270" style="s2">I just met him sort of randomly.</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.270" end="01:14:32.780" style="s2">And he had had a motorcycle accident.</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.780" end="01:14:34.220" style="s2">And it was a bad one.</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.220" end="01:14:38.370" style="s2">He rolled like 200 feet at 60 miles an hour<br />and he broke seven ribs and you know, had</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.370" end="01:14:40.180" style="s2">a brain hemorrhage.</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.180" end="01:14:41.310" style="s2">Like it really took it out of him.</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.310" end="01:14:42.820" style="s2">He was a good athlete before that.</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.820" end="01:14:44.640" style="s2">And so it probably aged him twenty years.</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.640" end="01:14:47.450" style="s2">And he’s still recovering.</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.450" end="01:14:51.580" style="s2">And he was telling me, he works for a power<br />company, and so he’s climbing up these power</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.580" end="01:14:53.430" style="s2">poles, you know, because that’s part of<br />his job.</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.430" end="01:14:55.540" style="s2">Well now he’s pretty screwed up.</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.540" end="01:14:58.480" style="s2">He’s in his mid-fifties, he’s still climbing<br />up power poles.</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.480" end="01:15:01.610" style="s2">And he was working with a guy who had Parkinson’s<br />disease.</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.610" end="01:15:05.452" style="s2">And so the guy with the Parkinson’s disease<br />is at the top of the power pole and he’s</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.452" end="01:15:06.452" style="s2">doing his job.</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.452" end="01:15:09.410" style="s2">And he’s getting shaky, so they’re afraid<br />things are going to fall, and then this guy</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.410" end="01:15:10.940" style="s2">comes up behind him to help him.</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.940" end="01:15:13.020" style="s2">He’s only really got one arm that works.</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.020" end="01:15:15.350" style="s2">It’s like, Jesus, that’s tough.</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.350" end="01:15:17.710" style="s2">Those people are tough, man.</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.710" end="01:15:19.580" style="s2">You know, because Parkinson’s?</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.580" end="01:15:20.650" style="s2">That sucks.</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.650" end="01:15:25.010" style="s2">And well, so does having half your arm more<br />or less destroyed by a motorcycle accident</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.010" end="01:15:27.980" style="s2">and not staying at home hiding under the bed.</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.980" end="01:15:31.540" style="s2">You know, they’re out there still making<br />sure the lights are on.</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.540" end="01:15:37.370" style="s2">Well, that’s a pretty unvarnished confrontation<br />with reality as far as I’m concerned.</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.370" end="01:15:43.850" style="s2">You know, so I could say… alright, so here’s<br />another story.</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.850" end="01:15:50.550" style="s2">So, I’ve probably told you a little bit<br />about this before.</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.550" end="01:15:56.070" style="s2">When the behaviourists first proposed that<br />you could use exposure to treat anxiety, the</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.070" end="01:16:00.400" style="s2">psychoanalysts were all skeptical about that,<br />because they thought, well you’re just treating</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.400" end="01:16:01.560" style="s2">the symptom.</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.560" end="01:16:07.820" style="s2">They usually thought of a phobia as the manifestation,<br />the visible manifestation of something that</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.820" end="01:16:10.820" style="s2">lurked more deeply underground.</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.820" end="01:16:13.160" style="s2">And there’s real truth in that.</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.160" end="01:16:19.060" style="s2">Like, whatever a mouse is to someone that’s<br />mouse-phobic isn’t what a mouse is to you.</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.060" end="01:16:22.461" style="s2">The mouse is a bunch of other things, because<br />otherwise they wouldn’t be afraid of it.</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.461" end="01:16:27.110" style="s2">And so all those… you could say the mouse<br />is an exemplar of the category of all things</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.110" end="01:16:28.250" style="s2">that they’re afraid of.</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.250" end="01:16:31.340" style="s2">And that’s a good way of thinking what that<br />might mean symbolically.</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.340" end="01:16:35.890" style="s2">And so I had one client who was afraid of<br />mice, and she thought one would run up her</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.890" end="01:16:36.890" style="s2">leg.</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.890" end="01:16:37.890" style="s2">And she was also afraid of being raped.</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.890" end="01:16:44.530" style="s2">And those two things were… there was a metaphorical<br />union between them, even though they’re</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.530" end="01:16:46.790" style="s2">obviously not exactly the same.</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.790" end="01:16:50.510" style="s2">So the psychoanalysts, they’re making their<br />point, you know.</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.510" end="01:16:54.460" style="s2">But it turned out that… so the original<br />behavioural theory was you can’t be anxious</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.460" end="01:16:56.990" style="s2">and calm at the same time.</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.990" end="01:16:59.982" style="s2">So what you do first, if you’re going to<br />teach someone to not be afraid of a mouse,</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.982" end="01:17:02.130" style="s2">is teach them how not to be afraid.</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.130" end="01:17:06.820" style="s2">So you put them in a chair and you do a relaxation<br />exercise with them, and then you show them</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.820" end="01:17:08.190" style="s2">a picture of a mouse.</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.190" end="01:17:10.110" style="s2">And you say, just breathe, you know, calm<br />down.</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.110" end="01:17:11.290" style="s2">And so they calm down.</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.290" end="01:17:15.340" style="s2">And then sooner or later they can look at<br />the pictures of mice by themselves, and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.340" end="01:17:20.630" style="s2">maybe you could throw a stuffed mouse at them,<br />and then maybe they could walk by a pet store</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.630" end="01:17:24.720" style="s2">and look at a mouse, and so on and so forth,<br />till you get them holding rats.</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.720" end="01:17:27.530" style="s2">And so, you know, that works.</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.530" end="01:17:30.030" style="s2">But it works even if you don’t relax.</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.030" end="01:17:33.130" style="s2">In fact it works just as well.</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.130" end="01:17:38.830" style="s2">So the old behavioural idea that it was counter-conditioning<br />was wrong, just like the idea that the reason</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.830" end="01:17:40.830" style="s2">that you were afraid of a rat was because<br />of conditioning.</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.830" end="01:17:44.850" style="s2">It’s like, of course you’re afraid of<br />a rat, it’s a rat.</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.850" end="01:17:50.460" style="s2">Just like you’re afraid of snakes, you know,<br />to a lesser or greater degree.</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.460" end="01:17:53.740" style="s2">And people actually become more afraid of<br />snakes as they get older, interestingly enough.</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.740" end="01:17:57.790" style="s2">Which is not what you really expect, right,<br />unless it was a biological function.</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.790" end="01:18:03.600" style="s2">So anyways, all you have to do is show people<br />the thing they’re afraid of.</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.600" end="01:18:05.310" style="s2">And what do they learn?</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.310" end="01:18:07.160" style="s2">They don’t learn that the thing isn’t<br />frightening.</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.160" end="01:18:08.420" style="s2">They learn that they’re tough.</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.420" end="01:18:16.060" style="s2">And so one of the things… and that’s why<br />it generalises, which is… see the psychoanalysts</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.060" end="01:18:18.720" style="s2">predicted that what would happen is, well,<br />you know, yeah, yeah, you’re not afraid</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.720" end="01:18:23.740" style="s2">of a mouse anymore, but you’re twice as<br />afraid of being raped in your cabin when you’re</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.740" end="01:18:24.740" style="s2">up there alone.</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.740" end="01:18:26.850" style="s2">It’s like no, that isn’t what happens.</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.850" end="01:18:30.360" style="s2">You’re not afraid of the mouse anymore and<br />you’re half as afraid of being alone up</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.360" end="01:18:31.550" style="s2">in your cabin.</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.550" end="01:18:32.550" style="s2">It generalises.</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.550" end="01:18:36.640" style="s2">And so if you take someone who’s agoraphobic<br />and they’re in their mid-forties, and somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.640" end="01:18:40.450" style="s2">dependent, and you treat them for agoraphobia,<br />then they’ll go home and give their husband</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.450" end="01:18:43.700" style="s2">hell (because they’re usually women), and<br />tell them all the things that they’ve been</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.700" end="01:18:46.470" style="s2">wanting to tell them for twenty years but<br />have been too afraid to because they thought</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.470" end="01:18:47.470" style="s2">he might leave.</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.470" end="01:18:51.300" style="s2">And then they were afraid that he’d leave<br />and they’d fall apart and all of that.</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.300" end="01:18:55.770" style="s2">So they get… you teach them that they don’t<br />have to run out of a subway and all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.770" end="01:18:56.770" style="s2">they get more confrontational.</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.770" end="01:19:00.200" style="s2">And the reason for that is because they get<br />more courageous.</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.200" end="01:19:04.930" style="s2">And the reason for that is they go do something<br />difficult and they watch themselves and hey,</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.930" end="01:19:06.330" style="s2">they could do it.</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.330" end="01:19:11.460" style="s2">And so one of the things you might ask about<br />yourself is, how do you know what you have</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.460" end="01:19:13.700" style="s2">to run away from?</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.700" end="01:19:17.330" style="s2">You know, you might be so damn tough you just<br />can’t bloody well imagine it, and you’re</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.330" end="01:19:18.860" style="s2">just sort of sheltered.</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.860" end="01:19:25.560" style="s2">Now, look, you’re a lot less sheltered than<br />you were when you were three, I presume.</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.560" end="01:19:27.670" style="s2">How many of you live on your own?</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.670" end="01:19:31.310" style="s2">Okay, now, that was a transition, I presume.</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.310" end="01:19:35.000" style="s2">How many of you were depressed and anxious<br />their first year of university?</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.000" end="01:19:37.990" style="s2">Okay, how many of you weren’t?</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.990" end="01:19:42.080" style="s2">Okay, so it’s about 50%.</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.080" end="01:19:43.080" style="s2">Well that’s about right.</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.080" end="01:19:47.020" style="s2">About a third of first-year UofT meet clinical<br />criteria for depression according to the Beck</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.020" end="01:19:48.020" style="s2">Depression Inventory.</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.020" end="01:19:49.020" style="s2">Well why?</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.020" end="01:19:50.040" style="s2">Well it’s hard.</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.040" end="01:19:53.590" style="s2">You know, you leave your family, you’re<br />kind of protected there, you go out, you have</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.590" end="01:19:57.030" style="s2">to figure out all the things you have to do<br />to keep yourself alive and then you have to</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.030" end="01:19:59.880" style="s2">go to university and they’re going to give<br />you an impossible amount of work that no one</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.880" end="01:20:02.190" style="s2">could ever possibly master.</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.190" end="01:20:03.190" style="s2">So it’s daunting.</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.190" end="01:20:06.300" style="s2">And then you’re surrounded by people who<br />are smarter than the people you’re used</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.300" end="01:20:07.340" style="s2">to being surrounded by.</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.340" end="01:20:09.190" style="s2">So that means that you’re not as smart as<br />you thought you were.</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.190" end="01:20:13.060" style="s2">And then you meet people now and then who<br />are way smarter than you and way harder-working</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.060" end="01:20:14.960" style="s2">and way better-looking and all of those things.</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.960" end="01:20:17.960" style="s2">So you know, it’s depressing.</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.960" end="01:20:23.940" style="s2">But by the same token, how many of you feel<br />less armed to take on the world than you did</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.940" end="01:20:25.080" style="s2">five years ago?</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.080" end="01:20:29.110" style="s2">You’re not going to admit it, probably,<br />but I presume that that’s a very small number.</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.110" end="01:20:31.220" style="s2">How many of you feel more prepared?</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.220" end="01:20:34.110" style="s2">Okay, okay, so that’s pretty cool.</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.110" end="01:20:37.390" style="s2">So what that means is that you went out there<br />and did a whole bunch of difficult things.</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.390" end="01:20:42.010" style="s2">And some of those things… you’ve been<br />reading each other’s autobiographies right?</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.010" end="01:20:43.580" style="s2">How’s that going?</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.580" end="01:20:45.680" style="s2">Has it been interesting?</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.680" end="01:20:48.310" style="s2">Yeah, has it been worthwhile?</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.310" end="01:20:49.540" style="s2">Anybody think it isn’t worthwhile?</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.540" end="01:20:54.230" style="s2">I really want to know, you know, because it’s<br />kind of an experiment, in some sense, to see</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.230" end="01:20:55.230" style="s2">how this is working.</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.230" end="01:20:56.230" style="s2">What’s good about it?</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.230" end="01:21:02.550" style="s2">[Student: That you can get to know a stranger<br />on the deepest level possible.]</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.550" end="01:21:05.810" style="s2">So why do you like that?</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.810" end="01:21:10.170" style="s2">[Student: Because it makes the class feel<br />more…]</p>

<p begin="01:21:20.270" end="01:21:24.210" style="s2">They’re not really sharing their deepest<br />secrets, but what they will be doing is having</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.210" end="01:21:28.070" style="s2">structured conversations where they find out<br />a little bit about each other.</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.070" end="01:21:32.530" style="s2">You know, and it’s sort of… it seems like<br />to have a relationship with someone you have</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.530" end="01:21:34.540" style="s2">to get to know their hierarchical structure,<br />right?</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.540" end="01:21:39.970" style="s2">And it’s just like… like the tiniest things<br />while that person sits at the desk and types,</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.970" end="01:21:42.280" style="s2">well, it’s a shallow relationship.</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.280" end="01:21:46.690" style="s2">And if it’s a deep relationship you know<br />much more about the whole structure, right?</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.690" end="01:21:50.090" style="s2">Which is I think why the metaphor of depth<br />works so well.</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.090" end="01:21:52.691" style="s2">Okay, so you feel like it catalysed the classroom<br />a little bit more, is that right?</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.691" end="01:22:03.000" style="s2">[Student: Yeah, and isn’t it like you fall<br />in love with someone… this isn’t about</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.000" end="01:22:08.050" style="s2">falling in love, but you fall in love with<br />someone when they’re vulnerable?]</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.050" end="01:22:11.410" style="s2">Yeah so that’s interesting too eh about<br />the whole vulnerability issue.</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.410" end="01:22:17.430" style="s2">Yeah it’s like, if you’re forming a relationship<br />with someone what you do is you basically</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.430" end="01:22:20.650" style="s2">mutually open up your shells you know.</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.650" end="01:22:24.250" style="s2">Or basically you kind of go like this [opens<br />and closes hands].</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.250" end="01:22:27.190" style="s2">And if it has to close permanently well then<br />you go.</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.190" end="01:22:31.790" style="s2">Yeah well that’s another interesting thing<br />too because what it implies is that unless,</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.790" end="01:22:37.870" style="s2">you know, you voluntarily expose your vulnerabilities<br />you’ll never find a partner, or they won’t</p>

<p begin="01:25:43.180" end="01:25:45.150" style="s2">So you get more courageous.</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.150" end="01:25:50.060" style="s2">But then the next thing might be…</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.060" end="01:25:55.190" style="s2">I would say that you have a more sympathetic<br />relationship with yourself.</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.190" end="01:25:58.010" style="s2">Because let’s say you have this stupid memory<br />about something dumb that you did when you</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.010" end="01:25:59.010" style="s2">were 13.</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.010" end="01:26:00.740" style="s2">And you’re still carrying that along.</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.740" end="01:26:04.179" style="s2">It’s like, Jesus, you were 13, what the<br />hell do you expect?</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.179" end="01:26:07.590" style="s2">13-year-olds are just dumb as sticks, they’re<br />going to do all sorts of stupid things.</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.590" end="01:26:12.060" style="s2">Their brains are all addled from hormones<br />and they’re trapped in those little educational</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.060" end="01:26:13.060" style="s2">prisons.</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.060" end="01:26:15.590" style="s2">So they’re going to do stupid things.</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.590" end="01:26:19.000" style="s2">But if you’re carrying that it’s like<br />it’s you that did that.</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.000" end="01:26:22.130" style="s2">It’s not some stupid 13-year-old that you<br />once were.</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.130" end="01:26:27.630" style="s2">And so then you can start to see yourself<br />in perspective, you know, as a 13-year-old</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.630" end="01:26:29.040" style="s2">like other 13-year-olds.</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.040" end="01:26:31.770" style="s2">No better, but perhaps no worse.</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.770" end="01:26:37.980" style="s2">So you can get on your side, in some sense,<br />by walking through your story and seeing what</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.980" end="01:26:39.380" style="s2">the causal elements are.</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.380" end="01:26:40.950" style="s2">Does that seem reasonable?</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.950" end="01:26:44.890" style="s2">Okay, okay, yeah, well so that’s a good<br />thing.</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.890" end="01:26:45.920" style="s2">[Student: I think…</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.920" end="01:26:52.620" style="s2">I really liked it, again, because you really<br />get to know other people and I really liked</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.620" end="01:26:53.620" style="s2">that.</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.620" end="01:26:59.850" style="s2">I think that it was also interesting that<br />other people not necessarily knew more about</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.850" end="01:27:04.280" style="s2">you than you did, but they contemplated the<br />information that you gave them…</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.280" end="01:27:07.640" style="s2">like I know that someone looked at something<br />that I’d written in a completely different</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.640" end="01:27:10.220" style="s2">light than I did, and I thought that was so<br />interesting.</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.220" end="01:27:15.350" style="s2">Just like, the idea of kind of looking at<br />it a little bit more from the outside, and</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.350" end="01:27:17.140" style="s2">getting a different perspective on it.]</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.140" end="01:27:23.460" style="s2">Right, well that’s… what’s the famous<br />poem on the best gift we can possibly be given</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.460" end="01:27:25.280" style="s2">is to see ourselves as others see us?</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.280" end="01:27:29.710" style="s2">I think it’s Robbie Burns and I just mangled<br />the hell out of it.</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.710" end="01:27:33.830" style="s2">But yeah, you do get that opportunity, and<br />it’s weird.</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.830" end="01:27:36.670" style="s2">And this is something the positive illusion<br />people never think about either.</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.670" end="01:27:41.890" style="s2">It’s that sometimes people think they’re<br />better than they are, like objectively, whatever</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.890" end="01:27:42.890" style="s2">that means.</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.890" end="01:27:46.860" style="s2">But lots of times the opposite is true, and<br />I think it’s often it’s true even more</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.860" end="01:27:47.860" style="s2">often.</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.860" end="01:27:49.280" style="s2">It’s like, people think they’re a lot<br />worse than they are.</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.280" end="01:27:54.980" style="s2">No one’s as anxious as me or as concerned<br />about X or is as confused about this or as</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.980" end="01:27:59.420" style="s2">socially awkward, or is not funny, or you<br />know, everybody’s got their paranoia about</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.420" end="01:28:04.340" style="s2">this part of them that’s the worst that<br />anyone could possibly be in the entire world</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.340" end="01:28:08.580" style="s2">and it’s almost never true.</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.580" end="01:28:10.870" style="s2">Other people are a lot more like that than<br />you think.</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.870" end="01:28:14.720" style="s2">And they’re running around trying to hide<br />it madly as well.</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.720" end="01:28:16.830" style="s2">So that’s a good thing.</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.830" end="01:28:20.290" style="s2">Well you know, you’re also allowing yourself…<br />in some sense you’re allowing yourself up</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.290" end="01:28:21.290" style="s2">into the light.</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.290" end="01:28:23.260" style="s2">You go through your life and you think, well<br />I can allow other people…</p>
