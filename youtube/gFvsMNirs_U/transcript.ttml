<p begin="00:01:10.630" end="00:01:15.729" style="s2">a found at the neuro hacker collective</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.000" end="00:01:17.800" style="s2">and movement dedicated to upgrading our</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.729" end="00:01:20.200" style="s2">individual and collective capacities and</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.800" end="00:01:22.960" style="s2">to safeguarding the well-being of all</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.200" end="00:01:25.659" style="s2">he&#39;s an evolutionary philosopher systems</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.960" end="00:01:27.250" style="s2">designer a strategist and I could</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.659" end="00:01:30.299" style="s2">probably keep throwing lots of labels</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.250" end="00:01:32.970" style="s2">around and that still kind of apply</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.299" end="00:01:35.229" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of crossover between</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.970" end="00:01:37.509" style="s2">different fields which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.229" end="00:01:39.490" style="s2">something that we&#39;re going to explore in</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.509" end="00:01:42.220" style="s2">this episode so Daniel thank you very</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.490" end="00:01:44.979" style="s2">much for joining us thank you for having</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.220" end="00:01:47.979" style="s2">me fun to be here how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.979" end="00:01:49.420" style="s2">feel about the labels in fact when</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.979" end="00:01:54.159" style="s2">trying to sum up the things that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.420" end="00:01:56.079" style="s2">interested in I like talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.159" end="00:01:59.590" style="s2">things that I&#39;m interested in more than</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.079" end="00:02:04.360" style="s2">labels of things that I am or am not so</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.590" end="00:02:06.430" style="s2">when in general when people are wanting</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.360" end="00:02:08.170" style="s2">to ask what my background is whatever</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.430" end="00:02:10.090" style="s2">out I like sharing things that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.170" end="00:02:11.470" style="s2">passionate about and I like asking</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.090" end="00:02:16.269" style="s2">people similarly what they&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.470" end="00:02:18.850" style="s2">in and yeah as you said there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.269" end="00:02:20.440" style="s2">overlapping interests when you have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.850" end="00:02:23.569" style="s2">deep fascination with the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.440" end="00:02:26.349" style="s2">reality and everything within it</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.569" end="00:02:28.549" style="s2">yeah I think it&#39;s good to start with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.349" end="00:02:30.680" style="s2">the things that you&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.549" end="00:02:34.219" style="s2">rather than making identity statements</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.680" end="00:02:36.680" style="s2">so what what do you think how would you</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.219" end="00:02:39.109" style="s2">sum up the the mission of neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.680" end="00:02:41.239" style="s2">collective and what what drives and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.109" end="00:02:43.040" style="s2">prompted you to do the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.239" end="00:02:45.819" style="s2">do and what the collective is aiming to</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.040" end="00:02:48.980" style="s2">do hmm</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.819" end="00:02:52.989" style="s2">so the collective is an awesome project</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.980" end="00:02:55.730" style="s2">and it&#39;s one project that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.989" end="00:02:56.930" style="s2">associated with and there are other</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.730" end="00:02:58.659" style="s2">projects I&#39;m associate would they do</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.930" end="00:03:01.569" style="s2">very different things so what its</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.659" end="00:03:04.970" style="s2">mission is and what moves me are</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.569" end="00:03:10.870" style="s2">partially overlapping the goal of neural</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.970" end="00:03:13.489" style="s2">hacker is really at an individual level</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.870" end="00:03:16.430" style="s2">increasing human wellbeing and human</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.489" end="00:03:18.139" style="s2">capacity and right in that right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.430" end="00:03:20.269" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly focused on the physiology</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.139" end="00:03:25.359" style="s2">side of that but is eventually</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.269" end="00:03:27.500" style="s2">interested in the psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.359" end="00:03:30.199" style="s2">psychological cognitive development side</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.500" end="00:03:33.109" style="s2">as well but specifically looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.199" end="00:03:35.989" style="s2">how physiology effects psyche both</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.109" end="00:03:39.709" style="s2">states of experience emotion you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.989" end="00:03:41.590" style="s2">well-being and capacities and working to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.709" end="00:03:46.790" style="s2">do a better job of how we support</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.590" end="00:03:50.479" style="s2">physiologies to predispose happier and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.790" end="00:03:52.370" style="s2">more capable and more positively</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.479" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">oriented people is really the interest</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.370" end="00:03:57.949" style="s2">of it and in terms of what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:03:59.060" style="s2">so far that&#39;s exploring the space of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.949" end="00:04:01.340" style="s2">what you could think of as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.060" end="00:04:03.409" style="s2">psycho neuropharmacology or psychiatry</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.340" end="00:04:05.919" style="s2">but rather than just looking at single</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.409" end="00:04:09.049" style="s2">molecule solutions how do we address</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.919" end="00:04:10.609" style="s2">dopamine through one synthetic molecule</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.049" end="00:04:14.750" style="s2">or address serotonin or one synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.609" end="00:04:17.209" style="s2">molecule trying to look at is is there</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.750" end="00:04:19.070" style="s2">anything even imbalance with this</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.209" end="00:04:20.930" style="s2">person&#39;s dopaminergic system do we know</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.070" end="00:04:24.289" style="s2">and if so where did the imbalance occur</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.930" end="00:04:26.900" style="s2">and do we understand about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.289" end="00:04:29.659" style="s2">regulatory systems that are involved and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.900" end="00:04:31.729" style="s2">what would a more comprehensive approach</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.659" end="00:04:34.039" style="s2">to supporting those regulatory systems</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.729" end="00:04:36.160" style="s2">to do better and is dopamine the only</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.039" end="00:04:38.170" style="s2">thing that was in balance if it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.160" end="00:04:40.870" style="s2">their other neurotransmitters involved</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.170" end="00:04:42.760" style="s2">were their other nutrient amounts as</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.870" end="00:04:44.860" style="s2">involved where their gut brain access or</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.760" end="00:04:46.960" style="s2">neuro inflammatory dynamics so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.860" end="00:04:49.840" style="s2">do a better job of understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.960" end="00:04:52.240" style="s2">physiology as a whole as a subset of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.840" end="00:04:55.900" style="s2">then not just physiology but the mind</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.240" end="00:04:57.250" style="s2">brain environment complex but starting</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.900" end="00:04:58.840" style="s2">even just with physiology how do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.250" end="00:05:00.340" style="s2">understand how the different systems</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.840" end="00:05:02.950" style="s2">interact with each other more complexly</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.340" end="00:05:06.340" style="s2">how do they self-regulate what leads to</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.950" end="00:05:08.230" style="s2">increased homeostatic resilience or</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.340" end="00:05:11.470" style="s2">decreased homeostatic resilience or</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.230" end="00:05:13.090" style="s2">deviation from homeostasis and how can</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.470" end="00:05:14.650" style="s2">we do a better job of both understanding</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.090" end="00:05:19.360" style="s2">these systems and supporting these</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.650" end="00:05:21.550" style="s2">systems to have more resilience and more</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.360" end="00:05:23.610" style="s2">capacity so that&#39;s the goal of neural</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.550" end="00:05:25.930" style="s2">hacker and if you know if anyone goes to</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.610" end="00:05:29.650" style="s2">the website and checks it out with what</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.930" end="00:05:32.560" style="s2">they&#39;ll see right now is some</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.650" end="00:05:35.290" style="s2">information about that mission writ</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.560" end="00:05:40.420" style="s2">large but then they&#39;ll see one offering</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.290" end="00:05:43.300" style="s2">which is you know we we we had a first</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.420" end="00:05:44.980" style="s2">offering that was kind of how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.300" end="00:05:47.440" style="s2">something better than the smart drugs</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.980" end="00:05:51.220" style="s2">that people are taking to increase</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.440" end="00:05:53.230" style="s2">productive capacity but that increase a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.220" end="00:05:56.410" style="s2">fairly narrow bandwidth of productive</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.230" end="00:05:58.270" style="s2">capacity oftentimes at the expense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.410" end="00:06:00.970" style="s2">other meaningful aspects so maybe we get</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.270" end="00:06:02.590" style="s2">more focused but certain memory metrics</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.970" end="00:06:04.630" style="s2">decrease certain creativity metrics</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.590" end="00:06:08.290" style="s2">decrease and maybe things like empathy</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.630" end="00:06:09.760" style="s2">decrease anxiety can increase and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.290" end="00:06:12.600" style="s2">doing it in a way that creates long term</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.760" end="00:06:15.550" style="s2">dependence and down-regulation can we</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.600" end="00:06:17.320" style="s2">increase a broader set of the things</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.550" end="00:06:19.150" style="s2">that are meaningful for people and do it</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.320" end="00:06:22.240" style="s2">in a way where because it&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.150" end="00:06:23.590" style="s2">through and with their endogenous</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.240" end="00:06:25.990" style="s2">regulatory systems rather than</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.590" end="00:06:27.970" style="s2">overriding them if they&#39;re on something</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.990" end="00:06:28.480" style="s2">like this for a while and then get off</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.970" end="00:06:30.580" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.480" end="00:06:32.650" style="s2">they don&#39;t have dependence and crash and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.580" end="00:06:36.130" style="s2">if anything they have lasting elevation</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.650" end="00:06:37.390" style="s2">of baseline those are our goals and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.130" end="00:06:39.400" style="s2">know we&#39;re working on that for a number</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.390" end="00:06:41.650" style="s2">of other categories not just in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.400" end="00:06:44.500" style="s2">productivity category but that that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.650" end="00:06:47.230" style="s2">the first thing that we were able to get</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.500" end="00:06:50.560" style="s2">far enough with to have as an offer</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.230" end="00:06:52.150" style="s2">- that&#39;s neural hacker yes and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.560" end="00:06:54.250" style="s2">the those are the kind of the areas</p>

<p begin="00:06:54.250" end="00:07:00.070" style="s2">episode with the personal development</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.740" end="00:07:02.980" style="s2">that I think if we look at the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.070" end="00:07:06.700" style="s2">bigger picture of societies and where we</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.980" end="00:07:08.140" style="s2">are across the world it&#39;s almost the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.700" end="00:07:09.970" style="s2">same problem but talking at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.140" end="00:07:14.050" style="s2">collective level about how we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.970" end="00:07:16.180" style="s2">optimize what we have and try and raise</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.050" end="00:07:20.070" style="s2">and change some baselines away from if</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.180" end="00:07:22.510" style="s2">there are depleted or dangerous levels</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.070" end="00:07:25.150" style="s2">do you see them as sort of overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.510" end="00:07:28.210" style="s2">goals in in that respect the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.150" end="00:07:31.560" style="s2">collective optimization or is it a</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.210" end="00:07:34.570" style="s2">different sort of perspective the human</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.560" end="00:07:39.130" style="s2">brain the human physiology the human</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.570" end="00:07:42.070" style="s2">psyche and culture and ecology are all</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.130" end="00:07:47.470" style="s2">complex systems right self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.070" end="00:07:50.350" style="s2">complex systems and we are not that good</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.470" end="00:07:52.660" style="s2">at interacting with and supporting</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.350" end="00:07:54.370" style="s2">complex systems yet we the whole field</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.660" end="00:07:56.950" style="s2">of complexity science is still a brand</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.370" end="00:08:00.790" style="s2">new field and hasn&#39;t really entered that</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.950" end="00:08:03.790" style="s2">meaningfully into how we approach things</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.790" end="00:08:05.530" style="s2">like design we&#39;re quite good at simple</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.790" end="00:08:08.140" style="s2">systems and we&#39;re also pretty good at</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.530" end="00:08:11.500" style="s2">complicated systems so when I look at</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.140" end="00:08:14.500" style="s2">something like a the LAT laptop I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.500" end="00:08:17.470" style="s2">talking to you on the blueprint for how</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.500" end="00:08:19.810" style="s2">to make it from you know the transistor</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.470" end="00:08:21.130" style="s2">level all the way up to all the parts</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.810" end="00:08:22.780" style="s2">fitting the other software I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.130" end="00:08:25.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.780" end="00:08:27.250" style="s2">information no one person could do it it</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.450" end="00:08:29.950" style="s2">takes a tremendous number of people but</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.250" end="00:08:32.410" style="s2">there is a blueprint and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.950" end="00:08:35.650" style="s2">evolve itself in real time right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.410" end="00:08:37.090" style="s2">a static design it was designed the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.650" end="00:08:40.360" style="s2">computer didn&#39;t design itself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.090" end="00:08:42.970" style="s2">designed from outside of itself it</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.360" end="00:08:46.630" style="s2">doesn&#39;t repair itself as opposed to when</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.970" end="00:08:49.840" style="s2">we look at biology and we see systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.630" end="00:08:51.960" style="s2">that organize and emerge in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.840" end="00:08:54.820" style="s2">with their environments but without</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.960" end="00:08:56.410" style="s2">exogenous design and where they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.820" end="00:08:58.420" style="s2">have a formal blueprint the blueprint</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.410" end="00:08:59.830" style="s2">itself is changing the structure of it</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.420" end="00:09:01.420" style="s2">is changing in every interaction</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.830" end="00:09:03.880" style="s2">even if we look at the genome the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.420" end="00:09:09.310" style="s2">genetic expression is changing and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.880" end="00:09:10.959" style="s2">know etc so what what happens is when</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.310" end="00:09:13.690" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with a complex system like</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.959" end="00:09:16.649" style="s2">human physiology and we if there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.690" end="00:09:18.880" style="s2">acute cause of an issue like an injury</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.649" end="00:09:20.680" style="s2">we&#39;re pretty good at that in medicine</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.880" end="00:09:21.760" style="s2">dealing with things like injuries it</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.680" end="00:09:23.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean we won&#39;t get a lot better</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.760" end="00:09:25.149" style="s2">an exponential tech will help us get a</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.320" end="00:09:29.320" style="s2">lot better but when we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.149" end="00:09:31.540" style="s2">something like cancer or autoimmune</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.320" end="00:09:33.820" style="s2">disease or neurodegenerative disease or</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.540" end="00:09:37.480" style="s2">something that doesn&#39;t have an obvious</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.820" end="00:09:39.610" style="s2">acute cause it has complex causation and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.480" end="00:09:41.170" style="s2">that might mean that there isn&#39;t one</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.610" end="00:09:42.399" style="s2">cause there&#39;s a number of different</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.170" end="00:09:45.279" style="s2">causes and they might not be the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.399" end="00:09:47.399" style="s2">for different people so you might be</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.279" end="00:09:49.600" style="s2">looking autoimmune disease where</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.399" end="00:09:52.440" style="s2">infection was part some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.600" end="00:09:55.060" style="s2">subclinical infection was part of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.440" end="00:09:57.910" style="s2">destabilization of homeo dynamic systems</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.060" end="00:09:59.940" style="s2">and some kind of toxicity exposure and</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.910" end="00:10:01.990" style="s2">maybe some kind of nutrient deficiency</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.940" end="00:10:03.850" style="s2">combined with some kind of genetic</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.990" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">predisposition right all came together</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.850" end="00:10:09.520" style="s2">to lead to a series of imbalances that</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:11.800" style="s2">eventually we call MS or rheumatoid</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.520" end="00:10:14.500" style="s2">arthritis or whatever it is and so not</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.800" end="00:10:16.690" style="s2">only it might it be multifactorial right</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.500" end="00:10:19.570" style="s2">but it might have many steps of causal</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.690" end="00:10:22.680" style="s2">transform the infection leading to</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.570" end="00:10:25.779" style="s2">changed immune cells leading to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.680" end="00:10:27.790" style="s2">autoimmune antibodies you know etc and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.779" end="00:10:30.910" style="s2">that happened over the course of time</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.790" end="00:10:32.800" style="s2">and you have this delayed time causation</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.910" end="00:10:35.290" style="s2">all of this makes it much harder to</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.800" end="00:10:37.620" style="s2">assess cause and effect and so you need</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.290" end="00:10:40.660" style="s2">really a deeper system that isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.620" end="00:10:43.089" style="s2">working with one variable at a time and</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.660" end="00:10:45.339" style="s2">where there&#39;s clear causation but they</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.089" end="00:10:48.250" style="s2">can do this kind of complex causal</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.339" end="00:10:50.949" style="s2">assessment in the same way that we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.250" end="00:10:53.050" style="s2">just starting with functional medicine</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.949" end="00:10:56.140" style="s2">and systems biology to try and</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.050" end="00:10:58.570" style="s2">understand the human physiology more</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.140" end="00:10:59.920" style="s2">complexly but we have dealt with it</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.570" end="00:11:02.579" style="s2">pretty much like oh you have a tumor</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.920" end="00:11:06.220" style="s2">let&#39;s cut it out rather than understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.579" end="00:11:10.920" style="s2">carcinogenesis well cut it out or</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.220" end="00:11:13.570" style="s2">radiate it out or poison it out and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.920" end="00:11:14.740" style="s2">we&#39;ve really dealt with global issue</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.570" end="00:11:16.870" style="s2">right we&#39;ve dealt with the environment</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.740" end="00:11:20.250" style="s2">in very much the same way the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.870" end="00:11:23.980" style="s2">temperature is too high so let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.250" end="00:11:25.870" style="s2">geoengineering to address decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.980" end="00:11:27.670" style="s2">temperature but that&#39;s not addressing</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.870" end="00:11:29.649" style="s2">the cause of why the temperature is too</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.670" end="00:11:31.480" style="s2">high at all because we really don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.649" end="00:11:34.149" style="s2">how to do that well enough there&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.480" end="00:11:36.370" style="s2">many complex economic and social and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.149" end="00:11:37.529" style="s2">worldview and technological factors so</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.370" end="00:11:39.670" style="s2">we largely deal with it symptomatically</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.529" end="00:11:41.350" style="s2">well there with Ward&#39;s symptomatically</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.670" end="00:11:43.269" style="s2">without understanding all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.350" end="00:11:44.620" style="s2">that lead to patterns of human</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.269" end="00:11:47.440" style="s2">experience and behavior that lead to war</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.620" end="00:11:50.440" style="s2">and so I would say that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.440" end="00:11:53.680" style="s2">things I&#39;m really interested in is</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.440" end="00:11:56.920" style="s2">understanding that universe is a complex</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.680" end="00:12:03.220" style="s2">not a complicated system that just like</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.920" end="00:12:05.709" style="s2">our computer our civilization most of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.220" end="00:12:09.100" style="s2">what we have built a civilization have</p>

<p begin="00:12:09.100" end="00:12:17.050" style="s2">are anti fragile inherently like in a in</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.050" end="00:12:20.050" style="s2">that it is in relationship with</p>

<p begin="00:12:22.420" end="00:12:28.360" style="s2">contextual right and because of all the</p>

<p begin="00:12:28.360" end="00:12:32.380" style="s2">of certain kinds of plants with others</p>

<p begin="00:12:38.050" end="00:12:42.279" style="s2">be that much it likes whereas you</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.699" end="00:12:43.540" style="s2">contrast that to row crops and you can</p>

<p begin="00:12:43.540" end="00:12:51.540" style="s2">right the row cropping is fragile it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.740" end="00:12:54.100" style="s2">susceptible to collapse in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.540" end="00:12:56.860" style="s2">you know robust complex biospheres</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.100" end="00:12:58.779" style="s2">aren&#39;t and we can think of physiologies</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.779" end="00:13:04.060" style="s2">of culture in a similar way well what we</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.540" end="00:13:07.779" style="s2">have called civilization so far has been</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.060" end="00:13:10.110" style="s2">a process of converting complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.779" end="00:13:11.920" style="s2">into simple and complicated ones and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.110" end="00:13:14.230" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean it hasn&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.920" end="00:13:17.860" style="s2">anything good but it has been kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.230" end="00:13:20.079" style="s2">entropy generator in that way when you</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.860" end="00:13:22.510" style="s2">think of evolution as increasing</p>

<p begin="00:14:56.800" end="00:15:02.440" style="s2">very interested in how we can understand</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.320" end="00:15:12.670" style="s2">economics is just made up monopoly right</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.480" end="00:15:15.160" style="s2">like what our governments are made up</p>

<p begin="00:15:15.160" end="00:15:20.080" style="s2">isn&#39;t and psychology there are intrinsic</p>

<p begin="00:15:20.080" end="00:15:23.020" style="s2">made up stuff in there so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.400" end="00:15:25.560" style="s2">understand those better so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.020" end="00:15:27.220" style="s2">work with them in ways that support real</p>

<p begin="00:15:34.180" end="00:15:39.850" style="s2">how much expertise needs to go into it</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.210" end="00:15:40.640" style="s2">is but I was thinking back to what you</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.850" end="00:15:42.830" style="s2">first said about</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.640" end="00:15:45.740" style="s2">the nature of the body that when it say</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.830" end="00:15:47.840" style="s2">we have a disease or a disorder of some</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.740" end="00:15:52.070" style="s2">kind there can be so many interlaced</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.840" end="00:15:53.840" style="s2">interlocking causal factors yet doctors</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.070" end="00:15:56.930" style="s2">are often experts in just one of those</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.840" end="00:15:59.330" style="s2">so is there potentially an expert</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.930" end="00:16:02.420" style="s2">problem here that lots of people are in</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.330" end="00:16:03.740" style="s2">their particular fields say economics</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.420" end="00:16:07.970" style="s2">and they only see things through the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.740" end="00:16:10.250" style="s2">economics lens do we need to have more</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.970" end="00:16:12.590" style="s2">Jack&#39;s of all trades involved or is this</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.250" end="00:16:14.180" style="s2">a case of I don&#39;t know really</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.590" end="00:16:18.740" style="s2">understanding what you need to be to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.180" end="00:16:20.330" style="s2">an expert yeah so an expert in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.740" end="00:16:21.590" style="s2">complicated system see one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.330" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">about a complicated system is you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.590" end="00:16:24.650" style="s2">break it apart into parts and understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.360" end="00:16:27.440" style="s2">the parts in isolation and put it back</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.650" end="00:16:29.030" style="s2">together and you don&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.440" end="00:16:31.490" style="s2">kinds of synergies that you have in</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.030" end="00:16:33.080" style="s2">complex self-organizing systems so no</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.490" end="00:16:34.640" style="s2">one has to understand every part of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.080" end="00:16:37.370" style="s2">computer because we can take it apart</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.640" end="00:16:39.620" style="s2">and put a new CPU and put a new hard</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.370" end="00:16:41.330" style="s2">drive in and you notice that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.620" end="00:16:42.740" style="s2">treated bodies very much like that like</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.330" end="00:16:43.760" style="s2">oh this parts worn out let&#39;s take it out</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.740" end="00:16:45.740" style="s2">put a new one in or you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.760" end="00:16:47.180" style="s2">need this part as opposed to like whoa</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.740" end="00:16:48.710" style="s2">what happened with the regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.180" end="00:16:51.470" style="s2">systems here and what role did it really</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.710" end="00:16:54.770" style="s2">play and and you a gastroenterologist</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.470" end="00:16:56.360" style="s2">can&#39;t you know in a neurologist an</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.770" end="00:16:58.010" style="s2">oncologist they can&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.360" end="00:17:00.050" style="s2">any of those parts independent of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.010" end="00:17:02.300" style="s2">other ones because what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.050" end="00:17:04.070" style="s2">the gut via the microbiome via the gut</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.300" end="00:17:06.320" style="s2">brain access via the enteric nervous</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.070" end="00:17:07.940" style="s2">system we have so many different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.320" end="00:17:09.260" style="s2">of pathways is affecting what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.940" end="00:17:12.530" style="s2">happening in the nervous system and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.260" end="00:17:14.930" style="s2">all of the top-down mechanisms so there</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.530" end="00:17:16.459" style="s2">is I wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t say that an</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.930" end="00:17:17.990" style="s2">expert problem is how I would describe</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.459" end="00:17:21.380" style="s2">it I would say there&#39;s a problem of</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.990" end="00:17:22.790" style="s2">hyper specialization in complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.380" end="00:17:26.329" style="s2">where that is just not the right</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.790" end="00:17:29.090" style="s2">epistemology and Alfred North Whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.329" end="00:17:31.010" style="s2">wrote this great paper some decades ago</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.090" end="00:17:32.600" style="s2">called the problem of over</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.010" end="00:17:36.980" style="s2">specialization he said</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.600" end="00:17:38.600" style="s2">notice how we the smarter a kid is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.980" end="00:17:41.540" style="s2">earlier we start moving them into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.600" end="00:17:43.520" style="s2">specialization and we move them further</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.540" end="00:17:46.040" style="s2">and further into specialization so that</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.520" end="00:17:47.180" style="s2">by the time they do their PhD there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.040" end="00:17:49.070" style="s2">few people in the world to really</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.180" end="00:17:54.260" style="s2">understand their dissertation and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.070" end="00:17:56.660" style="s2">have relatively little abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.260" end="00:17:58.340" style="s2">across domains lateral thinking into</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.660" end="00:17:59.780" style="s2">other spaces etc because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.340" end="00:18:01.280" style="s2">supposed to be able to do a good job of</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.780" end="00:18:02.750" style="s2">that specialized expertise and of course</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:05.360" style="s2">we know there were benefits of</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.750" end="00:18:08.270" style="s2">specialization but I think then there</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.360" end="00:18:10.340" style="s2">were real problems with it you said so</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.270" end="00:18:13.130" style="s2">when all of our a students are thinking</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.340" end="00:18:16.040" style="s2">about tiny tiny parts then who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.130" end="00:18:18.380" style="s2">thinking about the hole and so we are</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.040" end="00:18:19.730" style="s2">leaving two people who didn&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.380" end="00:18:21.620" style="s2">excel that well to think about it or</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.730" end="00:18:26.030" style="s2">just nobody at all and it is just a</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.620" end="00:18:28.010" style="s2">complex kind of system but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.030" end="00:18:31.850" style="s2">necessary the one that we want</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.010" end="00:18:33.169" style="s2">or that works effectively so I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.850" end="00:18:35.840" style="s2">say what we want is jack-of-all-trades</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.169" end="00:18:38.210" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a false dichotomy I would</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.840" end="00:18:40.760" style="s2">say people who are studying complex</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.210" end="00:18:44.660" style="s2">systems and who are studying systems at</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.760" end="00:18:47.270" style="s2">all and who are studying deeper level</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.660" end="00:18:49.429" style="s2">generalized principles and things like</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.270" end="00:18:53.150" style="s2">design that are cross applicable so that</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.429" end="00:18:54.980" style="s2">they can so that they really have the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.150" end="00:18:56.660" style="s2">right epistemology to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.980" end="00:18:59.570" style="s2">systems that they&#39;re looking at and to</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.660" end="00:19:01.100" style="s2">work with them yes I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.570" end="00:19:02.570" style="s2">critical and I think it&#39;s been critical</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.100" end="00:19:07.280" style="s2">for a while but especially in the face</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.570" end="00:19:10.040" style="s2">of machine learning within narrow</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.280" end="00:19:12.230" style="s2">intelligence right now already and over</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.040" end="00:19:13.850" style="s2">the next little bit narrow intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.230" end="00:19:17.299" style="s2">via machine learning will just be better</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.850" end="00:19:21.919" style="s2">at us better than us at combinatorics</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.299" end="00:19:24.230" style="s2">with in finite spaces and it really is</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.919" end="00:19:26.000" style="s2">generalized intelligence that is at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.230" end="00:19:29.419" style="s2">meaningful place for humans to develop</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:32.120" style="s2">themselves and work yeah and in that</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.419" end="00:19:34.760" style="s2">case it&#39;s um it looks like the education</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.120" end="00:19:36.620" style="s2">system and the way that we value certain</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.760" end="00:19:38.419" style="s2">kinds of education is going to need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.620" end="00:19:40.580" style="s2">change and I&#39;ve heard you speak</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.419" end="00:19:43.610" style="s2">passionately and passionately in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.580" end="00:19:46.190" style="s2">past about an issue that we damp down</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.610" end="00:19:48.200" style="s2">kids curiosity in the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.190" end="00:19:49.640" style="s2">education systems and say no stop</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.200" end="00:19:51.470" style="s2">looking at that stop playing with that</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.640" end="00:19:54.710" style="s2">you need to go and learn these specific</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.470" end="00:19:57.049" style="s2">exercises so I wonder how you think we</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.710" end="00:19:59.780" style="s2">can reawaken that kind of curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.049" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">without fear and when I say fear I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.780" end="00:20:04.880" style="s2">the fear of parents or older generations</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:06.309" style="s2">because they might want to nurture it in</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.880" end="00:20:08.919" style="s2">their kids they might want</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.309" end="00:20:11.229" style="s2">understand the necessity for it but if</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.919" end="00:20:13.149" style="s2">they don&#39;t have any answers themselves</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.229" end="00:20:16.419" style="s2">cuz they&#39;ve only the parents have only</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.149" end="00:20:19.119" style="s2">got this old-fashioned education how can</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.419" end="00:20:23.049" style="s2">we overcome this this divide and find a</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.119" end="00:20:24.519" style="s2">way to nurture it in children the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.049" end="00:20:26.320" style="s2">thing that we call modern Western</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.519" end="00:20:29.499" style="s2">education is not the only system of</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.320" end="00:20:34.210" style="s2">Education that has ever been explored</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.499" end="00:20:37.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.210" end="00:20:39.609" style="s2">have the educational philosophy argument</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.840" end="00:20:41.619" style="s2">that it is just not even a very good one</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.609" end="00:20:43.799" style="s2">for many definitions of what is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.619" end="00:20:45.999" style="s2">meaningful way to educate a human being</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.799" end="00:20:49.029" style="s2">but when you look at kind of the history</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.999" end="00:20:53.109" style="s2">of how it came about and things like we</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.029" end="00:20:56.440" style="s2">need you know the movement into an</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.109" end="00:20:58.419" style="s2">industrial revolution where we needed</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.440" end="00:21:00.820" style="s2">people we needed a lot of people to get</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.419" end="00:21:03.489" style="s2">trained to fulfill roles within the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.820" end="00:21:05.559" style="s2">Industrial Revolution that were pretty</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.489" end="00:21:07.359" style="s2">fungible right factory line workers were</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.559" end="00:21:08.559" style="s2">pretty fun like any of them could do</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.359" end="00:21:12.519" style="s2">basically what any of the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.559" end="00:21:13.539" style="s2">could do and MBAs are supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.519" end="00:21:15.399" style="s2">able to do pretty much what the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.539" end="00:21:18.249" style="s2">ones can do and doctors and so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.399" end="00:21:20.289" style="s2">the society needs people to fulfill</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.249" end="00:21:22.299" style="s2">these roles so how do we create both an</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.289" end="00:21:23.559" style="s2">extrinsic incentive economics to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.299" end="00:21:25.599" style="s2">them to do it and how do we create an</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.559" end="00:21:27.759" style="s2">education system to train them up into</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.599" end="00:21:29.080" style="s2">these roles where then we identify them</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.759" end="00:21:30.489" style="s2">with this role and this role is really</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.080" end="00:21:33.210" style="s2">fun jables anyone else who had that</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.489" end="00:21:35.019" style="s2">training give or take a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.210" end="00:21:36.849" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be profound</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.019" end="00:21:38.739" style="s2">meaninglessness and that because the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.849" end="00:21:40.719" style="s2">uniqueness of self is gone their own</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.739" end="00:21:45.309" style="s2">kind of self-directed processes gone</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.719" end="00:21:48.309" style="s2">right and again especially in the place</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.309" end="00:21:50.979" style="s2">of robotic automation where those jobs</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.309" end="00:21:53.830" style="s2">are going to be getting automated and</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.979" end="00:21:55.450" style="s2">not just physical robotic automation but</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.830" end="00:21:56.769" style="s2">even the deep deep learning through a</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.450" end="00:21:58.089" style="s2">lot of the things that we think of as</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.769" end="00:22:04.210" style="s2">thinking things but things that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.089" end="00:22:08.019" style="s2">procedural aiza bulimics possible and</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.210" end="00:22:09.759" style="s2">necessitates a foundational rethinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.019" end="00:22:11.289" style="s2">of what education should be for and</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.759" end="00:22:13.599" style="s2">really like what society what</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.289" end="00:22:16.989" style="s2">civilization should be for and it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.599" end="00:22:19.170" style="s2">rather if we if we can decouple to where</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.989" end="00:22:21.960" style="s2">the jobs don&#39;t need the people</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.170" end="00:22:23.580" style="s2">to do them we can also de couple it or</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.960" end="00:22:25.560" style="s2">the people don&#39;t need the jobs meaning</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.580" end="00:22:26.940" style="s2">start to actually change the economic</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.560" end="00:22:29.730" style="s2">structure because we don&#39;t need it to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.940" end="00:22:31.260" style="s2">a source of extrinsic incentive then we</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.730" end="00:22:33.300" style="s2">get to say okay now we can actually have</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.260" end="00:22:35.370" style="s2">a system of entry where intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.300" end="00:22:38.160" style="s2">incentive is deeper to both the</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.370" end="00:22:42.110" style="s2">economics and the education so what is</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.160" end="00:22:45.200" style="s2">an education system where the focus is</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.110" end="00:22:48.410" style="s2">facilitating each child&#39;s unique</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.200" end="00:22:52.530" style="s2">expression their unique passion interest</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.410" end="00:22:57.420" style="s2">curiosities capacities and following it</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.530" end="00:22:59.610" style="s2">right now you say how can parents how</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.420" end="00:23:01.470" style="s2">can teachers participate with that if</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.610" end="00:23:03.150" style="s2">they weren&#39;t facilitated that way and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.470" end="00:23:04.920" style="s2">they don&#39;t necessarily know the answer</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.150" end="00:23:08.640" style="s2">and the kit the kids gonna ask them</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.920" end="00:23:10.620" style="s2">questions they don&#39;t know answers to if</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.640" end="00:23:12.750" style="s2">the parents earn this if they really are</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.620" end="00:23:15.320" style="s2">earnest about this they can go on a</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.750" end="00:23:21.510" style="s2">process of code discovery with their kid</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.320" end="00:23:23.340" style="s2">and when the kid says so why is the sky</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.510" end="00:23:25.020" style="s2">blue and the parent realizes that they</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.340" end="00:23:27.810" style="s2">don&#39;t actually know they remember</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.020" end="00:23:29.040" style="s2">something about diffraction but maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.810" end="00:23:31.890" style="s2">is reflecting the ocean they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.040" end="00:23:35.400" style="s2">really fuck about right then they can be</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.890" end="00:23:40.050" style="s2">like well let&#39;s pour it together yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.400" end="00:23:41.760" style="s2">and then rather than push for that</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.050" end="00:23:43.470" style="s2">exploration to go in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.760" end="00:23:45.210" style="s2">they&#39;re interested in pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.470" end="00:23:47.400" style="s2">the kids interest and ask them like war</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.210" end="00:23:49.050" style="s2">find out why they&#39;re interested in it</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.400" end="00:23:50.490" style="s2">and what their what their intuition</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.050" end="00:23:53.700" style="s2">about it is what their thought is and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.490" end="00:23:56.510" style="s2">help help go through the process of</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.700" end="00:23:58.710" style="s2">helping them learn how to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.510" end="00:24:01.380" style="s2">facilitating their interest in life and</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.710" end="00:24:05.090" style="s2">letting their interest in life and their</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.380" end="00:24:07.530" style="s2">learning reignite the adults also I</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.090" end="00:24:09.360" style="s2">think that&#39;s it that&#39;s a key ingredient</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.530" end="00:24:11.730" style="s2">that you mentioned I hadn&#39;t thought of</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.360" end="00:24:14.280" style="s2">which is not only to go and find the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.730" end="00:24:17.160" style="s2">answer for the kid but say first of all</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.280" end="00:24:20.280" style="s2">what what do you think and why do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.160" end="00:24:24.000" style="s2">wonder that and try and tune into into</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.280" end="00:24:26.130" style="s2">the nature of that curiosity it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.000" end="00:24:27.780" style="s2">the dynamic that I often see and I even</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.130" end="00:24:29.820" style="s2">feel that myself is a sort of sense a</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.780" end="00:24:31.470" style="s2">little bit of shame and fear if someone</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.820" end="00:24:32.790" style="s2">asked me a question I feel I ought to</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.470" end="00:24:35.490" style="s2">know the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.790" end="00:24:37.980" style="s2">and so it&#39;s kind of a conversation to</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.490" end="00:24:40.020" style="s2">about putting aside our own ego and need</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.980" end="00:24:42.750" style="s2">to appear a certain way in front of</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.020" end="00:24:44.310" style="s2">others well there&#39;s a there&#39;s a few fun</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.750" end="00:24:49.200" style="s2">things here so let&#39;s first address the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.310" end="00:24:52.080" style="s2">part about asking the kid why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.200" end="00:24:55.140" style="s2">interested so the kid asks why the sky</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.080" end="00:24:55.950" style="s2">is blue maybe that was the question I</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.140" end="00:24:57.840" style="s2">asked in the moment but they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.950" end="00:25:00.570" style="s2">really curious about why any color has</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.840" end="00:25:02.040" style="s2">color and they could just as easily ask</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.570" end="00:25:03.900" style="s2">why is the leaf green and they really</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.040" end="00:25:08.010" style="s2">just want to know what color is right</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.900" end="00:25:11.460" style="s2">and or they&#39;re really asking kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.010" end="00:25:13.080" style="s2">question about God an existential things</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.460" end="00:25:14.070" style="s2">about like why did the Creator make it</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.080" end="00:25:15.570" style="s2">that way because that&#39;s the way they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.070" end="00:25:17.580" style="s2">thinking about it and so they there</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.570" end="00:25:19.260" style="s2">there&#39;s a they&#39;re thinking about things</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.580" end="00:25:22.380" style="s2">like why is anything the way that it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.260" end="00:25:25.230" style="s2">or they&#39;re asking a question about why</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.380" end="00:25:27.090" style="s2">is it that we subjectively experience it</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.230" end="00:25:28.320" style="s2">as blue and does that relate to what is</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.090" end="00:25:29.610" style="s2">objectively true and do we all</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.320" end="00:25:31.920" style="s2">experience it the same way if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.610" end="00:25:33.830" style="s2">know you&#39;re gonna go into answering it</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.920" end="00:25:36.330" style="s2">the way you think they&#39;re asking it and</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.830" end="00:25:37.590" style="s2">then you&#39;re gonna find them get bored</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.330" end="00:25:38.910" style="s2">pretty quickly and then you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.590" end="00:25:42.060" style="s2">get frustrated and try and get them to</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.910" end="00:25:44.880" style="s2">pay attention and so it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.060" end="00:25:48.360" style="s2">important to actually pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.880" end="00:25:50.310" style="s2">what is the real inquiry and then not</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.360" end="00:25:51.660" style="s2">you go find the answer as if the answer</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.310" end="00:25:53.430" style="s2">already fucking exists they might be</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.660" end="00:25:55.050" style="s2">asking questions the answers don&#39;t fully</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.430" end="00:25:57.090" style="s2">exist - and you get to like be in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.050" end="00:25:59.640" style="s2">process of discovery together where the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.090" end="00:26:01.110" style="s2">answer matters less then the</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.640" end="00:26:02.850" style="s2">investigation the inquiry of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.110" end="00:26:04.260" style="s2">thinking about it and some of the best</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.850" end="00:26:05.580" style="s2">questions or when they get to things</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.260" end="00:26:07.380" style="s2">where we don&#39;t know the answers and</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.580" end="00:26:12.000" style="s2">their intuition about it might be as</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.380" end="00:26:14.310" style="s2">good as anybody&#39;s yeah that&#39;s that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.000" end="00:26:16.110" style="s2">whole I guess the the stereotype the</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.310" end="00:26:19.380" style="s2">picture of the friend of mouths of babes</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.110" end="00:26:21.990" style="s2">thing where you start seeing the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.380" end="00:26:23.370" style="s2">from a new angle just because somebody</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.990" end="00:26:25.530" style="s2">is asking a question which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.370" end="00:26:28.590" style="s2">unencumbered by years of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.530" end="00:26:31.050" style="s2">conditioning yeah and you know if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.590" end="00:26:33.870" style="s2">asking about so what&#39;s fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.050" end="00:26:36.350" style="s2">real is consciousness real and this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.870" end="00:26:38.670" style="s2">all arising in my consciousness is is</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.350" end="00:26:40.200" style="s2">matter fundamentally real and my</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.670" end="00:26:41.490" style="s2">consciousness is an epiphenomena of</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.200" end="00:26:44.250" style="s2">neural networks if we ask a question</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.490" end="00:26:45.510" style="s2">where we were the real answer right now</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.250" end="00:26:46.919" style="s2">is we don&#39;t fucking know this is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.510" end="00:26:50.940" style="s2">best thinkers in the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.919" end="00:26:52.889" style="s2">mentally disagree on this then it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.940" end="00:26:55.109" style="s2">place where you get to actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.889" end="00:26:57.359" style="s2">dialogue with them really on equal</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.109" end="00:26:59.070" style="s2">footing because you actually can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.359" end="00:27:00.359" style="s2">though you can tell a whole history of</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.070" end="00:27:02.100" style="s2">Western philosophy and Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.359" end="00:27:03.989" style="s2">philosophy on it you that still just</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.100" end="00:27:07.499" style="s2">brings you to I just told you a whole</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.989" end="00:27:09.379" style="s2">lot of things about why I don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.499" end="00:27:11.909" style="s2">so if you can come back to the like</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.379" end="00:27:13.499" style="s2">fascination and the interest you and</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.909" end="00:27:16.590" style="s2">you&#39;re in the same place as them and</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.499" end="00:27:20.489" style="s2">they do have they are touching it for</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.590" end="00:27:22.409" style="s2">the first time in different ways how do</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.489" end="00:27:25.470" style="s2">you think we can get to to detector the</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.409" end="00:27:27.239" style="s2">other point that I mentioned is how do</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.470" end="00:27:30.809" style="s2">you think we can get to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.239" end="00:27:32.489" style="s2">we&#39;re not worrying about admitting our</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.809" end="00:27:36.629" style="s2">ignorance maybe it&#39;s not such a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.489" end="00:27:40.019" style="s2">to a child but I think that we in in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.629" end="00:27:42.659" style="s2">West loosely speaking it&#39;s it&#39;s seen as</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.019" end="00:27:46.190" style="s2">largely not okay to admit oh I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.659" end="00:27:52.679" style="s2">know even though I feel that I should</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.190" end="00:27:56.519" style="s2">yeah so I mean you can see what a great</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.679" end="00:28:02.669" style="s2">tool to control other people that is yes</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.519" end="00:28:05.369" style="s2">and you can see how little real freedom</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.669" end="00:28:07.529" style="s2">you have and how little real ability for</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.369" end="00:28:09.389" style="s2">peace or intimacy or honesty with other</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.529" end="00:28:12.659" style="s2">people you have well that bullshit&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.389" end="00:28:15.109" style="s2">running in you now let&#39;s step back and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.659" end="00:28:18.499" style="s2">think about it like this for a minute</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.109" end="00:28:21.350" style="s2">let&#39;s think about the field of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.499" end="00:28:24.690" style="s2">knowable and the field of the unknowable</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.350" end="00:28:26.159" style="s2">as ontological or ease well the thing of</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.690" end="00:28:30.289" style="s2">them is epistemological categories for a</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.159" end="00:28:34.669" style="s2">minute he expels what the difference is</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.289" end="00:28:38.220" style="s2">yeah so ontology is in philosophy the</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.669" end="00:28:40.789" style="s2">the inquiry into the study of what is</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.220" end="00:28:43.820" style="s2">fundamentally real what exists and</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.789" end="00:28:46.679" style="s2">epistemology is how do we know like you</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.820" end="00:28:47.639" style="s2">do we think this exists because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.679" end="00:28:49.379" style="s2">measuring it in all getting the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.639" end="00:28:51.269" style="s2">thing because we&#39;re experiencing it</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.379" end="00:28:53.279" style="s2">because we&#39;re intuiting it because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.269" end="00:28:57.599" style="s2">doing math like what is the what is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.279" end="00:28:59.999" style="s2">right process of coming to believe</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.599" end="00:29:00.809" style="s2">anything that we might believe and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.999" end="00:29:03.720" style="s2">there&#39;s this deeper layer</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.809" end="00:29:07.289" style="s2">between what we think is real and how we</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.720" end="00:29:09.899" style="s2">think about anything and so those are</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.289" end="00:29:13.799" style="s2">some some of the deep categories and</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.899" end="00:29:16.590" style="s2">philosophies so let&#39;s think about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.799" end="00:29:20.610" style="s2">knowable stuff and the unknowable stuff</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.590" end="00:29:23.100" style="s2">now Heisenberg said a limit on no</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.610" end="00:29:25.350" style="s2">ability at the quantum mechanical level</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.100" end="00:29:28.080" style="s2">right said the position and the momentum</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.350" end="00:29:30.120" style="s2">of a quantum particle are not</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.080" end="00:29:31.499" style="s2">simultaneously knowable and here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.120" end="00:29:34.649" style="s2">big deal it wasn&#39;t an epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.499" end="00:29:36.269" style="s2">emmett it wasn&#39;t we just can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.649" end="00:29:38.369" style="s2">enough information about it it was an</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.269" end="00:29:39.809" style="s2">ontological in if they don&#39;t both exist</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.369" end="00:29:41.730" style="s2">at the same time at the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.809" end="00:29:43.950" style="s2">quantum it does not actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.730" end="00:29:45.539" style="s2">fixed amount of momentum and a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.950" end="00:29:47.610" style="s2">amount of position it has something</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.539" end="00:29:49.230" style="s2">weirder than that like a probability</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.610" end="00:29:52.379" style="s2">distribution about how much of those</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.230" end="00:29:56.460" style="s2">things it has and so there is a limit to</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.379" end="00:29:57.990" style="s2">the knowable and then you say okay well</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.460" end="00:29:59.460" style="s2">how many quantum particles are there in</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.990" end="00:30:01.019" style="s2">the universe and what are all the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.460" end="00:30:02.999" style="s2">interactions between them and how much</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.019" end="00:30:06.210" style="s2">unknowable is there from that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.999" end="00:30:08.909" style="s2">like okay that&#39;s you know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.210" end="00:30:11.700" style="s2">profound set and girdle&#39;s incompleteness</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.909" end="00:30:13.470" style="s2">theorem said set a limit on the knowable</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.700" end="00:30:15.450" style="s2">when it comes to mathematics right the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.470" end="00:30:18.299" style="s2">foundational axiomatic set of math is</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.450" end="00:30:18.690" style="s2">infinite well we you can&#39;t no infinite</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.299" end="00:30:21.539" style="s2">shit</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.690" end="00:30:26.999" style="s2">the knowable is always finite but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.539" end="00:30:32.779" style="s2">unknowable is infinite so it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.999" end="00:30:32.779" style="s2">to get first that the unknowable is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.869" end="00:30:39.929" style="s2">larger class than the knowable</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.110" end="00:30:41.399" style="s2">fundamentally and then within the</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.929" end="00:30:43.980" style="s2">knowable you have the known and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.399" end="00:30:45.779" style="s2">unknown and the known is I have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.980" end="00:30:47.879" style="s2">reasonable confidence margin through</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.779" end="00:30:50.700" style="s2">whatever process that my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.879" end="00:30:53.669" style="s2">of this is pretty good and the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.700" end="00:30:56.190" style="s2">is this is hypothetically knowable stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.669" end="00:30:59.549" style="s2">we just don&#39;t know it yet and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.190" end="00:31:02.490" style="s2">plenty of that within that the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.549" end="00:31:06.389" style="s2">is also a larger class than the known is</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.490" end="00:31:08.039" style="s2">within it knowable now why why am i</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.389" end="00:31:12.240" style="s2">specifying this I&#39;m specifying it</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.039" end="00:31:14.640" style="s2">because if I think that I should know</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.240" end="00:31:16.470" style="s2">most things then I actually just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.640" end="00:31:22.710" style="s2">no the deepest things about the nature</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.470" end="00:31:24.390" style="s2">of no ability itself and so that idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.710" end="00:31:26.160" style="s2">like Oh someone asked me something I</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.390" end="00:31:28.230" style="s2">don&#39;t know there&#39;s something wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.160" end="00:31:34.410" style="s2">me like to just realize how ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.230" end="00:31:36.990" style="s2">that fucking thought is yeah and its own</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.410" end="00:31:41.550" style="s2">ego and to instead say okay well the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.990" end="00:31:45.120" style="s2">there there is an infinite class of</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.550" end="00:31:46.710" style="s2">things I don&#39;t know and couldn&#39;t no and</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:49.260" style="s2">then there&#39;s a bunch of things that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.710" end="00:31:54.390" style="s2">could know that I don&#39;t and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.260" end="00:31:58.590" style="s2">forever and that is fascinating right</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.390" end="00:32:01.590" style="s2">that is in in enthralling it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.590" end="00:32:04.680" style="s2">get to touch a sense of awe in that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.590" end="00:32:07.800" style="s2">so I think that reframe of just really</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.680" end="00:32:11.040" style="s2">getting how vast reality is and how</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.800" end="00:32:12.210" style="s2">complex and how deep in and then being</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.040" end="00:32:16.500" style="s2">able to have a totally different</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.210" end="00:32:19.110" style="s2">humility in relationship to it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.500" end="00:32:22.020" style="s2">an emotional and even spiritual element</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.110" end="00:32:24.090" style="s2">to this I think that people find I found</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.020" end="00:32:26.130" style="s2">if you study something in depth when you</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.090" end="00:32:27.930" style="s2">go into the subject at first you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.130" end="00:32:29.640" style="s2">make all sorts of strong and sweeping</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.930" end="00:32:31.410" style="s2">claims because you don&#39;t know enough to</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.640" end="00:32:33.810" style="s2">know how complicated it is and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.410" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">quite exciting and then the more that</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.810" end="00:32:39.270" style="s2">you learn you realize oh I feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:40.440" style="s2">have to equivocate over everything all</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.270" end="00:32:42.600" style="s2">the time because everything&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.440" end="00:32:44.610" style="s2">complicated I wish I could go back to</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.600" end="00:32:46.860" style="s2">when I knew less but then the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.610" end="00:32:48.720" style="s2">transformation can happen where you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.860" end="00:32:53.580" style="s2">become comfortable knowing that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.720" end="00:32:55.830" style="s2">don&#39;t know much yeah so this is a mr.</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.580" end="00:32:57.360" style="s2">fun process right so we will see you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.830" end="00:33:00.000" style="s2">go to academic conference and you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.360" end="00:33:02.310" style="s2">the top scientists in a domain almost</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.000" end="00:33:05.460" style="s2">tripping over themselves you do not make</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.310" end="00:33:06.630" style="s2">any real statements because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.460" end="00:33:07.830" style="s2">want to say something wrong and firm all</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.630" end="00:33:09.450" style="s2">the other people that probably know a</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.830" end="00:33:10.830" style="s2">shit ton of stuff that they that they</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.450" end="00:33:12.840" style="s2">don&#39;t know that is relevant where what</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.830" end="00:33:15.060" style="s2">they&#39;re saying might be wrong and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.840" end="00:33:17.520" style="s2">you look at people who are radically</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.060" end="00:33:20.630" style="s2">less educated about a field and you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.520" end="00:33:24.120" style="s2">adamant passionate about it so now I</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.630" end="00:33:27.080" style="s2">basically I shared half of the story so</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.120" end="00:33:27.080" style="s2">one half is</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.149" end="00:33:32.489" style="s2">this is actually the this is a fun story</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.729" end="00:33:35.159" style="s2">so related to the knowable and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.489" end="00:33:37.309" style="s2">unknowable and the known and the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.159" end="00:33:40.169" style="s2">within the knowable our subjective</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.309" end="00:33:44.249" style="s2">relationship has to do with certainty</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.169" end="00:33:48.629" style="s2">and uncertainty and think think about it</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.249" end="00:33:51.119" style="s2">like this in the in the pre-modern world</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.629" end="00:33:53.399" style="s2">and most of the kind of religious</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.119" end="00:33:55.229" style="s2">traditions and maybe not some of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.399" end="00:33:59.309" style="s2">mystical interpretations of them but at</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.229" end="00:34:03.719" style="s2">least in in the dominant expression to</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.309" end="00:34:07.320" style="s2">the religious traditions certainty had a</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.719" end="00:34:09.720" style="s2">pretty high value right I have certainty</p>

<p begin="00:34:14.669" end="00:34:18.389" style="s2">if I get it wrong like I go to I could</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.980" end="00:34:19.980" style="s2">go to hell instead of going to heaven or</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.389" end="00:34:22.020" style="s2">I could reincarnate badly instead of</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.980" end="00:34:25.919" style="s2">reincarnating well and I&#39;m certain</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.020" end="00:34:28.109" style="s2">enough that we can burn women as witches</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.919" end="00:34:29.250" style="s2">and do Crusades and whatever we need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.109" end="00:34:32.819" style="s2">do because we have enough certainty</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.250" end="00:34:37.500" style="s2">about that rightness right right now</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.819" end="00:34:40.470" style="s2">science started to emerge and have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.500" end="00:34:44.279" style="s2">more success in in really important</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.470" end="00:34:47.819" style="s2">things like aiming canons and you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.279" end="00:34:49.770" style="s2">do practical physical things which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.819" end="00:34:53.789" style="s2">actually a part of why I proliferated</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.770" end="00:34:55.319" style="s2">one and it acknowledged certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.789" end="00:34:57.210" style="s2">uncertainties but it also gave us the</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.319" end="00:34:59.520" style="s2">capacity for more certainty plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.210" end="00:35:01.140" style="s2">questions like do heavy things and light</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.520" end="00:35:02.579" style="s2">things or dense things and non dense</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.140" end="00:35:04.170" style="s2">things fall at the same speed we were</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.579" end="00:35:06.990" style="s2">able to start solving some of that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.170" end="00:35:10.680" style="s2">right and earth being round or flat or</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.990" end="00:35:13.710" style="s2">we and and so even though within the</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.680" end="00:35:16.529" style="s2">philosophy of science the purely</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.710" end="00:35:19.289" style="s2">uncertainty holding it as very deep a</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.529" end="00:35:21.359" style="s2">lot of people carried the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.289" end="00:35:23.430" style="s2">emotional orientation toward certainty</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.359" end="00:35:27.329" style="s2">into the way they did science and wanted</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.430" end="00:35:29.490" style="s2">to like be pretty sure that the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.329" end="00:35:32.569" style="s2">started with the universe heard with a</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.490" end="00:35:34.829" style="s2">big bang and you know matter 1st and</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.569" end="00:35:37.500" style="s2">biology and consciousness emerge from</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.829" end="00:35:38.789" style="s2">neural networks and and this this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.500" end="00:35:40.740" style="s2">actually the philosophy of science</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.789" end="00:35:45.780" style="s2">section emotional structure</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.740" end="00:35:50.700" style="s2">of associating certainty with security</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.780" end="00:35:53.790" style="s2">and value and associating uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.700" end="00:35:56.190" style="s2">with insecurity fear and lack of value</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.790" end="00:35:58.230" style="s2">which create which is an emotional and</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.190" end="00:36:01.410" style="s2">existential bias leading to a cognate</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.230" end="00:36:04.380" style="s2">bias so then post-modernism saw these</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.410" end="00:36:05.700" style="s2">flaws and it said shit look at all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.380" end="00:36:07.170" style="s2">things that we fucked up in the name of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.700" end="00:36:08.700" style="s2">over certainty all the things we were</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.170" end="00:36:09.930" style="s2">certain about what we were wrong late or</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.700" end="00:36:11.130" style="s2">even within the sciences when we were</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.930" end="00:36:12.690" style="s2">pretty certain we had it almost all</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.130" end="00:36:14.280" style="s2">figured out around the time of Maxwell&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.690" end="00:36:14.820" style="s2">equations and modern physics fucked it</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.280" end="00:36:16.590" style="s2">all up</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.820" end="00:36:18.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s just happened so many times</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.590" end="00:36:20.160" style="s2">we really shouldn&#39;t ever be certain</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.480" end="00:36:23.030" style="s2">about anything because historically</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.160" end="00:36:26.310" style="s2">we&#39;ve been wrong about all of it and</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.030" end="00:36:30.420" style="s2">whenever we were whenever we were over</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.310" end="00:36:33.420" style="s2">certain we could do really terrible</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.420" end="00:36:34.530" style="s2">stuff II and so then post-modernism said</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.420" end="00:36:36.960" style="s2">we should actually embrace uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.530" end="00:36:39.030" style="s2">about everything and kind of all</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.960" end="00:36:41.280" style="s2">certainty and of course I&#39;m radically</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.030" end="00:36:44.000" style="s2">simplifying all of pre-modern ISM and</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.280" end="00:36:47.900" style="s2">then modernity and then post modernity</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.000" end="00:36:52.140" style="s2">but a move towards embrace uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.900" end="00:36:54.240" style="s2">and any idea any narrative is just one</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.140" end="00:36:58.020" style="s2">narrative and isn&#39;t fundamentally true</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.240" end="00:37:00.540" style="s2">and we don&#39;t know and so then it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.020" end="00:37:02.700" style="s2">pathologized certainty and made</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.540" end="00:37:07.440" style="s2">uncertainty laudable and I think both of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.700" end="00:37:09.630" style="s2">those are untenable and you know we we</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.440" end="00:37:11.460" style="s2">can actually see some major problems in</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.630" end="00:37:13.410" style="s2">the world from certain interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.460" end="00:37:17.910" style="s2">of postmodern that have led to the post</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.410" end="00:37:20.310" style="s2">fact world that have led to increased</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.910" end="00:37:24.390" style="s2">likelihood for strongman leaders to come</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.310" end="00:37:28.020" style="s2">in in a post fact world but I would say</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.390" end="00:37:29.670" style="s2">part of maturity is having a mature</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.020" end="00:37:32.220" style="s2">relationship with certainty and</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.670" end="00:37:34.350" style="s2">uncertainty inside of ourselves and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.220" end="00:37:37.650" style="s2">it&#39;s what you could call it epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.350" end="00:37:39.960" style="s2">maturity which is I have a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.650" end="00:37:43.650" style="s2">confidence margin for certainty about</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.960" end="00:37:45.720" style="s2">these things based on the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.650" end="00:37:49.050" style="s2">processes that I went through to come to</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.720" end="00:37:50.280" style="s2">it and I have less confidence margin</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.050" end="00:37:52.680" style="s2">about these things and I have no</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.280" end="00:37:54.329" style="s2">confidence margin about these things but</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.680" end="00:37:56.729" style="s2">my security and universe</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.329" end="00:38:00.569" style="s2">and my self-worth aren&#39;t coupled to any</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.729" end="00:38:02.429" style="s2">of it yeah yeah and that&#39;s that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.569" end="00:38:03.839" style="s2">point that people become so emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.429" end="00:38:06.839" style="s2">wrapped up in there and as you were</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.839" end="00:38:09.359" style="s2">talking about that post-modernism there</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.839" end="00:38:11.609" style="s2">I thought of someone who we featured on</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.359" end="00:38:14.789" style="s2">the site quite a bit Jordan Peterson who</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.609" end="00:38:17.849" style="s2">has a particular kind of gripe against</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.789" end="00:38:19.829" style="s2">who he calls post modernists and yet the</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.849" end="00:38:22.769" style="s2">people he&#39;s talking about seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.829" end="00:38:26.119" style="s2">gone kind of full circle where they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.769" end="00:38:29.009" style="s2">become very certain about their position</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.119" end="00:38:31.259" style="s2">where things they&#39;re saying well there</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.009" end="00:38:33.089" style="s2">is no inherent truth in anything and in</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.259" end="00:38:36.059" style="s2">particular we&#39;ll talk about say cultural</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.089" end="00:38:37.499" style="s2">relativism or cultural appropriation but</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.059" end="00:38:39.569" style="s2">they&#39;ve suddenly become dogmatic about</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.499" end="00:38:42.779" style="s2">it which seems to totally contradict the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.569" end="00:38:44.339" style="s2">original point if you read Foucault</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.779" end="00:38:46.319" style="s2">where Derrida or some of the good</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.339" end="00:38:48.119" style="s2">postmodern philosophers there was like</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.319" end="00:38:49.589" style="s2">real insights there right there were</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.119" end="00:38:52.499" style="s2">there were key important insights and</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.589" end="00:38:54.119" style="s2">they were not equally like the critiques</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.499" end="00:38:56.369" style="s2">were not about all of the sciences</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.119" end="00:39:01.079" style="s2">equally if you look at say the way we</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.369" end="00:39:02.779" style="s2">did social sciences and all of the bias</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.079" end="00:39:05.279" style="s2">that affects how we do social science</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.779" end="00:39:09.559" style="s2">that is gonna affect the way we do</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.279" end="00:39:13.589" style="s2">chemistry less right not none but less</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.559" end="00:39:15.150" style="s2">and so you know there are there are</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.589" end="00:39:19.499" style="s2">important insights there but when you</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.150" end="00:39:21.900" style="s2">look at so let you know let&#39;s take a fun</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.499" end="00:39:23.880" style="s2">case let&#39;s take the conversation between</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.900" end="00:39:27.269" style="s2">Sam Harris and Dan Dennett about</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.880" end="00:39:29.999" style="s2">freewill and consciousness these guys</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.269" end="00:39:33.779" style="s2">are on the same team when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.999" end="00:39:36.959" style="s2">you know atheism and the problems of</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.779" end="00:39:38.519" style="s2">superstitious ideas and religious</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.959" end="00:39:42.539" style="s2">metaphysical ideas but then when it</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.519" end="00:39:44.459" style="s2">comes to foundational ontology itself</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.539" end="00:39:46.199" style="s2">they actually disagreed on the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.459" end="00:39:49.170" style="s2">things one could disagree on right sam</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.199" end="00:39:49.709" style="s2">says consciousness is real but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.170" end="00:39:52.170" style="s2">no free will</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.709" end="00:39:55.109" style="s2">and Dan said no there is free will but</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.170" end="00:39:56.789" style="s2">consciousness is not real like the ears</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.109" end="00:39:59.489" style="s2">are the deepest and they and they are</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.789" end="00:40:00.660" style="s2">both philosophers of science and both</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.489" end="00:40:02.099" style="s2">have read the same books and both</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.660" end="00:40:03.179" style="s2">understand critical thinking it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.099" end="00:40:04.810" style="s2">well how the fuck could they come to</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.179" end="00:40:07.870" style="s2">things that are bad different</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.810" end="00:40:09.910" style="s2">and it you know and Sam actually said</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.870" end="00:40:12.490" style="s2">something really important in the end of</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.910" end="00:40:14.050" style="s2">that dialogue if and if you if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.490" end="00:40:16.120" style="s2">read it but it was a fun one</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.050" end="00:40:19.260" style="s2">he said it seems that we just have</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.120" end="00:40:21.580" style="s2">fundamentally different intuitions and</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.260" end="00:40:24.820" style="s2">or she is something to that effect and</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.580" end="00:40:26.110" style="s2">that that is actually like nai there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.820" end="00:40:27.820" style="s2">this thing called the symbol grounding</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.110" end="00:40:31.770" style="s2">problem how do we get the symbols to</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.820" end="00:40:34.840" style="s2">ground into experience right when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.770" end="00:40:36.430" style="s2">when you think of an apple you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.840" end="00:40:39.790" style="s2">things about the way an apple can be</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.430" end="00:40:42.160" style="s2">tart or sweet or melee or its skin can</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.790" end="00:40:45.490" style="s2">kind of peel off or it can snap or like</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.160" end="00:40:48.010" style="s2">you have so many interdependent</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.490" end="00:40:50.920" style="s2">contextual things and you&#39;ve taken it in</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.010" end="00:40:53.380" style="s2">through a tongue and a nose and your</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.920" end="00:40:55.750" style="s2">fingers in so many sensory organs plus</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.380" end="00:40:58.030" style="s2">the abstraction layers of it that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.750" end="00:40:59.830" style="s2">symbol has grounded right the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.030" end="00:41:03.040" style="s2">Apple has grounded through all of those</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.830" end="00:41:04.570" style="s2">sentry channels and so if you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.040" end="00:41:05.710" style="s2">had some of the same sensory channels</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.570" end="00:41:06.940" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to get the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.710" end="00:41:09.970" style="s2">grounding in the same way so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.940" end="00:41:12.580" style="s2">studying the chemistry of an apple but I</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.970" end="00:41:14.080" style="s2">haven&#39;t tasted it no matter how much</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.580" end="00:41:16.240" style="s2">fucking chemistry about an apple I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.080" end="00:41:18.010" style="s2">got and I know what the EEG patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.240" end="00:41:21.570" style="s2">people tasting it are I still don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.010" end="00:41:21.570" style="s2">what the fucking Apple tastes like and</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.900" end="00:41:28.030" style="s2">so there is a place at which as much as</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.900" end="00:41:32.380" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to be totally objective and</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.030" end="00:41:35.350" style="s2">logical what what when we hear it can</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.380" end="00:41:38.760" style="s2">land as true or not has to connect to</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.350" end="00:41:43.270" style="s2">some experience set that lands as true</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.760" end="00:41:45.460" style="s2">has to it is not a purely those axioms</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.270" end="00:41:47.740" style="s2">are reasonable and can be later reified</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.460" end="00:41:49.600" style="s2">by the process and this this was a good</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.740" end="00:41:53.260" style="s2">process for deriving other things from</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.600" end="00:41:56.080" style="s2">those axioms I accept it then one of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.260" end="00:41:58.120" style="s2">main sources of our cognitive bias isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.080" end="00:41:59.800" style="s2">just the normal logical fallacies</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.120" end="00:42:02.530" style="s2">everybody you know those are easy to</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.800" end="00:42:07.660" style="s2">study it&#39;s a bunch of emotional and</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.530" end="00:42:11.020" style="s2">existential level biases that affect the</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.660" end="00:42:13.349" style="s2">way we process and that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.020" end="00:42:16.559" style="s2">really subtle work comes in</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.349" end="00:42:20.519" style="s2">few examples yeah remember the first</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.559" end="00:42:25.890" style="s2">time that this hit me was so clearly a</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.519" end="00:42:27.359" style="s2">very long time ago but I was I was young</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.890" end="00:42:30.420" style="s2">I was talking to someone about their</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.359" end="00:42:33.410" style="s2">religious persuasion they had moved from</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.420" end="00:42:38.430" style="s2">being a kind of New Age Hindu to a</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.410" end="00:42:41.450" style="s2">fundamentalist Muslim and that seemed</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.430" end="00:42:42.890" style="s2">like a very and they did that while in</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.450" end="00:42:45.420" style="s2">mmm</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.890" end="00:42:47.729" style="s2">California upper class I&#39;m like that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.420" end="00:42:49.430" style="s2">seems like a very interesting step that</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.729" end="00:42:53.069" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make that much sense to me and</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.430" end="00:42:55.950" style="s2">so I asked them questions about the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.069" end="00:42:57.720" style="s2">theology of Islam and if they really</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.950" end="00:43:01.289" style="s2">believed these aspects of the theology</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.720" end="00:43:04.319" style="s2">and and it wasn&#39;t getting anywhere like</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.289" end="00:43:06.450" style="s2">it I there was no place where they were</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.319" end="00:43:07.799" style="s2">really willing to look at the aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.450" end="00:43:11.369" style="s2">the theology I was pretty sure they</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.799" end="00:43:12.869" style="s2">probably didn&#39;t believe and but in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.369" end="00:43:14.460" style="s2">process of the way I was asking I was</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.869" end="00:43:17.039" style="s2">actually damaging my rapport with this</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.460" end="00:43:19.289" style="s2">person and in damaging rapport I was</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.039" end="00:43:20.759" style="s2">damaging the ability to actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.289" end="00:43:24.180" style="s2">meaningful conversation about this or</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.759" end="00:43:26.460" style="s2">any topic right and so I stopped and</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.180" end="00:43:28.739" style="s2">then I came back to let me see if I can</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.460" end="00:43:31.349" style="s2">just create rapport about anything we</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.739" end="00:43:32.489" style="s2">get rapport fast forward about a year</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.349" end="00:43:34.289" style="s2">because it takes that much time to</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.489" end="00:43:38.779" style="s2">repair the rapport from an issue like</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.289" end="00:43:42.479" style="s2">this and I ended up finding out that</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.779" end="00:43:43.529" style="s2">this person comes to Islam and their</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.479" end="00:43:44.700" style="s2">particular belief someone saying this</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.529" end="00:43:46.319" style="s2">would be true for everyone I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.700" end="00:43:50.519" style="s2">this one case this was a place of</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.319" end="00:43:53.700" style="s2">realizing this person&#39;s past was that</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.519" end="00:43:55.079" style="s2">they actually couldn&#39;t say no and they</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.700" end="00:43:57.569" style="s2">couldn&#39;t set limits or boundaries from</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.079" end="00:43:58.589" style="s2">themselves because of like family sexual</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.569" end="00:44:03.420" style="s2">trauma that had happened in their</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.589" end="00:44:05.729" style="s2">childhood and they got to a place where</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.420" end="00:44:07.079" style="s2">they were there were some things that</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.729" end="00:44:09.289" style="s2">happened in their life and because they</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.079" end="00:44:11.549" style="s2">couldn&#39;t say no to some fairly terrible</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.289" end="00:44:13.079" style="s2">things that led to their relationship</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.549" end="00:44:15.630" style="s2">breaking whatever and they they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.079" end="00:44:18.749" style="s2">oh wow I&#39;m gonna die basically because I</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.630" end="00:44:21.269" style="s2">can&#39;t set limits or say no and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.749" end="00:44:23.099" style="s2">right around that time they met a friend</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.269" end="00:44:25.200" style="s2">who had just joined Islam and they were</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.099" end="00:44:25.880" style="s2">talking about it and the rules in kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.200" end="00:44:28.700" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.880" end="00:44:33.140" style="s2">absoluteness of the rules and that they</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.700" end="00:44:36.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t have to hold boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.140" end="00:44:37.910" style="s2">themselves they just being someone who</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.440" end="00:44:41.480" style="s2">believed that got to follow those rules</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.910" end="00:44:43.930" style="s2">and at a survival level that told this</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.480" end="00:44:47.140" style="s2">person oh she could actually survive</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.930" end="00:44:49.790" style="s2">because she could adopt a rule set that</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.140" end="00:44:52.370" style="s2">she now she could say no with that</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.790" end="00:44:53.870" style="s2">reason it but it bypassed her childhood</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.370" end="00:44:57.380" style="s2">reasons of not being able to say no and</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.870" end="00:45:00.050" style="s2">so what I realized was it had nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.380" end="00:45:01.880" style="s2">do with theology even though later the</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.050" end="00:45:05.720" style="s2">theology back felled itself has a</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.880" end="00:45:07.370" style="s2">rationalization and so I was addressing</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.720" end="00:45:08.870" style="s2">it at totally the wrong level because it</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.370" end="00:45:10.880" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the level at which the decision</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.870" end="00:45:13.550" style="s2">was made the choice was made by a deep</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.880" end="00:45:15.260" style="s2">rational introspection and study of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.550" end="00:45:19.520" style="s2">theology compared to other theologies</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.260" end="00:45:23.930" style="s2">and so then when I talked with them</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.520" end="00:45:26.950" style="s2">about basically just childhood and their</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.930" end="00:45:29.840" style="s2">ability to say no and set boundaries and</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.950" end="00:45:31.280" style="s2">construct those capacities inside of</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.840" end="00:45:33.320" style="s2">them rather than try to deconstruct a</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.280" end="00:45:35.570" style="s2">belief once actually felt they had that</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.320" end="00:45:39.170" style="s2">capacity they ended up deconstructing</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.570" end="00:45:41.090" style="s2">the religious belief on their own their</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.170" end="00:45:43.430" style="s2">critical thinking couldn&#39;t kick in</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.090" end="00:45:44.750" style="s2">because it was if their critical</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.430" end="00:45:46.190" style="s2">thinking kicked in or if they allowed</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.750" end="00:45:48.380" style="s2">anyone else&#39;s critical thinking to kick</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.190" end="00:45:50.930" style="s2">in it would hit a survival level fear</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.380" end="00:45:54.230" style="s2">for them of a belief that was meeting a</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.930" end="00:45:55.850" style="s2">need and maybe it&#39;s the need to get to</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.230" end="00:45:57.170" style="s2">still be part of your family because if</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.850" end="00:45:58.430" style="s2">you leave the religion you won&#39;t be part</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.170" end="00:46:00.710" style="s2">of the family or you won&#39;t be part of</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.430" end="00:46:02.720" style="s2">the community or or you&#39;re too afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.710" end="00:46:05.900" style="s2">death and so you know there&#39;s an extent</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.720" end="00:46:08.450" style="s2">whatever it is or it&#39;s it&#39;s a situation</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.900" end="00:46:09.950" style="s2">where if you say this particular thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.450" end="00:46:13.220" style="s2">inside of academia inside of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.950" end="00:46:15.200" style="s2">sciences you will be shunned for saying</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.220" end="00:46:17.510" style="s2">something that is so non-standard model</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.200" end="00:46:18.980" style="s2">that you lose all kinds of opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.510" end="00:46:24.380" style="s2">so there&#39;s like all these little subtle</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.980" end="00:46:26.660" style="s2">and not-so-subtle sources of bias that</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.380" end="00:46:31.730" style="s2">affect the process of how we go about</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.660" end="00:46:34.010" style="s2">understanding reality it&#39;s it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.730" end="00:46:35.930" style="s2">same sort of mechanism and thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.010" end="00:46:37.880" style="s2">when you make a big change in your life</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.930" end="00:46:39.680" style="s2">or maybe you leave a place of employment</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.880" end="00:46:41.480" style="s2">and people become angry</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.680" end="00:46:43.160" style="s2">with you because you&#39;re changing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.480" end="00:46:45.530" style="s2">not what they expected anymore because</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.160" end="00:46:48.069" style="s2">for them there&#39;s they could receive it</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.530" end="00:46:51.770" style="s2">as an implicit implicit criticism of</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.069" end="00:46:53.780" style="s2">themselves and their choices and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.770" end="00:46:55.579" style="s2">all happening kind of as a subtext and</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.780" end="00:46:58.849" style="s2">people are getting angry and they maybe</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.579" end="00:47:00.829" style="s2">don&#39;t know why they&#39;re angry yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.849" end="00:47:04.579" style="s2">so now you come back to the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.829" end="00:47:06.470" style="s2">relativism and you see okay someone</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.579" end="00:47:10.550" style="s2">might have taken postmodern philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.470" end="00:47:13.069" style="s2">and used it as cognitive backfill to</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.550" end="00:47:15.760" style="s2">positions that largely came from other</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.069" end="00:47:18.079" style="s2">places they didn&#39;t just come from a</p>

<p begin="00:47:19.940" end="00:47:22.880" style="s2">this was the very best thinking they</p>

<p begin="00:47:22.880" end="00:47:27.950" style="s2">have been their own trauma or witnessing</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.599" end="00:47:29.690" style="s2">a trauma in the world that was so</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.950" end="00:47:32.000" style="s2">problematic that they took it on or</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.690" end="00:47:35.000" style="s2">resonated with it and that&#39;s affecting</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.000" end="00:47:36.589" style="s2">then the way they are you know what</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.000" end="00:47:41.960" style="s2">they&#39;re resonating with intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.589" end="00:47:43.400" style="s2">and how they&#39;re processing it do you how</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.960" end="00:47:46.339" style="s2">do you think we can become more aware of</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.400" end="00:47:50.180" style="s2">that in ourselves if we if we start from</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.339" end="00:47:52.549" style="s2">the point that we&#39;re willing to become</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.180" end="00:47:54.650" style="s2">more aware of it a lot of these things</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.549" end="00:47:56.780" style="s2">just sort of well up as emotions and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.650" end="00:47:59.059" style="s2">sometimes that&#39;s useful and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.780" end="00:48:01.670" style="s2">it&#39;s not but maybe if we take the</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.059" end="00:48:05.329" style="s2">example of cultural appropriation which</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.670" end="00:48:07.460" style="s2">is such a hot topic at the moment how do</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.329" end="00:48:10.040" style="s2">you see that playing out for people</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.460" end="00:48:12.170" style="s2">emotionally and how how might we be able</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.040" end="00:48:16.369" style="s2">to have a more productive self</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.170" end="00:48:20.390" style="s2">reflective conversation about it well</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.369" end="00:48:23.780" style="s2">one good thing is I want to see if I can</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.390" end="00:48:29.470" style="s2">take both sides or any side of the topic</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.780" end="00:48:29.470" style="s2">well enough that I really get it II and</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.890" end="00:48:37.490" style="s2">if I can&#39;t if while I&#39;m trying to take</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.400" end="00:48:38.900" style="s2">the other side I feel like I&#39;m mocking</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.490" end="00:48:42.109" style="s2">it the whole time because it just seems</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.900" end="00:48:44.119" style="s2">so stupid then there is some bias that</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.109" end="00:48:45.829" style="s2">won&#39;t actually allow me to see reality</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.119" end="00:48:50.299" style="s2">through that lens and see if I&#39;m missing</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.829" end="00:48:52.910" style="s2">anything needs and so then part of</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.299" end="00:48:53.700" style="s2">earnestness would be can I actually do I</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.910" end="00:48:55.800" style="s2">know that</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.700" end="00:48:59.130" style="s2">seeing what they&#39;re seeing or am i I</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.800" end="00:49:01.740" style="s2">might not be but I actually like notice</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.130" end="00:49:03.900" style="s2">how many times there&#39;s a I want to stay</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.740" end="00:49:09.450" style="s2">in with the people who share a belief</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.900" end="00:49:11.190" style="s2">similar to me or coming to this belief</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.450" end="00:49:13.530" style="s2">that I had answered some really critical</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.190" end="00:49:15.030" style="s2">things that made me feel more okay or</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.530" end="00:49:16.770" style="s2">like I had my shit together a safer and</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.030" end="00:49:19.110" style="s2">universe or smarter and leaving that</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.770" end="00:49:22.920" style="s2">feel scary you know you know you notice</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.110" end="00:49:25.040" style="s2">all those kinds of things and so I would</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.920" end="00:49:34.110" style="s2">say the degree to which we can identify</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.040" end="00:49:37.620" style="s2">with our own earnestness to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.110" end="00:49:39.540" style="s2">explore more than our current position</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.620" end="00:49:41.340" style="s2">about things that&#39;s a much better</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.540" end="00:49:45.690" style="s2">identity to the degree we need to have</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.340" end="00:49:48.240" style="s2">one mmm I think with with the example of</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.690" end="00:49:49.830" style="s2">a cultural appropriation when I try and</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.240" end="00:49:51.840" style="s2">think into the mind of someone who</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.830" end="00:49:55.050" style="s2">thinks that it&#39;s pretty much always a</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.840" end="00:49:57.720" style="s2">bad thing it goes I have sort of two</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.050" end="00:50:00.150" style="s2">rough pictures of what that can be</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.720" end="00:50:02.460" style="s2">driven by and one is the more negative</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.150" end="00:50:04.350" style="s2">kind of wanting to virtue signal and</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.460" end="00:50:06.300" style="s2">want to be right on and sort of a cruise</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.350" end="00:50:08.880" style="s2">the sort of certainty we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.300" end="00:50:10.560" style="s2">before that I know that this is the this</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.880" end="00:50:13.350" style="s2">is wrong to do it&#39;s morally wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.560" end="00:50:15.660" style="s2">therefore I&#39;m a good person and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.350" end="00:50:19.110" style="s2">other I think comes from a place of pain</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.660" end="00:50:21.990" style="s2">that it&#39;s hard to want to identify with</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.110" end="00:50:24.540" style="s2">that if you feel that you your culture</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.990" end="00:50:26.940" style="s2">or the culture of your parents and</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.540" end="00:50:30.090" style="s2">relatives has been taken and abused</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.940" end="00:50:32.160" style="s2">that&#39;s quite a deep hurt and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.090" end="00:50:34.070" style="s2">coming from a place where you feel there</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.160" end="00:50:37.320" style="s2">is no understanding of you it&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.070" end="00:50:42.180" style="s2">alienation pain and that&#39;s also very</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.320" end="00:50:44.010" style="s2">uncomfortable to enter into yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.180" end="00:50:47.130" style="s2">think this is a good process right where</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.010" end="00:50:49.680" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re not making everyone who</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.130" end="00:50:52.080" style="s2">believes that cultural appropriation is</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.680" end="00:50:53.070" style="s2">an issue in the same category you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.080" end="00:50:56.250" style="s2">acknowledging that there might be</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.070" end="00:50:58.230" style="s2">different epistemologies and different</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.250" end="00:50:59.490" style="s2">processes that bring them there which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.230" end="00:51:01.680" style="s2">key and then you&#39;re kind of feeling into</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.490" end="00:51:04.020" style="s2">what those could be and some that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.680" end="00:51:07.380" style="s2">can really empathize with this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.020" end="00:51:09.420" style="s2">topic that I would say I have very deep</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.380" end="00:51:11.549" style="s2">molarity or expertise was but but as I</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.420" end="00:51:13.529" style="s2">just think into it right now with you</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.549" end="00:51:17.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of things that come up</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.529" end="00:51:19.920" style="s2">right as I think about someone who says</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.880" end="00:51:20.700" style="s2">cultural appropriation is wrong and why</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.920" end="00:51:25.799" style="s2">that would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.700" end="00:51:28.500" style="s2">I can imagine reasons mmm</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.799" end="00:51:30.000" style="s2">deeper than just even the pain of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.500" end="00:51:33.809" style="s2">culture that has been damaged by another</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.000" end="00:51:36.660" style="s2">culture II I can imagine very real</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.809" end="00:51:38.519" style="s2">reason so let&#39;s say we take hey white</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.660" end="00:51:40.380" style="s2">people shouldn&#39;t wear dreadlocks oh they</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.519" end="00:51:43.069" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t wear hindu bindi so they</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.380" end="00:51:45.480" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t you know where hari krishna</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.069" end="00:51:49.069" style="s2">chika ponytails or whatever whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.480" end="00:51:51.509" style="s2">is right well then you say well what</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.069" end="00:51:54.150" style="s2">were those things well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.509" end="00:51:57.569" style="s2">superficial answer which is they were</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.150" end="00:52:00.240" style="s2">some aesthetic whatever right but then</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.569" end="00:52:04.829" style="s2">you go deeper well it was actually a</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.240" end="00:52:08.450" style="s2">signaling mechanism of people who had</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.829" end="00:52:11.460" style="s2">went through so say say in getting that</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.450" end="00:52:13.049" style="s2">that brahmin string or getting that mall</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.460" end="00:52:15.539" style="s2">or getting that whatever it was they had</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.049" end="00:52:17.970" style="s2">actually went through specific ritual</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.539" end="00:52:20.160" style="s2">specific processes practices world view</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.970" end="00:52:22.289" style="s2">where then they could see anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.160" end="00:52:23.579" style="s2">who had that and they could know here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.289" end="00:52:25.890" style="s2">a person that I&#39;m gonna have a certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.579" end="00:52:27.630" style="s2">amount of shared experience with and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.890" end="00:52:30.240" style="s2">created a signaling that was actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.630" end="00:52:32.400" style="s2">relevant not only maybe for survival</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.240" end="00:52:33.480" style="s2">which it very much might have been in</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.400" end="00:52:35.069" style="s2">the world where in-group out-group</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.480" end="00:52:37.380" style="s2">dynamics have determined those to</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.069" end="00:52:40.200" style="s2">survival but also their ability for</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.380" end="00:52:42.329" style="s2">deeper connection trust coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.200" end="00:52:45.890" style="s2">they&#39;re like okay that that that</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.329" end="00:52:49.769" style="s2">actually meant something sacred II and</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.890" end="00:52:51.660" style="s2">now if someone else is is taking that</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.769" end="00:52:54.630" style="s2">thing without all that it meant now I</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.660" end="00:52:55.890" style="s2">actually don&#39;t know my signaling system</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.630" end="00:52:57.599" style="s2">is broken and I don&#39;t know if these are</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.890" end="00:53:01.200" style="s2">people with shared experience or not or</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.599" end="00:53:06.779" style="s2">and so you you think about like there</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.200" end="00:53:09.210" style="s2">might be layers of depth that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.779" end="00:53:12.029" style="s2">just completely missing in an argument</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.210" end="00:53:13.980" style="s2">when you come to a position on it and</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.029" end="00:53:16.079" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying I think cultural</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.980" end="00:53:19.559" style="s2">appropriation is always wrong I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.079" end="00:53:20.910" style="s2">I as I start to imagine in I can think</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.559" end="00:53:24.030" style="s2">of a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.910" end="00:53:26.310" style="s2">and I would want to listen a lot and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.030" end="00:53:28.860" style="s2">want to see can I be earnest about it or</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.310" end="00:53:31.590" style="s2">does something come up in me big starts</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.860" end="00:53:34.080" style="s2">to get blocked and if it does I want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.590" end="00:53:36.180" style="s2">look at that well I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.080" end="00:53:38.340" style="s2">a great attitude is both self reflective</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.180" end="00:53:41.190" style="s2">and asking questions but also not</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.340" end="00:53:43.860" style="s2">seeking to have a certainty at the at</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.190" end="00:53:46.440" style="s2">the end of it and what what comes up for</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.860" end="00:53:50.280" style="s2">me when you&#39;re describing those sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.440" end="00:53:53.520" style="s2">single as symbol systems and how we can</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.280" end="00:53:55.530" style="s2">read those things is is it at the core</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.520" end="00:53:57.000" style="s2">that we have as humans trying to</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.530" end="00:53:59.850" style="s2">understand each other and improve</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.000" end="00:54:02.880" style="s2">ourselves are we kind of tripping over a</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.850" end="00:54:05.070" style="s2">kind of an innate nature which is tribal</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.880" end="00:54:07.620" style="s2">and wanting certain systems to make</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.070" end="00:54:14.730" style="s2">sense and apply to everybody is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.620" end="00:54:16.650" style="s2">something that we can overcome they</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.730" end="00:54:23.010" style="s2">question a dumpling is there different</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.650" end="00:54:26.390" style="s2">questions let me separate are we tribal</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.010" end="00:54:30.840" style="s2">and signaling mechanisms in human nature</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.390" end="00:54:32.340" style="s2">sure signaling mechanisms were actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.840" end="00:54:36.780" style="s2">part of what helped us go beyond</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.340" end="00:54:39.180" style="s2">tribalism because if I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.780" end="00:54:41.580" style="s2">hunter-gatherer society pre agrarian</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.180" end="00:54:43.590" style="s2">society and we&#39;re below Dunbar number</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.580" end="00:54:47.370" style="s2">right typically below 150 people maybe</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.590" end="00:54:48.720" style="s2">meaningfully below that I actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.370" end="00:54:51.420" style="s2">need signalling mechanisms because I</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.720" end="00:54:53.130" style="s2">know all the people like I firsthand</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.420" end="00:54:54.690" style="s2">actually know them all I&#39;ve lived with</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.130" end="00:54:56.040" style="s2">in my whole life and I know if it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.690" end="00:54:58.740" style="s2">people that I know and can trust or</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.040" end="00:55:01.590" style="s2">other people that I don&#39;t know and so I</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.740" end="00:55:03.240" style="s2">actually don&#39;t need symbolism because I</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.590" end="00:55:06.630" style="s2">don&#39;t need an abstraction layer I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.240" end="00:55:12.000" style="s2">actually in my instantiated experience</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.630" end="00:55:13.710" style="s2">right okay and now if we want to get a</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.000" end="00:55:16.860" style="s2">number of tribes to be able to come</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.710" end="00:55:19.010" style="s2">together into villages and then kingdoms</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.860" end="00:55:21.060" style="s2">and the nation-states or you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.010" end="00:55:23.130" style="s2">religious associations or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.060" end="00:55:25.590" style="s2">larger kind of entity that has some</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.130" end="00:55:27.360" style="s2">coherence then the question is how do we</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.590" end="00:55:29.340" style="s2">have coherence with other people that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.360" end="00:55:33.600" style="s2">don&#39;t know but that we&#39;ve chosen to have</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.340" end="00:55:34.910" style="s2">coherence for coherence with in a</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.600" end="00:55:40.880" style="s2">situation where that</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.910" end="00:55:43.160" style="s2">was survival relevant mmm and now</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.880" end="00:55:44.740" style="s2">signaling mechanisms were a major part</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.160" end="00:55:48.859" style="s2">of how that happened</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.740" end="00:55:50.299" style="s2">right so now you know your red team</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.859" end="00:55:52.069" style="s2">where blue team the fact that you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.299" end="00:55:53.420" style="s2">a red shirt on even though I haven&#39;t met</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.069" end="00:55:54.950" style="s2">you like I know that we&#39;re put that</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.420" end="00:55:56.599" style="s2">you&#39;re playing on my side that&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.950" end="00:55:58.369" style="s2">the what flag are you flying right and</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.599" end="00:56:00.200" style="s2">so you notice with regard to cultural</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.369" end="00:56:02.150" style="s2">appropriation like there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.200" end="00:56:04.190" style="s2">get pretty bent out of shape of someone</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.150" end="00:56:06.609" style="s2">who isn&#39;t a citizen of their country</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.190" end="00:56:10.910" style="s2">using their flag in a certain way yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.609" end="00:56:12.890" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a similar thing right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.910" end="00:56:16.250" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a related topic of wait this</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.890" end="00:56:18.680" style="s2">is a way that our group was able to</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.250" end="00:56:21.740" style="s2">maintain some coherence against forces</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.680" end="00:56:24.200" style="s2">that were arrayed against it and you</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.740" end="00:56:28.760" style="s2">know you think about like how would US</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.200" end="00:56:30.410" style="s2">or or UK military deal with if someone</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.760" end="00:56:31.880" style="s2">was fucking up their intelligence system</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.410" end="00:56:34.730" style="s2">right and the signals that were coming</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.880" end="00:56:37.609" style="s2">into their Intel like that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.730" end="00:56:39.020" style="s2">problem if you see someone like the</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.609" end="00:56:40.569" style="s2">crime of being dressed as a police</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.020" end="00:56:43.190" style="s2">officer if you&#39;re not a police officer</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.569" end="00:56:44.930" style="s2">or being dressed as a military official</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.190" end="00:56:49.279" style="s2">is actually a crime because that system</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.930" end="00:56:53.900" style="s2">of signaling is very meaningful and and</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.279" end="00:56:56.260" style="s2">so one thing I would say is like now</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.900" end="00:56:58.940" style="s2">many of those systems have have</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.260" end="00:57:00.529" style="s2">interspersed so much that we then have</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.940" end="00:57:01.819" style="s2">cultures like the u.s. that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.529" end="00:57:03.650" style="s2">really have a culture right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.819" end="00:57:08.750" style="s2">mix of a whole bunch of different things</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.650" end="00:57:10.640" style="s2">because it&#39;s fairly new and and and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.750" end="00:57:13.160" style="s2">then of course it makes sense to allow</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.640" end="00:57:15.920" style="s2">those cultures to come together and to</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.160" end="00:57:18.289" style="s2">make new emergent things from one</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.920" end="00:57:20.539" style="s2">perspective from another perspective if</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.289" end="00:57:23.089" style="s2">some of those subgroups feel like they</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.539" end="00:57:25.220" style="s2">are still needing to maintain some of</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.089" end="00:57:27.289" style="s2">their identity for survival or thriving</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.220" end="00:57:30.020" style="s2">reasons then it&#39;s like wait fuck this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.289" end="00:57:31.640" style="s2">a real issue and oh yeah by the way the</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.020" end="00:57:33.109" style="s2">US was built on slavery and on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.640" end="00:57:37.609" style="s2">genocide and if that hasn&#39;t even been</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.109" end="00:57:40.880" style="s2">addressed like there there are there are</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.609" end="00:57:44.270" style="s2">issues with some of the appropriation</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.880" end="00:57:47.210" style="s2">that are on the pain side so I I know I</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.270" end="00:57:48.320" style="s2">went off topic a little bit but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.210" end="00:57:51.860" style="s2">think that this</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.320" end="00:57:54.800" style="s2">I don&#39;t think the signaling I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.860" end="00:57:57.050" style="s2">that&#39;s actually an abstraction layer to</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.800" end="00:58:00.110" style="s2">make larger cultures cohere that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.050" end="00:58:01.340" style="s2">tribalism now if by tribalism what you</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.110" end="00:58:04.130" style="s2">really meant was in-group out-group</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.340" end="00:58:08.690" style="s2">behavior i guess everybody did</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.130" end="00:58:11.150" style="s2">but beyond the Dunbar number now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.690" end="00:58:12.560" style="s2">a different question are humans so are</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.150" end="00:58:14.510" style="s2">humans capable of moving beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.560" end="00:58:16.040" style="s2">Dumber number obviously right like being</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.510" end="00:58:19.100" style="s2">able to have some sense of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.040" end="00:58:21.080" style="s2">with abstracted people well that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.100" end="00:58:24.890" style="s2">what nations and religions and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.080" end="00:58:27.860" style="s2">been and they&#39;ve had they&#39;ve mostly only</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.890" end="00:58:33.920" style="s2">been able to do it through hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.860" end="00:58:35.810" style="s2">systems that where the there was loss of</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.920" end="00:58:39.280" style="s2">freedom of individuals within those</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.810" end="00:58:42.290" style="s2">systems to maintain coherence now</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.280" end="00:58:43.880" style="s2">Machiavelli you knows enemy hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.290" end="00:58:46.580" style="s2">said that the only way to get a group of</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.880" end="00:58:48.050" style="s2">people to cohere sustainably beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.580" end="00:58:50.780" style="s2">Dunbar number is if they have a shared</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.050" end="00:58:54.140" style="s2">outside threat that is a bigger threat</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.780" end="00:58:58.490" style="s2">than their reason to not cohere with</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.140" end="00:59:01.190" style="s2">each other that has been true for the</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.490" end="00:59:04.700" style="s2">most part right like we&#39;ve we you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.190" end="00:59:08.510" style="s2">get you can have infighting between</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.700" end="00:59:12.710" style="s2">Shiite and Sunni until they have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.510" end="00:59:15.440" style="s2">West as a big enough you know shared fo</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.710" end="00:59:20.660" style="s2">the - unify against that that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.440" end="00:59:22.850" style="s2">true I think there&#39;s a dynamic that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.660" end="00:59:24.680" style="s2">about to happen that is different than</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.850" end="00:59:25.790" style="s2">anything that has ever happened and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.680" end="00:59:28.040" style="s2">think so I think this actually an</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.790" end="00:59:31.760" style="s2">important piece of changing social</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.040" end="00:59:33.830" style="s2">science axioms for a minute so how do</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.760" end="00:59:36.620" style="s2">you get the whole how do you get</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.830" end="00:59:39.980" style="s2">everyone on this little spaceship</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.620" end="00:59:42.440" style="s2">biosphere to recognize that they are all</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.980" end="00:59:44.510" style="s2">inside of the same spaceship biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.440" end="00:59:45.920" style="s2">and now we&#39;re affecting things at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.510" end="00:59:48.440" style="s2">level of the whole fuckin biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.920" end="00:59:50.660" style="s2">right it&#39;s like climate change and</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.440" end="00:59:52.160" style="s2">biodiversity loss and like all those</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.660" end="00:59:54.140" style="s2">issues and if we have catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.160" end="00:59:56.960" style="s2">threats from the way we develop</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.140" end="00:59:59.360" style="s2">exponential tech like AI or nanotech or</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.960" end="01:00:01.250" style="s2">like these are not local issues so they</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.360" end="01:00:02.570" style="s2">so local governance doesn&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.250" end="01:00:05.990" style="s2">sense if we&#39;re affecting each other</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.570" end="01:00:08.720" style="s2">completely like China and India in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.990" end="01:00:11.720" style="s2">u.s. can&#39;t can&#39;t think about climate</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.720" end="01:00:13.280" style="s2">change as countries in a meaningful you</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.720" end="01:00:15.590" style="s2">know sentence without what each other</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.280" end="01:00:16.850" style="s2">are doing so how do we get that to</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.590" end="01:00:19.940" style="s2">happen well either you&#39;ve got to have</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.850" end="01:00:21.140" style="s2">some aliens attack so we can all unify</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.940" end="01:00:23.480" style="s2">against a common enemy</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.140" end="01:00:25.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to abstract the enemy and say</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.480" end="01:00:27.560" style="s2">climate change is the enemy we all need</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.400" end="01:00:29.780" style="s2">to unify to keep ourselves from going</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.560" end="01:00:33.380" style="s2">extinct as a species or AI is the enemy</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.780" end="01:00:39.020" style="s2">whatever the fuck we decide or you can</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.380" end="01:00:41.060" style="s2">actually unify you so the first part is</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.020" end="01:00:43.160" style="s2">you can unify against an abstract threat</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.060" end="01:00:45.710" style="s2">right it does not have to be an agent ik</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.160" end="01:00:48.620" style="s2">threat so something like environmental</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.710" end="01:00:50.660" style="s2">destruction or catastrophic risk of any</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.620" end="01:00:53.270" style="s2">kind could be a unifying imperative it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.660" end="01:00:55.550" style="s2">harder but it&#39;s possible but the next</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.270" end="01:00:57.530" style="s2">thing is we also can unify towards</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.550" end="01:01:00.680" style="s2">shared goals where it is more useful for</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.530" end="01:01:02.360" style="s2">us to do that than not and this is a</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.680" end="01:01:06.020" style="s2">important thing and I think right now we</p>

<p begin="01:01:32.500" end="01:01:37.810" style="s2">if we think about it from a game</p>

<p begin="01:02:14.289" end="01:02:22.179" style="s2">and then of course if there&#39;s a larger</p>

<p begin="01:06:57.550" end="01:07:03.610" style="s2">finite in infinite games yep James</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.400" end="01:07:06.310" style="s2">course yeah it&#39;s a great read for those</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.610" end="01:07:07.960" style="s2">who haven&#39;t read it there&#39;s he outlines</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.310" end="01:07:10.780" style="s2">a perspective on essentially everything</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.960" end="01:07:13.030" style="s2">in human life where we can see it as a</p>

<p begin="01:07:13.030" end="01:07:17.740" style="s2">and losers and a clear outcome and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:07:17.740" end="01:07:22.330" style="s2">something you could repeat it you could</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.510" end="01:07:24.910" style="s2">do multiple times in the series but each</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.330" end="01:07:27.340" style="s2">outcome is kind of set whereas the point</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.910" end="01:07:31.120" style="s2">of an infinite game is to keep playing</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.340" end="01:07:32.980" style="s2">so like a relationship or we would say</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.120" end="01:07:35.380" style="s2">the human species if this is the game</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.980" end="01:07:37.210" style="s2">we&#39;re playing what we want to do is not</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.380" end="01:07:38.860" style="s2">to have winners and losers but to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.210" end="01:07:43.200" style="s2">able to enable the game to continue</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.860" end="01:07:45.430" style="s2">rolling along and yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.200" end="01:07:47.320" style="s2">foundational book and I highly recommend</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.430" end="01:07:49.540" style="s2">it for everyone and it has so many</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.320" end="01:07:51.130" style="s2">layers of depth and meaning built in</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.540" end="01:07:53.170" style="s2">that if you&#39;re if you&#39;re reading it</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.130" end="01:07:55.410" style="s2">it&#39;s a treatise on economics and</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.170" end="01:07:59.080" style="s2">governance and spirituality and human</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.410" end="01:08:01.750" style="s2">psychology at the same time but that</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.080" end="01:08:03.520" style="s2">core idea that finite games are meant to</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.750" end="01:08:08.230" style="s2">be won and when you win the game&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.520" end="01:08:12.610" style="s2">and infinite games are meant to continue</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.230" end="01:08:14.440" style="s2">the game of play it&#39;s a it is a so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.610" end="01:08:17.530" style="s2">looking at a shift from win-lose game</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.440" end="01:08:19.780" style="s2">theory to omni win win or a different</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.530" end="01:08:23.560" style="s2">concept even of what win means from</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.780" end="01:08:25.510" style="s2">mostly zero-sum to increasingly positive</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.560" end="01:08:27.700" style="s2">some from finite to infinite there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.510" end="01:08:29.859" style="s2">whole shift but that new thing isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.700" end="01:08:32.500" style="s2">even anything like what we have called a</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.859" end="01:08:34.390" style="s2">game previously yeah and if and if to</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.500" end="01:08:36.940" style="s2">win is to play then this brings us to a</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.390" end="01:08:38.740" style="s2">couple of points of ideas that people</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.940" end="01:08:40.420" style="s2">have talked about I know you talked</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.740" end="01:08:42.970" style="s2">about the Commons as a key reference</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.420" end="01:08:45.580" style="s2">point in your work where things that are</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.970" end="01:08:47.140" style="s2">common like the common resources or the</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.580" end="01:08:49.930" style="s2">things that are common to everyone like</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.140" end="01:08:52.060" style="s2">the environment but then we face the</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.930" end="01:08:54.699" style="s2">problem of say hardly anybody who uses</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.060" end="01:08:56.920" style="s2">Wikipedia actually contributes to it</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.699" end="01:08:59.350" style="s2">and how can we change that perspective</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.920" end="01:09:01.420" style="s2">and then there&#39;s another obvious example</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.350" end="01:09:03.219" style="s2">which is the idea of a universal basic</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.420" end="01:09:07.060" style="s2">income which would enable people to keep</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.219" end="01:09:09.160" style="s2">playing their lives without feeling that</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.060" end="01:09:10.750" style="s2">if they don&#39;t do certain things they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.160" end="01:09:13.509" style="s2">simply not going to be able to play at</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.750" end="01:09:16.199" style="s2">all and I wonder if you could comment on</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.509" end="01:09:18.940" style="s2">the usual objections that come up</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.199" end="01:09:20.529" style="s2">against those which tend to be people</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.940" end="01:09:22.330" style="s2">are selfish and they don&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.529" end="01:09:24.640" style="s2">others how can we reconfigure AI</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.330" end="01:09:29.049" style="s2">people&#39;s ideas of what the game is that</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.640" end="01:09:33.940" style="s2">they&#39;re playing yeah so you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.049" end="01:09:36.100" style="s2">questions that to really deconstruct a</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.940" end="01:09:38.770" style="s2">lot of our ideas around evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.100" end="01:09:41.109" style="s2">biology and evolutionary psychology and</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.770" end="01:09:45.069" style="s2">what we think of as human nature</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.109" end="01:09:46.810" style="s2">genetically and economic theory and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.069" end="01:09:49.120" style="s2">adequately reconstruct new things would</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.810" end="01:09:51.310" style="s2">take enough time that I&#39;m not gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.120" end="01:09:56.650" style="s2">to do it I&#39;m gonna just push push</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.310" end="01:09:59.890" style="s2">buttons of all of those I think that we</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.650" end="01:10:02.500" style="s2">have got human conditioning that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.890" end="01:10:04.300" style="s2">actually relatively new but that has</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.500" end="01:10:05.980" style="s2">become very ubiquitous because it was</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.300" end="01:10:07.660" style="s2">successful in a win-lose game theoretic</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.980" end="01:10:09.429" style="s2">structure and it&#39;s so skubick witnessed</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.660" end="01:10:11.980" style="s2">that we&#39;ve done pretty much all of our</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.429" end="01:10:13.660" style="s2">social science within that context and</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.980" end="01:10:16.390" style="s2">so we stopped factoring the context and</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.660" end="01:10:19.210" style="s2">call it human nature we&#39;ve we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.390" end="01:10:21.850" style="s2">almost all of our social sciences within</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.210" end="01:10:24.219" style="s2">capitalism we&#39;ve done almost all of it</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.850" end="01:10:25.770" style="s2">within nation-states right within those</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.219" end="01:10:30.070" style="s2">kinds of structures done it within</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.770" end="01:10:32.020" style="s2">win-lose game theory in a mostly</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.070" end="01:10:34.060" style="s2">post-industrial definitely post agrarian</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.020" end="01:10:37.330" style="s2">world most the history of our species is</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.060" end="01:10:39.330" style="s2">pre agrarian definitely pre nations say</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.330" end="01:10:42.160" style="s2">and you know pre agrarian also meant pre</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.330" end="01:10:44.679" style="s2">capital pre private ownership of surplus</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.160" end="01:10:45.910" style="s2">because there was no fuckin surplus and</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.679" end="01:10:49.000" style="s2">so there&#39;s a totally different</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.910" end="01:10:51.520" style="s2">relationship to those things so uh and</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.000" end="01:10:54.219" style="s2">then we say okay well the way that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.520" end="01:10:56.260" style="s2">behaving since it&#39;s ubiquitous must be</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.219" end="01:10:57.699" style="s2">nature rather than nurture so then let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.260" end="01:10:59.260" style="s2">try and look for the genes that</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.699" end="01:11:03.790" style="s2">correlate and make it a genetic answer</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.260" end="01:11:07.710" style="s2">and this is where I think our our biases</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.790" end="01:11:07.710" style="s2">lead to bad science</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.030" end="01:11:12.810" style="s2">so I won&#39;t go further down there but I</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.100" end="01:11:17.760" style="s2">will say that most of what we call</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.810" end="01:11:19.320" style="s2">Analia Balu &#39;men nature I think is our</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.760" end="01:11:21.150" style="s2">nature expressed through a certain set</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.320" end="01:11:24.570" style="s2">of conditions and different enough</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.150" end="01:11:27.120" style="s2">conditions can can have what is nature</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.570" end="01:11:28.920" style="s2">expressed differently now I&#39;m gonna come</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.120" end="01:11:31.650" style="s2">back and say the whole nature-nurture</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.920" end="01:11:34.530" style="s2">what is fundamentally possible to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.650" end="01:11:36.150" style="s2">human condition it we can ask a thought</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.530" end="01:11:37.950" style="s2">experiment about it that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.150" end="01:11:40.470" style="s2">than we&#39;ve been able to ask previously</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.950" end="01:11:41.910" style="s2">because CRISPR is is making the</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.470" end="01:11:44.690" style="s2">conversation of human genetic</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.910" end="01:11:48.450" style="s2">engineering a real not that far off</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.690" end="01:11:50.820" style="s2">possible conversation right it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.450" end="01:11:53.520" style="s2">fucking deal because if we say ok well</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.820" end="01:11:56.970" style="s2">maybe maybe there is something that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.520" end="01:12:00.180" style="s2">genetic and maybe we can change those</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.970" end="01:12:03.350" style="s2">genes then it brings up D instantly now</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.180" end="01:12:05.700" style="s2">we&#39;re in deep existentialism around oh</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.350" end="01:12:07.170" style="s2">if we can actually change something that</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.700" end="01:12:09.660" style="s2">we thought of as nature what is</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.170" end="01:12:14.130" style="s2">fundamentally desirable outside of what</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.660" end="01:12:15.930" style="s2">we thought was a fixed context eh should</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.130" end="01:12:18.960" style="s2">do we want to then change the genes</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.930" end="01:12:21.600" style="s2">where everyone is a hyper competitor do</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.960" end="01:12:24.630" style="s2">we and and they&#39;re the most violent and</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.600" end="01:12:25.920" style="s2">largest alpha men possible only do we</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.630" end="01:12:27.390" style="s2">want to make it toward now alphas are</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.920" end="01:12:28.710" style="s2">irrelevant and everyone is a super</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.390" end="01:12:31.320" style="s2">cooperator do we want to make it to</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.710" end="01:12:33.120" style="s2">where people are happy all the time and</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.320" end="01:12:34.830" style="s2">we have done the abolitionists</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.120" end="01:12:38.250" style="s2">imperative and got rid of the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.830" end="01:12:40.230" style="s2">suffer and feel pain or do we like are</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.250" end="01:12:43.200" style="s2">there evolutionary and psychological</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.230" end="01:12:44.640" style="s2">purposes that stay relevant to like now</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.200" end="01:12:47.190" style="s2">we&#39;re in a very deep existential</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.640" end="01:12:49.290" style="s2">philosophic and it&#39;s important that we</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.190" end="01:12:51.600" style="s2">go there now as soon as we can start to</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.290" end="01:12:52.890" style="s2">you know ask those questions then we can</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.600" end="01:12:54.180" style="s2">come back to ok well here are some</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.890" end="01:12:56.100" style="s2">things that are meaningful about the</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.180" end="01:12:57.930" style="s2">human condition what of them might</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.100" end="01:12:59.790" style="s2">actually be possible even without the</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.930" end="01:13:01.350" style="s2">genetic engineering but it does make us</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.790" end="01:13:03.450" style="s2">start thinking that the what we have</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.350" end="01:13:06.240" style="s2">thought of as human nature that was a</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.450" end="01:13:08.610" style="s2">hard unfixed limit we can at least think</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.240" end="01:13:15.140" style="s2">about it more flexibly which i think is</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.610" end="01:13:15.140" style="s2">a useful thought experiment but</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.560" end="01:13:23.270" style="s2">if you have us if you have a situation</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.750" end="01:13:26.330" style="s2">where there&#39;s a lot of shitty jobs right</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.270" end="01:13:32.000" style="s2">like what tarring roads is just not that</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.330" end="01:13:35.000" style="s2">fun and you know etc etc so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.000" end="01:13:36.980" style="s2">mean that nobody would would never want</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.000" end="01:13:38.630" style="s2">to go do some touring of a road or</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.980" end="01:13:40.340" style="s2">different kinds of labor or different</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.630" end="01:13:41.780" style="s2">kinds of rote tasks but most people</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.340" end="01:13:45.260" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t want to do 50 hours of it a</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.780" end="01:13:47.300" style="s2">week for 40 years right yeah and yet the</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.260" end="01:13:48.110" style="s2">society has needed people to do a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.300" end="01:13:51.980" style="s2">of that shit</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.110" end="01:13:55.070" style="s2">and so when you then see people as the</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.980" end="01:13:57.710" style="s2">vector for getting societal things done</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.070" end="01:14:00.050" style="s2">you have to have an extrinsic motives</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.710" end="01:14:01.820" style="s2">system to get people to do it so if we</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.050" end="01:14:03.680" style="s2">all pull our resources and then make</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.820" end="01:14:06.440" style="s2">sure everybody has resources we call it</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.680" end="01:14:08.120" style="s2">communism then then why would anyone do</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.440" end="01:14:09.920" style="s2">the shitty job so now the state has to</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.120" end="01:14:12.770" style="s2">force them so we call it imperialism and</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.920" end="01:14:14.900" style="s2">that&#39;s why we don&#39;t like communism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.770" end="01:14:15.980" style="s2">I&#39;m radically oversimplifying of course</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.900" end="01:14:18.110" style="s2">but that&#39;s like at the heart of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.980" end="01:14:19.640" style="s2">argument so then we say cool let&#39;s let</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.110" end="01:14:22.250" style="s2">the free market force people because</p>

<p begin="01:14:22.250" end="01:14:26.720" style="s2">going to force people but if but they</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.170" end="01:14:28.280" style="s2">don&#39;t get any basic needs met so if they</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.720" end="01:14:31.130" style="s2">don&#39;t go do one of the shitty jobs they</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.280" end="01:14:32.840" style="s2">starve now we&#39;ll say that they have the</p>

<p begin="01:14:32.840" end="01:14:36.110" style="s2">hopefully not have to do the shitty jobs</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.430" end="01:14:38.180" style="s2">but of course it&#39;s not a real argument</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.110" end="01:14:39.560" style="s2">since a lot of people are gonna have to</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.180" end="01:14:42.920" style="s2">do the shitty jobs because somebody has</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.560" end="01:14:44.840" style="s2">to write and those who are born into</p>

<p begin="01:14:44.840" end="01:14:48.230" style="s2">have a lot less likelihood to have</p>

<p begin="01:14:48.230" end="01:14:54.320" style="s2">care and good training and so in a</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.350" end="01:14:57.680" style="s2">situation where the default is having</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.320" end="01:15:00.740" style="s2">nothing you need to get stuff to just</p>

<p begin="01:15:11.000" end="01:15:14.750" style="s2">that have the resources to do stuff and</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.680" end="01:15:16.520" style="s2">and my esteem all the way up to my</p>

<p begin="01:15:26.720" end="01:15:31.540" style="s2">value the scare shit where you having</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.450" end="01:15:33.400" style="s2">something then you don&#39;t have access</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.540" end="01:15:34.900" style="s2">like a shopping cart you have possession</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.400" end="01:15:37.960" style="s2">of it where when you&#39;re not using it I</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.900" end="01:15:39.730" style="s2">still can&#39;t use it and so because you</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.960" end="01:15:41.380" style="s2">possessing some scarce thing there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.730" end="01:15:44.020" style="s2">enough of for everybody means that I</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.380" end="01:15:45.820" style="s2">don&#39;t have access we&#39;re we&#39;re in</p>

<p begin="01:15:45.820" end="01:15:52.390" style="s2">right and if there&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.620" end="01:15:54.490" style="s2">abundant enough that you having it</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.390" end="01:15:56.500" style="s2">doesn&#39;t decrease my access at all like</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.490" end="01:15:57.880" style="s2">err we put no economic value at all on</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.500" end="01:16:00.130" style="s2">it because there&#39;s no ability to have</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.880" end="01:16:01.750" style="s2">differential advantage associated with</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.130" end="01:16:03.970" style="s2">getting some of the scarce thing and</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.750" end="01:16:05.560" style="s2">because we put no economic value on the</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.970" end="01:16:06.940" style="s2">air will pollute the shit out of it and</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.560" end="01:16:10.660" style="s2">burn it up because it doesn&#39;t enter our</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.940" end="01:16:13.360" style="s2">economics calculus that is the basis of</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.660" end="01:16:15.070" style="s2">our decision-making but we&#39;ll work</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.360" end="01:16:16.180" style="s2">really hard to get the gold or the</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.070" end="01:16:17.590" style="s2">diamond or whatever it is that we</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.180" end="01:16:18.910" style="s2">perceive as scarce enough that if I have</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.590" end="01:16:20.890" style="s2">it gives me some differential advantage</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.910" end="01:16:22.210" style="s2">over you but then I&#39;m gonna take that</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.890" end="01:16:23.860" style="s2">gold of them in and put it in a safe</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.210" end="01:16:26.740" style="s2">that is doing nothing for anyone other</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.860" end="01:16:29.350" style="s2">than a Fiat purpose right and then</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.740" end="01:16:31.120" style="s2">because it&#39;s scarce now this is</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.350" end="01:16:32.380" style="s2">important to get because the value is</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.120" end="01:16:33.970" style="s2">proportional to the scarcity because</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.380" end="01:16:35.560" style="s2">we&#39;re not looking for systemic advantage</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.970" end="01:16:37.150" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for differential</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.560" end="01:16:39.310" style="s2">competitive advantage which just assumed</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.150" end="01:16:41.680" style="s2">if the thing became unscared it would</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.310" end="01:16:42.970" style="s2">have no value like air so as soon as we</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.680" end="01:16:44.320" style="s2">start finding that diamonds aren&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.970" end="01:16:45.730" style="s2">scarce as we thought they were we start</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.320" end="01:16:47.020" style="s2">burning in a crushing and hiding them</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.730" end="01:16:51.340" style="s2">right yeah I think that we need to</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.020" end="01:16:54.970" style="s2">artificially manufacture scarcity so</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.340" end="01:16:57.430" style="s2">when you have a system where if you</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.970" end="01:16:59.530" style="s2">don&#39;t get shit you die and if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.430" end="01:17:01.270" style="s2">get more shit you don&#39;t get to express</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.530" end="01:17:03.730" style="s2">very well and anyone else getting shit</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.270" end="01:17:06.250" style="s2">means you don&#39;t have it and win-lose</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.730" end="01:17:07.960" style="s2">dynamics everywhere like if you if I</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.250" end="01:17:09.880" style="s2">wanted to condition greed and</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.960" end="01:17:11.980" style="s2">selfishness and jealousy and the people</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.880" end="01:17:13.720" style="s2">the best I could</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.980" end="01:17:17.380" style="s2">that&#39;s how the fuck I would do it is</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.720" end="01:17:19.300" style="s2">that trading if it be this that exactly</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.380" end="01:17:23.470" style="s2">and if I wanted to train people to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.300" end="01:17:25.420" style="s2">Psychopaths right not like I put them</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.470" end="01:17:27.010" style="s2">through enough first person childhood</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.420" end="01:17:29.230" style="s2">trauma or they have the right kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.010" end="01:17:31.270" style="s2">brain injuries or genes for formal</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.230" end="01:17:32.860" style="s2">psychopathy but I want to decrease their</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.270" end="01:17:35.860" style="s2">empathy pretty radically and their</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.860" end="01:17:41.170" style="s2">ability to rationalize harm well I would</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.860" end="01:17:42.670" style="s2">do things like capitalism and large you</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.170" end="01:17:44.020" style="s2">know and then the evolutions of</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.670" end="01:17:45.040" style="s2">capitalism that happened corporate</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.020" end="01:17:49.480" style="s2">capitalism where</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.040" end="01:17:50.620" style="s2">if you aren&#39;t willing to participate in</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.480" end="01:17:52.360" style="s2">something that&#39;s gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.620" end="01:17:55.390" style="s2">externalities you just don&#39;t get to run</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.360" end="01:17:57.310" style="s2">a big company if you&#39;re running a big</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.390" end="01:18:00.310" style="s2">company you&#39;ve got to say yeah shit well</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.310" end="01:18:02.890" style="s2">those mines are run by slave labor but</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.310" end="01:18:04.450" style="s2">like there&#39;s just no other mines and if</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.890" end="01:18:06.400" style="s2">we tried to pay for fair trade we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.450" end="01:18:07.720" style="s2">totally out of business so you got it</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.400" end="01:18:09.880" style="s2">like crack some eggs to make some</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.720" end="01:18:13.030" style="s2">omelets just even being able to</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.880" end="01:18:15.760" style="s2">participate with the system that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.030" end="01:18:18.990" style="s2">closed-loop that doesn&#39;t actually value</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.760" end="01:18:22.540" style="s2">all the metrics that it effects requires</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.990" end="01:18:24.790" style="s2">rationalizing harm and having a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.540" end="01:18:27.300" style="s2">abstracted psychopathy so you know we</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.790" end="01:18:29.710" style="s2">have a system that you can think of as</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.300" end="01:18:33.280" style="s2">conditioning low-grade Ubiquiti</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.710" end="01:18:34.810" style="s2">psychopathy and everybody and then we do</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.280" end="01:18:39.640" style="s2">social science on it we call it human</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.810" end="01:18:41.440" style="s2">nature yeah and then we can&#39;t change it</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.640" end="01:18:44.470" style="s2">then we do stab to rationalize the</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.440" end="01:18:46.420" style="s2">system again continuing it exactly but</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.470" end="01:18:50.590" style="s2">like you know if I walk by a homeless</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.420" end="01:18:53.620" style="s2">person and they have they&#39;re in real</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.590" end="01:18:56.370" style="s2">pain right they might even be bleeding</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.620" end="01:18:59.380" style="s2">they might be really dirty they and I</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.370" end="01:19:02.320" style="s2">just walk by because I&#39;m busy I got shit</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.380" end="01:19:05.380" style="s2">to do and maybe I give him five bucks</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.320" end="01:19:08.740" style="s2">but I you know I walk by there is</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.380" end="01:19:11.200" style="s2">something wrong with me at a human level</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.740" end="01:19:14.410" style="s2">there is some way that I was able to</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.200" end="01:19:16.120" style="s2">turn my empathy off where this</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.410" end="01:19:18.610" style="s2">disappointment I got to get to that is</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.120" end="01:19:21.700" style="s2">trivial as fuck in comparison to this</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.610" end="01:19:24.010" style="s2">other person&#39;s whole life I just I can</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.700" end="01:19:26.050" style="s2">and I can be fine just continuing to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.010" end="01:19:28.000" style="s2">worried about my busyness like what the</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.050" end="01:19:29.740" style="s2">fuck how could I do that well because</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.000" end="01:19:33.240" style="s2">there&#39;s so many homeless people I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.740" end="01:19:36.550" style="s2">fix all of them and then that then that</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.240" end="01:19:39.270" style="s2">rationalizes none of them right but</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.550" end="01:19:42.220" style="s2">that&#39;s that systemic that is a system</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.270" end="01:19:44.380" style="s2">where empathy isn&#39;t even viable in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.220" end="01:19:47.350" style="s2">system and so everybody has to turn it</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.380" end="01:19:49.330" style="s2">down or go crazy it&#39;s also like a</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.350" end="01:19:50.890" style="s2">personal if I don&#39;t know if the language</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.330" end="01:19:52.450" style="s2">makes sense but it&#39;s a personally</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.890" end="01:19:54.370" style="s2">systemic thing that if you think you</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.450" end="01:19:57.660" style="s2">can&#39;t help all the people then you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.370" end="01:19:58.840" style="s2">help one then you never helped anybody</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.660" end="01:20:03.970" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.840" end="01:20:06.910" style="s2">and so well you know cuz it doesn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.970" end="01:20:09.130" style="s2">say alright I can try and do this like</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.910" end="01:20:11.920" style="s2">I&#39;ll help this one thing but then if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.130" end="01:20:14.620" style="s2">if I care about this one enough to</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.920" end="01:20:18.340" style="s2">really help them i turn my feeling back</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.620" end="01:20:20.650" style="s2">on right then on the day my feeling back</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.340" end="01:20:22.780" style="s2">on now what about the next one and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.650" end="01:20:26.470" style="s2">next one and when do I stop but also and</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.780" end="01:20:28.750" style="s2">when do I decide that actually upgrading</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.470" end="01:20:30.460" style="s2">from my last year&#39;s Mercedes to this</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.750" end="01:20:34.540" style="s2">next year&#39;s Mercedes is worth more than</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.460" end="01:20:37.390" style="s2">helping a couple more of them who are</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.540" end="01:20:40.510" style="s2">you gonna say my time well in this</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.390" end="01:20:42.970" style="s2">system when you do help that other</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.510" end="01:20:44.920" style="s2">person you might depends on the extent</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.970" end="01:20:48.340" style="s2">you help them but you also start risking</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.920" end="01:20:51.280" style="s2">your own safety and future so if you if</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.340" end="01:20:52.860" style="s2">you you really want to help them you</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.280" end="01:20:56.920" style="s2">want to give them all the resources and</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.860" end="01:20:59.170" style="s2">you already have you yourself live in</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.920" end="01:21:00.730" style="s2">scarcity which a lot of people do like</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.170" end="01:21:02.430" style="s2">you have to take care of your own shit</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.730" end="01:21:05.200" style="s2">first before you can help anyone else</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.430" end="01:21:08.860" style="s2">but that&#39;s the story right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.200" end="01:21:12.310" style="s2">that&#39;s the story that we tell and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.860" end="01:21:14.800" style="s2">of course now this is a very painful</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.310" end="01:21:17.800" style="s2">thing to say but most people then if you</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.800" end="01:21:19.960" style="s2">look at at the end of their life the</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.800" end="01:21:22.660" style="s2">amount of shit that they&#39;ve consumed and</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.960" end="01:21:24.310" style="s2">what that did to the environment what it</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.660" end="01:21:26.530" style="s2">did to however many animals that were</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.310" end="01:21:28.780" style="s2">involved how many species went extinct</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.530" end="01:21:30.880" style="s2">related to those supply chains how many</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.780" end="01:21:32.890" style="s2">animals in factory farms and then how</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.880" end="01:21:35.710" style="s2">many migrant workers how many people in</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.890" end="01:21:37.420" style="s2">sweatshops have etc and you and you look</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.710" end="01:21:39.820" style="s2">at all of that and then you compare it</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.420" end="01:21:41.830" style="s2">to what that person then did once they</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.820" end="01:21:44.140" style="s2">got ahead well enough to help other</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.830" end="01:21:46.420" style="s2">people like there they are on the</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.140" end="01:21:50.200" style="s2">liability side of nature&#39;s balance sheet</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.420" end="01:21:51.910" style="s2">yes now the answer is not obvious</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.200" end="01:21:53.230" style="s2">because the answer doesn&#39;t exist within</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.910" end="01:21:55.900" style="s2">this system the answer is actually</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.230" end="01:21:58.720" style="s2">needing to build new systems that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.900" end="01:22:00.910" style="s2">take complexity and make it simple or</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.720" end="01:22:03.340" style="s2">complicated right they don&#39;t do win lose</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.910" end="01:22:04.810" style="s2">game theoretic structures so when when</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.340" end="01:22:08.050" style="s2">you look at this it is it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.810" end="01:22:10.180" style="s2">there aren&#39;t obvious answers that are</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.050" end="01:22:12.239" style="s2">good and meaningful about how to like</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.180" end="01:22:14.159" style="s2">okay how do we</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.239" end="01:22:15.329" style="s2">prevent war and have a world full of</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.159" end="01:22:16.650" style="s2">peace like why the fuck do we still have</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.329" end="01:22:21.269" style="s2">war it would seem like world peace is</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.650" end="01:22:22.619" style="s2">something everybody wants okay well how</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.269" end="01:22:24.989" style="s2">do you have a for-profit</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.619" end="01:22:28.190" style="s2">military-industrial complex as the</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.989" end="01:22:29.940" style="s2">largest bloc of global economics and</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.190" end="01:22:31.440" style="s2">understanding the laws of supply and</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.940" end="01:22:33.269" style="s2">demand have a world that doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.440" end="01:22:36.989" style="s2">war like how do those two things get to</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.269" end="01:22:42.599" style="s2">live together they don&#39;t they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.989" end="01:22:44.460" style="s2">right and so then when we say well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.599" end="01:22:45.570" style="s2">working on peace are you working two</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.460" end="01:22:47.039" style="s2">obsolete having a for-profit</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.570" end="01:22:51.150" style="s2">military-industrial complex because if</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.039" end="01:22:53.940" style="s2">not you have no chance of addressing it</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.150" end="01:22:56.340" style="s2">because any system of supply has to</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.940" end="01:22:58.499" style="s2">continue to maintain and protect and</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.340" end="01:23:00.929" style="s2">grow its source of demand and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.499" end="01:23:03.389" style="s2">even just the directors following their</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.929" end="01:23:04.829" style="s2">fiduciary responsibility to the</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.389" end="01:23:07.619" style="s2">shareholders of the company I mean like</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.829" end="01:23:13.969" style="s2">that so the point is it&#39;s a the system</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.619" end="01:23:16.469" style="s2">as a whole is a paperclip Maximizer and</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.969" end="01:23:18.449" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s an identity problem here</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.469" end="01:23:21.179" style="s2">at the core to you that if you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.449" end="01:23:23.820" style="s2">to say obsolete a military-industrial</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.179" end="01:23:26.099" style="s2">complex the people within it don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.820" end="01:23:28.139" style="s2">to be obsoleted within the same way that</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.099" end="01:23:30.179" style="s2">somebody who has spent their whole life</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.139" end="01:23:32.670" style="s2">tearing the roads and that&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.179" end="01:23:34.889" style="s2">skill they feel they have they also</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.670" end="01:23:37.019" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be obsoleted because</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.889" end="01:23:39.210" style="s2">there&#39;s that sense of existential</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.019" end="01:23:41.010" style="s2">confusion and angst over well well what</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.210" end="01:23:43.079" style="s2">am I then I&#39;m being forced to become</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.010" end="01:23:45.809" style="s2">something else and that&#39;s frightening</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.079" end="01:23:48.090" style="s2">right right so the shift that has to</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.809" end="01:23:49.980" style="s2">happen doesn&#39;t include a macro</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.090" end="01:23:53.429" style="s2">structural shift but it also includes</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.980" end="01:23:55.889" style="s2">individual both trauma and attachments</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.429" end="01:23:58.199" style="s2">level shifts and identity level shifts</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.889" end="01:23:59.940" style="s2">right because most people&#39;s identity</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.199" end="01:24:03.090" style="s2">like that not most people everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.940" end="01:24:04.980" style="s2">identity was conditioned by a system and</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.090" end="01:24:06.570" style="s2">it&#39;s adaptive within it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.980" end="01:24:10.860" style="s2">actually maladaptive to making something</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.570" end="01:24:12.719" style="s2">else and then I guess we come back to</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.860" end="01:24:15.630" style="s2">the question of still wanting to have</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.719" end="01:24:17.460" style="s2">control over your life and how things</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.630" end="01:24:20.909" style="s2">make sense but if we&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.460" end="01:24:23.099" style="s2">radical shift in human development and</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.909" end="01:24:26.010" style="s2">something that we&#39;ve come to think of as</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.099" end="01:24:27.690" style="s2">human nature which he said likely is</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.010" end="01:24:29.670" style="s2">something we call human nature because</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.690" end="01:24:33.390" style="s2">it&#39;s been the case for long enough that</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.670" end="01:24:35.850" style="s2">we think it&#39;s fundamental the we have to</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.390" end="01:24:39.990" style="s2">overhaul some very basic structures of</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.850" end="01:24:41.460" style="s2">thoughts here so looking looking forward</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.990" end="01:24:43.830" style="s2">at that process do you think this is</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.460" end="01:24:45.600" style="s2">we&#39;re a chrysalis about to turn into a</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.830" end="01:24:56.970" style="s2">butterfly or are you kind of more</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.600" end="01:25:03.780" style="s2">worried than that I think that if we</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.970" end="01:25:07.880" style="s2">just okay first I will say that we have</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.780" end="01:25:07.880" style="s2">what I might call kind of naive Tecna is</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.560" end="01:25:20.160" style="s2">Amaya they&#39;re much of Silicon Valley is</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.610" end="01:25:23.160" style="s2">famous for right and that that narrative</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.160" end="01:25:26.190" style="s2">is also connected to kind of this that</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.160" end="01:25:29.400" style="s2">dialectic of progress that we used to</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.190" end="01:25:30.090" style="s2">have these short brutish nasty lives and</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.400" end="01:25:32.700" style="s2">should has just been getting</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.090" end="01:25:35.970" style="s2">continuously better with capitalism in</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.700" end="01:25:37.290" style="s2">tech and industry you know on a on a</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.970" end="01:25:39.720" style="s2">consistent path and it&#39;s gonna continue</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.290" end="01:25:41.040" style="s2">forever and every problem we have that</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.720" end="01:25:42.630" style="s2">ahead we don&#39;t really have to worry</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.040" end="01:25:45.960" style="s2">about because human ingenuity always</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.630" end="01:25:49.380" style="s2">figures it out I do think that this is</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.960" end="01:25:52.200" style="s2">radically naive I I think that is a more</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.380" end="01:25:55.710" style="s2">dangerous world view than fundamentalist</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.200" end="01:25:57.210" style="s2">religious worldviews interest because</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.710" end="01:25:59.820" style="s2">the fundamentalist religious worldviews</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.210" end="01:26:03.410" style="s2">can&#39;t create new tech that gives us more</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.820" end="01:26:05.850" style="s2">power and having more power</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.410" end="01:26:07.470" style="s2">exponentially more power to affect shit</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.850" end="01:26:09.270" style="s2">without having comprehensively better</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.470" end="01:26:13.620" style="s2">decision making means exponential</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.270" end="01:26:14.880" style="s2">externality equals catastrophic risk we</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.620" end="01:26:17.730" style="s2">have a scenario right now where</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.880" end="01:26:20.010" style="s2">exponential tech is means we are</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.730" end="01:26:21.870" style="s2">exponent we don&#39;t know how to make an</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.010" end="01:26:24.510" style="s2">intuition around exponents because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.870" end="01:26:26.880" style="s2">never had them right we we&#39;ve got we can</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.510" end="01:26:28.590" style="s2">maybe make a sense out of like curves</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.880" end="01:26:30.360" style="s2">that are slightly inflected up for a</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.590" end="01:26:33.510" style="s2">short period of time but not really</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.360" end="01:26:35.340" style="s2">right so with an exponential curve our</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.510" end="01:26:36.990" style="s2">intuition can&#39;t really make sense of it</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.340" end="01:26:39.209" style="s2">but we have exponentially increasing</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.990" end="01:26:42.630" style="s2">capacity to affect the world around us</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.209" end="01:26:51.239" style="s2">Tara Lee and through supply chains and</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.630" end="01:26:52.619" style="s2">through extraction technology and there</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.239" end="01:26:55.110" style="s2">are positive applications because</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.619" end="01:26:57.869" style="s2">thermodynamics just works that way right</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.110" end="01:27:00.659" style="s2">like there there&#39;s one way to put all</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.869" end="01:27:02.369" style="s2">the pieces of a cell together where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.659" end="01:27:07.579" style="s2">a cell and it respirate s&#39; there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.369" end="01:27:11.429" style="s2">of fuckin ways to take it apart and so</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.579" end="01:27:13.079" style="s2">and it takes a year to build a house or</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.429" end="01:27:14.280" style="s2">six months but it takes a few minutes</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.079" end="01:27:16.590" style="s2">with a record ball to break it down</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.280" end="01:27:18.510" style="s2">entropy is just easier so when we</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.590" end="01:27:20.550" style="s2">develop new technological capacity that</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.510" end="01:27:23.219" style="s2">negative applications have higher</p>

<p begin="01:27:24.840" end="01:27:30.209" style="s2">have to factor that so if we&#39;re two</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.079" end="01:27:32.010" style="s2">things we&#39;re exponentially increasing</p>

<p begin="01:30:49.830" end="01:30:55.080" style="s2">that said you know you asked this</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.080" end="01:30:57.150" style="s2">question about caterpillar into a</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.080" end="01:30:59.460" style="s2">butterfly this is a really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.150" end="01:31:00.630" style="s2">question because if I didn&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.460" end="01:31:02.369" style="s2">caterpillar was gonna go into a</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.630" end="01:31:04.349" style="s2">chrysalis and do the butterfly thing and</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.369" end="01:31:06.690" style="s2">I was just watching the caterpillar grow</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.349" end="01:31:08.040" style="s2">and I was forecasting a</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.690" end="01:31:09.510" style="s2">I would assume that it just kept</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.040" end="01:31:10.860" style="s2">becoming a bigger and bigger caterpillar</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.510" end="01:31:12.510" style="s2">and eating more and more shit until it</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.860" end="01:31:13.110" style="s2">decimated all the plants and ate itself</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.510" end="01:31:17.820" style="s2">to extinction</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.110" end="01:31:19.500" style="s2">yeah and so I can&#39;t keep plotting that</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.820" end="01:31:20.790" style="s2">curve because it&#39;s not gonna do that</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.500" end="01:31:23.460" style="s2">curve it&#39;s gonna do that curve to a</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.790" end="01:31:26.580" style="s2">certain point where it&#39;s actually eaten</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.460" end="01:31:28.920" style="s2">enough stuff meaning the caterpillar is</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.580" end="01:31:30.690" style="s2">a net consumption machine right like it</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.920" end="01:31:32.370" style="s2">doesn&#39;t pollinate stuff all it does is</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.690" end="01:31:34.710" style="s2">devastate everything around it consuming</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.370" end="01:31:36.650" style="s2">but it&#39;s getting the raw materials the</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.710" end="01:31:39.840" style="s2">minerals amino acids to make a butterfly</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.650" end="01:31:41.430" style="s2">so but as this consumption machine it is</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.840" end="01:31:45.360" style="s2">devastating the environment around it</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.430" end="01:31:47.070" style="s2">but once it eats enough stuff that it</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.360" end="01:31:49.260" style="s2">has the fuel and resources necessary to</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.070" end="01:31:51.180" style="s2">make a butterfly the imaginal cells the</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.260" end="01:31:53.190" style="s2">first butterfly cells start kicking on</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.180" end="01:31:55.950" style="s2">triggers the movement into the chrysalis</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.190" end="01:31:58.380" style="s2">at which point the caterpillar ends up</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.950" end="01:32:01.520" style="s2">dissolving like all the organs is</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.380" end="01:32:06.030" style="s2">alright dissolves all the way down to</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.520" end="01:32:08.580" style="s2">sub cellular structures and then gets to</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.030" end="01:32:11.250" style="s2">reform right at an amino acid at a</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.580" end="01:32:13.410" style="s2">peptide level reform to a butterfly it</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.250" end="01:32:15.480" style="s2">is not a retrofit of a caterpillar it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.410" end="01:32:17.550" style="s2">it&#39;s a fundamentally different thing of</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.480" end="01:32:19.620" style="s2">the fundamentally different code but you</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.550" end="01:32:22.500" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have predicted that discrete</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.620" end="01:32:25.290" style="s2">phase shift by just continuing to</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.500" end="01:32:26.940" style="s2">forecast along the caterpillar curve any</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.290" end="01:32:30.150" style="s2">more than you would if you just took the</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.940" end="01:32:32.850" style="s2">forty weeks of in utero development and</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.150" end="01:32:34.200" style="s2">said it looks bad right like if we</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.850" end="01:32:36.780" style="s2">didn&#39;t know birth was gonna happen</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.200" end="01:32:38.760" style="s2">it&#39;s getting really cramped around 42</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.780" end="01:32:40.410" style="s2">weeks around 44 weeks it looks like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.760" end="01:32:44.760" style="s2">just gonna like get too big and die</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.410" end="01:32:46.890" style="s2">right and this the same can be true said</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.760" end="01:32:49.470" style="s2">true for a little bird developing inside</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.890" end="01:32:52.020" style="s2">of an eggshell ray like they&#39;re all the</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.470" end="01:32:55.860" style="s2">developmental phases are defined by net</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.020" end="01:32:58.620" style="s2">consumption and net growth in a finite</p>

<p begin="01:32:58.620" end="01:33:03.000" style="s2">that of course if it tried to continue</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.210" end="01:33:04.620" style="s2">it would go it would die but it&#39;s to get</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.000" end="01:33:07.020" style="s2">to the point that it has the capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.620" end="01:33:09.660" style="s2">go through some discrete phase shift the</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.020" end="01:33:11.070" style="s2">chrysalis the birth out of the uterus</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.660" end="01:33:12.810" style="s2">and the cutting of the umbilical cord</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.070" end="01:33:15.690" style="s2">the emergence out of the eggshell and</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.810" end="01:33:17.870" style="s2">then on the other side of that discrete</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.690" end="01:33:20.040" style="s2">phase shift is a totally new curve and</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.870" end="01:33:22.560" style="s2">so then</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.040" end="01:33:24.960" style="s2">the question is could there be a</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.560" end="01:33:27.060" style="s2">discrete phase shift that where all of</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.960" end="01:33:28.590" style="s2">what we&#39;ve called humanity or</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.060" end="01:33:31.050" style="s2">civilization so far has been a</p>

<p begin="01:33:52.640" end="01:33:57.140" style="s2">restructure those technologies those</p>

<p begin="01:34:33.420" end="01:34:38.280" style="s2">that do you think this is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.520" end="01:34:40.950" style="s2">the chrysalis moment and that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.280" end="01:34:42.720" style="s2">going to just be creating or turn into a</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.950" end="01:34:44.640" style="s2">new paradigm of some kind</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.720" end="01:34:53.490" style="s2">is there enough cause for hope that we</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.640" end="01:34:59.340" style="s2">could feel that way it&#39;s a tricky</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.490" end="01:35:02.640" style="s2">question there there&#39;s a utilitarian</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.340" end="01:35:05.460" style="s2">answer which is depending upon what is</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.640" end="01:35:07.550" style="s2">going to move people more it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.460" end="01:35:10.350" style="s2">for them to hold both sides right if if</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.550" end="01:35:13.350" style="s2">getting that it&#39;s not a given that we</p>

<p begin="01:35:13.350" end="01:35:18.270" style="s2">just wanting to win at a dying game then</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.260" end="01:35:20.280" style="s2">they might need to go through that and I</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.270" end="01:35:22.920" style="s2">think probably most people do and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.280" end="01:35:25.530" style="s2">important but then not stay stuck there</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.920" end="01:35:28.080" style="s2">and then say okay well now I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.530" end="01:35:30.450" style="s2">to win at a dying game or a game that is</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.080" end="01:35:33.090" style="s2">causing the death of what is meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.450" end="01:35:33.599" style="s2">itself I want to help birth a new game</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.090" end="01:35:36.510" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.599" end="01:35:39.900" style="s2">what is that it&#39;s if you think of it as</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.510" end="01:35:42.270" style="s2">inevitable then it doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.900" end="01:35:44.130" style="s2">compel your participation if you think</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.270" end="01:35:46.349" style="s2">of it as impossible it doesn&#39;t compel</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.130" end="01:35:49.349" style="s2">your participation either if you think</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.349" end="01:35:52.320" style="s2">of it as possible and not yet determined</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.349" end="01:35:53.219" style="s2">and influenceable by how you show up I</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.320" end="01:35:57.210" style="s2">think that&#39;s the right way to think</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.219" end="01:36:01.949" style="s2">about it so I have one last question in</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.210" end="01:36:06.659" style="s2">this regard what can we do then on an</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.949" end="01:36:14.429" style="s2">individual level to make this shift</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.659" end="01:36:21.570" style="s2">happen yeah so I&#39;m gonna answer that in</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.429" end="01:36:27.599" style="s2">a meta way first ask that question</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.570" end="01:36:29.849" style="s2">earnestly a lot and really work for</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.599" end="01:36:34.199" style="s2">answers without assuming that any</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.849" end="01:36:35.579" style="s2">authority already has them and not</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.199" end="01:36:36.810" style="s2">assuming that there aren&#39;t places that</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.579" end="01:36:40.079" style="s2">have a lot of answer that you want to</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.810" end="01:36:44.659" style="s2">study right but like for whatever faults</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.079" end="01:36:47.250" style="s2">we can assess there Gandhi did some very</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.659" end="01:36:49.290" style="s2">meaningful things that have have not</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.250" end="01:36:51.449" style="s2">been done at that scale maybe maybe ever</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.290" end="01:36:52.920" style="s2">and one of the interesting parts of the</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.449" end="01:36:54.540" style="s2">story when he said you know in South</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.920" end="01:36:55.920" style="s2">Africa the first time then India later</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.540" end="01:36:57.300" style="s2">he said okay I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna stop</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.920" end="01:36:59.340" style="s2">this I&#39;m gonna get a home rule for India</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.300" end="01:37:01.219" style="s2">and people said how he said I have no</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.340" end="01:37:04.560" style="s2">idea mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.219" end="01:37:06.960" style="s2">but he said like I know that it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.560" end="01:37:08.760" style="s2">I know that these people being enslaved</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.960" end="01:37:10.020" style="s2">by another people is not right I know</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.760" end="01:37:12.540" style="s2">that&#39;s right so I&#39;m committed to</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.020" end="01:37:15.480" style="s2">aligning my life to make it happen fully</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.540" end="01:37:18.389" style="s2">before knowing how there&#39;s a decision</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.480" end="01:37:20.849" style="s2">before the problem solving and so then</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.389" end="01:37:23.429" style="s2">it was like then because of that and he</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.849" end="01:37:25.710" style="s2">said so my how I&#39;m gonna just sit here</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.429" end="01:37:27.090" style="s2">in Journal and think about it and</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.710" end="01:37:29.550" style="s2">meditate and pray and do whatever</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.090" end="01:37:31.230" style="s2">process I have to come up with a how and</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.550" end="01:37:33.840" style="s2">then when I give that how I&#39;m gonna try</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.230" end="01:37:35.670" style="s2">it and then when it failed he&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.840" end="01:37:37.320" style="s2">I didn&#39;t say I just learned something</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.670" end="01:37:37.590" style="s2">kind of like Edison&#39;s light bulb and try</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.320" end="01:37:40.739" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.590" end="01:37:44.550" style="s2">we have to take something an approach</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.739" end="01:37:46.559" style="s2">where there is a where there&#39;s a knowing</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.550" end="01:37:46.880" style="s2">that we don&#39;t actually know how to do</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.559" end="01:37:49.010" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.880" end="01:37:50.030" style="s2">mentally new phase yet we want to learn</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.010" end="01:37:51.889" style="s2">from all the people that have been</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.030" end="01:37:53.330" style="s2">thinking well about it and we want to be</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.889" end="01:37:54.860" style="s2">thinking well about it and we want to be</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.330" end="01:37:56.870" style="s2">adding our energy to it as best as we</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.860" end="01:37:59.870" style="s2">can and we want to get really fucking</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.870" end="01:38:02.690" style="s2">earnest about that and notice wait where</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.870" end="01:38:04.250" style="s2">am I actually just kind of mostly trying</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.690" end="01:38:06.920" style="s2">to win at the current system and and</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.250" end="01:38:08.179" style="s2">what does that mean and think more</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.920" end="01:38:11.659" style="s2">deeply about it so the first thing I</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.179" end="01:38:15.620" style="s2">would say is is really that like rather</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.659" end="01:38:18.080" style="s2">than yeah rather than you know me give</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.620" end="01:38:22.460" style="s2">an answer do this thing it&#39;s activate</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.080" end="01:38:25.370" style="s2">yourself as an agent of sense-making as</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.460" end="01:38:27.139" style="s2">a capable being that can actually make</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.370" end="01:38:32.679" style="s2">sense of shit and think about it and and</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.139" end="01:38:36.290" style="s2">work on something and so the the answer</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.679" end="01:38:39.530" style="s2">what can you do I one thing that it is</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.290" end="01:38:41.389" style="s2">not is donate some money to charity and</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.530" end="01:38:43.929" style="s2">go do some volunteer work sometimes and</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.389" end="01:38:49.610" style="s2">recycle and like ride your bike to work</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.929" end="01:38:51.710" style="s2">all of that is lovely and we we still</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.610" end="01:38:54.260" style="s2">hit catastrophe if that&#39;s if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.710" end="01:38:56.270" style="s2">best we&#39;re doing because it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.260" end="01:38:58.300" style="s2">decrease our personal consumption a</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.270" end="01:39:02.239" style="s2">little bit try and do some good stuff</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.300" end="01:39:03.469" style="s2">changes anything at scale Oh like people</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.239" end="01:39:04.699" style="s2">have to take a deeper level of</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.469" end="01:39:08.409" style="s2">responsibility for how do we actually</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.699" end="01:39:11.060" style="s2">change these meta systems what could a</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.409" end="01:39:12.739" style="s2">future of economics post capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.060" end="01:39:13.699" style="s2">that&#39;s viable really look like so then</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.739" end="01:39:15.530" style="s2">you say well I don&#39;t know let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.699" end="01:39:17.300" style="s2">studying and study post capitalism and</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.530" end="01:39:19.159" style="s2">and study different systems that have</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.300" end="01:39:20.690" style="s2">been proposed and then look out what are</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.159" end="01:39:21.739" style="s2">groups that are working on things and is</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.690" end="01:39:24.050" style="s2">there something I can meaningfully</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.739" end="01:39:25.580" style="s2">contribute all right well that system</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.050" end="01:39:27.050" style="s2">makes sense but I have no idea how the</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.580" end="01:39:29.750" style="s2">fuck we get there all right what might a</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.050" end="01:39:31.280" style="s2">transitional system that&#39;s intelligible</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.750" end="01:39:33.679" style="s2">to the current system but vectors</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.280" end="01:39:34.940" style="s2">towards that so maybe aspects of The</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.679" end="01:39:37.670" style="s2">Venus Project and resource-based</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.940" end="01:39:38.929" style="s2">economy&#39;s are not fully dialed in but</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.670" end="01:39:40.340" style="s2">there are parts of it that are right but</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.929" end="01:39:43.580" style="s2">how do you vector there may be some</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.340" end="01:39:45.650" style="s2">parts of crypto currency blockchain is</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.580" end="01:39:49.460" style="s2">also inadequate but maybe convector that</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.650" end="01:39:53.150" style="s2">you start kind of really dialing in what</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.460" end="01:39:56.270" style="s2">are the closest things we know for how</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.150" end="01:39:58.730" style="s2">to think about both what a viable</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.270" end="01:39:59.989" style="s2">civilization could look like and how we</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.730" end="01:40:04.249" style="s2">can vector there</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.989" end="01:40:06.099" style="s2">and yeah I mean that that&#39;s what I would</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.249" end="01:40:09.619" style="s2">really say is think about it earnestly</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.099" end="01:40:12.650" style="s2">educate yourself and work on it and</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.619" end="01:40:16.909" style="s2">actually realize that it matters that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.650" end="01:40:19.190" style="s2">really helpful thank you yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.909" end="01:40:21.019" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely it&#39;s keeping an it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.190" end="01:40:23.989" style="s2">an active mind and not just looking for</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.019" end="01:40:26.150" style="s2">quick fixes which I guess is part of the</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.989" end="01:40:28.519" style="s2">core of what well your work is and what</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.150" end="01:40:31.219" style="s2">neuro hacker is trying to do if people</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.519" end="01:40:33.230" style="s2">want to find out more about your own</p>

<p begin="01:40:44.869" end="01:40:50.389" style="s2">governance and infrastructure there is</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.090" end="01:40:54.440" style="s2">no place that that&#39;s hosted on the web</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.389" end="01:40:56.119" style="s2">yet but there is about to be we you know</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.440" end="01:40:58.010" style="s2">we have some kind of think tank like</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.119" end="01:41:01.369" style="s2">organizations that focus on these things</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.010" end="01:41:03.860" style="s2">but they&#39;re not publishing at some point</p>
