<p begin="00:20:55.030" end="00:20:59.500" style="s2">to play with the metaphor and that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.250" end="00:21:03.280" style="s2">a framing up simultaneously of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.500" end="00:21:07.180" style="s2">and our being and of our world and of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.280" end="00:21:12.610" style="s2">our being in the world and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.180" end="00:21:14.790" style="s2">things that will start to change on is</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.610" end="00:21:20.080" style="s2">your relationship to the mystery of time</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.790" end="00:21:23.500" style="s2">because time is so integral to our</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.080" end="00:21:26.340" style="s2">fundamental framing it&#39;s transparent to</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.500" end="00:21:28.210" style="s2">us it&#39;s hard to see it Augustine or</p>

<p begin="00:21:28.210" end="00:21:32.050" style="s2">Asians of his name famously said I know</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.950" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">what time is instant until somebody asks</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.050" end="00:21:39.100" style="s2">me so time is a mystery you every</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.880" end="00:21:40.780" style="s2">attempt to grasp it conceptually realize</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.100" end="00:21:43.570" style="s2">it you realize that you&#39;re presupposing</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.780" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">time in the very conceptualization</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.570" end="00:21:48.090" style="s2">that&#39;s how profound time is but yet</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.840" end="00:21:53.450" style="s2">also what is more familiar to what is</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.090" end="00:21:58.919" style="s2">more in every moment than time and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.450" end="00:22:04.970" style="s2">this practice will take the pasta into</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.919" end="00:22:07.080" style="s2">meta and that will start reorienting you</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.970" end="00:22:10.559" style="s2">towards some of these fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.080" end="00:22:12.299" style="s2">mysteries and the reorientation will</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.559" end="00:22:15.539" style="s2">come out in the way Brett was sharing</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.299" end="00:22:18.539" style="s2">they will come out in very practical</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.539" end="00:22:20.640" style="s2">thing as you do but because the way our</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.539" end="00:22:24.510" style="s2">culture has sort of separated</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.640" end="00:22:25.890" style="s2">practicality from profundity I want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.510" end="00:22:28.559" style="s2">emphasize the fact that although these</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.890" end="00:22:30.630" style="s2">are very practical transformations they</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.559" end="00:22:33.390" style="s2">are nevertheless profound and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.630" end="00:22:37.100" style="s2">very important to share them with us so</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.390" end="00:22:42.120" style="s2">thank you very much for Brett for that</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.100" end="00:22:45.059" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to be philosophers but we</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.120" end="00:22:48.630" style="s2">can learn from them hopefully we all do</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.059" end="00:22:51.360" style="s2">need to practice finally Oh Sophia the</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.630" end="00:22:54.470" style="s2">Philae Oh which means the community love</p>

<p begin="00:23:09.270" end="00:23:14.039" style="s2">are many traditions and I have done this</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.520" end="00:23:16.140" style="s2">where even where the entire city is to</p>

<p begin="00:23:16.140" end="00:23:23.309" style="s2">extended period I would recommend you</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.919" end="00:23:24.120" style="s2">emphasize the routing perhaps what you</p>

<p begin="00:23:29.370" end="00:23:35.429" style="s2">when you sit maybe very quickly do that</p>
