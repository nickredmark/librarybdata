<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:06.569" style="s2">I following the breadcrumbs yesterday I</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.859" end="00:00:08.730" style="s2">did a video on masculinity and</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.569" end="00:00:12.120" style="s2">femininity and I also commented on</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.730" end="00:00:13.290" style="s2">Charles Eisenstein video when I did it</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.120" end="00:00:15.030" style="s2">and I&#39;ll link the video on here if you</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.290" end="00:00:17.100" style="s2">want to read that but the main point is</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.030" end="00:00:19.020" style="s2">that two people had an ensuing</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.100" end="00:00:21.840" style="s2">conversation underneath my comment and</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.020" end="00:00:23.250" style="s2">reading that this morning I needed</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.840" end="00:00:25.080" style="s2">things for me I was like thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.250" end="00:00:26.220" style="s2">this this is if I hadn&#39;t written that</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.080" end="00:00:28.140" style="s2">comment they wouldn&#39;t have had that</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.220" end="00:00:35.219" style="s2">conversation and I wouldn&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.140" end="00:00:36.870" style="s2">follow this breadcrumb I realized that</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.219" end="00:00:40.020" style="s2">my response to masculinity and</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.870" end="00:00:43.800" style="s2">femininity isn&#39;t just on that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.020" end="00:00:45.660" style="s2">because they&#39;re archetypes and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.800" end="00:00:49.230" style="s2">reacting that way to all archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.660" end="00:00:50.789" style="s2">I don&#39;t like archetypes because of what</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.230" end="00:00:52.710" style="s2">this person also illuminated which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.789" end="00:00:55.530" style="s2">when you&#39;re when you&#39;re figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.710" end="00:00:57.510" style="s2">your identity are you creating it or are</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.530" end="00:00:59.399" style="s2">you discovering it is it something</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.510" end="00:01:00.570" style="s2">outside of you you were living into or</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.399" end="00:01:02.850" style="s2">it&#39;s something from inside of you that</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.570" end="00:01:03.690" style="s2">you&#39;re living into those are very</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.850" end="00:01:06.600" style="s2">different things</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.690" end="00:01:08.850" style="s2">and so if you&#39;re if you&#39;re creating your</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.600" end="00:01:11.220" style="s2">identity a blueprint can be very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.850" end="00:01:13.740" style="s2">and if you&#39;re discovering your identity</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.220" end="00:01:15.960" style="s2">can be a hindrance so thank you to that</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.740" end="00:01:17.790" style="s2">person who wrote that on there and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.960" end="00:01:19.259" style="s2">realizing yes I&#39;m negatively responding</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.790" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">to all archetypes cuz I think they are</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.259" end="00:01:25.320" style="s2">holding us back as a society we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:27.240" style="s2">looking for other people to come and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.320" end="00:01:29.729" style="s2">be the hero because that&#39;s what it looks</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.240" end="00:01:31.470" style="s2">like a mentor comes and tells the hero</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.729" end="00:01:34.829" style="s2">to go on their journey and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.470" end="00:01:36.030" style="s2">obvious here is your quest and that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.829" end="00:01:38.070" style="s2">not what&#39;s gonna happen on this planet</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.030" end="00:01:40.530" style="s2">we all need to step into our hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.070" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">journey and the entire universe exists</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.530" end="00:01:44.040" style="s2">to be your mentor to be the one to guide</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:45.420" style="s2">you to leave all of these breadcrumbs</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.040" end="00:01:47.880" style="s2">that we do for each other all of these</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.420" end="00:01:49.860" style="s2">big huge world events happen so that</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.880" end="00:01:52.590" style="s2">each and every one of us can learn what</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.860" end="00:01:54.960" style="s2">we&#39;re here to learn and that&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.590" end="00:01:56.579" style="s2">probability and comp like low</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.960" end="00:01:59.540" style="s2">probability and complex yet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.579" end="00:02:03.719" style="s2">happening it&#39;s happening constantly and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.540" end="00:02:05.490" style="s2">there&#39;s I don&#39;t want people to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.719" end="00:02:07.170" style="s2">creating an identity I want them to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.490" end="00:02:09.209" style="s2">discovering identity but I don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.170" end="00:02:12.480" style="s2">decide that I only can decide that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.209" end="00:02:13.120" style="s2">discovering my identity and I do know I</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.480" end="00:02:15.190" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.120" end="00:02:17.290" style="s2">labels helpful because they help explain</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.190" end="00:02:21.330" style="s2">Who I am to other people and to myself</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.290" end="00:02:23.500" style="s2">so when I discovered I was autistic it</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.330" end="00:02:25.180" style="s2">made a lot of things collect and put a</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.500" end="00:02:27.790" style="s2">lot of things into place all these are</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.180" end="00:02:32.500" style="s2">my people and he&#39;s that like it but if I</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.790" end="00:02:33.910" style="s2">started to act that role if I started to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.500" end="00:02:38.560" style="s2">be like okay how do I be more autistic</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.910" end="00:02:41.049" style="s2">how do I look that way more so other</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.560" end="00:02:43.120" style="s2">people believe me how do I then that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.049" end="00:02:47.470" style="s2">I&#39;m starting to create that instead of</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.120" end="00:02:48.880" style="s2">discovering that same with when before I</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.470" end="00:02:51.130" style="s2">was autistic but I figured out it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.880" end="00:02:53.110" style="s2">queer and I was there was a very real</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.130" end="00:02:55.420" style="s2">need I was like okay well I used to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.110" end="00:02:56.709" style="s2">woman who was attracted to men and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.420" end="00:02:57.879" style="s2">knew what that looks like even if I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.709" end="00:03:00.430" style="s2">failing and looking like a woman and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.879" end="00:03:02.290" style="s2">being a woman and I knew what male look</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.430" end="00:03:04.140" style="s2">like and men and masculine and so it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.290" end="00:03:07.299" style="s2">okay these two pieces go together</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.140" end="00:03:08.680" style="s2">that&#39;s easy now that you&#39;re queer I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.299" end="00:03:10.030" style="s2">like oh god wait am i mask it on my</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.680" end="00:03:15.340" style="s2">feminine whom I tracked to and it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.030" end="00:03:17.109" style="s2">like oh I I get to be I get to be Who I</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.340" end="00:03:19.030" style="s2">am and I get to be attracted to Who I am</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.109" end="00:03:20.079" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t matter whether they are</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.030" end="00:03:21.220" style="s2">vascular if I&#39;m in nowhere that</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.079" end="00:03:23.290" style="s2">masculine or feminine</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.220" end="00:03:25.120" style="s2">in fact if I&#39;m trying to play a role of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.290" end="00:03:27.370" style="s2">who trying to create something to create</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.120" end="00:03:29.290" style="s2">its so that I can attract someone that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.370" end="00:03:31.359" style="s2">is not the same as discovering who I am</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.290" end="00:03:33.910" style="s2">as I would love to hear from you in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.359" end="00:03:37.000" style="s2">comments do you find archetypes helpful</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.910" end="00:03:38.709" style="s2">are they blueprints what pieces do you</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.000" end="00:03:40.030" style="s2">take from it and I guess that&#39;s it they</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.709" end="00:03:42.459" style="s2">can be helpful it&#39;s an archetype</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.030" end="00:03:45.069" style="s2">umbrella as long as you know that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.459" end="00:03:46.750" style="s2">there&#39;s that it&#39;s explaining who you are</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.069" end="00:03:48.220" style="s2">and you&#39;re picking and choosing those</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.750" end="00:03:51.190" style="s2">explanations and throwing away what</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.220" end="00:03:52.989" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work for you versus trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.190" end="00:03:55.030" style="s2">something and that&#39;s what I find that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.989" end="00:03:57.280" style="s2">the masculine feminine idea of male and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.030" end="00:03:59.709" style="s2">female and man and woman is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.280" end="00:04:02.859" style="s2">trying to be these archetypes as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.709" end="00:04:04.569" style="s2">to being who we are which partly falls</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.859" end="00:04:06.069" style="s2">on the masculine male umbrella and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.569" end="00:04:10.840" style="s2">partly falls under the feminine female</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.069" end="00:04:12.609" style="s2">umbrella and that is exactly what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.840" end="00:04:13.840" style="s2">doing in the world is figure following</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.609" end="00:04:15.549" style="s2">these bread crumbs fine you know what</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.840" end="00:04:18.280" style="s2">the universe is left for me to discover</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.549" end="00:04:19.570" style="s2">so that I can discover who I am and be</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.280" end="00:04:22.180" style="s2">my best self in the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.570" end="00:04:24.699" style="s2">my most authentic self in the world not</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.180" end="00:04:29.889" style="s2">by society standards by my own standard</p>

<p begin="00:04:29.889" end="00:04:34.330" style="s2">here to do and that&#39;s what I want other</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:35.889" style="s2">people to do but I can&#39;t control anyone</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.330" end="00:04:37.659" style="s2">else well hope I can do is put it out</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.889" end="00:04:40.270" style="s2">into the world but I&#39;m super grateful I</p>
