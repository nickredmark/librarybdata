<p begin="00:00:34.350" end="00:00:39.870" style="s2">was forced to go through the rather</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.270" end="00:00:42.060" style="s2">traumatic experience of establishing a</p>

<p begin="00:00:57.420" end="00:01:01.710" style="s2">which is I I try to warn them I said I</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.190" end="00:01:04.199" style="s2">have very very difficult hair and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.710" end="00:01:07.290" style="s2">person becomes effusive and they say no</p>

<p begin="00:01:07.290" end="00:01:11.940" style="s2">they&#39;re lying and here&#39;s how I know</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.049" end="00:01:14.130" style="s2">because at the end if you hang around</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.940" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">after you&#39;ve paid they sweep it off the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.130" end="00:01:18.930" style="s2">floor and they just throw it away</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.600" end="00:01:20.850" style="s2">yeah no that&#39;s definitely about you yes</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.930" end="00:01:22.380" style="s2">yeah I mean they don&#39;t do that to anyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.850" end="00:01:24.270" style="s2">else I guess I put them in an awkward</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.380" end="00:01:26.040" style="s2">position by raising the issue but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.270" end="00:01:27.330" style="s2">they don&#39;t tell you the truth I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:01:30.210" end="00:01:35.130" style="s2">have you noticed that I have yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.760" end="00:01:37.500" style="s2">it&#39;s quite a world out there so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.130" end="00:01:40.740" style="s2">gonna try to unpack what is it taking</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.500" end="00:01:43.830" style="s2">place yeah you have a place you want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.740" end="00:01:45.630" style="s2">start oh we can start by talking a</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.830" end="00:01:47.520" style="s2">little bit about schools of Education</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.630" end="00:01:50.580" style="s2">which is something I alluded to either</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.520" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">last time or the time before as you like</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.580" end="00:01:53.759" style="s2">I thought that would be in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.170" end="00:01:58.320" style="s2">but okay you&#39;re gonna start there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.759" end="00:01:59.880" style="s2">okay so I had alluded to a friend of</p>

<p begin="00:02:34.470" end="00:02:39.790" style="s2">and he later because I was behind a</p>

<p begin="00:02:42.510" end="00:02:47.050" style="s2">let me just walk us through a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.670" end="00:02:49.690" style="s2">of what his argument is and they were</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.050" end="00:02:52.000" style="s2">gonna show a clip that was sent to us by</p>

<p begin="00:03:32.829" end="00:03:37.090" style="s2">of the foundational papers in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.299" end="00:03:38.950" style="s2">so-called scholarship in this realm that</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.090" end="00:03:41.549" style="s2">has become really foundational for many</p>

<p begin="00:03:56.290" end="00:04:03.640" style="s2">here&#39;s just a quote from this paper that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.190" end="00:04:04.989" style="s2">Asher takes two pieces they say again</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.640" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">this is the foundational is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.989" end="00:04:08.920" style="s2">introduction of the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:12.070" style="s2">microaggressions from if memory serves</p>

<p begin="00:04:12.070" end="00:04:15.579" style="s2">can usually be explained away by</p>

<p begin="00:04:15.579" end="00:04:18.760" style="s2">for the recipient of a microaggression</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.229" end="00:04:20.320" style="s2">however there is always the nagging</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.760" end="00:04:21.970" style="s2">question of whether it really happened</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.320" end="00:04:23.380" style="s2">it is difficult to identify a</p>

<p begin="00:04:25.900" end="00:04:28.760" style="s2">of color describe a vague</p>

<p begin="00:04:30.410" end="00:04:35.060" style="s2">right microaggressions operate to create</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.230" end="00:04:37.040" style="s2">psychological dilemmas for both the</p>

<p begin="00:04:37.040" end="00:04:44.360" style="s2">color so Asher quotes this from this</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.330" end="00:04:45.890" style="s2">paper and says why is everyone falling</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.360" end="00:04:48.530" style="s2">for this kind of thinking which</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.890" end="00:04:50.780" style="s2">explicitly pits villains against victims</p>

<p begin="00:04:56.480" end="00:05:01.730" style="s2">garbage so just one quote here from him</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.700" end="00:05:05.150" style="s2">he says because doing so yeah why not</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.730" end="00:05:07.910" style="s2">why not tear apart</p>

<p begin="00:06:42.349" end="00:06:48.229" style="s2">recommend this essay highly enough it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.229" end="00:06:49.939" style="s2">it&#39;s so it&#39;s so good and I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.229" end="00:06:51.379" style="s2">we want to go right into this little</p>

<p begin="00:06:51.379" end="00:06:55.039" style="s2">things about what what you just heard</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.509" end="00:06:56.869" style="s2">well I would agree with you Lyle has</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.039" end="00:07:00.110" style="s2">been on this case for quite some time</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.869" end="00:07:01.639" style="s2">and reading his work is very sobering</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.110" end="00:07:03.860" style="s2">because he just cuts right to the heart</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.639" end="00:07:06.080" style="s2">of it those quotes are excellent and</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.860" end="00:07:07.429" style="s2">really point to it but what I&#39;m hoping</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.080" end="00:07:10.849" style="s2">people will do is they will start to</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.429" end="00:07:13.699" style="s2">think about what the architecture that</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.849" end="00:07:15.649" style="s2">is built up around these claims becomes</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.699" end="00:07:16.759" style="s2">and what it looks like going forward</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.649" end="00:07:19.219" style="s2">because of course the thing that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.759" end="00:07:21.559" style="s2">been saying for quite some time is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.219" end="00:07:23.809" style="s2">as this moves into the schools of Eady</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.559" end="00:07:25.669" style="s2">it obviously moves into the children and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.809" end="00:07:28.219" style="s2">it moves into the children and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.669" end="00:07:29.959" style="s2">cannot help but pervade society because</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.219" end="00:07:33.019" style="s2">where do the children go absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.959" end="00:07:35.240" style="s2">everywhere right so anyway that&#39;s sure</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.019" end="00:07:37.039" style="s2">to be a theme of much of our discussion</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.240" end="00:07:39.229" style="s2">today but let&#39;s look at that clip yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.039" end="00:07:43.189" style="s2">so before before you put the clip up</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.229" end="00:07:45.259" style="s2">sack when I mentioned this essay a</p>

<p begin="00:08:16.579" end="00:08:20.439" style="s2">just watch this minute or so long clip</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.279" end="00:08:26.629" style="s2">yes I creates is that an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.899" end="00:08:28.969" style="s2">opportunity for our school to have time</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.629" end="00:08:31.490" style="s2">dedicated to come together to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.969" end="00:08:32.419" style="s2">how do we create anti-racist schools I</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.490" end="00:08:35.149" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.419" end="00:08:36.919" style="s2">teaching as a very political act when we</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.149" end="00:08:38.959" style="s2">are engaging with our students whether</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.919" end="00:08:40.969" style="s2">it&#39;s on social justice issues or</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.959" end="00:08:42.649" style="s2">multicultural issues or culturally</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.969" end="00:08:45.319" style="s2">relevant teaching I see that as</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.649" end="00:08:47.389" style="s2">foundational to all learning we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.319" end="00:08:49.889" style="s2">learning a lot about like different</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.389" end="00:08:53.790" style="s2">issues in this world</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.889" end="00:08:55.949" style="s2">and like um what&#39;s happening around like</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.790" end="00:08:59.309" style="s2">we&#39;re mostly thinking about like racial</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.949" end="00:09:02.850" style="s2">and culture in my class and how we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.309" end="00:09:05.609" style="s2">change the future we have all of these</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.850" end="00:09:08.519" style="s2">different people that are activists we</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.609" end="00:09:11.639" style="s2">have gay people we have transgendered</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.519" end="00:09:14.069" style="s2">people and we have people that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.639" end="00:09:16.799" style="s2">taking action and we&#39;re learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.069" end="00:09:19.980" style="s2">take action in social studies now we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.799" end="00:09:21.419" style="s2">seen our students become empowered we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.980" end="00:09:23.069" style="s2">seen them see that even at the age of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.419" end="00:09:25.649" style="s2">four that they can take an active role</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.069" end="00:09:27.989" style="s2">and be activists and so it&#39;s through</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.649" end="00:09:31.109" style="s2">this work that we realize that education</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.989" end="00:09:36.029" style="s2">without this conversation isn&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.109" end="00:09:38.220" style="s2">make a difference for our children even</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.029" end="00:09:39.869" style="s2">for ural even four-year-olds bretton</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.220" end="00:09:44.160" style="s2">even four-year-olds could be activists</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.869" end="00:09:46.589" style="s2">even for yes and so what&#39;s so disturbing</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.160" end="00:09:49.379" style="s2">as an educator and of course I never</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.589" end="00:09:51.779" style="s2">taught young kids but as an educator I</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.379" end="00:09:55.649" style="s2">know and from being a parent I know kids</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.779" end="00:09:58.009" style="s2">have to have and they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.649" end="00:10:00.149" style="s2">trusting in order for education to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.009" end="00:10:02.249" style="s2">effective because they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.149" end="00:10:04.499" style="s2">tools to be discerning and to choose</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.249" end="00:10:06.959" style="s2">between the truth and lies if they have</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.499" end="00:10:08.369" style="s2">a teacher that&#39;s spouting both of them</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.959" end="00:10:11.519" style="s2">they can&#39;t detect which witch is which</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.369" end="00:10:13.529" style="s2">and so anyway you would expect evolution</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.519" end="00:10:15.509" style="s2">to have built children to be trusting</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.529" end="00:10:18.149" style="s2">and that the it is the obligation of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.509" end="00:10:20.040" style="s2">adults around them to protect them from</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.149" end="00:10:22.579" style="s2">untruths and when the adults around them</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.040" end="00:10:25.319" style="s2">start spouting on trees feeding them</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.579" end="00:10:26.999" style="s2">fictions in an effort to turn them into</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.319" end="00:10:29.699" style="s2">soldiers in some battle that they will</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.999" end="00:10:33.779" style="s2">ultimately join it&#39;s just an incredible</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.699" end="00:10:37.259" style="s2">betrayal of of their natural role as</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.779" end="00:10:39.629" style="s2">educators and mentors the natural</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.259" end="00:10:42.299" style="s2">betrayal by the teachers by the teachers</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.629" end="00:10:44.449" style="s2">and the administrators and coming down</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.299" end="00:10:45.899" style="s2">from on high from the schools of Ed and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.449" end="00:10:48.149" style="s2">you know it</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.899" end="00:10:50.609" style="s2">it misunderstands so much about what</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.149" end="00:10:53.970" style="s2">humans are and about what children are</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.609" end="00:10:56.489" style="s2">right one thing that most people who are</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.970" end="00:10:58.739" style="s2">professional educators in k-12 schools</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.489" end="00:11:00.629" style="s2">and probably in higher ed as well don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.739" end="00:11:02.220" style="s2">know and probably would tell you the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.629" end="00:11:06.720" style="s2">exact opposite if you were to ask them</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.220" end="00:11:08.400" style="s2">is that school not only isn&#39;t a thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.720" end="00:11:10.610" style="s2">that exists outside of humans but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.400" end="00:11:14.250" style="s2">not a human Universal by any means</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.610" end="00:11:16.530" style="s2">learning is and every social organism</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.250" end="00:11:19.440" style="s2">out there be they human or not does some</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.530" end="00:11:23.550" style="s2">learning but the idea of school in which</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.440" end="00:11:27.920" style="s2">you have an authority who hands down</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.550" end="00:11:30.570" style="s2">information as opposed to the young</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.920" end="00:11:34.110" style="s2">interactively learning by observing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.570" end="00:11:36.300" style="s2">doing is really not just a modern but</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.110" end="00:11:38.280" style="s2">specifically a we&#39;re a pretty weird that</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.300" end="00:11:42.090" style="s2">is to say you know Western educated</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.280" end="00:11:45.060" style="s2">industrialized rich democratic society</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.090" end="00:11:47.070" style="s2">weird that acronym and surely there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.060" end="00:11:49.860" style="s2">other there are non weird countries that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.070" end="00:11:53.190" style="s2">have that have school but it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.860" end="00:11:55.860" style="s2">bit of a bastardization of the honest</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.190" end="00:11:57.630" style="s2">and necessary thing that we need as</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.860" end="00:12:01.560" style="s2">children which is to be actively</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.630" end="00:12:05.450" style="s2">observing engaging doing learning and to</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.560" end="00:12:10.290" style="s2">have that that software hijacked by</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.450" end="00:12:12.480" style="s2">activists educators is is an abomination</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.290" end="00:12:16.440" style="s2">the software is hijacked for</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.480" end="00:12:18.090" style="s2">indoctrination purposes so what I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.440" end="00:12:20.340" style="s2">is probably true to see if you agree is</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.090" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">that mentoring is absolutely Bic WA</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.340" end="00:12:26.280" style="s2">tusen humans that schooling is a an</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:28.320" style="s2">alternative to mentoring and it opens</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.280" end="00:12:30.630" style="s2">the door to indoctrination right</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.320" end="00:12:32.700" style="s2">mentoring is inherently I believe free</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.630" end="00:12:33.960" style="s2">of it because at some level if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.700" end="00:12:36.150" style="s2">showing somebody how to do something</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.960" end="00:12:38.400" style="s2">they will immediately detect that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.150" end="00:12:39.900" style="s2">are telling them nonsense because what</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.400" end="00:12:42.120" style="s2">you&#39;re demonstrating how to do won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.900" end="00:12:44.580" style="s2">work as well as it does when you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.120" end="00:12:45.870" style="s2">do whatever the nonsense was so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.580" end="00:12:47.130" style="s2">opened the door to this with formal</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.870" end="00:12:50.280" style="s2">schooling and then we see this thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.130" end="00:12:54.030" style="s2">migrated into the schools of ed now I am</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.280" end="00:12:55.380" style="s2">sure that most of our viewers will be in</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.030" end="00:12:57.420" style="s2">the same boat that I was in until</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.380" end="00:12:59.220" style="s2">recently having thought almost nothing</p>

<p begin="00:13:01.050" end="00:13:05.850" style="s2">what does it cover so in some sense we</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.690" end="00:13:09.530" style="s2">are all living downstream of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.850" end="00:13:12.300" style="s2">phenomenon that touches all of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.530" end="00:13:13.920" style="s2">teachers who then reach all of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.300" end="00:13:15.630" style="s2">kids who then show up in our college</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.920" end="00:13:16.080" style="s2">classrooms and we have no idea the kids</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.630" end="00:13:18.530" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.080" end="00:13:21.360" style="s2">have no idea where a lot of the</p>

<p begin="00:13:21.360" end="00:13:27.710" style="s2">came from in this case it&#39;s like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.090" end="00:13:31.410" style="s2">kind of developmental gatekeeping and</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.710" end="00:13:33.900" style="s2">the I think the effect that it is having</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.410" end="00:13:37.290" style="s2">on the present is that people are</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.900" end="00:13:39.240" style="s2">misunderstanding where we are in history</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.290" end="00:13:40.770" style="s2">that they are watching what is taking</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.240" end="00:13:43.110" style="s2">place in the street and almost always</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.770" end="00:13:45.570" style="s2">when I talk to people about it I have</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.110" end="00:13:47.340" style="s2">the sense that they are too calm because</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.570" end="00:13:49.860" style="s2">they think we are much earlier in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.340" end="00:13:53.520" style="s2">process than we actually are and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.860" end="00:13:56.580" style="s2">going on is that they are modeling the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.520" end="00:13:59.150" style="s2">idea of revolution based on what I would</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.580" end="00:14:02.280" style="s2">call a vertical revolution you know so</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.150" end="00:14:07.680" style="s2">Fidel Castro and Che Guevara and a small</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.280" end="00:14:09.120" style="s2">band of people team up and they reside</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.680" end="00:14:10.980" style="s2">in the hills and they come down and they</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.120" end="00:14:12.750" style="s2">make dramatic strikes and they win over</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.980" end="00:14:15.750" style="s2">the population and ultimately they</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.750" end="00:14:17.190" style="s2">topple the governmental structure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.750" end="00:14:19.140" style="s2">not the kind of revolution we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.190" end="00:14:22.590" style="s2">at the moment what we are facing is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.140" end="00:14:25.050" style="s2">horizontal resolution where ideas have</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.590" end="00:14:27.870" style="s2">been inserted into so many minds that</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.050" end="00:14:31.290" style="s2">exist in every organization that what</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.870" end="00:14:33.900" style="s2">we&#39;re going to see is instance after</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.290" end="00:14:35.700" style="s2">instance in which suddenly the thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.900" end="00:14:40.740" style="s2">awakens almost like a sleeper cell</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.700" end="00:14:45.720" style="s2">inside of every journalistic body inside</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.740" end="00:14:47.460" style="s2">every business inside every you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.720" end="00:14:49.920" style="s2">it&#39;s already been spotted in</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.460" end="00:14:52.340" style="s2">universities but the point is where</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.920" end="00:14:54.300" style="s2">isn&#39;t it in a position to take over</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.340" end="00:14:58.020" style="s2">frankly I think it&#39;s even in a position</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.300" end="00:15:01.110" style="s2">to take the presidency in two moves</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.020" end="00:15:02.190" style="s2">right I think that&#39;s coming do you do</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.110" end="00:15:04.980" style="s2">you want to speak to what those two</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.190" end="00:15:06.450" style="s2">moves are well sure I mean maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.980" end="00:15:09.540" style="s2">it has to be a little deeper down in our</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.450" end="00:15:12.300" style="s2">discussion of what&#39;s going on but if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.540" end="00:15:14.880" style="s2">imagine that you&#39;ve got this wrongheaded</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.300" end="00:15:16.470" style="s2">belief system unfalsifiable wrongheaded</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.880" end="00:15:18.270" style="s2">belief system so this is like a new</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.470" end="00:15:20.880" style="s2">religion it&#39;s a religion but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.270" end="00:15:22.260" style="s2">even have the claim on being valid by</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.880" end="00:15:25.230" style="s2">virtue of having stood the test of time</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.260" end="00:15:27.540" style="s2">this is brand new so it&#39;s myth it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.230" end="00:15:28.900" style="s2">mythology that&#39;s marching through every</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.540" end="00:15:32.020" style="s2">institution we</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.900" end="00:15:34.540" style="s2">when it becomes activated those who</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.020" end="00:15:36.640" style="s2">operate it are in a position to dictate</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.540" end="00:15:40.330" style="s2">terms to anybody who might resist and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.640" end="00:15:42.750" style="s2">each institution topples so that</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.330" end="00:15:46.450" style="s2">horizontal revolution is taking place</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.750" end="00:15:48.880" style="s2">because every individual is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.450" end="00:15:50.500" style="s2">faced with the same puzzle which is I am</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.880" end="00:15:52.350" style="s2">personally in jeopardy I&#39;m in no</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.500" end="00:15:56.050" style="s2">position to do anything that will</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.350" end="00:15:58.870" style="s2">effectively repel this onslaught but I</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.050" end="00:16:00.880" style="s2">am in a position to silence it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.870" end="00:16:02.950" style="s2">accusations against me for the moment by</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.880" end="00:16:05.710" style="s2">delivering some apology or offering it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.950" end="00:16:08.110" style="s2">something that it&#39;s demanding you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.710" end="00:16:10.300" style="s2">it will succeed in capturing more and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.110" end="00:16:13.420" style="s2">more people well but even even before</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.300" end="00:16:15.940" style="s2">that comes you have people who have</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.420" end="00:16:17.560" style="s2">legitimate grievances because as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.940" end="00:16:21.970" style="s2">talked about many and many previous</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.560" end="00:16:24.940" style="s2">episodes the you know beginning yes we</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.970" end="00:16:27.430" style="s2">as Gen Xers also inherited a moment when</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.940" end="00:16:29.230" style="s2">the economy was not booming particularly</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.430" end="00:16:31.330" style="s2">but not hmm</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.230" end="00:16:34.570" style="s2">Millennials inherited a worst moment by</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.330" end="00:16:37.840" style="s2">far and they&#39;re in debt and have low</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.570" end="00:16:39.280" style="s2">chance of getting real estate and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.840" end="00:16:40.480" style="s2">know having good health care and all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.280" end="00:16:43.270" style="s2">these things and so they have real</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.480" end="00:16:45.750" style="s2">grievances despite what some would say</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.270" end="00:16:49.230" style="s2">they actually have real grievances and</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.750" end="00:16:52.390" style="s2">they have been handed a pro forma</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.230" end="00:16:54.580" style="s2">explanation for what is it the base of</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.390" end="00:16:56.320" style="s2">those grievances even when the proform</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.580" end="00:16:59.170" style="s2">explanation actually would seem to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.320" end="00:17:00.490" style="s2">nothing to address any of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.170" end="00:17:02.710" style="s2">grievances they&#39;re out there but it</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.490" end="00:17:05.890" style="s2">feels righteous and honorable and</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.710" end="00:17:09.310" style="s2">finally a cause that they can get behind</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.890" end="00:17:12.040" style="s2">and feel good and like their lives have</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.310" end="00:17:14.740" style="s2">meaning for standing up for something</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.040" end="00:17:16.600" style="s2">and all of those things it&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.740" end="00:17:18.310" style="s2">perfect storm that gets people out on</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.600" end="00:17:20.830" style="s2">the streets especially after being in</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.310" end="00:17:23.620" style="s2">lockdown for months right and then once</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.830" end="00:17:25.240" style="s2">once they&#39;ve done it once they&#39;ve stood</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.620" end="00:17:28.300" style="s2">up and held a placard and shouted in</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.240" end="00:17:31.330" style="s2">March it&#39;s very much harder to say hmm</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.300" end="00:17:33.820" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s actually what I met</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.330" end="00:17:34.990" style="s2">or I&#39;m not sure that it is what it said</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.820" end="00:17:36.310" style="s2">it meant and therefore I&#39;m not sure that</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.990" end="00:17:39.250" style="s2">I should have stood up for that thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.310" end="00:17:42.610" style="s2">right yeah it&#39;s much harder once once</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.250" end="00:17:43.720" style="s2">you have stood stood with a movement</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.610" end="00:17:46.500" style="s2">to distance yourself from that movement</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.720" end="00:17:49.630" style="s2">and of course this is a long known</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.500" end="00:17:51.580" style="s2">psychological trick that is utilized by</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.630" end="00:17:56.409" style="s2">the most effective regimes that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.580" end="00:17:59.380" style="s2">don&#39;t that the thing that wishes you ill</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.409" end="00:18:01.539" style="s2">will ill does not tend to come down with</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.380" end="00:18:03.419" style="s2">a hammer and beat you up in front of</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.539" end="00:18:06.220" style="s2">your loved ones that&#39;s not how it&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.419" end="00:18:07.450" style="s2">it does so by incrementally changing</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.220" end="00:18:09.429" style="s2">what it is that you say that you believe</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.450" end="00:18:11.440" style="s2">such that incrementally you change what</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.429" end="00:18:13.870" style="s2">you do actually believe yeah it gets</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.440" end="00:18:15.610" style="s2">harder and harder to deprogram and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.870" end="00:18:17.799" style="s2">actually very much a cult phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.610" end="00:18:18.909" style="s2">right once you once you&#39;ve gotten in on</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.799" end="00:18:21.100" style="s2">the ground floor it&#39;s very hard to get</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.909" end="00:18:22.840" style="s2">out and you see this man this is why you</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.100" end="00:18:24.370" style="s2">know in the last episode I we were</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.840" end="00:18:27.669" style="s2">sharing those pictures that I had taken</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.370" end="00:18:29.830" style="s2">in Southwest Portland and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.669" end="00:18:31.419" style="s2">business that had its windows plastered</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.830" end="00:18:35.169" style="s2">you know that I call the don&#39;t hurt me</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.419" end="00:18:38.070" style="s2">wall well every probably fifth window in</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.169" end="00:18:40.059" style="s2">an area with apartment buildings and</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.070" end="00:18:42.279" style="s2">anything you know anything beyond just</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.059" end="00:18:44.110" style="s2">retail on the ground floor every fifth</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.279" end="00:18:47.049" style="s2">window or so has a black lives matter</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.110" end="00:18:49.750" style="s2">poster in it and if you say something</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.049" end="00:18:51.370" style="s2">about that to any random person on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.750" end="00:18:54.549" style="s2">street they are going to immediately</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.370" end="00:18:56.679" style="s2">conflate any critique of that suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.549" end="00:18:59.110" style="s2">groupthink with a critique of the very</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.679" end="00:19:00.820" style="s2">idea that lower case lower case lower</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.110" end="00:19:03.220" style="s2">case black lives matter of course they</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.820" end="00:19:05.529" style="s2">do yeah yeah we saw the same thing at</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.220" end="00:19:08.230" style="s2">Evergreen with the flyer gate scenario</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.529" end="00:19:10.630" style="s2">where the campus found itself actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.230" end="00:19:12.220" style="s2">publishing flyers that claimed white</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.630" end="00:19:13.720" style="s2">supremacy was widespread at Evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.220" end="00:19:15.760" style="s2">which it simply wasn&#39;t but everybody was</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.720" end="00:19:17.889" style="s2">putting them up doing you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.760" end="00:19:19.779" style="s2">advertising we&#39;re your friend and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.889" end="00:19:22.240" style="s2">point is that is actually evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.779" end="00:19:26.409" style="s2">how much power is gained very quickly by</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.240" end="00:19:28.529" style="s2">this horizontal revolution so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.409" end="00:19:31.779" style="s2">part that I think people don&#39;t get yet</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.529" end="00:19:33.880" style="s2">why is the Democratic Party playing ball</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.779" end="00:19:36.519" style="s2">all right it would seem that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.880" end="00:19:39.399" style="s2">Democratic Party ought to be attempting</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.519" end="00:19:41.440" style="s2">to establish some sort of reason and to</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.399" end="00:19:43.539" style="s2">calm the situation when in fact what</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.440" end="00:19:45.610" style="s2">it&#39;s doing is signing on to this very</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.539" end="00:19:48.760" style="s2">dangerous set of beliefs so before you</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.610" end="00:19:50.409" style="s2">go on why does it seem that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.760" end="00:19:53.169" style="s2">Democratic Party should be trying to</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.409" end="00:19:56.260" style="s2">calm the situation why would you that</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.169" end="00:19:56.710" style="s2">you just asserted that yeah and some you</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.260" end="00:19:57.909" style="s2">have some peep</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.710" end="00:20:00.220" style="s2">audience will say yeah like they should</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.909" end="00:20:01.330" style="s2">be obviously and some people will said</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.220" end="00:20:03.520" style="s2">well of course I&#39;ve never done it why</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.330" end="00:20:05.110" style="s2">would they so why why does it seem that</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.520" end="00:20:06.490" style="s2">they should be doing something that</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.110" end="00:20:07.450" style="s2">they&#39;re not before we get on to why</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.490" end="00:20:09.220" style="s2">they&#39;re doing the thing that they are</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.450" end="00:20:11.020" style="s2">well it seems that they should be</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.220" end="00:20:14.350" style="s2">because a large part of their natural</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.020" end="00:20:18.010" style="s2">constituency are white people who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.350" end="00:20:19.510" style="s2">actually guilty of racism and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.010" end="00:20:21.250" style="s2">need a defense and even if the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.510" end="00:20:22.929" style="s2">Democratic Party was being cynical you</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.250" end="00:20:24.669" style="s2">would think they would defend a large</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.929" end="00:20:26.320" style="s2">number of people in need of a defense</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.669" end="00:20:28.270" style="s2">and you know be trying to hold their</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.320" end="00:20:30.399" style="s2">coalition together which involves lots</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.270" end="00:20:32.049" style="s2">of people of color and lots of white</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.399" end="00:20:34.090" style="s2">people and just trying not to let that</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.049" end="00:20:37.630" style="s2">thing fray but here&#39;s what people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.090" end="00:20:40.570" style="s2">get first of all as I&#39;ve said elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.630" end="00:20:42.429" style="s2">these two parties are deeply corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.570" end="00:20:44.529" style="s2">they are both involved in intense</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.429" end="00:20:46.480" style="s2">influence peddling so policy does not</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.529" end="00:20:48.940" style="s2">mirror the needs of the population</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.480" end="00:20:50.230" style="s2">almost ever anymore in general it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.940" end="00:20:52.090" style="s2">serving some other interest in it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.230" end="00:20:53.890" style="s2">dressed up to look like it is for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.090" end="00:20:55.679" style="s2">people and therefore the people begin to</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.890" end="00:20:57.700" style="s2">detect that they are frozen out of</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.679" end="00:20:59.970" style="s2">well-being they get angry they spill</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.700" end="00:21:03.070" style="s2">into the streets now here&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.970" end="00:21:04.960" style="s2">the elites the economic elites who are</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.070" end="00:21:08.320" style="s2">represented by these two parties do not</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.960" end="00:21:10.840" style="s2">wish to share the well-being and</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.320" end="00:21:12.580" style="s2">opportunity that they are hoarding right</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.840" end="00:21:15.580" style="s2">they have hoarded these things that was</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.580" end="00:21:17.830" style="s2">the purpose of their investing in these</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.580" end="00:21:20.980" style="s2">corrupt entities and they don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.830" end="00:21:22.390" style="s2">share so what can they do well wait the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.980" end="00:21:23.980" style="s2">corrupt entities that you&#39;re referring</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.390" end="00:21:26.169" style="s2">to that the two parties has been</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.980" end="00:21:27.370" style="s2">invested well no the parties have</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.169" end="00:21:30.850" style="s2">invested in the corrupt entities I</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.370" end="00:21:34.120" style="s2">thought you said no parties have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.850" end="00:21:35.649" style="s2">racket the racket is to gain power by</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.120" end="00:21:38.020" style="s2">appealing to voters enough to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.649" end="00:21:40.149" style="s2">elected and then to peddle the influence</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.020" end="00:21:42.700" style="s2">that they win at the ballot box to their</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.149" end="00:21:46.720" style="s2">actual constituents which are powerful</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.700" end="00:21:48.399" style="s2">elites that keep the entities afloat so</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.720" end="00:21:50.529" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to share power</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.399" end="00:21:52.419" style="s2">they now have something that looks a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.529" end="00:21:54.669" style="s2">like the French Revolution in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.419" end="00:21:56.320" style="s2">streets and although various people at</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.669" end="00:21:57.970" style="s2">the New York Times may think that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.320" end="00:21:59.470" style="s2">those of us who know anything about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.970" end="00:22:01.840" style="s2">French Revolution know how dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.470" end="00:22:04.299" style="s2">this is so what are they going to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.840" end="00:22:06.880" style="s2">well they&#39;re not going to share what</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.299" end="00:22:10.490" style="s2">they&#39;ve hoarded and the street isn&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.880" end="00:22:12.440" style="s2">a and a mindset to to wait any longer</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.490" end="00:22:16.940" style="s2">right it&#39;s boiled over enough is enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.440" end="00:22:20.090" style="s2">so what&#39;s happened is the blue corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.940" end="00:22:22.309" style="s2">entity has decided in time but not the</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.090" end="00:22:24.350" style="s2">police the Democrats yes the democratic</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.309" end="00:22:26.420" style="s2">party sorry blue versus red the blue</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.350" end="00:22:29.480" style="s2">corrupt entity has come up with a plan</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.420" end="00:22:31.520" style="s2">which is they are going to divert the</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.480" end="00:22:33.320" style="s2">resent the resentment that naturally</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.520" end="00:22:35.090" style="s2">should go to them for hoarding the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.320" end="00:22:37.360" style="s2">opportunity in the first place they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.090" end="00:22:40.429" style="s2">going to redirect that resentment at</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.360" end="00:22:42.440" style="s2">people who superficially can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.429" end="00:22:44.270" style="s2">demonized if you imagine that racism is</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.440" end="00:22:45.320" style="s2">in every whitehead and there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.270" end="00:22:47.660" style="s2">that can be done about it and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.320" end="00:22:49.490" style="s2">pervades the thoughts of white people</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.660" end="00:22:51.230" style="s2">and is therefore in every interaction</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.490" end="00:22:53.900" style="s2">and every decision and all of those</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.230" end="00:22:56.150" style="s2">things then you might say yeah it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.900" end="00:22:58.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the reason that we&#39;re we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.150" end="00:23:00.890" style="s2">succeeding is that those people are</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.880" end="00:23:02.960" style="s2">always having racist thoughts that they</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.890" end="00:23:04.700" style="s2">never voice but nonetheless it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.960" end="00:23:06.410" style="s2">the reason that we can&#39;t get anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.700" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">rather than somebody took all of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.410" end="00:23:10.429" style="s2">opportunity and frankly the whole</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:13.309" style="s2">population of normal people is suffering</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.429" end="00:23:16.550" style="s2">from the reduction in available</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.309" end="00:23:18.890" style="s2">opportunity but by redirecting the anger</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.550" end="00:23:20.390" style="s2">of people who can identify that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.890" end="00:23:23.000" style="s2">actually on the list of people who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.390" end="00:23:25.400" style="s2">going to get something right they can</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.000" end="00:23:27.080" style="s2">the elites can stave off the French</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.400" end="00:23:28.190" style="s2">Revolution coming for them in other</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.080" end="00:23:29.960" style="s2">words they&#39;re going to redirect the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.190" end="00:23:31.820" style="s2">French Revolution at somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.960" end="00:23:34.910" style="s2">somebody who can&#39;t defend themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.820" end="00:23:41.420" style="s2">that&#39;s white people of regular means so</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.910" end="00:23:44.480" style="s2">that thing is yet one more ploy to to</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.420" end="00:23:46.460" style="s2">prevent the actual reckoning that comes</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.480" end="00:23:49.059" style="s2">from hoarding all of the opportunity but</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.460" end="00:23:52.420" style="s2">what it means in this case the two-step</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.059" end="00:23:55.610" style="s2">plan to take the white house we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.420" end="00:23:59.660" style="s2">not your plan oh and our plan their plan</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.610" end="00:24:02.360" style="s2">their plan in is going to involve this</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.660" end="00:24:04.400" style="s2">old codger that they have set up for</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.360" end="00:24:06.980" style="s2">nomination decrepit Klan Biden the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.400" end="00:24:10.160" style="s2">decrepit clown Joe Biden is of course</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.980" end="00:24:11.809" style="s2">going to nominate Camilla Harris as VP</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.160" end="00:24:13.880" style="s2">because of course it&#39;s That moment when</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.809" end="00:24:16.250" style="s2">certain demographic parameters have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.880" end="00:24:18.950" style="s2">be met Kamala Harris is like the living</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.250" end="00:24:20.809" style="s2">breathing DNC that&#39;s what she is and</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.950" end="00:24:22.280" style="s2">then DNC being the Democratic National</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.809" end="00:24:23.809" style="s2">the Democratic National Committee which</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.280" end="00:24:24.440" style="s2">is different than the party many of us</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.809" end="00:24:25.990" style="s2">are still member</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.440" end="00:24:30.170" style="s2">the party but anybody with half a brain</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.990" end="00:24:34.280" style="s2">has no tolerance for what the DNC has</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.170" end="00:24:36.860" style="s2">done to the party but Kamala Harris ends</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.280" end="00:24:38.780" style="s2">up on the ticket maybe Joe Biden wins</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.860" end="00:24:42.650" style="s2">because people are so fed up with Trump</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.780" end="00:24:44.810" style="s2">which they are and then Joe Biden steps</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.650" end="00:24:47.990" style="s2">down at some point right</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.810" end="00:24:50.720" style="s2">Kamala Harris then would be president by</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.990" end="00:24:53.480" style="s2">virtue of having been brought on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.720" end="00:24:56.210" style="s2">ticket for symbolic largely symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.480" end="00:24:59.210" style="s2">reasons it&#39;s not like people are wildly</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.210" end="00:25:01.130" style="s2">in favor of her and then there it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.210" end="00:25:02.420" style="s2">then the intersectional madness has made</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.130" end="00:25:04.910" style="s2">a deal with somebody who would inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.420" end="00:25:06.110" style="s2">the role of the president now of course</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.910" end="00:25:10.550" style="s2">there is another way this could all go</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.110" end="00:25:12.170" style="s2">down which is that the white folks who</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.550" end="00:25:14.450" style="s2">understand that they have been targeted</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.170" end="00:25:16.430" style="s2">in a way that would traditionally have</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.450" end="00:25:18.080" style="s2">been pointed at Jews maybe but in this</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.430" end="00:25:21.740" style="s2">case it&#39;s going to be white folks writ</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.080" end="00:25:24.080" style="s2">large they may decide not to let this</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.740" end="00:25:26.030" style="s2">happen and my biggest fear is I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.080" end="00:25:28.730" style="s2">saying I went back and found a video on</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.030" end="00:25:30.410" style="s2">my channel that I&#39;d put out in 2019</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.730" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2">saying look they&#39;re gonna conjure</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.410" end="00:25:34.760" style="s2">exactly the white supremacist demon that</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:36.350" style="s2">they claim to be fighting right now by</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.760" end="00:25:39.200" style="s2">backing white people against the wall</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.350" end="00:25:42.410" style="s2">and getting them to identify as some</p>

<p begin="00:25:42.410" end="00:25:51.200" style="s2">it&#39;s going to push more such people into</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.230" end="00:25:53.750" style="s2">voting for Trump in November and those</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.200" end="00:25:56.840" style="s2">that demographic shift will be observed</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.750" end="00:25:59.360" style="s2">in the in the voting polls presumably</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.840" end="00:26:03.620" style="s2">and that will be trotted out as evidence</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.360" end="00:26:05.210" style="s2">that the only reason to vote for Trump</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.620" end="00:26:08.630" style="s2">in the first place was because you were</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.210" end="00:26:10.450" style="s2">racist all along so it is this they are</p>

<p begin="00:26:15.370" end="00:26:23.930" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s it&#39;s clear to me that what</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.720" end="00:26:26.120" style="s2">needs to happen is voices of reason who</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.930" end="00:26:28.190" style="s2">get the nuance here it&#39;s not that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.120" end="00:26:30.860" style="s2">resentment isn&#39;t real and it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.190" end="00:26:32.270" style="s2">the gripe isn&#39;t well-founded it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.860" end="00:26:34.160" style="s2">well-founded but it is not well</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.270" end="00:26:37.440" style="s2">articulated and the proposals that are</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.160" end="00:26:39.760" style="s2">being suggested are</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.440" end="00:26:41.440" style="s2">insane I mean it&#39;s hard to give them</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:43.660" style="s2">more credit than that they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.440" end="00:26:45.940" style="s2">literally insane proposals that nobody</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.660" end="00:26:47.590" style="s2">who had ever run anything of any size</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.940" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">could possibly imagine we&#39;re going to</p>

<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:53.700" style="s2">all right society evaporating is going</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.429" end="00:26:56.530" style="s2">to be a disaster for all of us so</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.700" end="00:26:58.660" style="s2">somebody needs to step in and speak to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.530" end="00:27:01.000" style="s2">the movement about what it is that has</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.660" end="00:27:03.179" style="s2">them angry and what actual remedies</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.000" end="00:27:05.350" style="s2">might look like which does involve</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.179" end="00:27:06.610" style="s2">taking a good look at the elites who</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.350" end="00:27:08.410" style="s2">have hoarded the opportunity and</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.610" end="00:27:11.830" style="s2">figuring out what to do to bry it loose</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.410" end="00:27:12.940" style="s2">from them mm-hmm so you said that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.830" end="00:27:15.820" style="s2">actually I&#39;m not sure to pronounce her</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.940" end="00:27:18.730" style="s2">name I thought it was Kamala Harris but</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.820" end="00:27:20.440" style="s2">you said that she is the living</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.730" end="00:27:25.419" style="s2">breathing embodiment of the DNC I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.440" end="00:27:26.830" style="s2">and I&#39;m wondering what that surprises me</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.419" end="00:27:28.660" style="s2">a little bit because she strikes me as</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.830" end="00:27:30.460" style="s2">sort of half the living breathing a body</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.660" end="00:27:33.700" style="s2">man at the DNC but I admit that I have</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.460" end="00:27:35.710" style="s2">probably a very shaky understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.700" end="00:27:37.450" style="s2">exactly what that is I feel like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.710" end="00:27:40.179" style="s2">change during the Clinton era quite</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.450" end="00:27:42.790" style="s2">substantially and you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.179" end="00:27:45.010" style="s2">Clinton one era in the 90s but that</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.790" end="00:27:46.600" style="s2">she&#39;s equally and you know this is these</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.010" end="00:27:49.150" style="s2">are coming to converge on one eye there</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.600" end="00:27:52.510" style="s2">but that she is equally embedded in woke</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.150" end="00:27:55.059" style="s2">intersectional ideology and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.510" end="00:27:57.700" style="s2">DNC has come to adopt that as one of its</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.059" end="00:28:00.820" style="s2">foundational planks but it wasn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.700" end="00:28:03.610" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the platform at least until</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.820" end="00:28:05.799" style="s2">recently this is exactly what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.610" end="00:28:08.020" style="s2">okay I don&#39;t believe that this is I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.799" end="00:28:09.929" style="s2">who&#39;s to even say you can&#39;t detect the</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.020" end="00:28:12.160" style="s2">difference between genuine</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.929" end="00:28:14.620" style="s2">intersectional misunderstanding and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.160" end="00:28:18.309" style="s2">cynical embrace of intersectional ism</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.620" end="00:28:21.490" style="s2">because it advances your your ball but</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.309" end="00:28:25.360" style="s2">what she is is the it&#39;s the Chimera</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.490" end="00:28:27.250" style="s2">right you have the DNC serves to it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:30.340" style="s2">the center of the influence-peddling</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.250" end="00:28:34.390" style="s2">operation and therefore the blue half of</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.340" end="00:28:36.940" style="s2">that I&#39;ll wrap the blue racquet yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.390" end="00:28:39.820" style="s2">the blue racquet is run through the DNC</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.940" end="00:28:41.260" style="s2">the DNC therefore has to figure out some</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.820" end="00:28:43.270" style="s2">sort of you know is there enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.260" end="00:28:44.590" style="s2">symbolism that we can hand people that</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.270" end="00:28:46.120" style="s2">will keep them voting for us so that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.590" end="00:28:47.740" style="s2">have influence that we can peddle that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.120" end="00:28:50.050" style="s2">the game right</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.740" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">well oh the symbolism thing has now run</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.050" end="00:28:51.990" style="s2">out on them</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:53.220" style="s2">gonna have to give them something real</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.990" end="00:28:55.140" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have to give them something</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.220" end="00:28:56.760" style="s2">that tastes like food and well-being</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.140" end="00:28:58.500" style="s2">where are we gonna get that if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.760" end="00:29:00.780" style="s2">willing to share what we have and what</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.500" end="00:29:02.250" style="s2">our constituents have hoarded we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.780" end="00:29:04.020" style="s2">gonna have to look at somebody else who</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.250" end="00:29:06.060" style="s2">can&#39;t defend theirs and feed that to</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.020" end="00:29:08.850" style="s2">them and so this is this I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.060" end="00:29:11.010" style="s2">actually back to Asher&#39;s point about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.850" end="00:29:13.640" style="s2">entire ideology one of creating an</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.010" end="00:29:16.140" style="s2">us-versus-them dynamic of creating</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.640" end="00:29:18.540" style="s2">victims and victimizers oppressed and</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.140" end="00:29:20.640" style="s2">oppressors that this is this is an easy</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.540" end="00:29:22.710" style="s2">way to rile people up and to get people</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.640" end="00:29:24.930" style="s2">motivated out on the streets out to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.710" end="00:29:26.880" style="s2">polls you know you&#39;re on the right side</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.930" end="00:29:29.070" style="s2">of history you know they&#39;re not you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.880" end="00:29:31.350" style="s2">to get rid of those people because they</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.070" end="00:29:33.870" style="s2">are evil well there are two things here</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.350" end="00:29:36.060" style="s2">yes that&#39;s the sense right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.870" end="00:29:37.170" style="s2">more honorable sense but the real I</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.060" end="00:29:39.030" style="s2">think that&#39;s there&#39;s nothing honorable</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.170" end="00:29:39.540" style="s2">about that at all it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.030" end="00:29:43.710" style="s2">honorable</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.540" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">but it&#39;s the more honor occasion so my</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.710" end="00:29:47.760" style="s2">point would be look the reason I invoke</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:50.040" style="s2">Jews here is that because of the nature</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.760" end="00:29:52.740" style="s2">of the Jewish Diaspora because you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.040" end="00:29:55.020" style="s2">a small population that does well but</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.740" end="00:29:57.330" style="s2">tends to live amongst people to whom it</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.020" end="00:29:58.040" style="s2">is less well related than Jews are to</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.330" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.040" end="00:30:04.110" style="s2">you can always when things go wrong</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:06.270" style="s2">point to the Jews and you can say they</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.110" end="00:30:08.880" style="s2">are the problem now are the Jews really</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.270" end="00:30:11.660" style="s2">the problem no but that doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.880" end="00:30:14.490" style="s2">because if you&#39;re really willing to</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.660" end="00:30:15.240" style="s2">steal what they have and hand it to</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.490" end="00:30:17.700" style="s2">somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.240" end="00:30:20.010" style="s2">it&#39;s a classic transfer frontier to use</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.700" end="00:30:21.690" style="s2">our language right it&#39;s a it&#39;s a source</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.010" end="00:30:24.330" style="s2">for something that feels like growth</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.690" end="00:30:25.710" style="s2">that you can hand to somebody else to</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.330" end="00:30:28.650" style="s2">placate them and my point is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.710" end="00:30:30.690" style="s2">always cynical garbage in this case</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.650" end="00:30:33.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a twist which is that you have</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.690" end="00:30:35.430" style="s2">an intersectional coalition this is not</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.210" end="00:30:37.650" style="s2">a natural coalition it is a it is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.430" end="00:30:41.520" style="s2">synthetic coalition that is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.650" end="00:30:46.470" style="s2">fed the well-being of a natural entity</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.520" end="00:30:49.710" style="s2">right European Americans now</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.470" end="00:30:51.809" style="s2">the point is that actually from the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.710" end="00:30:54.389" style="s2">point of view of solving the problem</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.809" end="00:30:55.950" style="s2">that the influence-peddling rackets face</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.389" end="00:30:58.200" style="s2">if you try to put yourself in their</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.950" end="00:31:01.289" style="s2">mindset right how do we keep this going</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.200" end="00:31:05.850" style="s2">for another electoral cycle right this</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.289" end="00:31:08.759" style="s2">is a plan and it&#39;s a disastrous plan it</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.850" end="00:31:12.870" style="s2">we&#39;ve already said it is the uninvent of</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.759" end="00:31:15.690" style="s2">America but would it work to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.870" end="00:31:18.330" style="s2">the blue racket going it might and</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.690" end="00:31:19.620" style="s2">that&#39;s a very frightening prospect you</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.330" end="00:31:22.169" style="s2">know this strikes me what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.620" end="00:31:25.009" style="s2">about what the what the Democratic Party</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.169" end="00:31:28.039" style="s2">is becoming this sort of assortment of</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.009" end="00:31:30.240" style="s2">loosely associated interest groups is</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.039" end="00:31:31.860" style="s2">exactly what we used to say about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.240" end="00:31:34.350" style="s2">Republican Party when you know when we</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.860" end="00:31:36.809" style="s2">were coming of age in the 80s and 90s</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.350" end="00:31:39.840" style="s2">that this was it didn&#39;t it didn&#39;t appear</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.809" end="00:31:43.830" style="s2">to be or an organic grouping of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.840" end="00:31:46.019" style="s2">of like mind or particularly like values</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.830" end="00:31:48.870" style="s2">but rather you had you know the the</p>

<p begin="00:31:54.539" end="00:31:59.190" style="s2">particularly cohere and it sounds to me</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.179" end="00:32:01.710" style="s2">like what we&#39;re seeing in part and I</p>

<p begin="00:35:48.570" end="00:35:53.010" style="s2">this the bust of him had all of those</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.330" end="00:35:55.140" style="s2">things but the very first thing that it</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.010" end="00:35:57.810" style="s2">had on the on the statue in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.140" end="00:35:59.220" style="s2">what he did was welder and I hope I have</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.810" end="00:36:00.720" style="s2">in this right I hope I have which trade</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.220" end="00:36:04.530" style="s2">it was which all these other things were</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.720" end="00:36:06.420" style="s2">but I come in as a Toby our son this</p>

<p begin="00:36:08.100" end="00:36:13.470" style="s2">and wonderful that they chose to point</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.190" end="00:36:15.270" style="s2">out first and maybe was blacksmith like</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.470" end="00:36:17.910" style="s2">I can&#39;t remember you know that they</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.270" end="00:36:20.430" style="s2">chose first and foremost to identify the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.910" end="00:36:22.440" style="s2">trade that he was skilled in before</p>

<p begin="00:36:22.440" end="00:36:26.880" style="s2">are why his bust is here you know if he</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.720" end="00:36:28.950" style="s2">had just been a blacksmith or weld or</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.880" end="00:36:30.540" style="s2">whatever it was that he was doing he</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.950" end="00:36:33.480" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have a statue in front of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.540" end="00:36:36.000" style="s2">courthouse right yeah but I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.480" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">that had he not had that background in</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.000" end="00:36:39.870" style="s2">the trade that he did he also wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.640" end="00:36:41.460" style="s2">have his bust in front in that</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.870" end="00:36:44.790" style="s2">courthouse because he wouldn&#39;t have the</p>

<p begin="00:36:44.790" end="00:36:50.100" style="s2">gave him in order to do good in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.460" end="00:36:53.280" style="s2">world later yeah an incredible amount of</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.100" end="00:36:54.930" style="s2">what&#39;s true is also counterintuitive to</p>

<p begin="00:37:00.510" end="00:37:05.220" style="s2">forced to it by the fact that the system</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.790" end="00:37:07.950" style="s2">isn&#39;t listening to clever arguments it</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.220" end="00:37:11.750" style="s2">just works or doesn&#39;t and so yes you and</p>

<p begin="00:38:13.119" end="00:38:17.439" style="s2">first I&#39;m hearing about it</p>

<p begin="00:38:53.019" end="00:38:59.679" style="s2">premise of the piece is that her work</p>

<p begin="00:38:59.679" end="00:39:04.979" style="s2">she shot Andy Warhol now I should say</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.439" end="00:39:08.049" style="s2">she shot Andy Warhol multiple times</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.979" end="00:39:11.619" style="s2">premeditated murder and or would have</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.049" end="00:39:15.579" style="s2">been attempted murder he survived but</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.619" end="00:39:17.949" style="s2">was desperately injured now the work</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.579" end="00:39:20.619" style="s2">that this author at the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.949" end="00:39:22.900" style="s2">is claiming is overshadowed is a work in</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.619" end="00:39:23.439" style="s2">which he advocates the killing of all</p>

<p begin="00:39:23.439" end="00:39:29.670" style="s2">now many people took this to be ironic</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.049" end="00:39:32.920" style="s2">apparently she insisted it was literal</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.670" end="00:39:35.319" style="s2">so my point is it is impossible for this</p>

<p begin="00:39:35.319" end="00:39:39.900" style="s2">Warhol to have her high quality work</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.900" end="00:39:41.400" style="s2">overshadowed if the point of that work</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.900" end="00:39:44.339" style="s2">is actually perfectly consistent with</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.400" end="00:39:48.029" style="s2">the murder that she attempted but from</p>

<p begin="00:40:40.859" end="00:40:45.510" style="s2">for the first time here&#39;s a sentence in</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.619" end="00:40:48.359" style="s2">the early part of this obut the</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.510" end="00:40:50.160" style="s2">manifesto self published in 1967 reads</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.359" end="00:40:53.460" style="s2">as satire the Solanas defendant is</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.160" end="00:40:55.920" style="s2">serious this sounds exactly like we</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.460" end="00:40:58.140" style="s2">don&#39;t really mean defund the police well</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.920" end="00:41:00.660" style="s2">and in fact this is exactly what Ezra</p>

<p begin="00:41:00.660" end="00:41:04.740" style="s2">about was that Ezra Klein swore that</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.520" end="00:41:07.710" style="s2">when the New York Times published kill</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.740" end="00:41:09.839" style="s2">all men that that was meant to be taken</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.710" end="00:41:11.309" style="s2">ironically and the point is was it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.839" end="00:41:12.779" style="s2">partially it&#39;s meant to be taken</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.309" end="00:41:15.029" style="s2">ironically if you&#39;re gonna be a stickler</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.779" end="00:41:16.319" style="s2">about how ugly a thought that is and</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.029" end="00:41:17.430" style="s2">then if you&#39;re not going to say anything</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.319" end="00:41:19.559" style="s2">then maybe it&#39;s not to be taken</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.430" end="00:41:22.529" style="s2">ironically do you think that in Jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.559" end="00:41:27.119" style="s2">Swift&#39;s era people any anyone thought</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.529" end="00:41:30.630" style="s2">that he was serious I mean isn&#39;t it in</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.119" end="00:41:32.309" style="s2">order to count as satire don&#39;t the vast</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.630" end="00:41:34.650" style="s2">majority of people who read the thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.309" end="00:41:36.059" style="s2">have to recognize it as satire actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.650" end="00:41:38.420" style="s2">there should be some standard like that</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.059" end="00:41:41.849" style="s2">we have lost the ability and I have as</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.420" end="00:41:43.440" style="s2">my followers on Twitter know had to</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.849" end="00:41:44.849" style="s2">hard-code a solution to this problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.440" end="00:41:47.069" style="s2">because there&#39;s nothing I can say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.849" end="00:41:49.470" style="s2">so insane that people will understand me</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.069" end="00:41:51.119" style="s2">not to be speaking seriously so I use</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.470" end="00:41:52.619" style="s2">the emoji to do that but yeah yeah there</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.119" end="00:41:53.680" style="s2">should be some standard about either</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.619" end="00:41:57.339" style="s2">your satire is</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.680" end="00:41:59.530" style="s2">complete failure or it isn&#39;t satire if</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.339" end="00:42:01.869" style="s2">some fraction of the population takes it</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.530" end="00:42:04.000" style="s2">as serious on yeah first read well it</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.869" end="00:42:05.859" style="s2">also omits it&#39;s totally illegitimate if</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.000" end="00:42:07.660" style="s2">the author themselves says it&#39;s serious</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.859" end="00:42:10.270" style="s2">and other people are saying no no no she</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.660" end="00:42:12.160" style="s2">she doesn&#39;t really mean it it&#39;s satire</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.270" end="00:42:14.260" style="s2">well then well then no right actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.160" end="00:42:15.880" style="s2">then no and in this case it turns out at</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.260" end="00:42:19.180" style="s2">the very last line of the piece you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.880" end="00:42:21.730" style="s2">find out that maybe it was satire but</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.180" end="00:42:25.930" style="s2">that the person the the author of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.730" end="00:42:28.270" style="s2">scum manifesto acknowledged that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.930" end="00:42:30.099" style="s2">it was satire that instead of actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.270" end="00:42:32.200" style="s2">killing all men what she wanted to do I</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.099" end="00:42:33.760" style="s2">think should be neutered or castrated so</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.200" end="00:42:37.059" style="s2">they can&#39;t mess up any more women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.760" end="00:42:39.760" style="s2">lives right so the point here is not</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.059" end="00:42:42.520" style="s2">really about the author of this gun</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.760" end="00:42:45.730" style="s2">manifesto or even of the author of this</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.520" end="00:42:47.440" style="s2">late obituary it is about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.730" end="00:42:49.630" style="s2">at the New York Times this apparently</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.440" end="00:42:52.270" style="s2">passes for journalism and it reports</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.630" end="00:42:54.760" style="s2">that these ideas are not just something</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.270" end="00:42:56.230" style="s2">wrong headed in the mind of one author</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.760" end="00:42:59.410" style="s2">at the New York Times that they are</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.230" end="00:43:01.900" style="s2">apparently now in Gender Studies classes</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.410" end="00:43:03.309" style="s2">in American universities with no</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.900" end="00:43:06.750" style="s2">apparent irony so that&#39;s where we are</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.309" end="00:43:09.130" style="s2">that&#39;s the horizontal nasai dia has</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.750" end="00:43:11.380" style="s2">obviously begun to take over</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.130" end="00:43:13.359" style="s2">universities and the same people who are</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.380" end="00:43:16.089" style="s2">saying white supremacy is everywhere are</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.359" end="00:43:17.650" style="s2">also taking seriously the idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.089" end="00:43:20.260" style="s2">should be thinking about castrating men</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.650" end="00:43:21.790" style="s2">are killing them I don&#39;t I mean I guess</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.260" end="00:43:24.819" style="s2">the only thing I take issue with there</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.790" end="00:43:26.530" style="s2">is the idea that it&#39;s begun to take over</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.819" end="00:43:28.599" style="s2">universities I mean you and I were</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.530" end="00:43:32.319" style="s2">seeing this in the early nineties yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.599" end="00:43:34.660" style="s2">we were seeing nonsense not at this</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.319" end="00:43:38.980" style="s2">level you know not not scum manifesto</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.660" end="00:43:44.380" style="s2">level explicitly but really batshit</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.980" end="00:43:46.869" style="s2">loony undefensible unscholarly on</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.380" end="00:43:49.690" style="s2">analytical nonsense being trotted out as</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.869" end="00:43:51.630" style="s2">if it made sense and this was before the</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.690" end="00:43:53.650" style="s2">advent of filling the X Studies</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.630" end="00:43:55.210" style="s2">departments right those those fields</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.650" end="00:43:56.890" style="s2">didn&#39;t even exist yet yeah they started</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.210" end="00:44:00.309" style="s2">to proliferate in the sort of the mid</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.890" end="00:44:01.359" style="s2">and late 90s so I mean this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.309" end="00:44:03.970" style="s2">the thing that people have been saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.359" end="00:44:04.960" style="s2">to us since evergreen blow-up from</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.970" end="00:44:06.010" style="s2">before even when we were having</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.960" end="00:44:06.819" style="s2">conversations with people before</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.010" end="00:44:09.009" style="s2">evergreen blue</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.819" end="00:44:12.160" style="s2">for it was public I was like yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.009" end="00:44:15.489" style="s2">it&#39;s isolated it won&#39;t spread it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.160" end="00:44:17.140" style="s2">big deal and and of course it was</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.489" end="00:44:18.789" style="s2">already spreading because those people</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.140" end="00:44:20.679" style="s2">graduate and they don&#39;t stay on call it</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.789" end="00:44:22.769" style="s2">on college campuses forever so on some</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.679" end="00:44:26.529" style="s2">of them do and so as you&#39;ve pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.769" end="00:44:28.390" style="s2">for years now the people that we were</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.529" end="00:44:29.979" style="s2">encountering in the 90s had a generation</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.390" end="00:44:32.650" style="s2">of students that are now the professors</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.979" end="00:44:34.869" style="s2">of today and so anyway the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.650" end="00:44:37.989" style="s2">matured and developed because we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.869" end="00:44:41.799" style="s2">given it a hibernaculum or I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.989" end="00:44:43.929" style="s2">some place to to to wait out those years</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.799" end="00:44:46.119" style="s2">in part I mean academics are so insular</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.929" end="00:44:47.529" style="s2">and so you know always feeling so</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.119" end="00:44:49.059" style="s2">overworked and you know that&#39;s it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.529" end="00:44:51.059" style="s2">to laugh at but you know if you really</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.059" end="00:44:53.529" style="s2">are trying to do good deep work</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.059" end="00:44:55.089" style="s2">constantly having demands on you for</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.529" end="00:44:57.130" style="s2">governance and sit on this meeting and</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.089" end="00:44:58.569" style="s2">that committee is burdensome and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.130" end="00:45:01.269" style="s2">scientists in particular and I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.569" end="00:45:04.599" style="s2">artists also but really all good</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.269" end="00:45:06.549" style="s2">academics do tend to as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.599" end="00:45:09.160" style="s2">ignore the stuff going on at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.549" end="00:45:10.539" style="s2">university that doesn&#39;t seem to apply</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.160" end="00:45:12.939" style="s2">directly to them unless they are</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.539" end="00:45:14.709" style="s2">absolutely forced to by the demands of</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.939" end="00:45:15.759" style="s2">their job you know you have to spend 25</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.709" end="00:45:17.229" style="s2">percent of your time on governance so</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.759" end="00:45:18.369" style="s2">you have to attend these eight meetings</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.229" end="00:45:20.019" style="s2">a year and they do that and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.369" end="00:45:22.150" style="s2">done and they just check it off and they</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.019" end="00:45:24.689" style="s2">don&#39;t think more about it and so the</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.150" end="00:45:28.089" style="s2">sort of ostrich head in the sand thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.689" end="00:45:29.890" style="s2">is in part because you know when they</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.089" end="00:45:31.749" style="s2">when someone pops their head up on some</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.890" end="00:45:34.449" style="s2">island goes wait what is happening now</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.749" end="00:45:37.239" style="s2">in terms of administrative bloat and</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.449" end="00:45:39.189" style="s2">changes in policy with regard to who</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.239" end="00:45:41.529" style="s2">gets graded how and what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.189" end="00:45:42.819" style="s2">departments are being created oh boy I</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.529" end="00:45:45.039" style="s2">don&#39;t even know I&#39;m just gonna go back</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.819" end="00:45:47.199" style="s2">to my research and you know that is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.039" end="00:45:50.709" style="s2">is part and then especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.199" end="00:45:52.869" style="s2">sciences that&#39;s allowed by the admitted</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.709" end="00:45:54.640" style="s2">the old fashioned administrators because</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.869" end="00:45:56.349" style="s2">scientists are paying for the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.640" end="00:45:57.519" style="s2">universities largely through the through</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.349" end="00:45:59.949" style="s2">the grants that they&#39;re getting right</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.519" end="00:46:02.049" style="s2">the forty to eighty percent in overhead</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.949" end="00:46:04.329" style="s2">that every NSF grant an NIH grant that</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.049" end="00:46:06.699" style="s2">comes in goes directly to the University</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.329" end="00:46:08.439" style="s2">well let&#39;s not hassle those those nice</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.699" end="00:46:10.029" style="s2">lab scientists who need lots of</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.439" end="00:46:12.999" style="s2">expensive machines and so need lots of</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.029" end="00:46:14.469" style="s2">expensive grants and just let them do</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.999" end="00:46:15.669" style="s2">what they do and don&#39;t bother them with</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.469" end="00:46:17.979" style="s2">the fact that the universities being</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.669" end="00:46:19.310" style="s2">taken over by a bunch of loons yes that</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.979" end="00:46:22.490" style="s2">was six weeks ago</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.310" end="00:46:26.090" style="s2">now so three years ago this matured</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.490" end="00:46:27.470" style="s2">early at Evergreen and the we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.090" end="00:46:31.010" style="s2">have departments but we had the</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.470" end="00:46:32.750" style="s2">equivalent of the various theory and</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.010" end="00:46:34.730" style="s2">Studies departments and they began</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.750" end="00:46:36.920" style="s2">dictating terms to the sciences that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.730" end="00:46:39.980" style="s2">and people like you and me you and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.920" end="00:46:41.480" style="s2">stood up and the rest is history on that</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.980" end="00:46:43.940" style="s2">front but the point is that thing has</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.480" end="00:46:45.560" style="s2">now come to every other university and</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.940" end="00:46:47.360" style="s2">those departments are now dictating</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.560" end="00:46:49.910" style="s2">terms to the sciences they have the</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.360" end="00:46:51.440" style="s2">administrators on board because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.910" end="00:46:53.480" style="s2">know that administrators actually have</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.440" end="00:46:55.910" style="s2">thoughts but to the extent that they</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.480" end="00:46:57.290" style="s2">have something like them these people</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.910" end="00:46:59.450" style="s2">are simply looking out for their own</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.290" end="00:47:01.370" style="s2">well-being and so they&#39;ll feed anybody</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.450" end="00:47:03.140" style="s2">to the Wolves that they have - including</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.370" end="00:47:05.930" style="s2">now the sciences but it was happening</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.140" end="00:47:07.970" style="s2">before well it was beginning to but my</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.930" end="00:47:11.350" style="s2">point about the horizontal nosov this</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.970" end="00:47:14.810" style="s2">revolution is it&#39;s like you had some</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.350" end="00:47:16.670" style="s2">group of people that gathered until some</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.810" end="00:47:18.560" style="s2">point and spoke to each other in some</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.670" end="00:47:20.810" style="s2">way that was recognizable and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.560" end="00:47:22.820" style="s2">suddenly on some day the recognition</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.810" end="00:47:26.360" style="s2">Dawn&#39;s we actually now have the power</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.820" end="00:47:28.610" style="s2">that we can take this body over and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.360" end="00:47:31.010" style="s2">actually can we M maybe before we do</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.610" end="00:47:33.920" style="s2">this can you find a it was too late to</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.010" end="00:47:35.900" style="s2">get Zak a link but there&#39;s a new piece</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.920" end="00:47:41.930" style="s2">in the Atlantic a short piece by Yasha</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.900" end="00:47:43.730" style="s2">monk that Sam Harris tweeted out anyway</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.930" end="00:47:47.780" style="s2">this piece is quite good I highly</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.730" end="00:47:49.880" style="s2">recommend it and what it details yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.780" end="00:47:53.630" style="s2">that&#39;s it that top ones about firing the</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.880" end="00:47:58.100" style="s2">incent okay not yet Zak so this piece</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.630" end="00:48:01.070" style="s2">details three cases in which people have</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.100" end="00:48:02.960" style="s2">recently been terminated from their</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.070" end="00:48:05.360" style="s2">employment these are not people who are</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.960" end="00:48:07.040" style="s2">in a good position to construct</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.360" end="00:48:10.490" style="s2">something else to take care of their</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.040" end="00:48:11.960" style="s2">needs three people who were fired who on</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.490" end="00:48:14.930" style="s2">inspection of their story there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.960" end="00:48:17.690" style="s2">nothing to it and some corporate entity</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.930" end="00:48:20.120" style="s2">just decided to do the expedient thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.690" end="00:48:21.470" style="s2">and kowtow to some mob that was claiming</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.120" end="00:48:25.340" style="s2">they were guilty of something in one</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.470" end="00:48:27.590" style="s2">case the guy apparently has three</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.340" end="00:48:29.930" style="s2">quarters not white and his a hand</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.590" end="00:48:31.460" style="s2">hanging out the window of his car and it</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.930" end="00:48:33.230" style="s2">appeared to someone who later admitted</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.460" end="00:48:35.090" style="s2">that he probably overreacted</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.230" end="00:48:36.440" style="s2">if the guy was making an okay symbol</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.090" end="00:48:38.870" style="s2">which of course okay symbol</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.440" end="00:48:40.700" style="s2">are you kidding you got to read this oh</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.870" end="00:48:42.500" style="s2">my god yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s quite frightened</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.700" end="00:48:44.540" style="s2">but the point is okay these three make</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.500" end="00:48:47.420" style="s2">the Atlantic the Atlantic which you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.540" end="00:48:49.970" style="s2">has become Uncas is a voice of reason</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.420" end="00:48:51.590" style="s2">yeah sure but the Atlantic is sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.970" end="00:48:52.820" style="s2">as a voice of reason and sometimes isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.590" end="00:48:54.920" style="s2">as all these places are so will the</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.820" end="00:48:56.600" style="s2">Atlantic topple and articles like this</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.920" end="00:48:58.160" style="s2">stop showing up I would guess it will</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.600" end="00:49:00.470" style="s2">just as the New York Times looks</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:04.940" style="s2">appeared about ready to topple</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.470" end="00:49:07.820" style="s2">completely into this madness okay so</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.940" end="00:49:10.100" style="s2">actually we use AK I want to now say</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.820" end="00:49:12.770" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a problem in journalism that</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.100" end="00:49:14.900" style="s2">we are aware of Matt Taibbi has done a</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.770" end="00:49:16.550" style="s2">brilliant job covering what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.900" end="00:49:19.460" style="s2">in journalism and he&#39;s detailed I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.550" end="00:49:22.370" style="s2">six cases in which an effective coup is</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.460" end="00:49:24.140" style="s2">underway in very important places right</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.370" end="00:49:25.970" style="s2">you know the New York Times the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.140" end="00:49:29.570" style="s2">intercept it&#39;s happening all over the</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.970" end="00:49:31.130" style="s2">place but my point is this horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.570" end="00:49:35.000" style="s2">thing is going to be anywhere you look</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.130" end="00:49:38.120" style="s2">so I came across something this week can</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.000" end="00:49:44.030" style="s2">you put up the link I gave you that says</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.120" end="00:49:46.730" style="s2">something like we see you well your</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.030" end="00:49:49.310" style="s2">analogy I don&#39;t think it is an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.730" end="00:49:54.320" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re calling this sleeper cells</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.310" end="00:49:56.900" style="s2">is apt that whether or not it was the</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.320" end="00:49:59.200" style="s2">conscious intention of schools of Ed to</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.900" end="00:50:01.250" style="s2">train teachers to indoctrinate children</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.200" end="00:50:02.690" style="s2">and in some cases it clearly was</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.250" end="00:50:05.530" style="s2">conscious and in some cases maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.690" end="00:50:09.080" style="s2">wasn&#39;t those children have grown up</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.530" end="00:50:12.470" style="s2">often drugged often helicoptered unable</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.080" end="00:50:16.340" style="s2">to do anything real in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.470" end="00:50:18.260" style="s2">they&#39;re being handed a prefab revolution</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.340" end="00:50:20.090" style="s2">and of course they&#39;re on board of course</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.260" end="00:50:21.410" style="s2">they&#39;re on board for one thing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.090" end="00:50:23.180" style="s2">the rhetoric sounds pretty good if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.410" end="00:50:25.010" style="s2">don&#39;t look at it too closely and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.180" end="00:50:26.990" style="s2">they&#39;re slated to get an upgrade in</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.010" end="00:50:29.900" style="s2">lifestyle because they&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.990" end="00:50:32.240" style="s2">intersectional side that&#39;s going to reap</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.900" end="00:50:34.730" style="s2">the benefits so what I have here is</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.240" end="00:50:38.900" style="s2">something from apparently the theater</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.730" end="00:50:41.080" style="s2">community in Atlanta and here dear white</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.900" end="00:50:43.240" style="s2">American theater</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.080" end="00:50:45.700" style="s2">we come together as a community of black</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.240" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">indigenous and people of color</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.700" end="00:50:52.210" style="s2">so by POC it&#39;s a new acronym</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.200" end="00:50:54.130" style="s2">theatre-makers in the legacy of August</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.210" end="00:50:56.380" style="s2">Wilson&#39;s to ground on which I stand to</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.130" end="00:50:58.420" style="s2">let you know exactly what the grant what</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.380" end="00:51:03.340" style="s2">ground we stand on in the wake of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.420" end="00:51:05.740" style="s2">nation&#39;s civic unrest so this goes on to</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.340" end="00:51:07.060" style="s2">say so there is no entity called white</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.740" end="00:51:08.830" style="s2">American theater they are addressing</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.060" end="00:51:10.480" style="s2">everyone who is white who was in</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.830" end="00:51:13.210" style="s2">American theatre is that the idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.480" end="00:51:14.440" style="s2">yes I believe so I you know I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.210" end="00:51:16.750" style="s2">imagine that there would be anything</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.440" end="00:51:20.290" style="s2">called white American theater that would</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.750" end="00:51:21.850" style="s2">be extraordinarily archaic and offensive</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.290" end="00:51:23.350" style="s2">and so in some sense this is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.850" end="00:51:27.190" style="s2">description of a boogie man and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.350" end="00:51:29.640" style="s2">boogie man is one in which theater has</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.190" end="00:51:33.880" style="s2">been oppressing black people in some</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.640" end="00:51:37.480" style="s2">transparent way on every stage at all</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.880" end="00:51:39.880" style="s2">times and this is the claim that it has</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.480" end="00:51:42.550" style="s2">been seen which is effectively very</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.880" end="00:51:44.020" style="s2">close to an empirical client right this</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.550" end="00:51:46.360" style="s2">is not an allegation this is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.020" end="00:51:48.340" style="s2">description it&#39;s an eyewitness account</p>

<p begin="00:51:48.340" end="00:51:53.410" style="s2">happening but anyway my point here isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.610" end="00:51:56.080" style="s2">about theater and it&#39;s not about Atlanta</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.410" end="00:51:57.340" style="s2">it&#39;s about the fact that you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.080" end="00:51:59.710" style="s2">know this was happening</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.340" end="00:52:01.780" style="s2">except that if you tuned in to this</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.710" end="00:52:03.490" style="s2">little world of Atlanta theater you</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.780" end="00:52:06.940" style="s2">discover oh my goodness the coup is</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.490" end="00:52:09.460" style="s2">happening right and well and I we heard</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.940" end="00:52:12.130" style="s2">from a lot of people in theater after</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.460" end="00:52:14.470" style="s2">evergreen blew up yeah we your inbox</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.130" end="00:52:16.450" style="s2">blew up thousands and thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.470" end="00:52:19.150" style="s2">emails and I went through many of them</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.450" end="00:52:22.570" style="s2">and there were a tremendous number of</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.150" end="00:52:24.190" style="s2">people writing in from theater now what</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.570" end="00:52:27.700" style="s2">are the chances that people who go into</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.190" end="00:52:31.750" style="s2">theater are particularly racist or</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.700" end="00:52:33.790" style="s2">bigoted or unwilling to investigate</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.750" end="00:52:35.830" style="s2">other narratives about what might be</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.790" end="00:52:38.430" style="s2">going on right know that like this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.830" end="00:52:42.640" style="s2">what art is is what art is for is</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.430" end="00:52:44.080" style="s2">precisely about engaging with different</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.640" end="00:52:45.910" style="s2">perspectives different ways of living</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.080" end="00:52:48.730" style="s2">different historical periods different</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.910" end="00:52:50.470" style="s2">places different ideologies different</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.730" end="00:52:52.060" style="s2">demographics all of this this is what we</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.470" end="00:52:54.220" style="s2">need narrative for and theater is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.060" end="00:52:55.690" style="s2">particularly wonderful way</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.220" end="00:52:58.119" style="s2">I mean you and I both enjoy live theater</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.690" end="00:52:59.710" style="s2">quite a lot we&#39;ve been going to we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.119" end="00:53:01.980" style="s2">taking our children to live theater</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.710" end="00:53:04.720" style="s2">multiple times a year for years now and</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.980" end="00:53:06.369" style="s2">and we&#39;ve been hearing a little bit from</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.720" end="00:53:08.530" style="s2">people we actually know in a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.369" end="00:53:12.160" style="s2">these theater companies but much more so</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.530" end="00:53:14.950" style="s2">from a number of anonymous well people</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.160" end="00:53:18.060" style="s2">who we don&#39;t know but who came to us</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.950" end="00:53:21.130" style="s2">with their stories theater troupes seem</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.060" end="00:53:24.130" style="s2">particularly prone to prostrate</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.130" end="00:53:27.790" style="s2">themselves before this ridiculous false</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.130" end="00:53:30.220" style="s2">set of accusations and gods when they</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.790" end="00:53:33.670" style="s2">are actually doing some of the most</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.220" end="00:53:35.740" style="s2">forward-thinking I can&#39;t use the word</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.670" end="00:53:38.530" style="s2">anti-racist anymore but like actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.740" end="00:53:40.690" style="s2">anti-racist it&#39;s a narrative work and</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.530" end="00:53:42.730" style="s2">therefore the presentation of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.690" end="00:53:44.920" style="s2">work is one of the places that we work</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.730" end="00:53:46.960" style="s2">out the difficult nuances that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.920" end="00:53:49.300" style="s2">whole point of the exercise and so to</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.960" end="00:53:51.550" style="s2">have something behind the scenes taking</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.300" end="00:53:54.940" style="s2">place that erases all nuance and creates</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.550" end="00:53:58.540" style="s2">totally phony narratives right is toxic</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.940" end="00:54:01.930" style="s2">and we&#39;ve seen this week a number of</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.540" end="00:54:05.560" style="s2">cases in which you know in some animated</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.930" end="00:54:07.510" style="s2">series some white actor was voicing a</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.560" end="00:54:10.180" style="s2">character of color and they&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.510" end="00:54:12.220" style="s2">stepped down so in those cases we can</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.180" end="00:54:13.900" style="s2">say that whatever these are celebrities</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.220" end="00:54:15.790" style="s2">they&#39;ll you know they&#39;ve got plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.900" end="00:54:18.190" style="s2">resources maybe it shouldn&#39;t have been a</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.790" end="00:54:21.070" style="s2">white person along but my point is this</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.190" end="00:54:23.440" style="s2">is now a threat the point is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.070" end="00:54:25.990" style="s2">threat going forward right every time</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.440" end="00:54:28.960" style="s2">you have a job opening you have to bend</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.990" end="00:54:31.140" style="s2">over backwards to make sure that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.960" end="00:54:34.330" style="s2">accusation that you&#39;ve done anything</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.140" end="00:54:36.430" style="s2">other than prioritised the voices of</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.330" end="00:54:39.070" style="s2">people that you know have demographic</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.430" end="00:54:40.420" style="s2">markers that you can spot you have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.070" end="00:54:43.300" style="s2">make every effort to do that so the</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.420" end="00:54:44.410" style="s2">point is yes this is a coup and some of</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.300" end="00:54:46.150" style="s2">the people paying the price are</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.410" end="00:54:48.880" style="s2">celebrities and maybe that&#39;s not all</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.150" end="00:54:50.970" style="s2">that awful right I don&#39;t like it but the</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.880" end="00:54:53.560" style="s2">point is if you&#39;re a celebrity</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.970" end="00:54:55.089" style="s2">you&#39;ve probably got resources but this</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.560" end="00:54:57.339" style="s2">is going to the this is going to fall</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.089" end="00:54:59.589" style="s2">down on the heads of thousands and</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.339" end="00:55:01.540" style="s2">thousands of people who are depending on</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.589" end="00:55:03.849" style="s2">you know a theatre is a difficult line</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.540" end="00:55:06.010" style="s2">of work and if you are suddenly now</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.849" end="00:55:06.690" style="s2">unable to get a job because your</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.010" end="00:55:08.819" style="s2">demographic</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.690" end="00:55:10.680" style="s2">markers don&#39;t slate you for one that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.819" end="00:55:13.380" style="s2">disaster furthermore it threatens all</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.680" end="00:55:15.720" style="s2">narrative it threatens all of our</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.380" end="00:55:18.240" style="s2">ability to hear stories that don&#39;t sound</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.720" end="00:55:20.099" style="s2">like what we expect the idea I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.240" end="00:55:22.950" style="s2">isn&#39;t I don&#39;t have an example from this</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.099" end="00:55:26.460" style="s2">week but over the last few years we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.950" end="00:55:28.170" style="s2">heard these many stories of okay so I</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.460" end="00:55:31.530" style="s2">think it was Janine Cummings is her name</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.170" end="00:55:33.780" style="s2">who wrote an American dirt she has maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.530" end="00:55:35.400" style="s2">a Puerto Rican grandmother I may be</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.780" end="00:55:36.450" style="s2">getting some of the descriptions wrong I</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.400" end="00:55:38.910" style="s2">didn&#39;t know we were gonna be talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.450" end="00:55:40.980" style="s2">about this but her book tour was</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.910" end="00:55:41.910" style="s2">canceled in her book almost canceled on</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.980" end="00:55:44.579" style="s2">the basis that</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.910" end="00:55:48.569" style="s2">how dare she write a book about a</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.579" end="00:55:51.240" style="s2">middle-class Mexican woman and her son</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.569" end="00:55:52.950" style="s2">running from the narcos through Mexico</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.240" end="00:55:55.260" style="s2">and ultimately escaping to the US</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.950" end="00:55:56.970" style="s2">because she is not herself Mexican</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.260" end="00:55:59.910" style="s2">American nor has she herself escaped</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.970" end="00:56:02.670" style="s2">from the narcos she had no right to</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.910" end="00:56:06.210" style="s2">write this they you know that publisher</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.670" end="00:56:09.030" style="s2">was obliged apparently to find instead</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.210" end="00:56:11.579" style="s2">someone who wished to write a novel who</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.030" end="00:56:14.940" style="s2">already lived that life well this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.579" end="00:56:17.250" style="s2">misunderstanding you know everything but</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.940" end="00:56:21.089" style="s2">you know what is fiction for one thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.250" end="00:56:24.660" style="s2">but also if we are really in this</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.089" end="00:56:26.670" style="s2">landscape where you cannot write from</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.660" end="00:56:28.770" style="s2">the perspective of someone else we are</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.670" end="00:56:32.730" style="s2">being asked to forgo all that is best</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.770" end="00:56:35.579" style="s2">about humanity we I can I cannot omit I</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.730" end="00:56:38.460" style="s2">I am NOT allowed to imagine myself into</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.579" end="00:56:42.300" style="s2">your brain because let&#39;s see your mail</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.460" end="00:56:44.339" style="s2">and you&#39;re Jewish and you know so many</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.300" end="00:56:46.859" style="s2">other things that make you different for</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.339" end="00:56:50.069" style="s2">me if we take that to its most obvious</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.859" end="00:56:52.410" style="s2">extreme none of us can possibly imagine</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.069" end="00:56:54.660" style="s2">the experience of anyone else and</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.410" end="00:56:57.329" style="s2">therefore we are forbidden from writing</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.660" end="00:56:58.980" style="s2">fiction . it is the it is the death of</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.329" end="00:57:00.480" style="s2">fiction is the death of narrative we can</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.980" end="00:57:01.740" style="s2">only write from and this and this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.480" end="00:57:03.750" style="s2">what they say with regard to lived</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.740" end="00:57:05.430" style="s2">experience you know the the the best</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.750" end="00:57:06.839" style="s2">form of knowledge the only legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.430" end="00:57:09.960" style="s2">form of knowledge I&#39;ve even heard is</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.839" end="00:57:11.250" style="s2">lived experience and that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.960" end="00:57:13.200" style="s2">end of science that&#39;s the end of</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.250" end="00:57:15.030" style="s2">hypothetical deduction ISM that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.200" end="00:57:16.560" style="s2">end of analysis but it&#39;s also we&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.030" end="00:57:18.119" style="s2">that many times it&#39;s also the end of</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.560" end="00:57:19.920" style="s2">fiction in narrative it&#39;s the end we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.119" end="00:57:22.059" style="s2">just doomed across the board it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.920" end="00:57:25.630" style="s2">end of empathy</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.059" end="00:57:28.420" style="s2">and I would point out a example that</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.630" end="00:57:29.500" style="s2">just pops to mind yeah if I&#39;d known we</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.420" end="00:57:33.339" style="s2">were headed here I would have looked up</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.500" end="00:57:35.760" style="s2">the actor&#39;s name but the movie life is</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.339" end="00:57:40.390" style="s2">beautiful I think was its name about a</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.760" end="00:57:44.650" style="s2">Jewish father who tries to make life for</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.390" end="00:57:48.369" style="s2">his son bearable in I believe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.650" end="00:57:50.619" style="s2">Auschwitz and the actor who plays the</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.369" end="00:57:53.200" style="s2">main role was attempt to open Nene</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.619" end="00:57:56.829" style="s2">roberta benigni yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.200" end="00:58:00.309" style="s2">so you it&#39;s hard for me even to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.829" end="00:58:03.339" style="s2">an outcry about the fact that you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.309" end="00:58:05.349" style="s2">this this heartbreaking story acted so</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.339" end="00:58:07.930" style="s2">beautifully by this actor that he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.349" end="00:58:09.700" style="s2">happen to be Jewish is irrelevant and</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.930" end="00:58:12.730" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s even a triumph in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.700" end="00:58:16.930" style="s2">because he you know he really evokes it</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.730" end="00:58:18.550" style="s2">and so yes isn&#39;t this exactly what we</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.930" end="00:58:21.250" style="s2">want for other people to be able to</p>

<p begin="01:02:29.840" end="01:02:34.730" style="s2">sessions in theatres all of the dangers</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.260" end="01:02:37.130" style="s2">that you and I were just talking about</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.730" end="01:02:39.620" style="s2">flow from this rather directly but again</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.130" end="01:02:41.990" style="s2">the point really isn&#39;t about theatre the</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.620" end="01:02:44.180" style="s2">point is we&#39;ve seen this up close and</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.990" end="01:02:46.430" style="s2">personal in colleges and universities</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.180" end="01:02:50.300" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen it in schools of IDI we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.430" end="01:02:52.100" style="s2">seen it in in journalism and it is</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.300" end="01:02:54.530" style="s2">spreading at a rapid rate we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.100" end="01:02:58.900" style="s2">the Democratic Party play ball with this</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.530" end="01:03:02.300" style="s2">thing at the highest possible levels and</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.900" end="01:03:03.650" style="s2">what is the natural remedy so my point</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.300" end="01:03:05.510" style="s2">would be look you&#39;ve got natural</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.650" end="01:03:07.370" style="s2">remedies this is completely insane</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.510" end="01:03:09.080" style="s2">people are being fired for things that</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.370" end="01:03:11.150" style="s2">they never did they&#39;re being fired for</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.080" end="01:03:14.030" style="s2">completely symbolic reasons that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.150" end="01:03:15.320" style="s2">actually legally acceptable right but</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.030" end="01:03:17.120" style="s2">you would have to go to a court to</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.320" end="01:03:19.070" style="s2">establish that you had been harmed this</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.120" end="01:03:21.980" style="s2">is also going to be in every single</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.070" end="01:03:25.970" style="s2">court right so it is getting harder to</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.980" end="01:03:29.150" style="s2">imagine that a a white plaintiff could</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.970" end="01:03:31.820" style="s2">prevail in such a case if they you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.150" end="01:03:33.890" style="s2">if the juries and judges are sensitive</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.820" end="01:03:37.670" style="s2">to the fact that they may be next to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.890" end="01:03:39.890" style="s2">portrayed as somehow whipe supremacists</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.670" end="01:03:40.490" style="s2">so this is it this is an Orwellian</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.890" end="01:03:42.590" style="s2">nightmare</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.490" end="01:03:44.240" style="s2">all of the natural remedies if the court</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.590" end="01:03:46.850" style="s2">fails what&#39;s supposed to protect you</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.240" end="01:03:49.010" style="s2">well journalism the fact of the court</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.850" end="01:03:50.390" style="s2">having failed might be reported and</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.010" end="01:03:51.860" style="s2">people might say oh my goodness what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.390" end="01:03:53.720" style="s2">going on in the court system how did it</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.860" end="01:03:56.720" style="s2">get so broken well that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.720" end="01:04:00.080" style="s2">gone too there&#39;s no remedy left and that</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.720" end="01:04:01.790" style="s2">is a cruelly frightening fact we are we</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.080" end="01:04:08.530" style="s2">are watching a horizontal revolution and</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.790" end="01:04:11.990" style="s2">frankly I don&#39;t know where it isn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.530" end="01:04:15.860" style="s2">don&#39;t know where it isn&#39;t either I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.990" end="01:04:17.720" style="s2">the it&#39;s harder to have outposts now in</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.860" end="01:04:22.600" style="s2">part because social media gets</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.720" end="01:04:25.550" style="s2">everywhere those who are self-employed</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.600" end="01:04:29.210" style="s2">need probably to fall in line lest they</p>

<p begin="01:04:35.300" end="01:04:40.760" style="s2">businesses too will be targeted it looks</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.240" end="01:04:43.310" style="s2">to me you know if I just take say you</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.760" end="01:04:45.710" style="s2">know within a supermarket the people</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.310" end="01:04:48.619" style="s2">cutting up meat the butchers seem the</p>

<p begin="01:04:55.730" end="01:05:02.030" style="s2">so-called blue-collar workers are less</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.930" end="01:05:04.640" style="s2">likely to succumb to the mind virus</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.030" end="01:05:06.980" style="s2">itself but that doesn&#39;t save them from</p>

<p begin="01:05:40.970" end="01:05:47.500" style="s2">vying for narrative here because</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.790" end="01:05:50.690" style="s2">actually were a movement that made sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.500" end="01:05:53.200" style="s2">to emerge from this by virtue of those</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.690" end="01:05:56.660" style="s2">who had</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.200" end="01:05:58.520" style="s2">superior understanding and capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.660" end="01:05:58.940" style="s2">reason were to triumph that would be</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.520" end="01:06:00.800" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.940" end="01:06:04.760" style="s2">I see no possibility of it happening</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.800" end="01:06:07.420" style="s2">because the mechanism by which the</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.760" end="01:06:11.030" style="s2">movement figures out what it stands for</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.420" end="01:06:12.859" style="s2">barely exists even black lives matters</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.030" end="01:06:14.510" style="s2">as a central organisations but anytime</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.859" end="01:06:16.220" style="s2">you point to that central organization</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.510" end="01:06:18.740" style="s2">people say oh but that&#39;s not black live</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.220" end="01:06:20.270" style="s2">matter that that&#39;s that&#39;s one entity</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.740" end="01:06:23.000" style="s2">there are other manifestations and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.270" end="01:06:25.640" style="s2">without leadership that is recognized by</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.000" end="01:06:27.050" style="s2">the movement there&#39;s no one to negotiate</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.640" end="01:06:29.900" style="s2">with there&#39;s no one to reason with</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.050" end="01:06:32.300" style="s2">there&#39;s no one to reign in the abuses</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.900" end="01:06:34.190" style="s2">and because of that it is certain to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.300" end="01:06:36.200" style="s2">a disaster and it is certain to cause</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.190" end="01:06:39.170" style="s2">the backlash on the other side which</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.200" end="01:06:41.930" style="s2">will be every bit as ugly yeah no I I</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.170" end="01:06:43.280" style="s2">think that&#39;s right and I don&#39;t know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.930" end="01:06:45.859" style="s2">hard to know exactly what movements</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.280" end="01:06:49.670" style="s2">versus factions means in terms of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.859" end="01:06:52.339" style="s2">distinction but to return very briefly</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.670" end="01:06:55.130" style="s2">to a point that we spent a fair bit of</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.339" end="01:06:58.579" style="s2">time on last time with regard to what</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.130" end="01:07:02.180" style="s2">what is trans ideology and trans rights</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.579" end="01:07:04.369" style="s2">activists what doing so prominently in</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.180" end="01:07:06.530" style="s2">the black lives matter movement when</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.369" end="01:07:11.150" style="s2">that would seem to be antithetical to</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.530" end="01:07:15.550" style="s2">their main main principle so I&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.150" end="01:07:21.140" style="s2">got three images to show not quite sac</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.550" end="01:07:24.470" style="s2">that suggests that at both the top of</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.140" end="01:07:28.220" style="s2">social media and in politics we are</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.470" end="01:07:31.339" style="s2">already seeing a change in messaging</p>

<p begin="01:09:03.850" end="01:09:12.069" style="s2">it&#39;s this pride let&#39;s focus on natal men</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.850" end="01:09:14.350" style="s2">let&#39;s do that yeah put aside the racial</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.069" end="01:09:15.400" style="s2">the the racial thing I mean none of us</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.350" end="01:09:17.680" style="s2">are supposed to be allowed to do that</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.400" end="01:09:18.430" style="s2">right now but I kind of don&#39;t even want</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.680" end="01:09:22.930" style="s2">to go there</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.430" end="01:09:29.140" style="s2">right why is everyone feeling not just</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.930" end="01:09:31.359" style="s2">empowered but forced to focus on men who</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.140" end="01:09:32.830" style="s2">have declared themselves women often</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.359" end="01:09:36.430" style="s2">without any other evidence to support</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.830" end="01:09:39.759" style="s2">the idea that they are and saying that</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.430" end="01:09:41.680" style="s2">that is the new face of progressivism</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.759" end="01:09:45.160" style="s2">and enlightenment you can take it down</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.680" end="01:09:48.990" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s do this another way</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.160" end="01:09:52.660" style="s2">because undoubtedly there are black</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.990" end="01:09:54.460" style="s2">trans black trans women which is to say</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.660" end="01:09:56.350" style="s2">people born male who have transitioned</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.460" end="01:10:00.100" style="s2">to female undoubtedly that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.350" end="01:10:02.860" style="s2">demographic however the category</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.100" end="01:10:05.890" style="s2">includes any presumably any black man</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.860" end="01:10:08.740" style="s2">who wants to say that he is now a woman</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.890" end="01:10:10.930" style="s2">so that is a loophole if this is the</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.740" end="01:10:14.890" style="s2">pinnacle of what we must be fighting for</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.930" end="01:10:17.440" style="s2">then any black man can opt into it which</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.890" end="01:10:18.690" style="s2">is a frightening prospect and again I</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.440" end="01:10:22.159" style="s2">don&#39;t think we know</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.690" end="01:10:25.860" style="s2">meaning of what&#39;s going on but it is</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.159" end="01:10:30.690" style="s2">conspicuous that evergreens meltdown was</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.860" end="01:10:33.600" style="s2">led by three black trans women it is to</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.690" end="01:10:35.550" style="s2">say people born male transitioned to</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.600" end="01:10:38.300" style="s2">female who led the collapse of our</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.550" end="01:10:40.620" style="s2">College and the attack on us so</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.300" end="01:10:43.710" style="s2">something is going on here the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.620" end="01:10:46.679" style="s2">there was a major demonstration in New</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.710" end="01:10:50.489" style="s2">York that this you know the George Floyd</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.679" end="01:10:53.370" style="s2">rallies were continuing a pace and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.489" end="01:10:55.590" style="s2">black transness was the focus of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.370" end="01:10:58.560" style="s2">second eruption of rallies why is this</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.590" end="01:11:01.199" style="s2">our second priority this at most it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.560" end="01:11:05.580" style="s2">tiny demographic and I&#39;d be hard-pressed</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.199" end="01:11:08.040" style="s2">to tell you what the what the concerns</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.580" end="01:11:09.420" style="s2">are what it is like to be in that</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.040" end="01:11:10.980" style="s2">category but nonetheless there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.420" end="01:11:14.190" style="s2">something conspicuous about the fact</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.980" end="01:11:16.560" style="s2">that this is like the flagship identity</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.190" end="01:11:18.900" style="s2">of this movement so to Khloe&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.560" end="01:11:20.550" style="s2">Chloe Valerie&#39;s point there is something</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.900" end="01:11:25.380" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.550" end="01:11:27.330" style="s2">largely behind the scenes that is one to</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.380" end="01:11:28.770" style="s2">your point maybe one faction within this</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.330" end="01:11:31.170" style="s2">larger movement or maybe a wholly</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.770" end="01:11:33.480" style="s2">distinct movement that is cloaking</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.170" end="01:11:34.949" style="s2">itself in the mainstream black lives</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.480" end="01:11:38.550" style="s2">matter movement and pretending to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.949" end="01:11:42.929" style="s2">that same thing and thus getting in that</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.550" end="01:11:46.739" style="s2">is very explicitly about this hyper</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.929" end="01:11:48.570" style="s2">niche demographic that is growing such</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.739" end="01:11:51.030" style="s2">that it&#39;s got to be the fairly rare</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.570" end="01:11:54.270" style="s2">person at least living on the coasts at</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.030" end="01:11:57.770" style="s2">this point and probably in any city who</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.270" end="01:12:00.870" style="s2">is not has not run into the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.770" end="01:12:03.510" style="s2">trans lives mattering in the last few</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.870" end="01:12:07.400" style="s2">weeks and this is this is not a</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.510" end="01:12:11.040" style="s2">demographic that warrants such</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.400" end="01:12:13.020" style="s2">remarkable attention otherwise so maybe</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.040" end="01:12:14.730" style="s2">maybe we should stop that for now return</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.020" end="01:12:16.230" style="s2">to this another time so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.730" end="01:12:19.980" style="s2">more to say yeah there&#39;s a lot there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.230" end="01:12:22.679" style="s2">lot to be said but I think the the fact</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.980" end="01:12:24.750" style="s2">that at some level the intersectional</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.679" end="01:12:27.989" style="s2">logic which was never coherent to begin</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.750" end="01:12:31.230" style="s2">with nonetheless effectively specifies</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.989" end="01:12:33.800" style="s2">that the if</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.230" end="01:12:35.880" style="s2">if this movement is really about and the</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.800" end="01:12:38.160" style="s2">last shall be first and the first shall</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.880" end="01:12:42.449" style="s2">be last then the top of the pyramid will</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.160" end="01:12:43.710" style="s2">be black trans women by virtue of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.449" end="01:12:46.770" style="s2">fact that they have opted into two</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.710" end="01:12:49.050" style="s2">categories that is to say that these are</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.770" end="01:12:50.670" style="s2">people who have opted into the protected</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.050" end="01:12:53.520" style="s2">category trans and the protected</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.670" end="01:12:56.489" style="s2">category woman which is a remarkable</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.520" end="01:12:58.830" style="s2">feat yeah if you can opt in to the top</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.489" end="01:13:01.199" style="s2">of the new oppressors lots of people</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.830" end="01:13:02.969" style="s2">will pop some people will it&#39;s it you</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.199" end="01:13:09.960" style="s2">know depending on what life you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.969" end="01:13:13.800" style="s2">living maybe that&#39;s a sweet deal all</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.960" end="01:13:17.100" style="s2">right perhaps it is time for us to take</p>
