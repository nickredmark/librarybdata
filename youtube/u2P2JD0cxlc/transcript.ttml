<p begin="00:00:40.050" end="00:00:46.500" style="s2">and seeing what isn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.210" end="00:00:49.020" style="s2">immediately apparent but seeing the</p>

<p begin="00:01:03.570" end="00:01:09.110" style="s2">able to deeply connect in that way with</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.720" end="00:01:16.619" style="s2">other people on an emotional level on a</p>

<p begin="00:02:07.829" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">the 3-way dialogue between John for</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.129" end="00:02:16.890" style="s2">Vicki Johannes and myself</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:20.099" style="s2">and if you haven&#39;t watched the first one</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.890" end="00:02:20.519" style="s2">I would recommend that you could you do</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.099" end="00:02:22.860" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.519" end="00:02:25.980" style="s2">but if you can also just start here and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.860" end="00:02:28.379" style="s2">launch off because you know the nature</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.980" end="00:02:32.010" style="s2">of these dialogues especially the ones</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.379" end="00:02:33.900" style="s2">with more than just two people you kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.010" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">of there it&#39;s interesting there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.900" end="00:02:44.609" style="s2">many levels of things being revealed and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.120" end="00:02:47.670" style="s2">at once almost I find them kind of a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.609" end="00:02:50.459" style="s2">fractal right if the whole thing is kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.670" end="00:02:52.379" style="s2">of in every part and so there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.459" end="00:02:55.530" style="s2">many many layers that are being revealed</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.379" end="00:02:59.159" style="s2">in the dialog in the way that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.530" end="00:03:00.750" style="s2">dialoguing that I want to encourage you</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.159" end="00:03:02.069" style="s2">just to tune into so you can just jump</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.750" end="00:03:04.769" style="s2">right into this one because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.069" end="00:03:07.859" style="s2">very linear we we kind of follow the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.769" end="00:03:10.530" style="s2">flow of the conversation this one is</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.859" end="00:03:14.250" style="s2">particularly looking at Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.530" end="00:03:17.370" style="s2">looking at Heidegger&#39;s notion of the age</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.250" end="00:03:19.919" style="s2">of Technology and the history of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.370" end="00:03:21.599" style="s2">understanding of being as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.919" end="00:03:25.319" style="s2">forgetfulness of being in Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.599" end="00:03:28.349" style="s2">speak right and how that relates to</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.319" end="00:03:31.379" style="s2">John&#39;s notion of the meaning crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.349" end="00:03:33.690" style="s2">getting those two two talking together</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.379" end="00:03:41.060" style="s2">and I think that really happened and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.690" end="00:03:41.060" style="s2">much more so without further ado enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.669" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">it&#39;s all the hands it&#39;s like we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.750" end="00:03:56.909" style="s2">hiding assess ever binden to get over</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:59.989" style="s2">instead of overcome instead of over we</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.909" end="00:04:03.180" style="s2">were common so so tame technics and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.989" end="00:04:06.810" style="s2">framing must be forbidden that means you</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.180" end="00:04:08.459" style="s2">don&#39;t go over it you go right in and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.810" end="00:04:10.019" style="s2">then you turn it from within because</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.459" end="00:04:12.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not about getting rid of it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.019" end="00:04:14.159" style="s2">about understanding where it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.090" end="00:04:17.310" style="s2">hiding who keep saying it does have an</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.159" end="00:04:20.699" style="s2">origin we must find that origin because</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.310" end="00:04:23.310" style="s2">if not them we&#39;re cut off and that means</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.699" end="00:04:26.810" style="s2">we live in Amity in a meaningless world</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.310" end="00:04:26.810" style="s2">it&#39;s quite vacuum</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.000" end="00:04:34.060" style="s2">that&#39;s that just that notion of origin</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.360" end="00:04:38.199" style="s2">right what I the picture I get from how</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.060" end="00:04:40.870" style="s2">I hear that is it&#39;s like different than</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.199" end="00:04:44.979" style="s2">source right source has kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.870" end="00:04:47.860" style="s2">from to right sense to it origin has</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.979" end="00:04:51.780" style="s2">more of this it&#39;s somehow present right</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.860" end="00:04:55.150" style="s2">now right it&#39;s like somehow present</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.780" end="00:04:57.039" style="s2">underneath the origin of something I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.150" end="00:05:00.430" style="s2">add the sense of where I can reveal the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.039" end="00:05:02.440" style="s2">scent the origin yeah of this sentence</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.430" end="00:05:04.330" style="s2">or the origin of this moment there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.440" end="00:05:06.970" style="s2">quite there is this kind of quality to</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.330" end="00:05:09.280" style="s2">it we carry that in the adjective</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.970" end="00:05:10.750" style="s2">original yeah we mean it&#39;s a current</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.280" end="00:05:12.729" style="s2">it&#39;s a property that something can</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.750" end="00:05:16.479" style="s2">currently have that will point back to</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.729" end="00:05:18.909" style="s2">his origin right so there&#39;s a there is</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.479" end="00:05:21.310" style="s2">that sense in the adjective to say that</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.909" end="00:05:23.469" style="s2">something&#39;s original is actually to talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.310" end="00:05:25.330" style="s2">about how it is now people even though</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.469" end="00:05:28.780" style="s2">you&#39;re presumably referring to something</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.330" end="00:05:31.210" style="s2">in its past yeah I agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.780" end="00:05:34.030" style="s2">original does carry that scent origin</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.210" end="00:05:36.460" style="s2">does carry that sense with it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.030" end="00:05:40.300" style="s2">origin is a is like this right in terms</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.460" end="00:05:43.569" style="s2">of the hand it&#39;s the wellspring of</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.300" end="00:05:46.300" style="s2">meaning yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.569" end="00:05:48.940" style="s2">source right we said that could give</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.300" end="00:05:50.349" style="s2">rise to being a resource etc which then</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.940" end="00:05:52.120" style="s2">could be sound like we&#39;re exploiting it</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.349" end="00:05:53.949" style="s2">but no origin and this is what hiding</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.120" end="00:05:55.779" style="s2">keeps coming back to when he says the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.949" end="00:05:57.099" style="s2">origin is not something two and a half</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.779" end="00:05:58.539" style="s2">thousand years ago I&#39;m not saying go</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.099" end="00:06:01.240" style="s2">back to the Golden Age of the Greeks</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.539" end="00:06:03.479" style="s2">know there is something of origin</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.240" end="00:06:06.940" style="s2">waiting in these texts in these</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.479" end="00:06:11.289" style="s2">testimonials of logos of knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.940" end="00:06:13.270" style="s2">ratio and of being itself of course that</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.289" end="00:06:15.099" style="s2">there&#39;s still something to be found in</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.270" end="00:06:17.080" style="s2">them right and and the other way of</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.099" end="00:06:18.669" style="s2">dealing with philosophy so we&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.080" end="00:06:20.710" style="s2">this distinction John you made a</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.669" end="00:06:24.069" style="s2">situation between if you go Sofia of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.710" end="00:06:26.710" style="s2">course the love of wisdom and academic</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.069" end="00:06:27.789" style="s2">philosophy now it was Afiya means okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.710" end="00:06:29.050" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of origin</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.789" end="00:06:30.759" style="s2">there&#39;s something there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.050" end="00:06:32.860" style="s2">something there&#39;s something there when I</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.759" end="00:06:35.979" style="s2">read these texts I come to these texts</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.860" end="00:06:38.529" style="s2">not not to be right or to find the place</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.979" end="00:06:40.650" style="s2">who was wrong but to be transformed by</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.529" end="00:06:44.610" style="s2">this because there must be a reason why</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.650" end="00:06:46.860" style="s2">Plato is Plato right and what I see in</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.610" end="00:06:49.860" style="s2">academic philosophy now is something</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.860" end="00:06:52.139" style="s2">else which is in my mind a bit cut off</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.860" end="00:06:54.150" style="s2">from warranty because what we now see is</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.139" end="00:06:56.639" style="s2">Spinoza a realist so is he more of an</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.150" end="00:06:58.620" style="s2">idealist if he is an idealist is he a</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.639" end="00:07:00.330" style="s2">Dogma etcetera whatever he is some kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.620" end="00:07:03.060" style="s2">of isn&#39;t that that&#39;s no longer this</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.330" end="00:07:05.250" style="s2">sense of an original access to this</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.060" end="00:07:07.139" style="s2">because ultimately this isn&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.250" end="00:07:11.250" style="s2">matter what matters is something else</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.139" end="00:07:17.820" style="s2">and that&#39;s this sense of getting back in</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.250" end="00:07:21.090" style="s2">touch with what there is with meaning</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.820" end="00:07:23.669" style="s2">let&#39;s just say it&#39;s I think it is I</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.090" end="00:07:26.310" style="s2">think that that that connectedness with</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.669" end="00:07:28.320" style="s2">what is that affords transformation is</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.310" end="00:07:29.820" style="s2">what people are even talking about in</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.320" end="00:07:32.910" style="s2">the psychological literature ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.820" end="00:07:35.580" style="s2">about meaning yeah so two things come up</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.910" end="00:07:38.430" style="s2">then to tie back to previous things like</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.580" end="00:07:39.960" style="s2">that the discussion of the origin I</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.430" end="00:07:41.970" style="s2">think resonates with the discussion we</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.960" end="00:07:44.039" style="s2">were having about tradition and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.970" end="00:07:45.900" style="s2">yeah and then I think I think of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.039" end="00:07:48.990" style="s2">Enlightenment right and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.900" end="00:07:51.930" style="s2">Enlightenment rejection of tradition as</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.990" end="00:07:53.910" style="s2">an oppressive it&#39;s a gnostic attitude</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.930" end="00:07:57.720" style="s2">right it&#39;s in the pejorative sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.910" end="00:07:59.669" style="s2">gnostic the rejection of tradition as an</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.720" end="00:08:04.860" style="s2">oppressive structure right that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.669" end="00:08:07.020" style="s2">keeping us you know from the promised</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.860" end="00:08:09.389" style="s2">future or something like that and then I</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.020" end="00:08:12.080" style="s2">think that is bound up with what we were</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.389" end="00:08:17.070" style="s2">also discussing this truncation of</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.080" end="00:08:19.860" style="s2">rationality down to basically monologic</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.070" end="00:08:22.110" style="s2">inferential argumentation and losing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.860" end="00:08:23.789" style="s2">connection with ratio and logos those</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.110" end="00:08:25.860" style="s2">two things seem to be coming to meet</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.789" end="00:08:28.159" style="s2">together at sort of a historical moment</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.860" end="00:08:31.320" style="s2">in the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.159" end="00:08:34.709" style="s2">mmm-hmm and that&#39;s pertinent to me</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.320" end="00:08:35.880" style="s2">because we have people obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.709" end="00:08:38.279" style="s2">person that comes to mind is Steven</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.880" end="00:08:41.550" style="s2">Pinker yeah basically saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.279" end="00:08:44.250" style="s2">enlightenment now right the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.550" end="00:08:46.800" style="s2">the doubling down right the the the idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.250" end="00:08:49.200" style="s2">the problem is we were just we just not</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.800" end="00:08:51.300" style="s2">accepting how really really wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:53.520" style="s2">the Enlightenment is and and again to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.300" end="00:08:54.490" style="s2">high daguerreian about this is to not</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.520" end="00:08:57.110" style="s2">deny</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.490" end="00:08:59.780" style="s2">seriously to not deny everything the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.110" end="00:09:02.930" style="s2">Enlightenment has given us right and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.780" end="00:09:06.650" style="s2">you know science isn&#39;t is an important</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.930" end="00:09:08.720" style="s2">thing I&#39;m a scientist I value it you</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.650" end="00:09:11.560" style="s2">know the increase in in healthcare that</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.720" end="00:09:14.660" style="s2">is not a minor thing in human existence</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.560" end="00:09:16.610" style="s2">etc so not and he puts up all of his</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.660" end="00:09:18.200" style="s2">graphs and there&#39;s note there there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.610" end="00:09:19.430" style="s2">denying that well actually some of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.200" end="00:09:21.440" style="s2">graphs I think are controversial but</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.430" end="00:09:23.450" style="s2">there&#39;s no denying most of the graphs</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.440" end="00:09:25.370" style="s2">but that&#39;s but there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.450" end="00:09:27.590" style="s2">the graphs for all the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.370" end="00:09:30.740" style="s2">they&#39;re graphic they missed the point</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.590" end="00:09:34.310" style="s2">they missed the point in what the how</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.740" end="00:09:36.680" style="s2">the Enlightenment again cut us off from</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.310" end="00:09:40.370" style="s2">Rotti oh and cut us off from tradition</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.680" end="00:09:43.370" style="s2">and in that significant deep way cut us</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.370" end="00:09:50.510" style="s2">off from a cultural cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.370" end="00:09:53.990" style="s2">for falling in love with being yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.510" end="00:09:56.630" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s you know to make a high</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.990" end="00:09:59.300" style="s2">to garyun point a full agreement the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.630" end="00:10:02.420" style="s2">trouble is and enlightenment forgets</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.300" end="00:10:06.080" style="s2">darkness concealment and yes in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.420" end="00:10:09.530" style="s2">horror right yes that part of the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.080" end="00:10:12.020" style="s2">is the horror yeah if you&#39;re not open to</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.530" end="00:10:14.270" style="s2">horror you&#39;re closed off to all and if</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.020" end="00:10:16.340" style="s2">you&#39;re closed off to all you wonder</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.270" end="00:10:18.800" style="s2">differs from curiosity in that wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.340" end="00:10:22.490" style="s2">everything into question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.800" end="00:10:24.860" style="s2">but yes and and on top of that you could</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.490" end="00:10:26.570" style="s2">say horror comes back to haunt you yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.860" end="00:10:27.980" style="s2">I&#39;m different level and more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.570" end="00:10:30.110" style="s2">and then you no longer even capable of</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.980" end="00:10:33.500" style="s2">dealing with it because you&#39;re not used</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.110" end="00:10:35.270" style="s2">to it being there being part at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.500" end="00:10:39.140" style="s2">heart of existence you could say what</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.270" end="00:10:45.530" style="s2">why is death so so extremely outsourced</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.140" end="00:10:48.470" style="s2">or the nine-hour epoch it&#39;s nobody spoke</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.530" end="00:10:50.450" style="s2">about the the loneliness of the dying</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.470" end="00:10:54.050" style="s2">that this is a tremendous societal</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.450" end="00:10:55.940" style="s2">problem but death itself what is it for</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.050" end="00:10:59.360" style="s2">the Greeks for the Greeks death is at</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.940" end="00:11:02.450" style="s2">the heart is an irresolvable mystery or</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.360" end="00:11:04.520" style="s2">problem at the heart of off of existence</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.450" end="00:11:06.800" style="s2">but for us today it&#39;s according to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.520" end="00:11:07.730" style="s2">Harare just a technical problem waiting</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.800" end="00:11:10.459" style="s2">to be solved</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.730" end="00:11:11.899" style="s2">right and and I think maybe pink it</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.459" end="00:11:14.509" style="s2">would be in agreement with her re here I</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.899" end="00:11:17.959" style="s2">don&#39;t know but when I interview you</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.509" end="00:11:20.869" style="s2">might know John Gray in is a British</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.959" end="00:11:24.109" style="s2">philosopher and in one of his books I</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.869" end="00:11:26.809" style="s2">think the soul of the marionette which</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.109" end="00:11:28.730" style="s2">is a reference to hang me from Christ he</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.809" end="00:11:30.439" style="s2">says that what he sees with this new</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.730" end="00:11:33.699" style="s2">enlightenment movement by people like</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.439" end="00:11:35.899" style="s2">Richard Dawkins and pink and others is</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.699" end="00:11:38.359" style="s2">what&#39;s the world they want to live in do</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.899" end="00:11:41.089" style="s2">they wants to live as in the machine</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.359" end="00:11:43.249" style="s2">stops in a in a bunker somewhere looking</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.089" end="00:11:45.079" style="s2">at graphs where they get new a news feed</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.249" end="00:11:47.449" style="s2">every day how much better the world is</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.079" end="00:11:49.699" style="s2">in terms of oh look it&#39;s all going</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.449" end="00:11:52.429" style="s2">moving upwards but what&#39;s hidden in</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.699" end="00:11:54.589" style="s2">these graphs is that even if we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.429" end="00:11:57.850" style="s2">all the best health care and people live</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.589" end="00:12:00.799" style="s2">longer etc the intricacies to prop the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.850" end="00:12:03.290" style="s2">existential problems of being a human</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.799" end="00:12:08.419" style="s2">beings don&#39;t go away they don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.290" end="00:12:11.480" style="s2">disappear they&#39;re still right you still</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.419" end="00:12:15.079" style="s2">have to die you still face all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.480" end="00:12:17.989" style="s2">horror but everyone else has faced and</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.079" end="00:12:20.779" style="s2">and hopefully not as bad as some some</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.989" end="00:12:23.739" style="s2">have had to go through but still this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.779" end="00:12:27.499" style="s2">not it forgets darkness this</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.739" end="00:12:29.629" style="s2">enlightenment movement but it it brings</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.499" end="00:12:31.910" style="s2">back another kind of darkness right if</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.629" end="00:12:34.220" style="s2">you keep staring at the Sun the Sun will</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.910" end="00:12:36.949" style="s2">turn dark you will turn blind you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.220" end="00:12:39.289" style="s2">just be in sheer light all the time yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.949" end="00:12:42.439" style="s2">yes I agree with that I think that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.289" end="00:12:44.419" style="s2">very very well said yeah it strikes me</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.439" end="00:12:47.259" style="s2">even if we move to the sort of popular</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.419" end="00:12:51.679" style="s2">culture because I talked about this in</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.259" end="00:12:53.600" style="s2">talk about how even in my class how in</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.679" end="00:12:55.129" style="s2">fact even many of the movies we call</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.600" end="00:12:57.379" style="s2">horror movies are not horror movies</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.129" end="00:12:59.209" style="s2">they&#39;re just you know they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.379" end="00:13:00.619" style="s2">I call them startled and puncture movies</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.209" end="00:13:02.299" style="s2">they&#39;re just movies that are designed to</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.619" end="00:13:04.160" style="s2">give us more and more intense</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.299" end="00:13:06.499" style="s2">experiences of our fear of predation</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.160" end="00:13:08.299" style="s2">we&#39;re wired to be afraid of predators</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.499" end="00:13:11.119" style="s2">because we you know are you know all of</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.299" end="00:13:13.759" style="s2">the previously we would preyed on for</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.119" end="00:13:15.230" style="s2">very long time so that deep in us so we</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.759" end="00:13:18.110" style="s2">can push that button just like you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.230" end="00:13:20.140" style="s2">push you know the glucose button and</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.110" end="00:13:22.870" style="s2">people will gorge on sugar and they will</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.140" end="00:13:24.910" style="s2">or John the fear of predation but</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.870" end="00:13:27.730" style="s2">there&#39;s very few movies that actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.910" end="00:13:29.560" style="s2">give you like there should be something</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.730" end="00:13:31.360" style="s2">that&#39;s on the same scale lives just</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.560" end="00:13:33.640" style="s2">should be an aspect of wonder in horror</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.360" end="00:13:36.790" style="s2">like in wonder you call yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.640" end="00:13:39.610" style="s2">your grip on reality right into question</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.790" end="00:13:41.260" style="s2">and whorish be like where you and your</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.610" end="00:13:43.060" style="s2">sense of self and your sense of your</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.260" end="00:13:45.010" style="s2">grip on things it&#39;s called radically</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.060" end="00:13:47.110" style="s2">into question now there are some I found</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.010" end="00:13:49.720" style="s2">a few there are a couple of movies that</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.110" end="00:13:51.160" style="s2">do do that they try to do horror but I</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.720" end="00:13:52.620" style="s2">think it bespeaks the point we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.160" end="00:13:55.270" style="s2">talking about that popular culture</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.620" end="00:13:58.840" style="s2">actually also and this is such a high to</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.270" end="00:14:01.540" style="s2">get in thing a it hides horror under the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.840" end="00:14:04.000" style="s2">mask of what it calls for it actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.540" end="00:14:06.670" style="s2">prevents us from encountering more yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.000" end="00:14:08.890" style="s2">right and we can get this mask on front</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.670" end="00:14:11.920" style="s2">of it which makes it basically a monster</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.890" end="00:14:13.420" style="s2">to be killed like all you have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.920" end="00:14:15.400" style="s2">actually if you can just face your</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.420" end="00:14:18.640" style="s2">favorite predation and turn and face the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.400" end="00:14:22.660" style="s2">monster yeah there dr. Don right kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.640" end="00:14:26.560" style="s2">thing where there&#39;s no right horror</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.660" end="00:14:31.510" style="s2">should should leave you with a mystery</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.560" end="00:14:33.700" style="s2">that undermines your sense of you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.510" end="00:14:35.860" style="s2">ultimate security that&#39;s part of what</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.700" end="00:14:38.170" style="s2">horror should do for you a joke it</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.860" end="00:14:41.260" style="s2">should be like it should having us in my</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.170" end="00:14:43.180" style="s2">to my mind it should have aspects I</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.260" end="00:14:47.890" style="s2">think it is just psychologically it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.180" end="00:14:50.380" style="s2">not a continuum with awe and Wonder yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.890" end="00:14:55.120" style="s2">so yeah there&#39;s something you said about</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.380" end="00:14:58.240" style="s2">about like bringing in a contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.120" end="00:15:00.250" style="s2">culture right I was like where is it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.240" end="00:15:04.000" style="s2">this is one of the things I&#39;m I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.250" end="00:15:07.960" style="s2">I&#39;m getting more of a sense of okay to</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.000" end="00:15:10.330" style="s2">relate with to look for the place that</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.960" end="00:15:14.650" style="s2">where we can genuinely find the horror</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.330" end="00:15:17.050" style="s2">right is the senses which what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.650" end="00:15:21.820" style="s2">interesting is that and this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.050" end="00:15:25.660" style="s2">the things about the this notion of like</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.820" end="00:15:29.710" style="s2">detect the age of technology right is is</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.660" end="00:15:31.420" style="s2">that for example when I go to actually I</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.710" end="00:15:33.100" style="s2">was in Atlanta visiting my mom she lives</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.420" end="00:15:35.530" style="s2">in Atlanta and we</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.100" end="00:15:38.130" style="s2">went to this some this temple that they</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.530" end="00:15:43.870" style="s2">had actually shipped over block-by-block</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.130" end="00:15:49.390" style="s2">from India and was a it was a like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.870" end="00:15:52.000" style="s2">like a Hindu temple like to the however</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.390" end="00:15:55.360" style="s2">I went in there and the whole thing and</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.000" end="00:15:58.600" style="s2">every single part of it was carved and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.360" end="00:16:00.370" style="s2">animated and told a story and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.600" end="00:16:01.960" style="s2">even know what the story was I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.370" end="00:16:05.050" style="s2">understand it but like you just it</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.960" end="00:16:08.770" style="s2">communicated just this deep sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.050" end="00:16:12.630" style="s2">this ever and fractal in sense of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.770" end="00:16:15.670" style="s2">recognition of being nothing everything</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.630" end="00:16:17.110" style="s2">like did you get to the you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.670" end="00:16:21.100" style="s2">senator thing you look up and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.110" end="00:16:23.320" style="s2">this like it goes into it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.100" end="00:16:26.410" style="s2">walking out you&#39;re just like present man</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.320" end="00:16:29.260" style="s2">like vibrating it and then we walk back</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.410" end="00:16:31.870" style="s2">out and I looked up and I looked across</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.260" end="00:16:34.210" style="s2">the street and there&#39;s this like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.870" end="00:16:36.700" style="s2">this shopping center thang</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.210" end="00:16:40.150" style="s2">and there&#39;s the people walking along and</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.700" end="00:16:46.810" style="s2">like this awful there&#39;s a whole road</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.150" end="00:16:49.270" style="s2">right with ya and I just I was so struck</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.810" end="00:16:51.010" style="s2">and horrified but here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.270" end="00:16:55.320" style="s2">that&#39;s like here&#39;s the thing that seems</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.010" end="00:16:58.180" style="s2">horrifying it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.320" end="00:17:01.750" style="s2">we live in places like that and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.180" end="00:17:03.910" style="s2">they exist it&#39;s that and that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.750" end="00:17:06.550" style="s2">horrifying the horror is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.910" end="00:17:11.470" style="s2">everybody&#39;s walking around and nobody is</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.550" end="00:17:13.260" style="s2">saying this is horrible right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.470" end="00:17:17.470" style="s2">very few people that are walking around</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.260" end="00:17:20.050" style="s2">you&#39;re just in the flow of it but</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.470" end="00:17:22.390" style="s2">they&#39;re as you as you look like at these</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.050" end="00:17:24.190" style="s2">houses that are the same it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.390" end="00:17:26.830" style="s2">little bit of difference like buildings</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.190" end="00:17:29.130" style="s2">are built to look like something right</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.830" end="00:17:31.600" style="s2">versus being something right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.130" end="00:17:34.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a that&#39;s where I feel a</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.600" end="00:17:36.880" style="s2">particular if the thing the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.150" end="00:17:39.040" style="s2">is horrifying and fascinating and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.880" end="00:17:41.350" style="s2">wondering if this is like an example of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.040" end="00:17:44.230" style="s2">starting to actually look at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.350" end="00:17:46.760" style="s2">withdrawal right seeing the withdrawal</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.230" end="00:17:48.530" style="s2">and being in relationship to it</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.760" end="00:17:50.990" style="s2">is it seems like part of the withdrawal</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.530" end="00:17:51.980" style="s2">is no one is noticing the withdrawal</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.990" end="00:17:55.700" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.980" end="00:17:58.370" style="s2">isn&#39;t that what well yeah Nietzsche says</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.700" end="00:18:00.200" style="s2">in the genealogy of morality and to all</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.370" end="00:18:02.300" style="s2">these P also speaks at the holder of och</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.200" end="00:18:06.130" style="s2">we so the shihoro of emptiness and he</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.300" end="00:18:10.790" style="s2">says rather than not willing the will</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.130" end="00:18:13.130" style="s2">wants nothing right so I just I&#39;d rather</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.790" end="00:18:15.410" style="s2">become a great destroyer yeah yeah Fromm</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.130" end="00:18:17.750" style="s2">said that too right wait and when people</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.410" end="00:18:19.130" style="s2">can&#39;t make anything they&#39;d rather than</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.750" end="00:18:21.410" style="s2">doing nothing they&#39;d rather smash</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.130" end="00:18:24.430" style="s2">everything down because at least at</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.410" end="00:18:28.460" style="s2">least they&#39;ve got the last vestiges of</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.430" end="00:18:30.800" style="s2">their agency yeah so I wondering what</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.460" end="00:18:32.780" style="s2">about what I just said there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.800" end="00:18:33.740" style="s2">in which people and I mean that was part</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.780" end="00:18:34.670" style="s2">of the whole book that I wrote with</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.740" end="00:18:37.310" style="s2">Chris said Philip</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.670" end="00:18:39.650" style="s2">like a zombie the zombie is is the is</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.310" end="00:18:41.840" style="s2">the being that is completely unaware of</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.650" end="00:18:44.060" style="s2">the fact that it&#39;s a zombie that it</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.840" end="00:18:45.800" style="s2">disconnected from the world from itself</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.060" end="00:18:47.750" style="s2">from its trip the zombie is all of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.800" end="00:18:50.420" style="s2">disconnections unaware of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.750" end="00:18:53.360" style="s2">disconnections and it&#39;s a symbol but you</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.420" end="00:18:56.540" style="s2">know Leo and Anderson I we&#39;ve reviewed a</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.360" end="00:18:57.980" style="s2">couple of movies on the week that are</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.540" end="00:19:01.790" style="s2">going to come out in the mind immediacy</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.980" end="00:19:06.110" style="s2">with Joker in which you see a shift from</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.790" end="00:19:08.270" style="s2">the zombie to something were and it goes</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.110" end="00:19:10.820" style="s2">to the point we just spoke about where</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.270" end="00:19:13.580" style="s2">now of course the Joker exploiters here</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.820" end="00:19:15.140" style="s2">by the way spoilers Joker&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.580" end="00:19:17.180" style="s2">meaning crisis I think that&#39;s very clear</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.140" end="00:19:19.430" style="s2">because you know all of the tropes of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.180" end="00:19:21.800" style="s2">meaning you know his connection to his</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.430" end="00:19:24.470" style="s2">past is undermined if the very story</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.800" end="00:19:25.820" style="s2">that we&#39;re watching we lose any sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.470" end="00:19:29.090" style="s2">dramatic irony because we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.820" end="00:19:31.700" style="s2">what&#39;s real and not in it right his name</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.090" end="00:19:33.950" style="s2">is oxymoronic he&#39;s Arthur the great king</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.700" end="00:19:35.810" style="s2">Fleck I mean is immediately a</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.950" end="00:19:38.930" style="s2">meaningless piece of crap the Arthur</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.810" end="00:19:41.540" style="s2">flack like you know come getting pounded</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.930" end="00:19:44.240" style="s2">over the head and then we see him sort</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.540" end="00:19:47.990" style="s2">of devolve into all he wants is whatever</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.240" end="00:19:51.080" style="s2">kind of attention is left right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.990" end="00:19:52.820" style="s2">all right there&#39;s no meaning no value no</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.080" end="00:19:56.600" style="s2">connectedness it&#39;s just it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.820" end="00:19:58.610" style="s2">sheer it&#39;s even beyond like even beyond</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.600" end="00:20:01.090" style="s2">sort of destructiveness it&#39;s just right</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.610" end="00:20:04.630" style="s2">the you know that the last</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.090" end="00:20:05.780" style="s2">narcissism is the last vestige of</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.630" end="00:20:08.600" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.780" end="00:20:10.370" style="s2">well at least you know things are people</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.600" end="00:20:12.290" style="s2">are still paying attention to me and</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.370" end="00:20:16.070" style="s2">then what was interesting about that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.290" end="00:20:17.870" style="s2">you know the way the way again what</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.070" end="00:20:20.480" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about instead of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.870" end="00:20:25.610" style="s2">shuffling zombies at the shopping mall</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.480" end="00:20:28.540" style="s2">you have the angry crowd in riot focused</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.610" end="00:20:32.810" style="s2">on a figure that&#39;s not a leader in any</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.540" end="00:20:35.120" style="s2">sense but who what who what what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.810" end="00:20:37.160" style="s2">doing is he&#39;s trying to make the</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.120" end="00:20:39.590" style="s2">environment as absurd as his own</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.160" end="00:20:42.050" style="s2">narcissism because that&#39;s the last bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.590" end="00:20:43.970" style="s2">of conformity that&#39;s possible for him</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.050" end="00:20:46.730" style="s2">that&#39;s the last bit of him having a</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.970" end="00:20:49.460" style="s2">connection to reality available to him</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.730" end="00:20:52.580" style="s2">right and so you I think and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.460" end="00:20:55.550" style="s2">that that movie was so like popular and</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.580" end="00:20:57.530" style="s2">got so much attention yes I people</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.550" end="00:20:59.630" style="s2">aren&#39;t talking about it and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.530" end="00:21:02.870" style="s2">right guy there&#39;s still zombies but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.630" end="00:21:04.970" style="s2">afraid that we&#39;re actually moving</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.870" end="00:21:07.760" style="s2">something beyond them not talking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.970" end="00:21:09.980" style="s2">it I think we&#39;re moving to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.760" end="00:21:13.490" style="s2">possibility that they might start acting</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.980" end="00:21:15.050" style="s2">out from it not acting on it but you</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.490" end="00:21:16.940" style="s2">know how we talk about somebody acting</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.050" end="00:21:18.890" style="s2">out like when they&#39;re acting out like</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.940" end="00:21:21.200" style="s2">when a child is acting out an issue that</p>

<p begin="00:23:31.740" end="00:23:36.780" style="s2">I think what we&#39;re pushing against is is</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.530" end="00:23:38.820" style="s2">is you can call it late modern</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.780" end="00:23:43.590" style="s2">subjectivity hyper-modern subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.820" end="00:23:48.300" style="s2">exactly subjectivity collapsing into</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.590" end="00:23:50.850" style="s2">itself and it&#39;s this it&#39;s it&#39;s becoming</p>

<p begin="00:23:55.020" end="00:23:59.310" style="s2">descartes and others right absolute</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.420" end="00:24:01.320" style="s2">sense of certainty is now collapsing and</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.310" end="00:24:04.020" style="s2">all I&#39;m left with is as you said is this</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.320" end="00:24:07.110" style="s2">absurdity is being unfolding as absurd</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.020" end="00:24:11.040" style="s2">and now all I can do to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.110" end="00:24:13.380" style="s2">anything or posit myself again is by</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.040" end="00:24:16.500" style="s2">acts of sheer and outs of brutal</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.380" end="00:24:18.870" style="s2">violence for example bring my horror</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.500" end="00:24:20.490" style="s2">that I can&#39;t cope with because the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.870" end="00:24:22.590" style="s2">isn&#39;t supposed to be horrible but</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.490" end="00:24:24.840" style="s2">somehow it&#39;s completely absurd I bring</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.590" end="00:24:25.320" style="s2">this horror into the world and I assert</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.840" end="00:24:27.120" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.320" end="00:24:29.429" style="s2">outwit and give myself some certainty</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.120" end="00:24:33.090" style="s2">before I ultimately collapse what I see</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.429" end="00:24:37.200" style="s2">in all of the madness is subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.090" end="00:24:39.570" style="s2">pushing to its utmost limited I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.200" end="00:24:43.230" style="s2">that was beautifully said I think that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.570" end="00:24:45.480" style="s2">think that I think that developed my</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.230" end="00:24:46.830" style="s2">point very well I I really like what you</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.480" end="00:24:50.429" style="s2">just said I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.830" end="00:24:55.710" style="s2">an that dimension you added is</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.429" end="00:24:58.200" style="s2">insightful yeah it&#39;s interesting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.710" end="00:25:00.539" style="s2">kind of like there is this there was a</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.200" end="00:25:03.870" style="s2">sense of that movie actually right as</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.539" end="00:25:07.139" style="s2">everyone gathered along did it looked</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.870" end="00:25:12.330" style="s2">very much like some of the some of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.139" end="00:25:14.460" style="s2">the protests at Berkeley right like I</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.330" end="00:25:15.779" style="s2">remember walking out one time I used to</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.460" end="00:25:17.759" style="s2">live right across the street from</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.779" end="00:25:22.169" style="s2">Berkeley like the main the main campus</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.759" end="00:25:24.809" style="s2">and I we had a meeting and helicopters</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.169" end="00:25:27.450" style="s2">were going and you&#39;re hearing noises and</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.809" end="00:25:29.309" style="s2">there&#39;s riots and and it was just I</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.450" end="00:25:31.889" style="s2">don&#39;t know it was like Ben Shapiro or</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.309" end="00:25:36.360" style="s2">something speaking right and I walk</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.889" end="00:25:38.580" style="s2">outside and there was literally the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.360" end="00:25:42.509" style="s2">hammer and sickle spray-painted on all</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.580" end="00:25:43.980" style="s2">the buildings and it was this um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.509" end="00:25:45.960" style="s2">interesting because I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.980" end="00:25:48.990" style="s2">this sense of like it was like it was a</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.960" end="00:25:51.480" style="s2">very moral stance like how could you</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.990" end="00:25:54.059" style="s2">have this whatever whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.480" end="00:25:57.149" style="s2">assertion was about that person but it</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.059" end="00:26:02.100" style="s2">was like an can it was eerie walking out</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.149" end="00:26:04.740" style="s2">in in the streets afterwards and yet it</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.100" end="00:26:08.179" style="s2">was very tied to a morality weirdly</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.740" end="00:26:10.889" style="s2">enough and I&#39;m and I&#39;m just I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.179" end="00:26:13.289" style="s2">when we at the end of that movie when</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.889" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">everyone was like all right like told</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.289" end="00:26:18.690" style="s2">them reality there&#39;s no I do anything</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:21.149" style="s2">yeah and I mean and the thing is I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.690" end="00:26:22.470" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to get into the politics of</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.149" end="00:26:24.659" style="s2">this yeah yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.470" end="00:26:27.299" style="s2">their it but but there is there is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.659" end="00:26:31.649" style="s2">collapsing of morality to the assertion</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.299" end="00:26:33.120" style="s2">of rules and propositions so morality in</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.649" end="00:26:36.210" style="s2">those kinds of protests has been</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.120" end="00:26:38.860" style="s2">divested from virtue it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.210" end="00:26:40.870" style="s2">disconnected from virtue in and</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.860" end="00:26:43.570" style="s2">really really important ways that needs</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.870" end="00:26:45.370" style="s2">to be talked about again I don&#39;t I I</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.570" end="00:26:47.320" style="s2">don&#39;t want to claim that people within a</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.370" end="00:26:50.559" style="s2">democracy shouldn&#39;t protest obviously</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.320" end="00:26:52.870" style="s2">good etc I&#39;m not I&#39;m clearly not saying</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.559" end="00:26:55.360" style="s2">that but what I&#39;m talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.870" end="00:26:58.029" style="s2">content in which the protest is</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.360" end="00:26:59.350" style="s2">expressed not the fact or the goal of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.029" end="00:27:01.210" style="s2">the protest okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.350" end="00:27:03.549" style="s2">so let&#39;s be clear about that now they</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.210" end="00:27:05.529" style="s2">may act or the goal of protest when</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.549" end="00:27:07.090" style="s2">talking about the content in which it</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.529" end="00:27:09.880" style="s2">expressed and whether or not that</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.090" end="00:27:12.909" style="s2">expression actually sits well with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.880" end="00:27:13.779" style="s2">fact and the goals of protest I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.909" end="00:27:16.510" style="s2">claims to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.779" end="00:27:18.250" style="s2">it makes moral claims but when you when</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.510" end="00:27:20.200" style="s2">you separate morality I think from</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.250" end="00:27:23.350" style="s2">virtue especially the virtue the virtues</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.200" end="00:27:25.769" style="s2">of wisdom and courage right and software</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.350" end="00:27:28.929" style="s2">son then that your protestations</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.769" end="00:27:32.649" style="s2">literally about justice are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.929" end="00:27:35.169" style="s2">very hollow in an important sense that</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.649" end="00:27:37.480" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about you know and then so</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.169" end="00:27:39.789" style="s2">I see that as actually what you get sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.480" end="00:27:42.070" style="s2">of before you get what you see in Joker</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.789" end="00:27:43.990" style="s2">which is you&#39;re pointing to you get the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.070" end="00:27:46.899" style="s2">Prout the protest that is just protest</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.990" end="00:27:48.669" style="s2">yeah it serves absolutely it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.899" end="00:27:52.539" style="s2">it&#39;s not even it&#39;s even giving up the</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.669" end="00:27:54.130" style="s2">pretense of virtue signaling or or</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.539" end="00:27:57.309" style="s2">making moral assertions it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.130" end="00:27:59.380" style="s2">smashing and anger and let&#39;s just let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.309" end="00:28:02.769" style="s2">make everything let&#39;s just let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.380" end="00:28:06.130" style="s2">break apart whatever structures are left</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.769" end="00:28:10.590" style="s2">because structure itself intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.130" end="00:28:12.909" style="s2">itself has now become oppressive to us</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.590" end="00:28:14.559" style="s2">yeah I agree with that I agree and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.909" end="00:28:17.230" style="s2">think that&#39;s that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.559" end="00:28:18.340" style="s2">hmm now you see where we are we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.230" end="00:28:20.350" style="s2">the Hat we&#39;re in the depths of the</p>

<p begin="00:29:51.640" end="00:29:57.220" style="s2">looking at and then that&#39;s a wall yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.370" end="00:29:59.110" style="s2">right that&#39;s a wall right if I can&#39;t see</p>

<p begin="00:30:08.110" end="00:30:13.270" style="s2">think I think that is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.130" end="00:30:15.070" style="s2">you&#39;re pointing to with what you said</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.270" end="00:30:17.590" style="s2">and I that that&#39;s how I that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.070" end="00:30:19.330" style="s2">placed so much they can talk a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.590" end="00:30:21.400" style="s2">the transparency opacity shifting of</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.330" end="00:30:23.110" style="s2">attention and we have to remember that</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.400" end="00:30:25.750" style="s2">and then we have to somehow work that</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.110" end="00:30:30.760" style="s2">back into our understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.750" end="00:30:34.120" style="s2">understanding yeah yeah standing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.760" end="00:30:36.370" style="s2">because what I think is that just in</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.120" end="00:30:38.530" style="s2">mind that what you just said is so we</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.370" end="00:30:41.200" style="s2">look at someone like 50 all right for 50</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.530" end="00:30:44.230" style="s2">50 says something along the lines of I</p>

<p begin="00:30:44.230" end="00:30:47.770" style="s2">to say that because nature is just</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.700" end="00:30:50.320" style="s2">fiction for him yeah you have ego and</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.770" end="00:30:52.360" style="s2">Schelling could try to rescue nature a</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.320" end="00:30:55.030" style="s2">bit but that had didn&#39;t really work out</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.360" end="00:30:57.040" style="s2">and what I&#39;m trying to say said what the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.030" end="00:30:59.380" style="s2">trajectory were on is it the self</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.040" end="00:31:02.710" style="s2">certainty of the self asserting self</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.380" end="00:31:04.390" style="s2">referential subject or ego has lost its</p>

<p begin="00:31:04.390" end="00:31:07.919" style="s2">it was importantly</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.269" end="00:31:09.989" style="s2">and because God let&#39;s not forget God</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.919" end="00:31:10.950" style="s2">it&#39;s a hypothesis that Laplace no longer</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.989" end="00:31:13.589" style="s2">needs right</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.950" end="00:31:15.809" style="s2">God is a hypothesis that Descartes needs</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.589" end="00:31:16.919" style="s2">in order to guarantee that the world out</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.809" end="00:31:19.739" style="s2">there is actually there</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.919" end="00:31:20.909" style="s2">it says the ancients and make sure</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.739" end="00:31:23.459" style="s2">they&#39;re actually all these people out</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.909" end="00:31:25.169" style="s2">there they&#39;re not robots / psalm bees</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.459" end="00:31:27.089" style="s2">but they&#39;re actually human beings God</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.169" end="00:31:28.799" style="s2">makes sure of that but I can&#39;t really be</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.089" end="00:31:32.070" style="s2">sure of that myself because all I know</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.799" end="00:31:34.559" style="s2">is meaning me and once this certainty</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.070" end="00:31:37.999" style="s2">disappears once the cows are Suey this</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.559" end="00:31:42.029" style="s2">ungodly is non God like God just</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.999" end="00:31:44.459" style="s2">evaporates into a never exploding non</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.029" end="00:31:47.729" style="s2">cosmos and black holes what we&#39;re left</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.459" end="00:31:51.749" style="s2">with is something subjectivity doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.729" end="00:31:55.499" style="s2">know and can&#39;t make sense of so hence it</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.749" end="00:31:58.320" style="s2">it&#39;s as you said stuck in a wall fucker</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.499" end="00:31:59.909" style="s2">in itself and it reacts violently and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.320" end="00:32:02.129" style="s2">keep saying it&#39;s because I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.909" end="00:32:03.899" style="s2">pin it down on anyone right now because</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.129" end="00:32:07.649" style="s2">I think it is ultimately structural</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.899" end="00:32:11.519" style="s2">historical yeah but but there is to me</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.649" end="00:32:14.609" style="s2">at least it clearly are parts out of it</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.519" end="00:32:16.589" style="s2">and they have to do with what we talked</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.609" end="00:32:18.479" style="s2">about now is you could say you call it</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.589" end="00:32:21.450" style="s2">tradition you could call it sources or</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.479" end="00:32:23.849" style="s2">origin or wisdom sources of wisdom etc</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.450" end="00:32:26.339" style="s2">those would be fight that those will be</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.849" end="00:32:27.779" style="s2">different paths out of it into a</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.339" end="00:32:30.599" style="s2">different way of as you put an</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.779" end="00:32:34.200" style="s2">understanding of understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.599" end="00:32:37.529" style="s2">takes us out of ourselves and into this</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.200" end="00:32:40.919" style="s2">the non propositional commencing world</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.529" end="00:32:47.700" style="s2">oh well said well said beautifully said</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.919" end="00:32:49.709" style="s2">yes what did he just say here I just I</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.700" end="00:32:54.299" style="s2">wanted something hit you there I want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.709" end="00:32:57.329" style="s2">hear well I I got from that I think I</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.299" end="00:32:59.879" style="s2">agree with the idea that you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.329" end="00:33:03.719" style="s2">Descartes represents this pivot point in</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.879" end="00:33:06.179" style="s2">which the conformity to the world is</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.719" end="00:33:07.979" style="s2">withdrawn until the specious moment of</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.179" end="00:33:10.440" style="s2">self-conscious conformity with itself</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.979" end="00:33:14.129" style="s2">sort of pure subjectivity and what</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.440" end="00:33:16.200" style="s2">Descartes needs is he needs he needs he</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.129" end="00:33:17.650" style="s2">needs right something that gives him</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.200" end="00:33:19.750" style="s2">egress something that gives him a</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.650" end="00:33:21.730" style="s2">a way out of that and God is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.750" end="00:33:23.970" style="s2">do that and but this is the god of</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.730" end="00:33:26.560" style="s2">certainty right this is not the God of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.970" end="00:33:28.740" style="s2">sacredness this is the god of certainty</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.560" end="00:33:31.870" style="s2">and the problem is that God ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.740" end="00:33:34.830" style="s2">it operates as johannes says and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.870" end="00:33:39.070" style="s2">what we get is we get trapped within</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.830" end="00:33:40.510" style="s2">this subjectivity and i think it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.070" end="00:33:43.060" style="s2">even that it becomes opaque i would</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.510" end="00:33:46.840" style="s2">wanted to add that we it&#39;s collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.060" end="00:33:49.630" style="s2">because if what you&#39;re trying to find is</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.840" end="00:33:51.190" style="s2">the moment of certainty its vanish it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.630" end="00:33:53.350" style="s2">like it&#39;s like almost like a singularity</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.190" end="00:33:55.240" style="s2">you&#39;re vanishing and vanishing and</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.350" end="00:33:57.490" style="s2">vanishing towards it and so the wall is</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.240" end="00:33:59.230" style="s2">closing in and closing so rather than</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.490" end="00:34:00.490" style="s2">paranoia you&#39;ll haunt us I would suggest</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.230" end="00:34:03.880" style="s2">it might be something more like</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.490" end="00:34:09.730" style="s2">existential claustrophobia that we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.880" end="00:34:13.659" style="s2">right that&#39;s what I heard</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.730" end="00:34:15.340" style="s2">that&#39;s what I heard him saying yeah hey</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.659" end="00:34:18.429" style="s2">something is something about like if I</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.340" end="00:34:19.390" style="s2">just sit if I sit with all right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.429" end="00:34:22.570" style="s2">like there&#39;s a sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.390" end="00:34:26.649" style="s2">claustrophobia I am like I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.570" end="00:34:30.220" style="s2">closed in right and the rages come out</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.649" end="00:34:34.179" style="s2">like joke boobies like all of that so if</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.220" end="00:34:38.040" style="s2">we bring in if we bring back in Nick</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.179" end="00:34:40.659" style="s2">Nick atashi the guy is returning yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.040" end="00:34:44.649" style="s2">funny I just find myself going like okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.659" end="00:34:46.899" style="s2">so what is so if that&#39;s how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.649" end="00:34:51.490" style="s2">happening this is what how things are</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.899" end="00:34:53.110" style="s2">occurring for us right yeah yeah if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.490" end="00:34:55.750" style="s2">look at it like I just thought about</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.110" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">this of like okay what would what would</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.750" end="00:35:01.360" style="s2">he do right and there&#39;s a sense of where</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:04.720" style="s2">I was like oh he would probably I just</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.360" end="00:35:12.790" style="s2">had this sense of it would just go and</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.720" end="00:35:14.790" style="s2">something you would think about and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.790" end="00:35:16.930" style="s2">think this is one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.790" end="00:35:19.150" style="s2">like kind of in a certain sense being</p>

<p begin="00:36:55.599" end="00:37:00.309" style="s2">is always emerging but never in some</p>

<p begin="00:37:00.309" end="00:37:05.259" style="s2">you can get and that the end of like you</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.039" end="00:37:06.640" style="s2">know and I think I think James was</p>

<p begin="00:37:16.900" end="00:37:22.299" style="s2">foundation you actually move into the no</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.420" end="00:37:27.099" style="s2">thingness you move into that aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.299" end="00:37:28.720" style="s2">mystery that is it is act I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.099" end="00:37:31.480" style="s2">this metaphor but it&#39;s at the center</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.720" end="00:37:33.519" style="s2">right you and so nishitani would point</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.480" end="00:37:35.470" style="s2">to the fact that if you follow it far</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.519" end="00:37:37.029" style="s2">enough in you find that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.470" end="00:37:39.910" style="s2">difference between moving in and moving</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.029" end="00:37:42.160" style="s2">out that there you find a different kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.910" end="00:37:44.559" style="s2">of conformity rather than the absurdity</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.160" end="00:37:45.550" style="s2">absurdity there&#39;s a deep conformity to</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.559" end="00:37:47.920" style="s2">between the know</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.550" end="00:37:50.950" style="s2">thickness and the no thickness and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.920" end="00:37:54.100" style="s2">that affords right that affords you</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.950" end="00:37:57.160" style="s2">moving back into an agog a that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.100" end="00:38:02.320" style="s2">see him basically articulating so that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.160" end="00:38:07.510" style="s2">if you can see the no thickness as that</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.320" end="00:38:11.190" style="s2">which affords radical transfer aiming</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.510" end="00:38:15.460" style="s2">rather than as the privation of</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.190" end="00:38:17.530" style="s2">graspable securable actuality then you</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.460" end="00:38:21.160" style="s2">can get out of you can get out of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.530" end="00:38:24.520" style="s2">the claustrophobia that&#39;s what I see him</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.160" end="00:38:26.500" style="s2">is saying it&#39;s because the West can only</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.520" end="00:38:28.360" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me to use these two</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.500" end="00:38:30.520" style="s2">words because the West can only</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.360" end="00:38:33.640" style="s2">represent no thickness as nothingness</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.520" end="00:38:35.980" style="s2">that it can&#39;t make that move and so all</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.640" end="00:38:40.000" style="s2">it does is P right it gets to that point</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.980" end="00:38:42.280" style="s2">it gets to that point yeah and then the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.000" end="00:38:45.130" style="s2">actuality we need actuality to come back</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.280" end="00:38:46.840" style="s2">to that source so what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.130" end="00:38:50.170" style="s2">that you&#39;re honest no but this is of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.840" end="00:38:53.640" style="s2">self is the actual yes rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.170" end="00:38:55.440" style="s2">potential or the possible sorry yeah yes</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.640" end="00:38:58.060" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.440" end="00:39:00.540" style="s2">I&#39;m sensei I&#39;m just sensing into that</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.060" end="00:39:02.980" style="s2">kind of figure ground shift of like</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.540" end="00:39:05.110" style="s2">reversal yeah it&#39;s a fundamental figure</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.980" end="00:39:07.090" style="s2">ground shift yes and it&#39;s not it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.110" end="00:39:11.980" style="s2">perspective a participatory thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.090" end="00:39:14.530" style="s2">not an argumentative thing yeah yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.980" end="00:39:17.020" style="s2">that equation it because argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.530" end="00:39:19.780" style="s2">always works within a stabilized</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.020" end="00:39:20.680" style="s2">perspective and an existential mode and</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.780" end="00:39:23.440" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.680" end="00:39:26.470" style="s2">reversal the argumentation can come</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.440" end="00:39:28.720" style="s2">after and perhaps engage in explication</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.470" end="00:39:30.640" style="s2">and elucidation but that the process</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.720" end="00:39:33.220" style="s2">itself is not an argumentative process</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.640" end="00:39:35.440" style="s2">right so it&#39;s like really like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.220" end="00:39:37.060" style="s2">wondering about just the sense of so</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.440" end="00:39:38.890" style="s2">when I kind of just feel into it like</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.060" end="00:39:42.130" style="s2">one thing is like I I sign my taneous</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.890" end="00:39:44.170" style="s2">League oh there&#39;s some kind of risk like</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.130" end="00:39:49.080" style="s2">if the walls Kerr coming in there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.170" end="00:39:49.080" style="s2">a risk I in some way actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.460" end="00:39:56.069" style="s2">I&#39;d almost like let go of all of Western</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.890" end="00:39:59.400" style="s2">metaphysics right like there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.069" end="00:40:03.630" style="s2">some kind of leap in there of uh of</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.400" end="00:40:06.240" style="s2">rather than pushing away but actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.630" end="00:40:08.849" style="s2">whatever the experience is I keep</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.240" end="00:40:10.319" style="s2">getting the sense of keep watching it</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.849" end="00:40:13.190" style="s2">not like I getting the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.319" end="00:40:17.760" style="s2">meditation in that sense of the word of</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.190" end="00:40:21.480" style="s2">some kind of vulnerability to be with</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.760" end="00:40:23.190" style="s2">the horror and everything that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.480" end="00:40:24.869" style="s2">talking about I&#39;m just sensing a certain</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.190" end="00:40:27.750" style="s2">kind of like a response is a certain</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.869" end="00:40:30.930" style="s2">kind of vulnerability there is I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.750" end="00:40:37.130" style="s2">mean within my own practice you get to</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.930" end="00:40:40.380" style="s2">this place where you step into sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.130" end="00:40:42.900" style="s2">because you can&#39;t grasp it you can only</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.380" end="00:40:44.250" style="s2">be it you can you can feel I&#39;ll use</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.900" end="00:40:46.230" style="s2">youngness as language because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.250" end="00:40:48.390" style="s2">perfectly appropriate actually for the</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.230" end="00:40:51.630" style="s2">phenomenology you feel the perpetual</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.390" end="00:40:54.809" style="s2">withdrawal the meditation right the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.630" end="00:40:57.210" style="s2">perpetual withdrawal you you suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.809" end="00:41:00.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like the back falls out from behind</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.210" end="00:41:01.950" style="s2">you that&#39;s why I like Jewish yes because</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.240" end="00:41:03.059" style="s2">in meditation you&#39;re stepping back and</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.950" end="00:41:04.529" style="s2">you&#39;re stepping back and you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.059" end="00:41:07.109" style="s2">at and you&#39;re looking at and then all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.529" end="00:41:09.930" style="s2">a sudden the what you&#39;re stepping back</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.109" end="00:41:12.329" style="s2">into it like and you get the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.930" end="00:41:15.920" style="s2">like that that&#39;s why I like that noise</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.329" end="00:41:19.289" style="s2">that you get that sense of you know of</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.920" end="00:41:21.000" style="s2">withdrawal which is not the sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.289" end="00:41:23.730" style="s2">thing it&#39;s not even the sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.000" end="00:41:25.319" style="s2">presence it&#39;s that I I have no other</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.730" end="00:41:27.240" style="s2">word for it it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.319" end="00:41:29.309" style="s2">phenomenological experience of the sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.240" end="00:41:31.579" style="s2">of withdrawal and that can be initially</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.309" end="00:41:33.809" style="s2">really really as you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.579" end="00:41:37.980" style="s2">horrifying to people it can be very</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.809" end="00:41:40.430" style="s2">horrified right yeah especially having</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.980" end="00:41:43.400" style="s2">got you know having had facilitated</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.430" end="00:41:48.000" style="s2">experiences of that horror that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.400" end="00:41:50.460" style="s2">like everything slipping away very thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.000" end="00:41:53.039" style="s2">that you just it&#39;s almost like the last</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.460" end="00:41:55.319" style="s2">bit of concern or care is glittering</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.039" end="00:41:57.599" style="s2">that and then at some point because then</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.319" end="00:41:58.950" style="s2">you&#39;re everywhere there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:42:01.109" style="s2">like that was a that&#39;s been my</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.950" end="00:42:03.329" style="s2">experiences with those places where I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.109" end="00:42:04.530" style="s2">done a Delic or I&#39;ve had an experience</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.329" end="00:42:07.110" style="s2">where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.530" end="00:42:09.600" style="s2">Oh like the ground starts to slip right</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.110" end="00:42:12.330" style="s2">and then I can&#39;t grip onto anything in</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.600" end="00:42:15.890" style="s2">that sense of and then there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.330" end="00:42:19.290" style="s2">like a some kind of threshold of where</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.890" end="00:42:21.450" style="s2">it feels like a death of some kind right</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.290" end="00:42:23.640" style="s2">in a dissolving and then this</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.450" end="00:42:26.910" style="s2">recognition that the whole time the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.640" end="00:42:29.760" style="s2">thing I&#39;m expanding into was present the</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.910" end="00:42:31.770" style="s2">whole time right somehow like and I just</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.760" end="00:42:34.170" style="s2">there was some way I was standing in</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.770" end="00:42:37.140" style="s2">relationship to it or identified it had</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.170" end="00:42:40.530" style="s2">it show itself as that which was</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.140" end="00:42:43.830" style="s2">horrifying just that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.530" end="00:42:46.950" style="s2">process yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.830" end="00:42:50.730" style="s2">that&#39;s it sounds very similar to what</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.950" end="00:42:52.440" style="s2">I&#39;m describing nishitani that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.730" end="00:42:54.000" style="s2">mean I mean obviously there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.440" end="00:42:55.350" style="s2">argumentation and religion and</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.000" end="00:42:58.110" style="s2">nothingness but religion and nothing</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.350" end="00:43:00.660" style="s2">this should not be read separate from a</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.110" end="00:43:03.210" style="s2">deep kind of meditative contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.660" end="00:43:05.640" style="s2">practice just like you shouldn&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.210" end="00:43:06.180" style="s2">the teletype Shen if you&#39;re not doing a</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.640" end="00:43:08.940" style="s2">Chi Chuan</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.180" end="00:43:14.060" style="s2">you hear you&#39;re just deeply not getting</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.940" end="00:43:15.740" style="s2">it in in a really important sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.060" end="00:43:18.360" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.740" end="00:43:20.490" style="s2">because I&#39;m interested in which people</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.360" end="00:43:23.880" style="s2">have these kinds of experiences because</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.490" end="00:43:26.480" style="s2">sometimes um the phenomenology is one of</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.880" end="00:43:31.320" style="s2">like almost like like I said this whoosh</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.480" end="00:43:35.430" style="s2">and then the other is it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s oh</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.320" end="00:43:37.590" style="s2">my gosh it&#39;s like it&#39;s all it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.430" end="00:43:39.630" style="s2">directional you know sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.590" end="00:43:43.250" style="s2">withdrawal feels that way but sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.630" end="00:43:45.660" style="s2">it feels more like everything is almost</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.250" end="00:43:53.660" style="s2">holographically everything is opening up</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.660" end="00:43:55.890" style="s2">hmm almost like sort of you know that</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.660" end="00:43:57.930" style="s2">helpful the tiniest describes the one</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.890" end="00:43:59.760" style="s2">you know all the forms are reflecting</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.930" end="00:44:01.710" style="s2">and interpenetrating each other but the</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.760" end="00:44:03.600" style="s2">one is what allows for all the opening</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.710" end="00:44:05.580" style="s2">up and interpenetration that is not</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.600" end="00:44:10.860" style="s2">actually in any one of the forms you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.580" end="00:44:13.710" style="s2">fake that get that to that that that has</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.860" end="00:44:16.840" style="s2">actually become more common for me than</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.710" end="00:44:20.020" style="s2">just just the withdrawal</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.840" end="00:44:24.580" style="s2">right right yeah that sounds very</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.020" end="00:44:28.390" style="s2">familiar - yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.580" end="00:44:30.010" style="s2">so the point I&#39;m get back to it the</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.390" end="00:44:32.920" style="s2">point nishitani is making of course is</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.010" end="00:44:34.510" style="s2">of course again you don&#39;t stop doing the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.920" end="00:44:37.750" style="s2">argumentation I&#39;m gonna keep saying that</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.510" end="00:44:39.400" style="s2">do you create religion and nothingness</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.750" end="00:44:42.010" style="s2">but you also do these perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.400" end="00:44:46.900" style="s2">participatory transformations and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.010" end="00:44:48.700" style="s2">there is some kind of allow me this</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.900" end="00:44:51.820" style="s2">metaphor this there&#39;s a deal logos</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.700" end="00:44:53.950" style="s2">between them that and and the response</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.820" end="00:44:56.500" style="s2">is in that dialogo so it&#39;s not in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.950" end="00:45:00.359" style="s2">text it&#39;s not just in the meditative</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.500" end="00:45:03.700" style="s2">practice but in the yeah Oh change it</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.359" end="00:45:05.590" style="s2">exactly like I started I started</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.700" end="00:45:06.250" style="s2">meditating I went to a good posture in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.590" end="00:45:09.369" style="s2">retreat</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.250" end="00:45:11.320" style="s2">right and then I think a few months</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.369" end="00:45:15.700" style="s2">after that is when I started reading</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.320" end="00:45:18.790" style="s2">being in time mmm and it I remember that</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.700" end="00:45:21.760" style="s2">it after reading being time and</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.790" end="00:45:25.210" style="s2">meditating couple hours a day back and</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.760" end="00:45:27.700" style="s2">forth that it it changed my meditation</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.210" end="00:45:30.850" style="s2">right yeah it was a kind of a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.700" end="00:45:32.800" style="s2">which you know like the reverse was also</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.850" end="00:45:35.380" style="s2">the case I respected the meditation</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.800" end="00:45:36.400" style="s2">afforded you seeing things in being in</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.380" end="00:45:38.830" style="s2">time that you wouldn&#39;t have otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:41.050" style="s2">seen that&#39;s what it we&#39;ve circled back</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.830" end="00:45:44.109" style="s2">around again about trying to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.050" end="00:45:46.030" style="s2">place of the philosopher rather than</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.109" end="00:45:48.520" style="s2">just gather their propositions and</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.030" end="00:45:50.200" style="s2">there&#39;s yeah there&#39;s all these and this</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.520" end="00:45:52.240" style="s2">is a law this was a lot for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.200" end="00:45:54.700" style="s2">in the Neoplatonic tradition that around</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.240" end="00:45:57.850" style="s2">the text was a whole ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.700" end="00:45:59.980" style="s2">practices and the text or the desk and</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.850" end="00:46:02.080" style="s2">the practices were always in dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.980" end="00:46:03.700" style="s2">with each other yeah and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.080" end="00:46:06.240" style="s2">Hado brought out so beautifully I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.700" end="00:46:12.520" style="s2">this was one of had those great points</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.240" end="00:46:15.880" style="s2">yeah not to make this too biographical</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.520" end="00:46:17.940" style="s2">about anyone but Heidegger had circles</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.880" end="00:46:20.410" style="s2">of students that he invited over for</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.940" end="00:46:21.940" style="s2">long extended sessions of simply</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.410" end="00:46:24.250" style="s2">thinking and sometimes they would</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.940" end="00:46:26.470" style="s2">collapse and sometimes they they</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.250" end="00:46:28.660" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t sometimes they were successful</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.470" end="00:46:32.170" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.660" end="00:46:35.980" style="s2">and yeah as you know he worked with my</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.170" end="00:46:40.750" style="s2">dad boss from the 50s to the late 60s</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.980" end="00:46:42.339" style="s2">who was a Swiss psychiatrist mmm in what</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.750" end="00:46:43.660" style="s2">was now published as the sole econ</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.339" end="00:46:46.809" style="s2">seminars and there are still people</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.660" end="00:46:48.609" style="s2">practicing designs analysis or</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.809" end="00:46:51.569" style="s2">existential therapy that came out of</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.609" end="00:46:54.430" style="s2">that so highly worked with psychiatrists</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.569" end="00:46:57.369" style="s2">for a decade or more until he couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.430" end="00:47:00.940" style="s2">anymore longer and that was his way of</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.369" end="00:47:02.319" style="s2">off of you know and he provoked them but</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.940" end="00:47:04.030" style="s2">because they were totally within a</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.319" end="00:47:07.630" style="s2">Cartesian framework they were very often</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.030" end="00:47:09.010" style="s2">out rich but what he said then you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.630" end="00:47:10.900" style="s2">begin with the ego you have to begin</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.010" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">here you have Madonna&#39;s I mean thousand</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.900" end="00:47:14.710" style="s2">is out in the world and it&#39;s being with</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.160" end="00:47:18.430" style="s2">others etc um but he but he never shied</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.710" end="00:47:20.829" style="s2">away from that he it was it was about</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.430" end="00:47:23.920" style="s2">bringing it into practice it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.829" end="00:47:26.349" style="s2">have been him to do it it would would</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.920" end="00:47:27.730" style="s2">need someone else to do it that was not</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.349" end="00:47:30.670" style="s2">his role and he was aware of this</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.730" end="00:47:32.260" style="s2">because for him this was antic this was</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.670" end="00:47:34.720" style="s2">something that others would have to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.260" end="00:47:39.490" style="s2">and but he provided the until ontology</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.720" end="00:47:42.430" style="s2">for that right his thinking and yes it</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.490" end="00:47:46.270" style="s2">needs practice and I see with students</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.430" end="00:47:48.460" style="s2">to I bet that it actually it it you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.270" end="00:47:50.920" style="s2">they come to university and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.460" end="00:47:52.450" style="s2">quite enthusiastic and after a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.920" end="00:47:56.170" style="s2">years they sound like everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.450" end="00:47:58.180" style="s2">and rather than still having because of</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.170" end="00:48:00.700" style="s2">what I always do it first seminar</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.180" end="00:48:03.279" style="s2">first-year students engineering</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.700" end="00:48:05.250" style="s2">philosophy why are you here that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.279" end="00:48:09.099" style="s2">first question</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.250" end="00:48:13.510" style="s2">sometimes again it is this relevant for</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.099" end="00:48:15.520" style="s2">the exam and some time but and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.510" end="00:48:23.049" style="s2">I get my mug everything I say will be on</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.520" end="00:48:25.150" style="s2">them and I bring it I keep bringing it</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.049" end="00:48:26.680" style="s2">back remember back the first lecture why</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.150" end="00:48:28.420" style="s2">did you come here because usually people</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.680" end="00:48:31.420" style="s2">are drawn to philosophy for a specific</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.420" end="00:48:33.279" style="s2">reason they&#39;re looking for something um</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.420" end="00:48:35.500" style="s2">what is it that they&#39;re looking for well</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.279" end="00:48:37.270" style="s2">usually they&#39;re looking for meaning why</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.500" end="00:48:39.789" style="s2">are they looking for meaning and why is</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.270" end="00:48:40.420" style="s2">it that I mean first of all why is it</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.789" end="00:48:42.910" style="s2">that perhaps like</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.420" end="00:48:44.890" style="s2">McClosky doesn&#39;t really do this or</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.910" end="00:48:49.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t acknowledge it but but second of</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.890" end="00:48:52.680" style="s2">all what is it that can be done should</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.720" end="00:48:55.510" style="s2">be done must be done in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.680" end="00:49:01.480" style="s2">providing again a space for these</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.510" end="00:49:03.310" style="s2">exercises practices etc yeah I agree I</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.480" end="00:49:05.710" style="s2">think I mentioned this to you last time</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.310" end="00:49:07.630" style="s2">yeah my discussion that I mean guy also</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.710" end="00:49:09.580" style="s2">knows this you know there are emerging</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.630" end="00:49:12.970" style="s2">communities of practice that are trying</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.580" end="00:49:15.970" style="s2">to create set ecologies of practices but</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.970" end="00:49:20.530" style="s2">what I often find is that that&#39;s missing</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.970" end="00:49:23.080" style="s2">from them is is philosophy a-- so</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.530" end="00:49:25.090" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of the other stuff around</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.080" end="00:49:26.560" style="s2">a lot of the things that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.090" end="00:49:28.150" style="s2">but there&#39;s mindfulness practices and</p>

<p begin="00:49:28.150" end="00:49:33.370" style="s2">discourse practices and narrative</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.550" end="00:49:35.230" style="s2">practices and all of this and don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.370" end="00:49:37.780" style="s2">me wrong I think this is great and I and</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.230" end="00:49:39.970" style="s2">I actively work to support and</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.780" end="00:49:44.410" style="s2">facilitate this but what I often find</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.970" end="00:49:49.630" style="s2">missing is the philosophy right and</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.410" end="00:49:53.050" style="s2">what&#39;s it what&#39;s what&#39;s uh what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.630" end="00:49:54.790" style="s2">interesting about that right he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.050" end="00:49:58.990" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering about like but did you</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.790" end="00:50:01.090" style="s2">correct me if I&#39;m wrong but the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.990" end="00:50:04.810" style="s2">religion without religion religion</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.090" end="00:50:07.180" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion that&#39;s my like I</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.810" end="00:50:09.570" style="s2">don&#39;t get the sense from it it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.180" end="00:50:12.670" style="s2">you&#39;re not looking to build a</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.570" end="00:50:19.300" style="s2">non-religious Church or something found</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.670" end="00:50:23.200" style="s2">a religion I will keep saying that and</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.300" end="00:50:25.420" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering about if the bring the</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.200" end="00:50:29.890" style="s2">thing that unites all of these practices</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.420" end="00:50:32.260" style="s2">the theory the philosophy awakening</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.890" end="00:50:34.420" style="s2">because to me this is about like</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.260" end="00:50:38.020" style="s2">philosophies about awakening the Wonder</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.420" end="00:50:41.920" style="s2">Ray and having that sense of things and</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.020" end="00:50:43.600" style="s2">I find with teaching people that there</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.920" end="00:50:46.690" style="s2">is a sense where you have to awaken it</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.600" end="00:50:49.290" style="s2">like in a oh yeah that&#39;s what I called</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.690" end="00:50:51.850" style="s2">it awakening for the meeting crisis it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.290" end="00:50:52.570" style="s2">it&#39;s because people aren&#39;t walking in</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.850" end="00:50:55.720" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.570" end="00:50:58.170" style="s2">Ernest and in fact the idea word</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.720" end="00:51:00.580" style="s2">philosophy they they will proactively</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.170" end="00:51:03.150" style="s2">feel that that&#39;s like assaulting or</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.580" end="00:51:05.500" style="s2">something to being her head or something</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.150" end="00:51:09.280" style="s2">like that so one of the things I found</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.500" end="00:51:12.370" style="s2">is it&#39;s like and I think I&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.280" end="00:51:16.180" style="s2">better as a teacher over the years in</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.370" end="00:51:19.390" style="s2">that sense of feeling the place where</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.180" end="00:51:21.250" style="s2">you can have them see it yes and you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.390" end="00:51:23.650" style="s2">see that moment where like they see</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.250" end="00:51:25.930" style="s2">something they experienced something</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.650" end="00:51:28.540" style="s2">that was right in front of them their</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.930" end="00:51:30.640" style="s2">whole lives yeah and it never there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.540" end="00:51:32.970" style="s2">all it never been questioned and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.640" end="00:51:35.440" style="s2">question and you can see that awakening</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.970" end="00:51:37.060" style="s2">categoría that&#39;s really what that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.440" end="00:51:40.120" style="s2">really what Socratic aporia is supposed</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.060" end="00:51:43.120" style="s2">to do yeah yeah YouTube what you thought</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.120" end="00:51:46.060" style="s2">you what was so familiar and so obvious</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.120" end="00:51:47.440" style="s2">suddenly is now mysterious team in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.060" end="00:51:50.890" style="s2">profound way I mean that&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.440" end="00:51:52.870" style="s2">point of Socratic aporia I agree i I</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.890" end="00:51:54.100" style="s2">mean that&#39;s that&#39;s why I and Johannes</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.870" end="00:51:56.020" style="s2">picked up on it that&#39;s why I try to make</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.100" end="00:51:59.920" style="s2">a distinction between philosophy which i</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.020" end="00:52:03.550" style="s2">think is still important by the way but</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.920" end="00:52:07.420" style="s2">and philosophy a-- which i think is is</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.550" end="00:52:09.310" style="s2">something more that i&#39;m not i&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.420" end="00:52:12.370" style="s2">i&#39;m neutral on whether or not everybody</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.310" end="00:52:14.800" style="s2">needs to do philosophy but i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.370" end="00:52:17.590" style="s2">everybody needs to practice and live</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.800" end="00:52:25.570" style="s2">philosophy a-- in a profound way and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.590" end="00:52:28.930" style="s2">I think those are because I guess I want</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.570" end="00:52:33.370" style="s2">I want to pick up on that that point you</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.930" end="00:52:35.830" style="s2">were making about you know you you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.370" end="00:52:38.290" style="s2">bring people to that point where they</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.830" end="00:52:40.210" style="s2">get well it&#39;s to use our metaphor you</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.290" end="00:52:42.610" style="s2">get you get a crack in the wall yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.210" end="00:52:44.620" style="s2">opening right it&#39;s like the Leonard</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.610" end="00:52:46.150" style="s2">Cohen line well you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.620" end="00:52:47.290" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s a crack and</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.150" end="00:52:51.670" style="s2">everything and that&#39;s how the light</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.290" end="00:52:54.790" style="s2">shines through all right um really yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.670" end="00:52:57.460" style="s2">I think everybody because of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.790" end="00:52:59.380" style="s2">in and where we are I think that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.460" end="00:53:02.860" style="s2">everybody ultimately needs philosophy ax</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.380" end="00:53:04.570" style="s2">so well I deeply applaud and I really</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.860" end="00:53:06.200" style="s2">and I put time and effort and talent</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.570" end="00:53:09.950" style="s2">into these emerging</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.200" end="00:53:13.339" style="s2">communities I think there is still right</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.950" end="00:53:15.290" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to get philosophy ax into them</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.339" end="00:53:16.820" style="s2">in some way that&#39;s why this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.290" end="00:53:18.380" style="s2">is very important by the way that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.820" end="00:53:19.640" style="s2">of the reasons I mean other than really</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.380" end="00:53:21.770" style="s2">liking you guys and enjoying the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.640" end="00:53:23.930" style="s2">conversation what I mean in this</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.770" end="00:53:25.579" style="s2">conversation is precisely because I want</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.930" end="00:53:28.460" style="s2">I think it&#39;s trying to do that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.579" end="00:53:31.520" style="s2">trying to bring philosophy ax into this</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.460" end="00:53:35.869" style="s2">attempt to get these Ecology&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.520" end="00:53:39.320" style="s2">practices going right on this point of</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.869" end="00:53:42.980" style="s2">philosophy ax perhaps also some other</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.320" end="00:53:47.750" style="s2">point we&#39;ll have to carve out what that</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.980" end="00:53:50.240" style="s2">is and what that means and you might</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.750" end="00:53:52.310" style="s2">disagree with this totally both of you I</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.240" end="00:53:54.380" style="s2">don&#39;t know but what are the dangers I</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.310" end="00:53:58.460" style="s2">see in Hegel speaks of this I think in</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.380" end="00:54:00.650" style="s2">the difference shift well he says it</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.460" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">would be absurd to call oneself up late</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.650" end="00:54:06.050" style="s2">in this today and and what I think what</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.160" end="00:54:09.290" style="s2">he means by this is that you you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.050" end="00:54:11.480" style="s2">just pick and choose no no you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.290" end="00:54:13.640" style="s2">just go back and say well I&#39;m an heiress</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.480" end="00:54:15.500" style="s2">I&#39;m a new in New York still I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.640" end="00:54:18.619" style="s2">Aristotelian i&#39;ma Clayton is a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.500" end="00:54:20.630" style="s2">I&#39;m this and that as if from a</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.619" end="00:54:23.150" style="s2">metaphysical supermarket because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.630" end="00:54:25.280" style="s2">very easy to do right I&#39;m gonna be a bit</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.150" end="00:54:27.530" style="s2">of a Buddhist over here I&#39;m gonna but</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.280" end="00:54:31.730" style="s2">what what does it mean that that we have</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.530" end="00:54:34.040" style="s2">this this rich source or origin but also</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.730" end="00:54:36.440" style="s2">this miss this burden of all of this</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.040" end="00:54:42.079" style="s2">knowledge because it philosophy is also</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.440" end="00:54:44.359" style="s2">extremely abstract and and and well it</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.079" end="00:54:47.750" style="s2">also is a burden to have access to all</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.359" end="00:54:49.700" style="s2">of that potential knowledge and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.750" end="00:54:51.800" style="s2">question is so if we use the word</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.700" end="00:54:53.329" style="s2">philosophy ax to some degree that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.800" end="00:54:57.589" style="s2">going back to the Greek word of course</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.329" end="00:55:00.859" style="s2">that&#39;s the fear but how for me I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.589" end="00:55:05.050" style="s2">it would be extremely important to not</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.859" end="00:55:08.450" style="s2">be some isn&#39;t some part from this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.050" end="00:55:11.270" style="s2">something uniquely off this ebook right</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.450" end="00:55:12.980" style="s2">uniquely of this age that that speaks to</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.270" end="00:55:17.030" style="s2">this age but then that takes of course</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.980" end="00:55:19.640" style="s2">direction and an orientation from the</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.030" end="00:55:22.460" style="s2">wisdom of what has been</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.640" end="00:55:22.700" style="s2">but but doesn&#39;t sort of mix it up too</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.460" end="00:55:25.310" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.700" end="00:55:28.400" style="s2">you see what I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.310" end="00:55:29.750" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s generating itself out of that</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.400" end="00:55:34.070" style="s2">which has been but in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.750" end="00:55:37.970" style="s2">responds to us or to us specifically</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.070" end="00:55:39.560" style="s2">today and how yeah I totally agree with</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.970" end="00:55:41.750" style="s2">that that&#39;s why I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.560" end="00:55:44.210" style="s2">articulate it I&#39;ve been tracking I</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.750" end="00:55:46.700" style="s2">talked about salvaging which is my way</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.210" end="00:55:48.470" style="s2">of trying to like you know you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.700" end="00:55:50.390" style="s2">sort of diving into the depths and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.470" end="00:55:53.720" style="s2">bringing up what was valuable and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.390" end="00:55:56.120" style="s2">trying to refurbish it and it&#39;s a poor</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.720" end="00:55:57.680" style="s2">matter for me I need a better one yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.120" end="00:55:59.090" style="s2">but that&#39;s part of what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.680" end="00:56:02.270" style="s2">say when I say the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.090" end="00:56:04.370" style="s2">religion the reason why I think even for</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.270" end="00:56:07.280" style="s2">even though I find Plato sacred and</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.370" end="00:56:09.470" style="s2">Platonists is sacred for me to I you</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.280" end="00:56:12.890" style="s2">know I&#39;m not a neoplatonist in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.470" end="00:56:16.340" style="s2">that I can&#39;t the the the axial age two</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.890" end="00:56:20.330" style="s2">worlds mythos is not viable for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.340" end="00:56:23.750" style="s2">just not viable of one so so well well I</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.330" end="00:56:26.330" style="s2">want to respond to and I want to let the</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.750" end="00:56:30.020" style="s2">I want to let the tradition flow into me</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.330" end="00:56:32.660" style="s2">but exactly what you said yeah I want to</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.020" end="00:56:33.770" style="s2">open to the I want exactly I think what</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.660" end="00:56:34.850" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that&#39;s part of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.770" end="00:56:36.680" style="s2">trying to put my finger on with the</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.850" end="00:56:39.200" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion yes and</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.680" end="00:56:42.920" style="s2">upon the sacredness but it yes for now</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.200" end="00:56:45.560" style="s2">okay cuz no I get I think I understand</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.920" end="00:56:49.100" style="s2">that name better because it reminded me</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.560" end="00:56:50.810" style="s2">of Heidegger&#39;s unnamed gods yeah he</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.100" end="00:56:52.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t name them because he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.810" end="00:56:55.820" style="s2">want to give us oh look you should</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.760" end="00:56:57.320" style="s2">believe in Susan Hera and no we can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.820" end="00:57:00.020" style="s2">back to Greek mythology that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.320" end="00:57:01.760" style="s2">bit ridiculous so there unnamed for now</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.020" end="00:57:05.780" style="s2">because this unfortunately or</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.760" end="00:57:08.330" style="s2">fortunately who knows is an epoch where</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.780" end="00:57:10.850" style="s2">gods have disappeared where the godly is</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.330" end="00:57:12.380" style="s2">disappearing withdrawing but what we can</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.850" end="00:57:15.230" style="s2">still say that there is a flickering</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.380" end="00:57:16.790" style="s2">some lingering some some gloom of them</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.230" end="00:57:19.430" style="s2">so there some something that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.790" end="00:57:22.250" style="s2">there that&#39;s still an echo of the divine</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.430" end="00:57:24.500" style="s2">but we can&#39;t name it we shouldn&#39;t name</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.250" end="00:57:27.770" style="s2">it because if because what I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.500" end="00:57:31.400" style="s2">about isms is that they are already</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.770" end="00:57:33.049" style="s2">there already ossified but it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.400" end="00:57:35.509" style="s2">I miss</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.049" end="00:57:38.809" style="s2">ISM and that&#39;s it so this is what I this</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.509" end="00:57:40.669" style="s2">is no but if we because Alma that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.809" end="00:57:43.219" style="s2">almost against subjectivity is asserting</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.669" end="00:57:44.419" style="s2">itself right I&#39;m I&#39;m this isn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.219" end="00:57:46.099" style="s2">therefore everything&#39;s fine and I have</p>

<p begin="00:57:46.099" end="00:57:50.779" style="s2">we live and we live in the age of four</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.469" end="00:57:53.749" style="s2">nothing makes sense to some degree but</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.779" end="00:57:56.359" style="s2">this is the tide is already coming back</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.749" end="00:57:58.489" style="s2">there is that it&#39;s like they have</p>

<p begin="00:57:58.489" end="00:58:06.919" style="s2">right of the tone of the hell&#39;s in bird</p>

<p begin="00:58:25.759" end="00:58:31.909" style="s2">about to come but it&#39;s so it but it but</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.289" end="00:58:33.109" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t sort of what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.909" end="00:58:34.699" style="s2">say is this this way of thinking from</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.109" end="00:58:37.969" style="s2">the Sofia is a good name for it because</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.699" end="00:58:42.019" style="s2">it&#39;s also quite open right but if we if</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.969" end="00:58:45.139" style="s2">we stifle it with isms then we it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.019" end="00:58:48.949" style="s2">almost like we what happen is you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.139" end="00:58:51.649" style="s2">produce a consumer product right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.949" end="00:58:55.309" style="s2">I mean and and so part of it I think is</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.649" end="00:58:58.569" style="s2">actually a bi-directional critique which</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.309" end="00:59:01.549" style="s2">it the one we&#39;re giving voice to now is</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.569" end="00:59:03.709" style="s2">to try to try to try to resolve this</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.549" end="00:59:06.019" style="s2">through nostalgia and that&#39;s yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.709" end="00:59:10.669" style="s2">a deep mistake I think also trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.019" end="00:59:13.489" style="s2">resolve this through a utopia which has</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.669" end="00:59:16.399" style="s2">a completed picture of the future is</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.489" end="00:59:20.359" style="s2">also a deep state I think these things</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.399" end="00:59:24.380" style="s2">are not the proper framing that we need</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.359" end="00:59:26.119" style="s2">for what I&#39;m calling philosophy a-- well</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.380" end="00:59:29.749" style="s2">that that&#39;s the work and that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.119" end="00:59:32.469" style="s2">be done right that&#39;s the what not sort</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.749" end="00:59:36.259" style="s2">of framing all of filo sofia but</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.469" end="00:59:37.059" style="s2">bringing while giving birth to</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.259" end="00:59:40.489" style="s2">philosophia</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.059" end="00:59:43.489" style="s2">yes it&#39;s more about exemplifying and</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.489" end="00:59:45.049" style="s2">participating in it yeah again i&#39;m good</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.489" end="00:59:46.690" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna be uh I will of course</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.049" end="00:59:52.650" style="s2">theorize it because that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.690" end="00:59:52.650" style="s2">yes Robin my work step on it and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.240" end="01:00:03.250" style="s2">but you know it&#39;s really interesting how</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.099" end="01:00:08.020" style="s2">hard it is I mean I you know it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.250" end="01:00:10.569" style="s2">sort of easy for us but it&#39;s hard to get</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.020" end="01:00:12.099" style="s2">people because often if you say or you</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.569" end="01:00:15.010" style="s2">know give up nostalgia they go oh yes I</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.099" end="01:00:16.480" style="s2">get that utopia and you say or if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.010" end="01:00:19.089" style="s2">say to people no no not utopia and they</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.480" end="01:00:21.579" style="s2">go oh yes I get that nostalgia right and</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.089" end="01:00:23.290" style="s2">it&#39;s oh no no the the grammar that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.579" end="01:00:25.030" style="s2">generating both of those is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.290" end="01:00:26.920" style="s2">asking you to step beyond and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.030" end="01:00:32.230" style="s2">that&#39;s when there&#39;s the glimmer of</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.920" end="01:00:36.130" style="s2">horror in their eyes right that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.230" end="01:00:37.569" style="s2">the moment that requires deep respect of</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.130" end="01:00:40.660" style="s2">the person you&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.569" end="01:00:44.890" style="s2">deep sensitivity and a willingness to</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.660" end="01:00:46.869" style="s2">linger and be patient with them and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.890" end="01:00:48.700" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry that came off as condescending</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.869" end="01:00:53.410" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t mean it to be kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.700" end="01:00:54.849" style="s2">I meant it to be caring yeah I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.410" end="01:00:56.650" style="s2">have to go soon guys we&#39;ve been talking</p>

<p begin="01:00:56.650" end="01:01:03.910" style="s2">we could talk for without any without</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.599" end="01:01:06.250" style="s2">any difficulty this was extremely</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.910" end="01:01:09.160" style="s2">fruitful I found this very helpful and</p>
