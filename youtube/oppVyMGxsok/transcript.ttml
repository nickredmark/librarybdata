<p begin="00:01:35.030" end="00:01:40.790" style="s2">to get some idea of maybe you have</p>

<p begin="00:03:04.640" end="00:03:09.380" style="s2">susceptible but I pretty much all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.250" end="00:03:11.450" style="s2">time every day have some kind of tune</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.380" end="00:03:13.280" style="s2">playing in my head repeatedly the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.450" end="00:03:15.500" style="s2">sort of simple tune over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.280" end="00:03:16.820" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how common an experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.500" end="00:03:19.340" style="s2">they&#39;re when I know everyone has it to</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.820" end="00:03:21.050" style="s2">some degree but for me is I mean I live</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.340" end="00:03:22.790" style="s2">alone and I work a lot you know just</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.050" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">just quietly in the garden whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.790" end="00:03:26.030" style="s2">I&#39;d pretty much all he says to say have</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.560" end="00:03:39.050" style="s2">some sort of little team going through</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.030" end="00:03:44.420" style="s2">my head or something the last time that</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.050" end="00:03:46.870" style="s2">resonated you said that curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.420" end="00:03:49.330" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to turn into inner talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.870" end="00:03:54.980" style="s2">because you know talk was to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.330" end="00:03:56.420" style="s2">coarse-grain I don&#39;t know exactly I</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.980" end="00:03:58.610" style="s2">don&#39;t have been thinking about that a</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.420" end="00:03:59.870" style="s2">little bit but I don&#39;t know exactly with</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.610" end="00:04:03.140" style="s2">me actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.870" end="00:04:10.760" style="s2">all right cool but not completely and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.140" end="00:04:14.050" style="s2">yeah yeah so what is inner talk good for</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.760" end="00:04:16.370" style="s2">inner talk is good for simulating and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.050" end="00:04:20.660" style="s2">experimenting with what you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.370" end="00:04:22.610" style="s2">say if if you need to run it by you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.660" end="00:04:24.770" style="s2">if you need to if you&#39;re gonna go on an</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.610" end="00:04:27.320" style="s2">interview and you know they&#39;re gonna ask</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.770" end="00:04:29.419" style="s2">you about your last job you might want</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.320" end="00:04:30.590" style="s2">to use inner talk to simulate to</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.419" end="00:04:35.270" style="s2">experiment with what</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.590" end="00:04:38.060" style="s2">you&#39;re going to say so all this inner</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.270" end="00:04:40.460" style="s2">inner visualization is the same way</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.060" end="00:04:43.370" style="s2">they&#39;re their ways to simulate if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.460" end="00:04:46.130" style="s2">looking at a carpentry problem you could</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.370" end="00:04:48.500" style="s2">do something trial and error or you</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.130" end="00:04:50.990" style="s2">could have I put back there</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.500" end="00:04:53.620" style="s2">oh then that&#39;ll go there or rearranging</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.990" end="00:04:56.720" style="s2">your room where you can start to solve</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.620" end="00:05:00.710" style="s2">80% of the problem by simulating it in</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.720" end="00:05:03.470" style="s2">your mind this is also how for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.710" end="00:05:06.020" style="s2">retraining athletes you simulate your</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.470" end="00:05:09.910" style="s2">dancers you simulate the choreography in</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.020" end="00:05:15.880" style="s2">your mind you&#39;re retraining pathways but</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.910" end="00:05:15.880" style="s2">to think of to solve complex problems</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.270" end="00:05:23.360" style="s2">they where you solve the complex problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.390" end="00:05:27.770" style="s2">is not in the length the language is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.360" end="00:05:31.370" style="s2">pretty coarse instrument to solve a</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.770" end="00:05:33.470" style="s2">problem so Eugene gentlemen for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.370" end="00:05:37.820" style="s2">he talks about gives the example of an</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.470" end="00:05:39.680" style="s2">of a poem of someone writing a poem and</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.820" end="00:05:41.690" style="s2">let&#39;s say about someone they love or</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.680" end="00:05:44.060" style="s2">someone they knew or someone they lost</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.690" end="00:05:52.190" style="s2">or guarded that they were in and they</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.060" end="00:05:56.270" style="s2">think beside the tree there she was it</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.190" end="00:05:59.780" style="s2">was and as the sense of something</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.270" end="00:06:01.970" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to say and they&#39;ll use a</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.780" end="00:06:04.550" style="s2">word it was marvelous and they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.970" end="00:06:07.420" style="s2">that words not right and then they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.550" end="00:06:10.220" style="s2">use another word so they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.420" end="00:06:13.630" style="s2">measuring the word against a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.220" end="00:06:16.880" style="s2">knowing right so the the deeper knowing</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.630" end="00:06:21.560" style="s2">generally would say is more precise than</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:25.820" style="s2">the language so what does that mean then</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.560" end="00:06:29.090" style="s2">what it means is that how do we work</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.820" end="00:06:33.110" style="s2">with the deeper energy and that is all</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.090" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">about intention so you set an intention</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.110" end="00:06:41.270" style="s2">to figure something out or you set an</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:44.420" style="s2">intention to solve a problem or you set</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.270" end="00:06:48.530" style="s2">an intention to change your life</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.420" end="00:06:50.960" style="s2">and you stay with the intention stay</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.530" end="00:06:53.960" style="s2">with the intentional motivational state</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.960" end="00:06:56.630" style="s2">and that keeps priming the system to</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.960" end="00:06:58.880" style="s2">solve it at these deeper levels and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.630" end="00:07:01.340" style="s2">every once in a while you check in you</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.880" end="00:07:05.780" style="s2">know and do you have the language do you</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.340" end="00:07:08.390" style="s2">have the inspiration or the insight to</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.780" end="00:07:10.190" style="s2">move move the needle to the next step</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.390" end="00:07:11.810" style="s2">and then once you have enough of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.190" end="00:07:15.710" style="s2">you might have to fiddle around with</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.810" end="00:07:18.710" style="s2">again in explicit space but it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.710" end="00:07:20.810" style="s2">back and forth we all know that this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.710" end="00:07:23.000" style="s2">part of why taking a walk all of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.810" end="00:07:25.430" style="s2">sudden you&#39;ll remember something you</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.000" end="00:07:29.150" style="s2">forgot or you&#39;ll solve a problem because</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.430" end="00:07:36.310" style="s2">you&#39;re making you&#39;re letting the process</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.150" end="00:07:36.310" style="s2">go back into the implicit processing so</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.800" end="00:07:45.990" style="s2">but the question then is why do we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.780" end="00:07:51.180" style="s2">constant and inner talk like what for</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.990" end="00:07:54.540" style="s2">some people like let&#39;s just raise our</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.180" end="00:07:59.460" style="s2">hands who has in a talk probably 90% of</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.540" end="00:08:07.880" style="s2">their conscious day all right who has it</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.460" end="00:08:07.880" style="s2">more like 70% and how about under 40</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.330" end="00:08:16.560" style="s2">yeah see some of you are 660 ish 5060</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.690" end="00:08:19.860" style="s2">some of you at 90 so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.560" end="00:08:26.550" style="s2">that&#39;s something interesting to notice</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.860" end="00:08:28.160" style="s2">and interesting to ask yourself the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.550" end="00:08:29.430" style="s2">question whether it serves you or not</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.160" end="00:08:31.290" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.430" end="00:08:34.310" style="s2">now if you let if you&#39;re at 90 percent</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.290" end="00:08:37.469" style="s2">and it&#39;s carrying all your ideas forward</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.310" end="00:08:39.570" style="s2">that&#39;s awesome but if you&#39;re at 90</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.469" end="00:08:42.599" style="s2">percent it&#39;s the same thing over and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.570" end="00:08:44.970" style="s2">over and over and over and over or some</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.599" end="00:08:48.930" style="s2">version of the same pattern that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.970" end="00:08:52.170" style="s2">you&#39;ll want to work toward releasing</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.930" end="00:08:59.220" style="s2">that habit and instead working with</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.170" end="00:09:00.870" style="s2">intention so if I say what do I really</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.220" end="00:09:03.570" style="s2">want to do with my life I have let</p>

<p begin="00:10:16.330" end="00:10:23.110" style="s2">better than stringing yourself along</p>

<p begin="00:10:32.290" end="00:10:40.930" style="s2">by talking so the question is you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.260" end="00:10:43.000" style="s2">can we relax into the intention that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.930" end="00:10:44.800" style="s2">kind of an interesting phrase because</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.000" end="00:10:46.840" style="s2">the intention of a motivational state</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.800" end="00:10:48.010" style="s2">has got a lot of energy to it but can we</p>

<p begin="00:10:48.010" end="00:10:59.580" style="s2">meaning relax this mind into this bodily</p>

<p begin="00:11:24.370" end="00:11:31.450" style="s2">to get underneath that and sit with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.180" end="00:11:34.240" style="s2">fact that you don&#39;t have an intention or</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.450" end="00:11:36.160" style="s2">determination so you can if that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.240" end="00:11:40.360" style="s2">arise you can you constantly want to go</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.160" end="00:11:43.000" style="s2">underneath as far as you need to go</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.360" end="00:11:46.570" style="s2">until you really feel like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.000" end="00:11:52.420" style="s2">touching where the energy is sourcing</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.570" end="00:11:54.910" style="s2">itself for some people it could be lower</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.420" end="00:11:56.320" style="s2">chakra and feel very sexual there no</p>

<p begin="00:12:02.770" end="00:12:09.760" style="s2">meditating that energy you it&#39;ll start</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.490" end="00:12:12.670" style="s2">to manifest in the in the lower chakra</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.760" end="00:12:15.250" style="s2">and then people say oh you know the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.670" end="00:12:16.720" style="s2">story you&#39;ll play a TV story in your</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.250" end="00:12:18.370" style="s2">head I gotta go get a girlfriend or I</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.720" end="00:12:22.029" style="s2">gotta get a boyfriend you know that</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.370" end="00:12:25.660" style="s2">that&#39;s how we displace that energy that</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.029" end="00:12:27.160" style="s2">energy is like a nuclear reactor and if</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.660" end="00:12:29.440" style="s2">we can&#39;t they don&#39;t have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.160" end="00:12:34.899" style="s2">hold or be with it then it goes into</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.440" end="00:12:39.089" style="s2">these stories and these these these kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.899" end="00:12:41.680" style="s2">of simulated thinking thought patterns</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.089" end="00:12:43.420" style="s2">then we get into the stories and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.680" end="00:12:45.700" style="s2">stories make us and stuff like that so</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.420" end="00:12:48.490" style="s2">it&#39;s just the energy has to go the</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.700" end="00:12:51.100" style="s2">energy is like a nuclear reactor it</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.490" end="00:12:54.070" style="s2">wants to be you know talked about as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.100" end="00:12:55.959" style="s2">car you know you have the energy as the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.070" end="00:12:58.660" style="s2">engine and it wants to be attached or</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.959" end="00:13:01.930" style="s2">transmissions that can go somewhere and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.660" end="00:13:05.230" style="s2">that will happen automatically in these</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.930" end="00:13:08.110" style="s2">kind of habits individual ways if you if</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.230" end="00:13:11.279" style="s2">you don&#39;t if you can&#39;t contact the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.110" end="00:13:15.040" style="s2">source and then with intention and</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.279" end="00:13:18.190" style="s2">determination attach it to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:22.350" style="s2">transmission that you want to you want</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.190" end="00:13:22.350" style="s2">the energy to be in service toward</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.410" end="00:13:32.090" style="s2">but what if we if we if we rush too fast</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.540" end="00:13:34.910" style="s2">to make meaning out of it it&#39;ll be this</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.090" end="00:13:39.290" style="s2">mental talk that&#39;s another thing you</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.910" end="00:13:40.910" style="s2">know you&#39;ll notice at one time one year</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.290" end="00:13:42.830" style="s2">at the farm here we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.910" end="00:13:45.530" style="s2">animals and we had a lot of older</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.830" end="00:13:47.720" style="s2">animals it you know like two chickens</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.530" end="00:13:51.080" style="s2">died and then a horse died and then a</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.720" end="00:13:53.990" style="s2">dog died like like five animals died in</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.080" end="00:13:55.820" style="s2">like four years and even though we know</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.990" end="00:13:57.860" style="s2">they were all older and stuff you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.820" end="00:14:00.260" style="s2">hear you feel your mind like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.860" end="00:14:03.080" style="s2">something in the water there&#39;s literally</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.260" end="00:14:05.120" style="s2">all these stories come up because you</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.080" end="00:14:06.890" style="s2">want to make sense or meaning out of</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.120" end="00:14:10.990" style="s2">something that it doesn&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.890" end="00:14:14.000" style="s2">that meaning and you could notice how</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.990" end="00:14:17.210" style="s2">when things are emotional or when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.000" end="00:14:22.250" style="s2">starting to tap into the deep the depths</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.210" end="00:14:24.680" style="s2">of your feeling tone you if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.250" end="00:14:27.680" style="s2">really be with that you&#39;ll start to make</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.680" end="00:14:29.990" style="s2">surface meaning that&#39;s that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.680" end="00:14:33.170" style="s2">ways in which the energy discharges no</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.990" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">it&#39;s a good thing because you want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.170" end="00:14:39.710" style="s2">wonder it&#39;s my well poisoned I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:43.700" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like I&#39;m yes thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.710" end="00:14:44.750" style="s2">serving up these things mind but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.700" end="00:14:48.530" style="s2">none of those things</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.750" end="00:14:53.480" style="s2">it&#39;s just grief it&#39;s just the energy of</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.530" end="00:14:57.020" style="s2">grief wants to go into this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.480" end="00:14:59.480" style="s2">surface meaning-making and so these are</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.020" end="00:15:01.660" style="s2">the ways that energies are coupled in in</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.480" end="00:15:01.660" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.150" end="00:15:17.720" style="s2">um I&#39;m really feeling the connection to</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.040" end="00:15:22.620" style="s2">working with myself and other people</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.720" end="00:15:26.640" style="s2">using tools like duct Akron&#39;s bio motive</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.620" end="00:15:33.690" style="s2">framework and internal family systems</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.640" end="00:15:37.260" style="s2">and where there&#39;s yeah seeing myself and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.690" end="00:15:41.310" style="s2">others struggle to to go into that under</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.260" end="00:15:48.029" style="s2">level layer and just want to stay in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.310" end="00:15:52.230" style="s2">sort of the words and the stories yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.029" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">just resonating a lot of that yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.230" end="00:15:56.730" style="s2">what we&#39;re gonna talk about today is</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:59.610" style="s2">what&#39;s underneath their words and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.730" end="00:16:01.740" style="s2">stories I mean not necessarily like</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.610" end="00:16:05.040" style="s2">inner talk or earworm stuff you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.740" end="00:16:10.490" style="s2">that stuff&#39;s just kind of like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.040" end="00:16:12.900" style="s2">know but well today I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.490" end="00:16:16.350" style="s2">mental models in what they&#39;re called</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.900" end="00:16:18.510" style="s2">internal working models when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.350" end="00:16:20.610" style="s2">internal working models are highly</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.510" end="00:16:23.040" style="s2">conceptual they use the term mental</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.610" end="00:16:25.140" style="s2">models when you&#39;re internal working</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.040" end="00:16:27.000" style="s2">models are based on stories and</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.140" end="00:16:30.810" style="s2">relationships they call them internal</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.000" end="00:16:34.490" style="s2">family systems they both operate the</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.810" end="00:16:40.310" style="s2">same way the way they operate is by</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.490" end="00:16:45.270" style="s2">organizing reality into a familiar model</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.310" end="00:16:49.800" style="s2">so conceptual people will usually use a</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.270" end="00:16:52.830" style="s2">lot of conceptual terminology in</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.800" end="00:16:55.350" style="s2">imagistic people like I use the car the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.830" end="00:16:58.740" style="s2">transmission that&#39;s more of an image I</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.350" end="00:17:05.730" style="s2">could have used concepts you could also</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.740" end="00:17:07.500" style="s2">use family systems and the family system</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.730" end="00:17:10.400" style="s2">so they&#39;re all what I call internal</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.500" end="00:17:10.400" style="s2">working models</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.320" end="00:17:23.340" style="s2">now what&#39;s interesting so what the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.640" end="00:17:27.720" style="s2">reason why they&#39;re deeper and lower is</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.340" end="00:17:32.090" style="s2">because once you get rid of the inner</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.720" end="00:17:35.940" style="s2">talk and you&#39;re accessing some of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.090" end="00:17:39.630" style="s2">deeper motivational or determination or</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.940" end="00:17:44.160" style="s2">felt sense you start to see that they</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.630" end="00:17:52.920" style="s2">have a structure that&#39;s built up on a</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.160" end="00:17:56.630" style="s2">mental model of reality right so and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.920" end="00:18:00.530" style="s2">can get at these mental structures</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.630" end="00:18:05.280" style="s2">through certain methodologies like</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.530" end="00:18:07.260" style="s2">internal family systems etc but one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.280" end="00:18:12.870" style="s2">the problems with them is they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.260" end="00:18:17.090" style="s2">horrible reduction of reality mental</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.870" end="00:18:22.380" style="s2">model is a construct or a container</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.090" end="00:18:24.930" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t let all of reality in and</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.380" end="00:18:28.050" style="s2">so they limit your freedom and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.930" end="00:18:30.600" style="s2">they limit the create that your ability</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.050" end="00:18:34.900" style="s2">be creative in your intentional and</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.600" end="00:18:36.250" style="s2">motivational sensing</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.900" end="00:18:38.310" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.250" end="00:18:38.310" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.200" end="00:18:46.639" style="s2">so yummy when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.690" end="00:18:49.580" style="s2">trying to tell yourself a story about</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.639" end="00:18:54.940" style="s2">the farm animals I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.580" end="00:18:57.950" style="s2">how both two things one the idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.940" end="00:18:59.419" style="s2">make sense of our lives looking backward</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.950" end="00:19:03.440" style="s2">that we have to live them going forward</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.419" end="00:19:07.610" style="s2">and then also John very key talks about</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.440" end="00:19:09.380" style="s2">how narrative is a psycho technology and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.610" end="00:19:11.330" style="s2">I&#39;d never thought about that before that</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.380" end="00:19:17.690" style="s2">we that we are taught to tell stories</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.330" end="00:19:20.630" style="s2">and I wonder to what extent like in that</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.690" end="00:19:22.730" style="s2">situation you&#39;re talking about that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.630" end="00:19:26.809" style="s2">have this tool of narrative that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.730" end="00:19:31.960" style="s2">powerful but then we want to over apply</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.809" end="00:19:35.720" style="s2">it to everything is that is that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.960" end="00:19:40.519" style="s2">yeah so I&#39;m gonna like your question</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.720" end="00:19:44.799" style="s2">steering steer around a little bit yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.519" end="00:19:48.139" style="s2">so language is funny for us because if</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.799" end="00:19:51.799" style="s2">instead of telling a story I was making</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.139" end="00:19:54.409" style="s2">artwork right like abstract artwork not</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.799" end="00:19:56.860" style="s2">artwork that basically tells a story</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.409" end="00:19:59.960" style="s2">like some artwork is so literal right</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.860" end="00:20:02.059" style="s2">let&#39;s say all that was processing in me</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.960" end="00:20:07.039" style="s2">became the artwork</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.059" end="00:20:09.409" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t relate to that artwork the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.039" end="00:20:10.639" style="s2">same as a theory of everything if I had</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.409" end="00:20:13.519" style="s2">a theory of everything</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.639" end="00:20:16.370" style="s2">I would relate to it as this wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.519" end="00:20:18.980" style="s2">expression of my part of my a part of me</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.370" end="00:20:24.019" style="s2">and this is the problem that we have</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.980" end="00:20:27.559" style="s2">with narratives we tend to not see them</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.019" end="00:20:31.519" style="s2">or allow them to be these fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.559" end="00:20:34.610" style="s2">creations we want them to be the final</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.519" end="00:20:36.830" style="s2">word or we want them to you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.610" end="00:20:38.990" style="s2">transcendent include everything else we</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.830" end="00:20:41.299" style="s2">thought you know it would be like an</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.990" end="00:20:43.490" style="s2">artist and I guess it could be movies</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.299" end="00:20:44.960" style="s2">about this who wants that doesn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.490" end="00:20:48.409" style="s2">any of their paintings because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.960" end="00:20:50.450" style="s2">one really big painting that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.409" end="00:20:53.090" style="s2">include all the other paintings right</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.450" end="00:20:56.030" style="s2">this is the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.090" end="00:20:58.250" style="s2">mine&#39;s in in Western culture it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.030" end="00:21:01.220" style="s2">this structure everybody&#39;s mind but</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.250" end="00:21:04.030" style="s2">pretty much everybody is cosmopolitan</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.220" end="00:21:07.550" style="s2">these days so the Buddhists talk about</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.030" end="00:21:10.220" style="s2">the mind as an organ of perception so</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.550" end="00:21:13.190" style="s2">they say for example there&#39;s not all the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.220" end="00:21:17.120" style="s2">Buddha&#39;s Buddhists it&#39;s just so time T</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.190" end="00:21:19.850" style="s2">cos school but it&#39;s a really beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.120" end="00:21:22.550" style="s2">way to think about the mind and that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.850" end="00:21:24.830" style="s2">they&#39;ll say like there&#39;s I consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.550" end="00:21:27.140" style="s2">so that&#39;s a perception right and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.830" end="00:21:29.150" style="s2">there&#39;s ear consciousness and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.140" end="00:21:30.680" style="s2">there&#39;s smell consciousness they have</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.150" end="00:21:34.160" style="s2">these the senses are a type of</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.680" end="00:21:36.830" style="s2">consciousness but then they say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.160" end="00:21:39.950" style="s2">mind consciousness also and for them the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.830" end="00:21:43.280" style="s2">mind is part of the team for us the mind</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.950" end="00:21:44.660" style="s2">Trump&#39;s the team like for us we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.280" end="00:21:50.140" style="s2">taking all this perceptual information</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.660" end="00:21:52.220" style="s2">and then the mind is supposed to say</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.140" end="00:21:55.940" style="s2">what that all means</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.220" end="00:21:58.780" style="s2">right so the santur antica say what the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.940" end="00:22:03.230" style="s2">mind&#39;s consciousness is it generalizes</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.780" end="00:22:05.720" style="s2">like the the ears hear the sound the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.230" end="00:22:08.150" style="s2">mind says bird</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.720" end="00:22:10.670" style="s2">that&#39;s all the mine does bird it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.150" end="00:22:13.310" style="s2">matter if it&#39;s a red-winged blackbird or</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.670" end="00:22:18.020" style="s2">a bluebird or whatever it&#39;s a generalist</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.310" end="00:22:20.840" style="s2">and so they the idea is it&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.020" end="00:22:23.360" style="s2">have a general perspective but it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.840" end="00:22:25.460" style="s2">one perspective amongst the others</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.360" end="00:22:27.620" style="s2">whereas the way we relate to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.460" end="00:22:30.950" style="s2">generalist is that it transcends and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.620" end="00:22:34.060" style="s2">includes all the others when the larger</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.950" end="00:22:37.750" style="s2">ideas should just be another perspective</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.060" end="00:22:40.610" style="s2">in Earth&#39;s constellation of perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.750" end="00:22:41.150" style="s2">so when we create mental models and</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.610" end="00:22:43.940" style="s2">theories</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.150" end="00:22:45.560" style="s2">it&#39;s as if they stand in for everything</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.940" end="00:22:48.230" style="s2">else but they should just be another</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.560" end="00:22:49.970" style="s2">tool in our toolkit some of you been</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.230" end="00:22:53.630" style="s2">watching me on Facebook and then getting</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.970" end="00:22:56.180" style="s2">into trouble so a larger understanding</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.630" end="00:22:59.120" style="s2">of coronavirus needs to be in your</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.180" end="00:23:01.760" style="s2">information ecology but also the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.120" end="00:23:06.140" style="s2">anecdotal evidence that contradicts with</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.760" end="00:23:09.410" style="s2">it we use our mind as if a more</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.140" end="00:23:11.780" style="s2">sophisticated perspective includes all</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.410" end="00:23:14.750" style="s2">of them and it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.780" end="00:23:16.520" style="s2">different type of perspective than all</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.750" end="00:23:19.160" style="s2">the other perspectives that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.520" end="00:23:22.280" style="s2">include this is the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.160" end="00:23:27.740" style="s2">systemic thinking what I call synthetics</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.280" end="00:23:30.700" style="s2">and stomach thinking right so to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.740" end="00:23:35.140" style="s2">like a kind of ecological management</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.700" end="00:23:39.640" style="s2">systems orientation to the environment</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.140" end="00:23:42.440" style="s2">does not include all the local knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.640" end="00:23:47.350" style="s2">that the indigenous people have it</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.440" end="00:23:52.370" style="s2">doesn&#39;t but we relate to those types of</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.350" end="00:23:55.730" style="s2">systemic models as if they sum up</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.370" end="00:23:58.010" style="s2">everything it&#39;s a valuable perspective</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.730" end="00:24:00.440" style="s2">to have but it&#39;s just another</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.010" end="00:24:03.380" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s another organ of</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.440" end="00:24:05.360" style="s2">consciousness and this is what we need</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.380" end="00:24:09.470" style="s2">to understand about narrative a</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.360" end="00:24:13.790" style="s2">narrative is a powerful exploration of</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.470" end="00:24:17.630" style="s2">reality but it&#39;s just it needs to be on</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.790" end="00:24:19.740" style="s2">the same team as all the others and most</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.630" end="00:24:23.669" style="s2">of our narratives</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.740" end="00:24:28.289" style="s2">come in the form as if they get there</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.669" end="00:24:32.580" style="s2">the trump card now this is true for what</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.289" end="00:24:35.580" style="s2">people go through you might have heard</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.580" end="00:24:37.529" style="s2">of Keegan and a self authoring self</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.580" end="00:24:41.760" style="s2">authoring person this is a late late</p>

<p begin="00:24:47.070" end="00:24:56.039" style="s2">identity is very reliant on what I call</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.470" end="00:24:59.940" style="s2">autobiographical coherence the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.039" end="00:25:00.179" style="s2">so if I ask you if we&#39;re really going at</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.940" end="00:25:02.610" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.179" end="00:25:07.289" style="s2">we&#39;re on the different page with</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.610" end="00:25:09.690" style="s2">coronavirus you will be arguing from</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.289" end="00:25:11.909" style="s2">this sense of autobiographical coherence</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.690" end="00:25:13.860" style="s2">I lived my whole life this way and I&#39;m a</p>

<p begin="00:25:23.610" end="00:25:31.980" style="s2">so you will resist my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.470" end="00:25:35.820" style="s2">because I am in arguing for my need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.980" end="00:25:40.230" style="s2">be an autobiographical coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.820" end="00:25:41.460" style="s2">this is the last identity before what we</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.230" end="00:25:45.480" style="s2">would like call some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.460" end="00:25:50.539" style="s2">individuation or liberation so this need</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.480" end="00:25:57.360" style="s2">for autobiographical coherence is</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.539" end="00:26:00.210" style="s2">symptomatic of a late-stage identity and</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.360" end="00:26:03.000" style="s2">I think this is what&#39;s great you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.210" end="00:26:12.059" style="s2">this is what&#39;s being challenged in our</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.000" end="00:26:14.880" style="s2">modern in in our recent times when your</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.059" end="00:26:16.919" style="s2">story of self can&#39;t address doesn&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.880" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">you the answer that what you should do</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.919" end="00:26:22.980" style="s2">next you start to see the story of self</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:30.289" style="s2">itself is a narrative or a mental model</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.980" end="00:26:32.999" style="s2">that&#39;s partial if when people ask you</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.289" end="00:26:36.779" style="s2">tell me something about you</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.999" end="00:26:38.369" style="s2">you have this this like you have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.779" end="00:26:40.739" style="s2">pause because it should it be this</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.369" end="00:26:43.289" style="s2">thread or it should it be that thread or</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.739" end="00:26:45.509" style="s2">it should it be this thread and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.289" end="00:26:47.729" style="s2">realize over time when you&#39;re answering</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.509" end="00:26:49.949" style="s2">the question you kind of morph it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.729" end="00:26:52.349" style="s2">you make it up you start to realize</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.949" end="00:26:55.049" style="s2">there is no autobiographical coherence</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.349" end="00:26:58.109" style="s2">it&#39;s just like the same question why do</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.049" end="00:27:02.359" style="s2">all these animals dying why am I here</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.109" end="00:27:02.359" style="s2">now your mind is just serving up things</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.479" end="00:27:11.609" style="s2">that are like make you feel that things</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.129" end="00:27:14.579" style="s2">make sense or that you can make sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.609" end="00:27:22.019" style="s2">out of them so this is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.579" end="00:27:26.029" style="s2">narrative structure this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.019" end="00:27:29.939" style="s2">somebody is writing I think to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.029" end="00:27:32.009" style="s2">okay so this is part of the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.939" end="00:27:38.429" style="s2">narrative structure are one of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.009" end="00:27:41.309" style="s2">mental models that shape us at a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.429" end="00:27:43.829" style="s2">level so we can&#39;t so or even when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.309" end="00:27:46.499" style="s2">trying to figure out from this deeper</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.829" end="00:27:52.019" style="s2">knowing we have to be careful or</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.499" end="00:28:01.379" style="s2">vigilant that we&#39;re not subject to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.019" end="00:28:03.359" style="s2">constraints of this mental model so</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.379" end="00:28:05.639" style="s2">here&#39;s one from internal family systems</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.359" end="00:28:10.829" style="s2">who&#39;s who believes they have an inner</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.639" end="00:28:12.509" style="s2">child okay so that&#39;s a that&#39;s a limiting</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.829" end="00:28:19.349" style="s2">belief it&#39;s a mental model it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.509" end="00:28:22.049" style="s2">thought to construct who&#39;s paid people</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.349" end="00:28:26.429" style="s2">to talk to the inner child it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.049" end="00:28:32.209" style="s2">kind of ridiculous really these many of</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.429" end="00:28:36.659" style="s2">the many of the bio spiritual trades</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.209" end="00:28:38.989" style="s2">they&#39;re in the process of creating the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.659" end="00:28:41.989" style="s2">structures that then they help you</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.989" end="00:28:41.989" style="s2">resolve</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.950" end="00:28:53.440" style="s2">could ask you a follow-up question about</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.240" end="00:28:57.550" style="s2">that yeah that was a what would you say</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.440" end="00:29:00.070" style="s2">like okay so for example and you know a</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.550" end="00:29:03.070" style="s2">depth psychology perspective there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.070" end="00:29:07.390" style="s2">these inner structures that are that</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.070" end="00:29:08.740" style="s2">have been shaped by whatever right</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.390" end="00:29:15.730" style="s2">whatever the narrative is like evolution</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.740" end="00:29:18.700" style="s2">or some spiritual boundaries that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.730" end="00:29:21.700" style="s2">shape the way that we perceive or even</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.700" end="00:29:23.820" style="s2">like like a phenomenological just a</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.700" end="00:29:26.230" style="s2">purely philosophical endeavour to</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.820" end="00:29:28.840" style="s2">uncover what the structures are that</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.230" end="00:29:31.120" style="s2">that we use to perceive things how do</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.840" end="00:29:33.550" style="s2">you feel about how our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:35.050" style="s2">articulate those is a narrative that</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.550" end="00:29:38.050" style="s2">then becomes a mental model that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.050" end="00:29:40.420" style="s2">limiting this yeah so this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.050" end="00:29:42.070" style="s2">good question thank you for asking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.420" end="00:29:44.350" style="s2">helping me move along in the right</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.070" end="00:29:46.570" style="s2">direction you know I don&#39;t know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.350" end="00:29:50.080" style="s2">about all of you okay there are</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.570" end="00:29:52.030" style="s2">psychological structures and it has to</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.080" end="00:29:54.010" style="s2">do something with how we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.030" end="00:29:58.840" style="s2">last time about burning and downward</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.010" end="00:30:01.180" style="s2">causation versus upward causation so the</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.840" end="00:30:04.300" style="s2">earliest site the primitive brain of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.180" end="00:30:07.000" style="s2">child and what I mean by brain again is</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.300" end="00:30:10.390" style="s2">the whole shebang works but God the</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.000" end="00:30:12.640" style="s2">vagus nerve effect systems and if I use</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.390" end="00:30:17.470" style="s2">the word brain it means that whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.640" end="00:30:22.030" style="s2">right so the core self is a sensory</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.470" end="00:30:25.180" style="s2">motor self with human potential so it</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.030" end="00:30:28.900" style="s2">basically has an animal&#39;s perception and</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.180" end="00:30:31.420" style="s2">body plan but it&#39;s more sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.900" end="00:30:34.060" style="s2">relational dynamics with its parents</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.420" end="00:30:35.110" style="s2">let&#39;s say right so if you know anything</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.060" end="00:30:36.790" style="s2">about chickens</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.110" end="00:30:39.010" style="s2">the chickens are born they have horrible</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.790" end="00:30:41.170" style="s2">mothers but they can eat right away and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.010" end="00:30:44.110" style="s2">they just take care of themselves called</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.170" end="00:30:46.270" style="s2">pro precocious but ducks they have</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.110" end="00:30:48.100" style="s2">really beautiful parents and the parents</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.270" end="00:30:51.520" style="s2">protect them right they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.100" end="00:30:53.800" style="s2">precarious existentially ducks are more</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.520" end="00:30:56.550" style="s2">precarious existentially turns out</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.800" end="00:30:59.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a relationship between ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.550" end="00:31:01.420" style="s2">pro-social behaviors and sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.740" end="00:31:04.540" style="s2">consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.420" end="00:31:07.960" style="s2">the precariousness of the sensorimotor</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.540" end="00:31:10.150" style="s2">system with respect to how its cared for</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.960" end="00:31:12.220" style="s2">early okay so that&#39;s how we&#39;re born but</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.150" end="00:31:15.070" style="s2">basically an animal with this potential</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.220" end="00:31:18.040" style="s2">that makes our socialization much more</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.070" end="00:31:20.920" style="s2">sensitive and precarious so the first</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.040" end="00:31:23.350" style="s2">thing this animal has to do it&#39;s a tries</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.920" end="00:31:25.690" style="s2">to structure reality because</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.350" end="00:31:27.700" style="s2">unstructured reality as James said is</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.690" end="00:31:30.310" style="s2">like you know an LSD trip or worse an</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.700" end="00:31:34.060" style="s2">LSD trip you can couldn&#39;t get any handle</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.310" end="00:31:37.060" style="s2">on anything and the way the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.060" end="00:31:42.840" style="s2">that the core self has to do is create a</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.060" end="00:31:47.860" style="s2">structure called self other and world</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.840" end="00:31:50.620" style="s2">that&#39;s the primary structure the primary</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.860" end="00:31:55.480" style="s2">organization their primary internal</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.620" end="00:31:57.880" style="s2">working model of the child now I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.480" end="00:32:01.510" style="s2">you how that happens but this core</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.880" end="00:32:02.890" style="s2">structure changes as we develop you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.510" end="00:32:05.830" style="s2">once when you get into high school</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.890" end="00:32:09.160" style="s2">you&#39;re starting to ask questions about</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.830" end="00:32:12.250" style="s2">is that the world in my mind or is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.160" end="00:32:16.420" style="s2">in another person you know these morph</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.250" end="00:32:18.310" style="s2">and get get the this organization this</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.420" end="00:32:21.640" style="s2">fundamental organization can change over</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.310" end="00:32:27.910" style="s2">time but for the child this is how the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.640" end="00:32:29.950" style="s2">structures are created it&#39;s about has to</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.910" end="00:32:33.130" style="s2">do what&#39;s called variance this is very</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.950" end="00:32:35.500" style="s2">well researched now it&#39;s a new field but</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.130" end="00:32:38.500" style="s2">it&#39;s called variance so what call varies</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.500" end="00:32:41.790" style="s2">with me what constantly comes with me is</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.500" end="00:32:46.840" style="s2">me self</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.790" end="00:32:49.750" style="s2">what responds to me but but varies like</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.840" end="00:32:52.780" style="s2">my mom she&#39;s always responsive or my dog</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.750" end="00:32:56.830" style="s2">there&#39;s like something responding but it</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.780" end="00:32:58.810" style="s2">varies is other and things that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.830" end="00:33:01.510" style="s2">invariant like no matter how many times</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.810" end="00:33:06.070" style="s2">I hit that wall it does not move or</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.510" end="00:33:09.600" style="s2">respond that becomes world and this sets</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.070" end="00:33:12.030" style="s2">up the primary psychological structures</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.600" end="00:33:13.530" style="s2">the psychological structures are the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.030" end="00:33:16.350" style="s2">the primitive minds</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.530" end="00:33:19.190" style="s2">it&#39;s the primitive minds internal</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.350" end="00:33:19.190" style="s2">working model</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.540" end="00:33:28.130" style="s2">so this enables us to figure out a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.570" end="00:33:32.420" style="s2">and to be socialized as an aside what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.130" end="00:33:36.020" style="s2">interesting is one of the hypotheses out</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.420" end="00:33:40.040" style="s2">there in this research is that kids that</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.020" end="00:33:44.420" style="s2">use simple interfaces like iPads and</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.040" end="00:33:48.530" style="s2">screens yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.420" end="00:33:51.170" style="s2">so let me say this and then I get back</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.530" end="00:33:54.590" style="s2">to the questions because the because the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.170" end="00:33:57.880" style="s2">interface is called very then you get</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.590" end="00:34:01.180" style="s2">this you get this fusion of self in</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.880" end="00:34:04.670" style="s2">technology this is actually what they do</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.180" end="00:34:07.660" style="s2">when they do these virtual reality</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.670" end="00:34:10.310" style="s2">out-of-body experiences because the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.660" end="00:34:11.810" style="s2">thing you&#39;re looking at is Co varying</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.310" end="00:34:15.710" style="s2">with you so you think you&#39;re ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.810" end="00:34:17.300" style="s2">yourself so this the hypothesis is this</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.710" end="00:34:20.960" style="s2">is creating psychotic</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.300" end="00:34:23.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like cycloid type pathologies and</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.960" end="00:34:27.080" style="s2">young people because there&#39;s too much of</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.960" end="00:34:35.410" style="s2">a fusion between technology and their</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.080" end="00:34:40.730" style="s2">self now this person yes so Bell Horan</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.410" end="00:34:43.910" style="s2">yeah so I did remember I said that the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.730" end="00:34:46.400" style="s2">construction changes so it can change a</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.910" end="00:34:49.310" style="s2">magical experience with nature nature</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.400" end="00:34:51.500" style="s2">mysticism but it also can change as you</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.310" end="00:34:58.520" style="s2">grow spiritually and you see the</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.500" end="00:35:01.550" style="s2">construction itself is up to has some</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.520" end="00:35:03.680" style="s2">choice in it right you see that those</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.550" end="00:35:06.140" style="s2">boundaries are not that clearly</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.680" end="00:35:10.670" style="s2">delineated but if you grow up in our</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.140" end="00:35:12.830" style="s2">society then you tend to not see the</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.670" end="00:35:15.590" style="s2">tree is Kovarian because our language</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.830" end="00:35:20.620" style="s2">takes that experience away from you but</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.590" end="00:35:23.090" style="s2">later on these categories change again</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.620" end="00:35:25.100" style="s2">and there&#39;s always there&#39;s a point in</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.090" end="00:35:28.880" style="s2">young people where there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.100" end="00:35:34.460" style="s2">reality testing this is you know these</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.880" end="00:35:35.690" style="s2">boundaries are themselves they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.460" end="00:35:38.750" style="s2">conditioned and they can be</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.690" end="00:35:44.230" style="s2">decommissioned but the normal Western</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.750" end="00:35:52.150" style="s2">child has this certainly a certain basic</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.230" end="00:35:54.740" style="s2">plan I think we&#39;re all you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.150" end="00:35:57.500" style="s2">which construction of self or other</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.740" end="00:36:00.710" style="s2">world is our fundamental one depends</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.500" end="00:36:03.140" style="s2">upon what gets affirmed in our culture</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.710" end="00:36:05.450" style="s2">and what gets kind of like oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.140" end="00:36:09.050" style="s2">silly you know it&#39;s just a tree kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.450" end="00:36:11.270" style="s2">thing yeah but those constructions are</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.050" end="00:36:17.840" style="s2">still made in all human being south of</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.270" end="00:36:19.550" style="s2">their world so that&#39;s the we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.840" end="00:36:22.850" style="s2">get to the inner child there Carrie I</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.550" end="00:36:24.860" style="s2">guess that&#39;s world going today so yes</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.850" end="00:36:27.260" style="s2">Nate there are psychological structures</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.860" end="00:36:29.720" style="s2">we call those psychological structures</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.260" end="00:36:32.720" style="s2">because they&#39;re not conceptual but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.720" end="00:36:36.260" style="s2">the same the sophisticated mind creates</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.720" end="00:36:40.930" style="s2">more mental models and the primitive</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.260" end="00:36:43.640" style="s2">mind creates these feeling tone kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.930" end="00:36:46.340" style="s2">expectation perceptual sensory motor</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.640" end="00:36:47.630" style="s2">models which we call psychological</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.340" end="00:36:49.460" style="s2">structures because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.630" end="00:36:51.910" style="s2">sophisticated mental models now the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.460" end="00:36:54.620" style="s2">thing about it is they&#39;re very hard</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.910" end="00:36:57.200" style="s2">wired because anything earlier</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.620" end="00:37:00.500" style="s2">everything else gets built on it right</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.200" end="00:37:02.120" style="s2">so our language and our abstractions and</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.500" end="00:37:05.660" style="s2">our science gets built on some</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.120" end="00:37:07.760" style="s2">fundamental things and then when if</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.660" end="00:37:11.030" style="s2">you&#39;re taking psychedelics or in</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.760" end="00:37:13.460" style="s2">tation or if you&#39;re having mystical</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.030" end="00:37:16.400" style="s2">experiences you start to see that those</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.460" end="00:37:19.600" style="s2">those are somewhat optional that they</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.400" end="00:37:24.400" style="s2">can be rearranged and still make sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.600" end="00:37:24.400" style="s2">they just make a different kind of sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.530" end="00:37:33.770" style="s2">yeah so and just to drive it home for</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.500" end="00:37:38.270" style="s2">some of you psychologists out there if</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.770" end="00:37:41.990" style="s2">you know affect regulation theory or</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.270" end="00:37:44.810" style="s2">attachment theory when the mother is too</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.990" end="00:37:46.640" style="s2">blended with the child and when the</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.810" end="00:37:49.340" style="s2">child scared the mother gets scared</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.640" end="00:37:51.110" style="s2">there&#39;s not enough variance and say you</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.340" end="00:37:53.450" style="s2">then you get certain psychological</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.110" end="00:37:56.600" style="s2">structures built that are not are</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.450" end="00:37:58.610" style="s2">considered not normative if the mother</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.600" end="00:37:59.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t vary at all of the child&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.610" end="00:38:01.730" style="s2">if you just put them on a strict</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.840" end="00:38:04.370" style="s2">schedule and if they cry they cry and</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.730" end="00:38:06.770" style="s2">then when it&#39;s time you know the mother</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.370" end="00:38:12.770" style="s2">and other people seem like world and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.770" end="00:38:17.090" style="s2">become a sociopath so the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.770" end="00:38:20.210" style="s2">to the primary caregivers can create</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.090" end="00:38:22.250" style="s2">these pathologies of self-other in</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.210" end="00:38:25.220" style="s2">worlds your to blended with the other or</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.250" end="00:38:28.130" style="s2">if you think other people are like world</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.220" end="00:38:33.130" style="s2">you become a sociopath they become</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.130" end="00:38:37.670" style="s2">object like for you this is also why</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.130" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">people who children who live you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.670" end="00:38:47.690" style="s2">this is also why well I won&#39;t get into</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.560" end="00:38:50.740" style="s2">that but okay so you studied to see how</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.690" end="00:38:54.760" style="s2">this works right now so self other world</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.740" end="00:38:59.440" style="s2">the other thing the child that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.760" end="00:39:03.650" style="s2">and the other thing is saying this</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.440" end="00:39:07.990" style="s2">indifference it&#39;s almost like the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.650" end="00:39:12.250" style="s2">way of languaging Kovarian and varying</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.990" end="00:39:17.330" style="s2">so once the second thing the child</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.250" end="00:39:19.370" style="s2">understands is what it feels like you</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.330" end="00:39:21.170" style="s2">know we were talking yesterday last time</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.370" end="00:39:23.599" style="s2">about when</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.170" end="00:39:27.349" style="s2">mouth moves ear always hears the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.599" end="00:39:31.220" style="s2">thing so there&#39;s these these packages of</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.349" end="00:39:32.390" style="s2">experience that are structures in psycho</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.220" end="00:39:34.940" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.390" end="00:39:39.319" style="s2">and one of the packages is if you live</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.940" end="00:39:41.720" style="s2">in a highly gendered family this person</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.319" end="00:39:44.059" style="s2">this other always feels like this and</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.720" end="00:39:48.380" style="s2">this other always feels like that and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.059" end="00:39:53.990" style="s2">these get hardwired as internal working</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.380" end="00:39:56.559" style="s2">models this is the formulation of male</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.990" end="00:40:01.609" style="s2">and female or masculine or feminine</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.559" end="00:40:05.920" style="s2">gender gender identities in the internal</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.609" end="00:40:13.510" style="s2">family system now what&#39;s fascinating is</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.920" end="00:40:16.280" style="s2">as the gender roles become more fluid in</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.510" end="00:40:18.589" style="s2">society you start to see more fluid</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.280" end="00:40:21.950" style="s2">gender structures as internal working</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.589" end="00:40:30.530" style="s2">models and children it&#39;s the same it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.950" end="00:40:34.910" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s how we say the same thing so</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.530" end="00:40:37.579" style="s2">that&#39;s the second that&#39;s another and</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.910" end="00:40:41.599" style="s2">some of this is fluid some of it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.579" end="00:40:45.290" style="s2">roles in society if you have a highly</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.599" end="00:40:50.210" style="s2">gendered family society and some of it</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.290" end="00:40:55.089" style="s2">is kind of biologically innate if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.210" end="00:40:55.089" style="s2">want to believe if you ascribe to that</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.809" end="00:41:03.470" style="s2">yeah so then we start to have the</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.380" end="00:41:06.619" style="s2">triangle we no self other in world and</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.470" end="00:41:09.490" style="s2">when we make a distinction between if</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.619" end="00:41:12.880" style="s2">they&#39;re gendered roles the two cells now</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.490" end="00:41:16.339" style="s2">genders are funny</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.880" end="00:41:18.710" style="s2">so I would say it&#39;s that a gendered role</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.339" end="00:41:21.290" style="s2">isomorphic roles because for example I</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.710" end="00:41:23.930" style="s2">have gay friends who have children and</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.290" end="00:41:26.569" style="s2">one just takes on such a traditional</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.930" end="00:41:28.220" style="s2">mother&#39;s role they stay home they cluck</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.569" end="00:41:31.069" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones they go to when they</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.220" end="00:41:34.080" style="s2">cry the other one goes to work and makes</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.069" end="00:41:38.970" style="s2">money so this is not a gender cat</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.080" end="00:41:40.350" style="s2">but it&#39;s an isomorphic role right does</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.970" end="00:41:42.480" style="s2">that have to really understand that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.350" end="00:41:45.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really have to do with your sex</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.480" end="00:41:52.350" style="s2">has to do with highly isomorphic roles</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.420" end="00:41:54.270" style="s2">in the nuclear family okay so that so</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.350" end="00:41:56.220" style="s2">that&#39;s the next structure the child</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.270" end="00:41:58.950" style="s2">makes there&#39;s there&#39;s this thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.220" end="00:42:01.080" style="s2">happening over here isomorphic there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.950" end="00:42:03.720" style="s2">different thing happening over here and</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.080" end="00:42:06.720" style="s2">I&#39;m it&#39;s like a triangle it I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.720" end="00:42:11.940" style="s2">child at the base this is the first</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.720" end="00:42:15.960" style="s2">family system right that I am part of</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.940" end="00:42:17.910" style="s2">this triad and this down here is called</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.960" end="00:42:19.920" style="s2">the child because all the attention and</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.910" end="00:42:22.050" style="s2">protection this one&#39;s protecting me this</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.920" end="00:42:25.320" style="s2">one&#39;s nurturing me or the protection and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.050" end="00:42:28.290" style="s2">nurturing is what happens in a highly</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.320" end="00:42:31.980" style="s2">gendered family the male becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.290" end="00:42:36.180" style="s2">protector and the provider and the woman</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.980" end="00:42:39.810" style="s2">becomes the nurturer and the safety but</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.180" end="00:42:42.030" style="s2">this is all kind of changing and that</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.810" end="00:42:46.260" style="s2">structure then is what your inner child</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.030" end="00:42:53.100" style="s2">is it&#39;s you sitting at the base of these</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.260" end="00:42:58.170" style="s2">two categories now what we tend to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.100" end="00:43:02.490" style="s2">when we are looking for partners when we</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.170" end="00:43:07.530" style="s2">look for partners and we&#39;re thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.490" end="00:43:10.320" style="s2">it in terms of family men tend to look</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.530" end="00:43:12.330" style="s2">for nurturers and women look tend to</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.320" end="00:43:17.100" style="s2">look for protectors because we think</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.330" end="00:43:23.250" style="s2">that&#39;s the you know Pythagorean shape of</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.100" end="00:43:27.060" style="s2">family and so you start to have people</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.250" end="00:43:29.670" style="s2">dating and putting kind of expectations</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.060" end="00:43:35.230" style="s2">on people to be part of this the real</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.670" end="00:43:39.410" style="s2">problem with that is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.230" end="00:43:43.420" style="s2">you&#39;re basically playing the role of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.410" end="00:43:46.850" style="s2">child when you look for your partner</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.420" end="00:43:49.100" style="s2">you&#39;re never you have it so when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.850" end="00:43:51.560" style="s2">a child and you have this structure this</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.100" end="00:43:54.500" style="s2">three-part structure that&#39;s a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.560" end="00:43:58.100" style="s2">thing it organizes reality but if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.500" end="00:44:01.460" style="s2">20 years old you don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.100" end="00:44:03.650" style="s2">organizing your reality on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.460" end="00:44:10.250" style="s2">a mental model that&#39;s appropriate to a</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.650" end="00:44:14.510" style="s2">two-year-old this is the problem now as</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.250" end="00:44:17.600" style="s2">we create as children create more and</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.510" end="00:44:20.000" style="s2">more organization they understand when</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.600" end="00:44:21.800" style="s2">they get to be like four years old their</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.000" end="00:44:23.750" style="s2">psychological structure that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.800" end="00:44:25.700" style="s2">to them is the role they set to</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.750" end="00:44:27.620" style="s2">understand mommy has a role daddy has a</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.700" end="00:44:29.810" style="s2">role they start to play doctor they</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.620" end="00:44:32.650" style="s2">start to play fireman trucks they really</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.810" end="00:44:38.270" style="s2">understand that you can step into roles</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.650" end="00:44:40.100" style="s2">it&#39;s also where they start to step back</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.270" end="00:44:42.110" style="s2">into the role of the chip excellent</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.100" end="00:44:44.150" style="s2">child because they understand it is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.110" end="00:44:47.540" style="s2">strategy they really start to understand</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.150" end="00:44:49.700" style="s2">that these roles come as packages and</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.540" end="00:44:53.750" style="s2">you can start to see them these are also</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.700" end="00:44:56.090" style="s2">internal structures that can be that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.750" end="00:44:58.990" style="s2">part of the way the child organizes</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.090" end="00:44:58.990" style="s2">their reality</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.070" end="00:45:07.160" style="s2">but the problem is is that if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.990" end="00:45:09.990" style="s2">not constantly upgraded or updated</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.160" end="00:45:12.240" style="s2">you&#39;ll always think the doctor is this</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.990" end="00:45:13.800" style="s2">the way you thought a doctor was when</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.240" end="00:45:15.720" style="s2">you were five years old and you always</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.800" end="00:45:17.940" style="s2">think the policeman is this and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.720" end="00:45:19.680" style="s2">always think the president is this and</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.940" end="00:45:22.830" style="s2">you always think a man is this and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.680" end="00:45:26.820" style="s2">always think a woman is this and these</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.830" end="00:45:29.580" style="s2">categories have been created when your</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.820" end="00:45:31.500" style="s2">mind was very primitive when you</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.580" end="00:45:34.920" style="s2">couldn&#39;t reason when you couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.500" end="00:45:38.850" style="s2">creative about the nuance of the human</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.920" end="00:45:40.710" style="s2">condition and that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.850" end="00:45:44.430" style="s2">psychological structures are they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.710" end="00:45:51.360" style="s2">deep internal working models of the way</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.430" end="00:45:53.700" style="s2">life is and if you&#39;re really honest with</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.360" end="00:45:57.900" style="s2">yourself we have no freaking clue of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.700" end="00:46:00.180" style="s2">way life is all we can do is try to</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.900" end="00:46:04.940" style="s2">organize some sense out of it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.180" end="00:46:04.940" style="s2">relevant and useful in our situation</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.800" end="00:46:13.369" style="s2">so would you say that a psychologist the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.660" end="00:46:14.720" style="s2">spiritual she&#39;s often is a different</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.369" end="00:46:22.099" style="s2">region mom comes with a different sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.720" end="00:46:25.520" style="s2">of feeling tone can you ask that</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.099" end="00:46:31.060" style="s2">question like in conversations a big</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.520" end="00:46:33.619" style="s2">question sure I was just wondering</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.060" end="00:46:36.230" style="s2">basically whether you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.619" end="00:46:41.810" style="s2">something like like I think young for</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.230" end="00:46:45.020" style="s2">example might say that the the father</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.810" end="00:46:49.760" style="s2">mother archetype you know becomes this</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.020" end="00:46:53.240" style="s2">like sky king sky queen in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.760" end="00:46:55.070" style="s2">whole the whole civilization and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.240" end="00:46:58.330" style="s2">why we create religions something like</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.070" end="00:47:02.170" style="s2">that but you&#39;re sort of suggesting that</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.330" end="00:47:07.760" style="s2">actually it&#39;s just a working</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.170" end="00:47:10.280" style="s2">relationship that the child has created</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.760" end="00:47:15.710" style="s2">with reality because that&#39;s the way it</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.280" end="00:47:19.580" style="s2">is for a lot of children so are you how</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.710" end="00:47:22.160" style="s2">would you think about wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.580" end="00:47:23.240" style="s2">deconstruct that for example and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.160" end="00:47:27.320" style="s2">build something that might be more</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.240" end="00:47:30.349" style="s2">appropriate in this place yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.320" end="00:47:35.060" style="s2">process of individuation is the process</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.349" end="00:47:39.050" style="s2">of dissolving these structures that</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.060" end="00:47:41.900" style="s2">stand between you and reality so I</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.050" end="00:47:45.200" style="s2">remember the first time I actually saw</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.900" end="00:47:48.530" style="s2">my father it was ft and a heart attack</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.200" end="00:47:52.240" style="s2">and he was he was in the hospital bed</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.530" end="00:47:55.880" style="s2">and I was like a little Frenchman I</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.240" end="00:48:01.359" style="s2">never knew he was little like literally</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.880" end="00:48:01.359" style="s2">I could not see that he was a little man</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.650" end="00:48:11.630" style="s2">say you know so until then you see</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.880" end="00:48:14.000" style="s2">through the archetype you actually never</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.630" end="00:48:16.580" style="s2">see the individual in front of you I</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.000" end="00:48:17.990" style="s2">work with women who will say first</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.580" end="00:48:19.910" style="s2">things out of their mouth does it I</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.990" end="00:48:22.670" style="s2">never intended to marry my</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.910" end="00:48:25.039" style="s2">father and I&#39;ll just cut them off right</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.670" end="00:48:26.990" style="s2">there you didn&#39;t marry your father the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.039" end="00:48:29.059" style="s2">only thing that&#39;s the same between your</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.990" end="00:48:31.640" style="s2">husband and your father&#39;s are a man and</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.059" end="00:48:35.480" style="s2">everything he does you put in that</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.640" end="00:48:38.780" style="s2">little tool box call my father you</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.480" end="00:48:41.180" style="s2">literally cannot see the individual who</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.780" end="00:48:44.329" style="s2">you&#39;re married to literally you have you</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.180" end="00:48:46.069" style="s2">know nothing about him and then of</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.329" end="00:48:49.670" style="s2">course that puts him in a box where he</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.069" end="00:48:51.710" style="s2">becomes what your father is so this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.670" end="00:48:53.839" style="s2">the problem with the archetypes and</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.710" end="00:48:56.059" style="s2">these primitive structures that are you</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.839" end="00:48:58.010" style="s2">know people pander to in the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.059" end="00:49:02.180" style="s2">community they&#39;re they&#39;re their</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.010" end="00:49:05.299" style="s2">constraints they&#39;re necessary for the</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.180" end="00:49:09.460" style="s2">precarious existential condition of an</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.299" end="00:49:09.460" style="s2">animal born as with a human propensity</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.750" end="00:49:19.059" style="s2">but they are they live in the past they</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.069" end="00:49:22.400" style="s2">live in the past now in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.059" end="00:49:24.470" style="s2">archetypes archetypes I&#39;m gonna give</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.400" end="00:49:26.210" style="s2">archetypes a really bad rap here I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.470" end="00:49:28.849" style="s2">a bad rap mood today</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.210" end="00:49:31.940" style="s2">what&#39;s that Peter Lindbergh said trash</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.849" end="00:49:33.859" style="s2">talking he&#39;s he answer you were trash</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.940" end="00:49:37.010" style="s2">talking so I&#39;m gonna trash talk the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.859" end="00:49:39.829" style="s2">archetypes it&#39;s a partial perspective</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.010" end="00:49:41.329" style="s2">but it&#39;s one that no one really sees I</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.829" end="00:49:43.430" style="s2">mean you know young is very</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.329" end="00:49:45.470" style="s2">controversial everything someone says</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.430" end="00:49:49.339" style="s2">they somebody else could say he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.470" end="00:49:51.559" style="s2">say or vice-versa but before there were</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.339" end="00:49:56.779" style="s2">archetypes there were allegories does</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.559" end="00:50:02.660" style="s2">anybody know what an allegory is so the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.779" end="00:50:06.710" style="s2">there before civilization before what</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.660" end="00:50:08.930" style="s2">what young call mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.710" end="00:50:11.450" style="s2">when the archetypes started becoming</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.930" end="00:50:14.029" style="s2">conceptualized more as internal models</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.450" end="00:50:17.559" style="s2">like the king and the queen</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.029" end="00:50:20.000" style="s2">there were allegories and if you read</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.559" end="00:50:23.510" style="s2">indigenous peoples stories for example</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.000" end="00:50:26.089" style="s2">they&#39;re all allegorical so like the wolf</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.510" end="00:50:28.789" style="s2">like or the coyote the Coyotes are</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.089" end="00:50:32.619" style="s2">really bad he eats everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.789" end="00:50:34.310" style="s2">babies he lies doesn&#39;t show up on time</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.619" end="00:50:37.310" style="s2">he shapes</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.310" end="00:50:38.870" style="s2">but when coyotes in trouble what do they</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.310" end="00:50:41.510" style="s2">do they go help them out</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.870" end="00:50:43.310" style="s2">and you think what you see the</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.510" end="00:50:45.410" style="s2">difference between an archetype is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.310" end="00:50:47.720" style="s2">in an architect the coyote would be the</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.410" end="00:50:50.450" style="s2">epitome of evil and then there would be</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.720" end="00:50:53.860" style="s2">good on the other side the archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.450" end="00:50:56.780" style="s2">emerge and culture with the dualistic</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.860" end="00:51:00.020" style="s2">consciousness in platonic consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.780" end="00:51:02.780" style="s2">before they were allegories and in these</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.020" end="00:51:04.490" style="s2">cultures and the early mythologies you</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.780" end="00:51:07.580" style="s2">know the early mythologies like Zeus</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.490" end="00:51:09.200" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the all-powerful person like he</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.580" end="00:51:11.360" style="s2">would do things and they would his</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.200" end="00:51:14.000" style="s2">daughter and turn into an animal and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.360" end="00:51:16.480" style="s2">animals get all this like weird stuff</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.000" end="00:51:18.740" style="s2">would go on much much richer</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.480" end="00:51:21.530" style="s2">appreciation of life as it is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.740" end="00:51:26.210" style="s2">archetypes are reduction symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.530" end="00:51:28.280" style="s2">reductions but in indigenous in these</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.210" end="00:51:30.680" style="s2">other kind of foraging tribes these</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.280" end="00:51:32.210" style="s2">early cultures that have remained today</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.680" end="00:51:34.400" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s a more sophisticated not</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.210" end="00:51:36.470" style="s2">that&#39;s not how their stories go their</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.400" end="00:51:39.830" style="s2">stories go more like social media in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.470" end="00:51:44.170" style="s2">coronavirus really truly that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.830" end="00:51:44.170" style="s2">actually more how their stories go</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.480" end="00:51:51.410" style="s2">and part of our I think what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.630" end="00:51:54.680" style="s2">asked of us is how can we become more</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.410" end="00:52:00.560" style="s2">real in this information ecology it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.680" end="00:52:04.010" style="s2">actually perhaps more real than the</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.560" end="00:52:06.200" style="s2">bubble we&#39;ve been in I mean some people</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.010" end="00:52:08.720" style="s2">are saying coronavirus is a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.200" end="00:52:10.640" style="s2">that&#39;s like saying coyote is good like</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.720" end="00:52:15.980" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s a good thing so this is kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.640" end="00:52:19.010" style="s2">of like trying to what&#39;s being at these</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.980" end="00:52:24.500" style="s2">internal working models are no longer</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.010" end="00:52:30.930" style="s2">adequate to the transparency of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.500" end="00:52:33.950" style="s2">world and so these deeper structures</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.930" end="00:52:36.299" style="s2">are things to really be mindful of and</p>

<p begin="00:52:36.299" end="00:52:50.880" style="s2">they&#39;re limiting and you you know you</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.430" end="00:52:53.819" style="s2">can do this like for example if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.880" end="00:52:55.260" style="s2">ever told a story about your childhood I</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.819" end="00:52:57.420" style="s2">mean there&#39;s certain stories you tell</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.260" end="00:53:00.270" style="s2">and you like it kind of like presents</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.420" end="00:53:01.799" style="s2">your parents you know I was born Italian</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.270" end="00:53:02.910" style="s2">family every night my father</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.799" end="00:53:04.470" style="s2">buh-buh-buh-buh</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.910" end="00:53:07.260" style="s2">you tell this story over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.470" end="00:53:10.950" style="s2">and then at a certain point you like you</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.260" end="00:53:12.240" style="s2">realize it&#39;s not a real story like you</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.950" end="00:53:15.210" style="s2">realize that&#39;s not really how it</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.240" end="00:53:18.770" style="s2">happened so this is this the point about</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.210" end="00:53:24.510" style="s2">your always retrospectively generating</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.770" end="00:53:27.539" style="s2">the paths so it fits with your idea of</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.510" end="00:53:29.640" style="s2">who you are now and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.539" end="00:53:32.089" style="s2">question of whether the past can ever be</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.640" end="00:53:32.089" style="s2">recaptured</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.960" end="00:53:38.309" style="s2">we can&#39;t ever know who our parents were</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.880" end="00:53:40.170" style="s2">really when we were young because we</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.309" end="00:53:41.940" style="s2">were too young to know they were we can</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.170" end="00:53:46.460" style="s2">only try to know who they are as</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.940" end="00:53:50.339" style="s2">individuals today all the rest is just</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.460" end="00:53:52.440" style="s2">internal churning it&#39;s a deeper level of</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.339" end="00:53:54.569" style="s2">internal talk it&#39;s a habit that goes</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.440" end="00:53:58.230" style="s2">around and around and around at this</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.569" end="00:54:01.609" style="s2">more subtle structure or structure of</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.230" end="00:54:01.609" style="s2">psychological structure</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.479" end="00:54:15.809" style="s2">yeah so conspiracy theories are part of</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.559" end="00:54:22.920" style="s2">this need for us to make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.809" end="00:54:24.989" style="s2">world one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.920" end="00:54:29.579" style="s2">interesting about conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.989" end="00:54:36.059" style="s2">you know I hate the term a lot of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.579" end="00:54:41.999" style="s2">of when the mainstream explanation</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.059" end="00:54:46.009" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense this need to make</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.999" end="00:54:50.969" style="s2">sense this is what arises spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.009" end="00:54:53.339" style="s2">and the way I would like to see I would</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.969" end="00:54:56.940" style="s2">like to see all these ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.339" end="00:55:00.420" style="s2">questions enter the information ecology</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.940" end="00:55:03.479" style="s2">and constantly how can all of this be</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.420" end="00:55:07.499" style="s2">happening at the same time how can be</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.479" end="00:55:08.279" style="s2">one Hospital be overwhelmed and 65% of</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.499" end="00:55:13.369" style="s2">the hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.279" end="00:55:17.400" style="s2">be under you know be laying off people</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.369" end="00:55:20.190" style="s2">how can we state that those two things</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.400" end="00:55:23.190" style="s2">simultaneously and then what is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.190" end="00:55:28.259" style="s2">relevant or the adequate response to</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.190" end="00:55:30.329" style="s2">that and yeah so in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.259" end="00:55:33.660" style="s2">there&#39;s some kernel of truth in every</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.329" end="00:55:36.690" style="s2">conspiracy theory is because someone is</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.660" end="00:55:38.160" style="s2">speaking of their experience first of</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.690" end="00:55:43.709" style="s2">all whether it&#39;s correctly or not</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.160" end="00:55:46.549" style="s2">correctly interpreted but also there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.709" end="00:55:51.029" style="s2">sense in which it&#39;s a ritual response</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.549" end="00:55:54.569" style="s2">like you feel some threat you feel some</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.029" end="00:55:59.309" style="s2">confinement and you&#39;re gonna respond in</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.569" end="00:56:01.229" style="s2">a ritual or archetypal way and what</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.309" end="00:56:03.959" style="s2">comes out of your mouth is like some</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.229" end="00:56:05.699" style="s2">kind of you know construct that may be</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.959" end="00:56:09.019" style="s2">over the top the aliens brought</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.699" end="00:56:16.650" style="s2">coronavirus down or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.019" end="00:56:20.099" style="s2">but I think we need to be able to live</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.650" end="00:56:25.190" style="s2">we learn how to let go of needing one</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.099" end="00:56:29.579" style="s2">narrative to connect all the dots in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.190" end="00:56:34.890" style="s2">sociology of information and let all of</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.579" end="00:56:37.650" style="s2">it in to play different degrees and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.890" end="00:56:50.309" style="s2">move from a place of response it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.650" end="00:56:53.390" style="s2">of an unknowing really the biggest thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.309" end="00:56:56.160" style="s2">is to let go when you can&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.390" end="00:57:00.000" style="s2">predictive narrative when it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.160" end="00:57:04.200" style="s2">uncertain is to let go of the need to</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.000" end="00:57:06.349" style="s2">settle for you know a story that trumps</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.200" end="00:57:06.349" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.609" end="00:57:17.579" style="s2">so Prati says so once we have dissolved</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.260" end="00:57:19.260" style="s2">these psychological structures will you</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.579" end="00:57:27.420" style="s2">proceed non conceptually replace them</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.260" end="00:57:30.450" style="s2">with better distilled models yes so is</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.420" end="00:57:32.549" style="s2">that a question or a statement ready no</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.450" end="00:57:34.589" style="s2">that&#39;s a question so obviously this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.549" end="00:57:36.299" style="s2">super super interesting and I also love</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.589" end="00:57:39.660" style="s2">like the the cutting through of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.299" end="00:57:41.480" style="s2">inner child structure right there but</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.660" end="00:57:44.039" style="s2">but at the end of the day what is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.480" end="00:57:46.289" style="s2">the next step we dissolved them but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.039" end="00:57:48.420" style="s2">sure they&#39;re quite useful to construct</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.289" end="00:57:50.490" style="s2">reality with so my question is do I</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.420" end="00:57:52.770" style="s2">eventually become completely non</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.490" end="00:57:56.549" style="s2">conceptual and receive everything but my</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.770" end="00:57:59.069" style="s2">intuition says that that might make it</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.549" end="00:58:00.869" style="s2">really time-consuming to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.069" end="00:58:04.220" style="s2">respond to reality so I would need to</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.869" end="00:58:11.960" style="s2">create some shortcuts some new</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.220" end="00:58:11.960" style="s2">conceptual scaffoldings yeah so um</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.950" end="00:58:23.680" style="s2">there&#39;s always an ability to touch with</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.070" end="00:58:29.109" style="s2">those structures I can get into a minor</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.680" end="00:58:29.859" style="s2">child but I don&#39;t think I have an inner</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.109" end="00:58:33.220" style="s2">child</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.859" end="00:58:35.560" style="s2">I think I&#39;m downwardly cause II just</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.220" end="00:58:40.359" style="s2">like you know we said we could do that</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.560" end="00:58:45.490" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m I&#39;m Reed animating the pathways</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.359" end="00:58:48.730" style="s2">that are the inner child and I also know</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.490" end="00:58:52.150" style="s2">I can tell when I&#39;m putting too much</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.730" end="00:58:54.040" style="s2">story in it I&#39;ll tell you how I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.150" end="00:58:56.800" style="s2">I&#39;m putting too much Dorian I feel the</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.040" end="00:58:58.510" style="s2">violin strings it&#39;s too sentimental</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.800" end="00:59:02.680" style="s2">children are not sentimental about</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.510" end="00:59:04.420" style="s2">themselves you see the difference so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.680" end="00:59:07.750" style="s2">can get touched in touch with me in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.420" end="00:59:10.210" style="s2">child but I know when I&#39;m storing it</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.750" end="00:59:13.780" style="s2">because I feel the little violin strings</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.210" end="00:59:16.619" style="s2">happening children are not sentimental</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.780" end="00:59:16.619" style="s2">about themselves</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.140" end="00:59:23.180" style="s2">so you start to relate you start to make</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.060" end="00:59:25.990" style="s2">these distinctions in what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.180" end="00:59:25.990" style="s2">constructed</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.570" end="00:59:32.240" style="s2">I went through a point in my life when I</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.590" end="00:59:35.420" style="s2">was what first was my partner that I</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.240" end="00:59:37.600" style="s2">have now we went to visit his his family</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.420" end="00:59:40.220" style="s2">on Nantucket and it was one of these</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.600" end="00:59:42.050" style="s2">beautiful and he went way out on the</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.220" end="00:59:44.540" style="s2">beach there was one of these beaches</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.050" end="00:59:46.460" style="s2">with no one there and the sunset was</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.540" end="00:59:49.730" style="s2">amazing and they had a carnival there</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.460" end="00:59:52.130" style="s2">and his two girls like when I was a kid</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.730" end="00:59:56.960" style="s2">I loved the merry-go-round because there</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.130" end="01:00:00.170" style="s2">was too too too much of uh I couldn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.960" end="01:00:04.490" style="s2">didn&#39;t like the the scary rides and his</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.170" end="01:00:06.410" style="s2">two daughters my my husband&#39;s brother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.490" end="01:00:08.720" style="s2">daughters went on the merry-go-round</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.410" end="01:00:11.240" style="s2">they&#39;re really young and they&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.720" end="01:00:15.260" style="s2">ground and it was the sunset and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.240" end="01:00:17.300" style="s2">beach knew my partner was my new</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.260" end="01:00:21.050" style="s2">boyfriend and the whole thing and I had</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.300" end="01:00:22.970" style="s2">a meltdown I had a meltdown watching</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.050" end="01:00:27.170" style="s2">them on the merry-go-round because I</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.970" end="01:00:29.660" style="s2">thought they&#39;re so happy now and between</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.170" end="01:00:32.680" style="s2">now and when they grow up all the pain</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.660" end="01:00:36.820" style="s2">they have to go through in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.680" end="01:00:38.570" style="s2">distractive it was just overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.820" end="01:00:42.230" style="s2">whelming right</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.570" end="01:00:44.360" style="s2">that&#39;s the little there&#39;s a story I put</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.230" end="01:00:47.360" style="s2">a story on top of what it is to be a</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.360" end="01:00:49.220" style="s2">child like the little backwards had too</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.360" end="01:00:52.900" style="s2">much of that and that little violin</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.220" end="01:00:56.420" style="s2">plays that&#39;s that&#39;s and strengthing so</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.900" end="01:00:58.840" style="s2">that&#39;s part of it is you you you start</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.420" end="01:01:00.710" style="s2">to utilize these and call</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.840" end="01:01:02.420" style="s2">subpersonalities or transitional</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.710" end="01:01:05.360" style="s2">structures just like when you get pulled</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.420" end="01:01:07.880" style="s2">over by the cop right I know what to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.360" end="01:01:10.310" style="s2">with my body I can just step into that</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.880" end="01:01:11.210" style="s2">little role but I feel the creativeness</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.310" end="01:01:16.580" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.210" end="01:01:19.640" style="s2">I feel the optionality in it so you have</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.580" end="01:01:23.120" style="s2">you you do have those but what you lose</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.640" end="01:01:26.060" style="s2">is this need for biographical coherence</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.120" end="01:01:28.400" style="s2">those all those options are no longer</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.060" end="01:01:33.020" style="s2">threaded by something you really believe</p>

<p begin="01:01:33.020" end="01:01:39.590" style="s2">soon and you start to hear people stop</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.180" end="01:01:40.339" style="s2">when they&#39;re in autobiographical</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.590" end="01:01:42.259" style="s2">coherence</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.339" end="01:01:46.579" style="s2">for those of you that are working like</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.259" end="01:01:49.130" style="s2">this the person coming out of</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.579" end="01:01:51.229" style="s2">autobiographical here incoherence will</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.130" end="01:01:54.619" style="s2">start to use the term what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.229" end="01:01:56.599" style="s2">authentic self you see they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.619" end="01:01:58.579" style="s2">looking for a structure underneath the</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.599" end="01:02:00.049" style="s2">autobiographical coherence now they know</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.579" end="01:02:02.479" style="s2">the story&#39;s not real</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.049" end="01:02:05.749" style="s2">what&#39;s the authentic self that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.479" end="01:02:10.849" style="s2">last-ditch attempt for someone to find a</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.749" end="01:02:13.190" style="s2">thing that is their self so in like the</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.849" end="01:02:15.079" style="s2">people I teach that&#39;s a lot of where</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.190" end="01:02:18.410" style="s2">people always so we have this</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.079" end="01:02:20.479" style="s2">transpersonal module called authenticity</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.410" end="01:02:24.349" style="s2">in the generative self we move from the</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.479" end="01:02:26.539" style="s2">sense of authentic self to the latent</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.349" end="01:02:30.589" style="s2">generative self the process itself is</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.539" end="01:02:32.569" style="s2">authentic not any one of those stages so</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.589" end="01:02:35.509" style="s2">you start to see when that question</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.569" end="01:02:36.950" style="s2">arises it&#39;s an unsolvable question</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.509" end="01:02:39.079" style="s2">because you&#39;re still looking for a</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.950" end="01:02:41.180" style="s2">psychological structure that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.079" end="01:02:43.219" style="s2">authentic self the authentic self is not</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.180" end="01:02:45.229" style="s2">a psychological structure is the things</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.219" end="01:02:48.890" style="s2">that capable of generating structures</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.229" end="01:02:51.440" style="s2">and organizing reality and then on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.890" end="01:02:53.319" style="s2">other side of it people start talking</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.440" end="01:02:56.420" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.319" end="01:02:59.089" style="s2">they use it language like they think</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.420" end="01:03:01.489" style="s2">that you know it&#39;s not up to me I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.089" end="01:03:04.609" style="s2">vehicle of evolution I&#39;m just I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.489" end="01:03:07.999" style="s2">used by a bigger process I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.609" end="01:03:10.430" style="s2">instrument so the notion of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.999" end="01:03:12.890" style="s2">find something in the psychological</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.430" end="01:03:15.979" style="s2">structure gives way to you&#39;re just part</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.890" end="01:03:19.609" style="s2">of this larger movement so that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.979" end="01:03:22.630" style="s2">of where me ask that that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.609" end="01:03:25.249" style="s2">weird that kind of spiritual technology</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.630" end="01:03:26.779" style="s2">happens right in those those stages</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.249" end="01:03:30.859" style="s2">there and that&#39;s that&#39;s how it typically</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.779" end="01:03:32.960" style="s2">arises yep thank you for that a super</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.859" end="01:03:34.969" style="s2">super helpful I&#39;m sorry Ryan</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.960" end="01:03:36.859" style="s2">Browns up to your initial comment right</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.969" end="01:03:39.079" style="s2">because you spoke about intention is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.859" end="01:03:40.729" style="s2">way to channel the energy and at that</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.079" end="01:03:43.249" style="s2">point the question that came for me was</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.729" end="01:03:46.400" style="s2">if I&#39;m looking at an unfolding system</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.249" end="01:03:48.079" style="s2">how can I enforce a preconceived</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.400" end="01:03:50.839" style="s2">intention because that was creating a</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.079" end="01:03:52.969" style="s2">friction between how my energy wants to</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.839" end="01:03:54.760" style="s2">flow versus what I think it should flow</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.969" end="01:03:57.890" style="s2">like exactly</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.760" end="01:03:59.750" style="s2">yeah you know so this is why I really</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.890" end="01:04:03.550" style="s2">appreciate the questions because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.750" end="01:04:06.140" style="s2">many Forks into into into the into the</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.550" end="01:04:07.580" style="s2">conversation but yes that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.140" end="01:04:10.010" style="s2">traps that&#39;s why I said you have to get</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.580" end="01:04:13.730" style="s2">deeper and you could start to taste the</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.010" end="01:04:14.780" style="s2">energy of the thought or the I you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.730" end="01:04:18.410" style="s2">it&#39;ll be different for different people</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.780" end="01:04:20.090" style="s2">for me it&#39;s always the violin it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.410" end="01:04:23.020" style="s2">always got to have something scent too</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.090" end="01:04:24.890" style="s2">sentimental that&#39;s a little habit</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.020" end="01:04:27.680" style="s2">although there&#39;s you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.890" end="01:04:31.550" style="s2">there&#39;s authentic grief and stuff too</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.680" end="01:04:34.040" style="s2">but you you start to realize that where</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.550" end="01:04:39.080" style="s2">that when the trap is being set for you</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.040" end="01:04:42.410" style="s2">by your ego you get snookered okay well</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.080" end="01:04:46.760" style="s2">this was a big dive lots of very</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.410" end="01:04:50.150" style="s2">sophisticated ideas in this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.760" end="01:04:57.200" style="s2">so just let it live in your imagination</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.150" end="01:05:01.460" style="s2">and don&#39;t try to jump down to too much</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.200" end="01:05:06.020" style="s2">of a thing and I&#39;m the host now and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.460" end="01:05:10.160" style="s2">want my duty is to remind you that the</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.020" end="01:05:12.080" style="s2">stoah is a place of dialogue around what</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.160" end="01:05:14.480" style="s2">matters most at the knife edge of</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.080" end="01:05:19.820" style="s2">history or something consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.480" end="01:05:21.440" style="s2">we operate on the kid society this is</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.820" end="01:05:23.810" style="s2">being given to you as a gift</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.440" end="01:05:27.020" style="s2">your presence here is already a gift but</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.810" end="01:05:29.150" style="s2">if you choose to support this door</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.020" end="01:05:30.410" style="s2">there&#39;s some way to do that and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.150" end="01:05:35.500" style="s2">haven&#39;t learned about it yet there&#39;s a</p>
