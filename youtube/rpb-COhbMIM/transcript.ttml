<p begin="00:00:23.599" end="00:00:30.619" style="s2">I am pessimistic that we are running out</p>

<p begin="00:00:30.619" end="00:00:39.830" style="s2">are totally out of date and not worth</p>

<p begin="00:00:41.629" end="00:00:47.059" style="s2">could address it and I think we now just</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.570" end="00:00:48.410" style="s2">barely know enough to start going down</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.059" end="00:00:52.730" style="s2">that road I don&#39;t think we know enough</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.410" end="00:00:55.280" style="s2">to describe the end state but I do think</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.730" end="00:00:59.390" style="s2">we know enough to embark and that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.280" end="00:01:02.390" style="s2">also know enough to figure out how to</p>

<p begin="00:01:19.009" end="00:01:25.010" style="s2">not independent of each other they are</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.950" end="00:01:27.530" style="s2">the result of a small number of errors</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.010" end="00:01:34.640" style="s2">in thinking that are reproduced across a</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.530" end="00:01:37.250" style="s2">large swath of the landscape and I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.640" end="00:01:40.790" style="s2">what we are lacking is not the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.250" end="00:01:43.220" style="s2">it&#39;s the wisdom that tells us now is the</p>

<p begin="00:01:53.479" end="00:02:03.430" style="s2">between right and left is it looks</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.119" end="00:02:09.280" style="s2">increasingly to me like it is a debate</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.430" end="00:02:12.739" style="s2">over you know it&#39;s a VHS Betamax debate</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.280" end="00:02:16.780" style="s2">it&#39;s a debate over something that no</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.739" end="00:02:19.760" style="s2">longer matters and that it is</p>

<p begin="00:02:24.770" end="00:02:28.110" style="s2">a core set of values that if we were not</p>

<p begin="00:02:28.110" end="00:02:34.830" style="s2">these archaic questions we we would move</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.700" end="00:02:37.740" style="s2">forward together it has become apparent</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.830" end="00:02:40.410" style="s2">in talking to folks across the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.740" end="00:02:44.070" style="s2">left-right divide from me that there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.410" end="00:02:48.810" style="s2">so much agreement about the desirability</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.070" end="00:02:52.860" style="s2">of a fair society and so little</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.810" end="00:02:57.780" style="s2">agreement over how advantageous meddling</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.860" end="00:03:00.630" style="s2">in civilization is that we are unable to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.780" end="00:03:03.480" style="s2">confront the real obstacle in other</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.630" end="00:03:07.340" style="s2">words I think if you sat people down on</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.480" end="00:03:12.000" style="s2">the right and you said if it were true</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.340" end="00:03:15.900" style="s2">that we could hedge out the risk of</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.000" end="00:03:19.650" style="s2">capture and of unintended consequences</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.900" end="00:03:23.250" style="s2">of policies that made civilization more</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.650" end="00:03:24.930" style="s2">fair would you favor it most people on</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.250" end="00:03:28.650" style="s2">the right would favor it and they would</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.930" end="00:03:32.850" style="s2">say but you can&#39;t right and if you said</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.650" end="00:03:36.540" style="s2">to the people on the left if you had to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.850" end="00:03:38.880" style="s2">recognize that solution making often</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.540" end="00:03:43.580" style="s2">produces problems that you did not</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.880" end="00:03:43.580" style="s2">anticipate could you accept that</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.060" end="00:03:48.750" style="s2">oftentimes the things that have noble</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.590" end="00:03:53.250" style="s2">objectives are more costly than they are</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.750" end="00:03:54.510" style="s2">valuable they would say sure but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.250" end="00:03:56.130" style="s2">not what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.510" end="00:03:57.600" style="s2">in fact there&#39;s lots of solutions that</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.130" end="00:04:00.750" style="s2">we can just drag off the shelf and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.600" end="00:04:02.010" style="s2">employ them and be better off so if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.750" end="00:04:04.400" style="s2">can get people to recognize that what</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.010" end="00:04:08.180" style="s2">they&#39;re really differing over is not</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.400" end="00:04:11.730" style="s2">what society we should want to build</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.180" end="00:04:14.610" style="s2">most good people agree we want a society</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.730" end="00:04:17.970" style="s2">that works that liberates people that</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.610" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">isn&#39;t authoritarian and onerous and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.970" end="00:04:25.820" style="s2">overly interested in regulating you out</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:25.820" style="s2">of taking risks that are yours to take</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.120" end="00:04:31.740" style="s2">people who can agree on that are really</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.590" end="00:04:34.710" style="s2">disagreeing over how likely it is that a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.740" end="00:04:37.440" style="s2">particular policy proposal will bring us</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.710" end="00:04:40.340" style="s2">closer to that objective or take us</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:42.120" style="s2">farther away but we&#39;re not talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.340" end="00:04:44.850" style="s2">policy that has been</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.120" end="00:04:47.460" style="s2">updated for modern circumstances we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.850" end="00:04:50.190" style="s2">talking about solutions that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.460" end="00:04:51.600" style="s2">antiquated and frankly just simply don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.190" end="00:04:54.000" style="s2">make sense because the people who</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.600" end="00:04:57.870" style="s2">engineered them could not possibly have</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.000" end="00:05:00.620" style="s2">been aware of what effect the internet</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.870" end="00:05:05.060" style="s2">would have or you know robotic</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.620" end="00:05:08.520" style="s2">manufacturing or what the downsides of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.060" end="00:05:11.580" style="s2">small changes in the composition of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.520" end="00:05:14.130" style="s2">atmosphere would be so we have to update</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.580" end="00:05:19.229" style="s2">our understanding of how to make</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.130" end="00:05:24.660" style="s2">solutions that work that is much easier</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.229" end="00:05:28.710" style="s2">now than it was for our ancestors in</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.660" end="00:05:33.180" style="s2">governance right and so I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.710" end="00:05:36.900" style="s2">the most powerful idea to me is that if</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.180" end="00:05:39.510" style="s2">you push any value to an extreme it</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.900" end="00:05:41.400" style="s2">creates a dystopian nightmare if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.510" end="00:05:43.650" style="s2">love freedom and you say well I want</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.400" end="00:05:46.020" style="s2">everybody to be free at all times to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.650" end="00:05:48.450" style="s2">anything they want you create a total</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.020" end="00:05:51.479" style="s2">catastrophe for justice on the other</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.450" end="00:05:53.880" style="s2">hand if you say look I know you love</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.479" end="00:05:58.410" style="s2">freedom but you got to be adult about it</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.880" end="00:06:00.990" style="s2">you can have 85% of the freedom that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.410" end="00:06:02.280" style="s2">would get if you were totally free right</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.990" end="00:06:04.889" style="s2">and here&#39;s what you&#39;re gonna get an</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.280" end="00:06:09.090" style="s2">exchange you&#39;re gonna get a system that</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.889" end="00:06:12.810" style="s2">protects you from unforeseeable medical</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.090" end="00:06:16.340" style="s2">mishaps that is going to enhance the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.810" end="00:06:18.510" style="s2">ability of your children to engage</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.340" end="00:06:19.830" style="s2">puzzles that will make the smarter as</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.510" end="00:06:21.000" style="s2">adults you&#39;re gonna get all of these</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.830" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">other things and you&#39;re gonna get them</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.000" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">very cheaply you&#39;re gonna give up 15% of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.280" end="00:06:28.139" style="s2">something that you have an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:29.880" style="s2">and what you&#39;re gonna get is 90% of some</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.139" end="00:06:31.880" style="s2">other stuff that is really important to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.880" end="00:06:35.310" style="s2">you - you just don&#39;t realize it</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.880" end="00:06:36.539" style="s2">people would accept that so recognizing</p>

<p begin="00:07:38.439" end="00:07:44.259" style="s2">a hundred years ago that was foreseeable</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.499" end="00:07:47.709" style="s2">I think we were stuck with partial</p>

<p begin="00:09:32.710" end="00:09:36.280" style="s2">on any given day or would you rather be</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.410" end="00:09:38.080" style="s2">constrained into driving on a</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.280" end="00:09:39.760" style="s2">predictable side of the road so that you</p>

<p begin="00:09:42.220" end="00:09:47.800" style="s2">person would so there&#39;s a lot that looks</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.920" end="00:09:49.360" style="s2">like that where if you could really see</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.800" end="00:09:51.490" style="s2">the view from 30,000 feet you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.360" end="00:09:53.290" style="s2">understand yeah I don&#39;t love the idea of</p>

<p begin="00:09:53.290" end="00:09:58.000" style="s2">regulations are more liberating than</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.960" end="00:10:00.460" style="s2">they are constraining they actually free</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:03.430" style="s2">you to drive and get to work rather than</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.460" end="00:10:04.780" style="s2">you know be terrified at any moment that</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.430" end="00:10:10.170" style="s2">somebody&#39;s gonna come careening out of</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.780" end="00:10:13.780" style="s2">nowhere and hitch so you&#39;re an optimist</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.170" end="00:10:15.640" style="s2">I&#39;m a very optimistic pessimist or very</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.780" end="00:10:18.790" style="s2">pessimistic optimist I mean you know I</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.640" end="00:10:22.600" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to put this I I think the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.790" end="00:10:24.880" style="s2">thing is I&#39;m I don&#39;t know what it means</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.600" end="00:10:26.680" style="s2">to or what the term is for somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.880" end="00:10:29.860" style="s2">defines themself as an optimist or a</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.680" end="00:10:31.390" style="s2">pessimist I&#39;m post whatever that is and</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.860" end="00:10:34.930" style="s2">the reason that I&#39;m most whatever</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.390" end="00:10:37.480" style="s2">there&#39;s glass yeah well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.930" end="00:10:40.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a unfortunately I didn&#39;t come up</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.480" end="00:10:41.920" style="s2">with it but there&#39;s a saying I like</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.210" end="00:10:43.660" style="s2">which is the optimist thinks the glass</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.920" end="00:10:45.760" style="s2">is half-full the pessimist thinks the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.660" end="00:10:49.750" style="s2">glass is half-empty and the engineer</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.760" end="00:10:53.040" style="s2">thinks it&#39;s too big how much do refills</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.750" end="00:10:56.010" style="s2">costs well my question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:58.750" style="s2">spoken like a recently starving student</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.010" end="00:11:00.520" style="s2">so I would say I&#39;m not I&#39;m not an</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.750" end="00:11:04.570" style="s2">optimist or pessimist what I am is</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.520" end="00:11:06.850" style="s2">somebody who recognizes that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.570" end="00:11:09.570" style="s2">only one way out of this and that is we</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.850" end="00:11:11.590" style="s2">have to figure out how to escape the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.570" end="00:11:13.900" style="s2">dysfunctional conversation that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.590" end="00:11:16.960" style="s2">preventing us from fixing our system and</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.900" end="00:11:17.960" style="s2">find our way to a system that at least</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.960" end="00:11:20.750" style="s2">knows how to</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.960" end="00:11:24.200" style="s2">itself and until we either fail at that</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.750" end="00:11:26.360" style="s2">or succeed at it there&#39;s no point in</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.200" end="00:11:29.420" style="s2">investing in anything else you brought</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.360" end="00:11:32.030" style="s2">up this term of maturity or acting like</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.420" end="00:11:35.630" style="s2">an adult is that a heuristic and is</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.030" end="00:11:38.560" style="s2">there such a thing as in the natural</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.630" end="00:11:41.390" style="s2">world or in the animal kingdom of</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.560" end="00:11:43.280" style="s2">maturity that the human need human</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.390" end="00:11:46.340" style="s2">beings need to grasp and develop in</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.280" end="00:11:48.380" style="s2">themselves well that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.340" end="00:11:52.550" style="s2">interesting question I mean I would say</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.380" end="00:11:55.310" style="s2">you certainly see if you were to survey</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.550" end="00:11:59.270" style="s2">animals of some type all right let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.310" end="00:12:01.880" style="s2">we looked at Jaguars if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.270" end="00:12:05.470" style="s2">survey Jaguars you would surely find</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.880" end="00:12:10.990" style="s2">that the oldest individuals actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.470" end="00:12:13.220" style="s2">invested their efforts in a way that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.990" end="00:12:15.620" style="s2">sensitive to subtleties in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.220" end="00:12:18.230" style="s2">environment that matter and insensitive</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.620" end="00:12:20.020" style="s2">to things that were a distraction right</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.230" end="00:12:24.260" style="s2">and that happens for two reasons one</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.020" end="00:12:26.540" style="s2">Jaguar is a smart animal and they they</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.260" end="00:12:28.790" style="s2">learn over time so the older you are the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.540" end="00:12:30.560" style="s2">more experience you&#39;ve had in this wiser</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.790" end="00:12:32.650" style="s2">you get the other reason is because</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.560" end="00:12:35.480" style="s2">those Jaguars that aren&#39;t very good at</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.650" end="00:12:36.830" style="s2">behaving in a wise way are eliminated</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.480" end="00:12:40.100" style="s2">over time so the ones that are left</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.830" end="00:12:41.600" style="s2">after a large number of years tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.100" end="00:12:45.820" style="s2">the ones that got it right in the first</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.600" end="00:12:48.770" style="s2">place so our older Jaguars wise</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.820" end="00:12:51.470" style="s2">undoubtedly undoubtedly they&#39;re wise</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.770" end="00:12:55.330" style="s2">about the stuff of Jaguar existence in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.470" end="00:12:59.180" style="s2">way that young cars are probably foolish</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.330" end="00:13:00.590" style="s2">so wisdom does have analogs I mean maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.180" end="00:13:02.660" style="s2">it&#39;s not even analogs it&#39;s just real</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.590" end="00:13:08.300" style="s2">real wisdom but then I guess there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.660" end="00:13:11.810" style="s2">question - about structures and actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.300" end="00:13:17.420" style="s2">this is going to be yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.810" end="00:13:21.140" style="s2">fractal you will surely find that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.420" end="00:13:24.530" style="s2">oldest claves of organisms have a design</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.140" end="00:13:25.190" style="s2">that anticipates changes in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.530" end="00:13:28.370" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.190" end="00:13:31.030" style="s2">they&#39;re greater so in other words when</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.370" end="00:13:33.680" style="s2">we look at what our I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.030" end="00:13:36.020" style="s2">the term has a certain resonance to it</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.680" end="00:13:38.000" style="s2">but I think it has the wrong emphasis we</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.020" end="00:13:40.460" style="s2">call certain things living fossils right</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.000" end="00:13:44.360" style="s2">so if we look at dragons lives for</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.460" end="00:13:47.000" style="s2">example or sharks these are designs that</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.360" end="00:13:48.920" style="s2">have existed for a very long period of</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.000" end="00:13:51.800" style="s2">time and the versions that we see today</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.920" end="00:13:54.560" style="s2">are modern versions but they&#39;re less</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.800" end="00:13:59.290" style="s2">modified from that original design than</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.560" end="00:14:04.150" style="s2">something like a fly you know or a trout</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.290" end="00:14:06.980" style="s2">so what can we say about those designs</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.150" end="00:14:10.960" style="s2">you know the term living fossil tends to</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.980" end="00:14:13.910" style="s2">suggest that there&#39;s something not very</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.960" end="00:14:16.730" style="s2">up-to-date about them when really the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.910" end="00:14:18.740" style="s2">answer is they got it right so early</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.730" end="00:14:21.020" style="s2">that the design has remained largely</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.740" end="00:14:22.670" style="s2">unchanged because they can compete even</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.020" end="00:14:25.880" style="s2">with that design so if you look at a</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.670" end="00:14:28.850" style="s2">dragonfly for example it has four large</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.880" end="00:14:31.190" style="s2">wings if you compare it to a fly two of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.850" end="00:14:34.370" style="s2">those wings have been reduced to control</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.190" end="00:14:36.170" style="s2">structures called Hall tiers you know it</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.370" end="00:14:38.900" style="s2">sort of seems like the dragonfly is</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.170" end="00:14:40.820" style="s2">missing those special control structures</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.900" end="00:14:42.200" style="s2">that allow flies to do certain things on</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.820" end="00:14:44.600" style="s2">the other hand you&#39;ve ever watched a</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.200" end="00:14:47.780" style="s2">dragonfly do what it does that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.600" end="00:14:48.980" style="s2">amazingly acrobatic creature and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.780" end="00:14:51.320" style="s2">only reason that it exists in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.980" end="00:14:53.390" style="s2">present is that that ancient design is</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.320" end="00:14:54.980" style="s2">totally capable of keeping up in at</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.390" end="00:14:57.410" style="s2">least some environments in modern</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.980" end="00:14:59.690" style="s2">circumstances so I would argue that</p>

<p begin="00:14:59.690" end="00:15:04.460" style="s2">that there is wisdom in those older</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.480" end="00:15:07.130" style="s2">designs that have persisted without as</p>

<p begin="00:15:07.130" end="00:15:13.580" style="s2">younger designs seem great but then some</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.020" end="00:15:15.710" style="s2">change in the environment will reveal</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.580" end="00:15:18.020" style="s2">that actually it wasn&#39;t - it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.710" end="00:15:20.750" style="s2">wisdom it was it was like youthful</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.020" end="00:15:23.180" style="s2">exuberance about something that then</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.750" end="00:15:24.590" style="s2">loses its appeal when the climate</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.180" end="00:15:27.910" style="s2">changes and that design no longer</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.590" end="00:15:31.700" style="s2">functions the tensions that give rise to</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.910" end="00:15:35.090" style="s2">wise designs that&#39;s found in the</p>

<p begin="00:15:52.070" end="00:15:58.760" style="s2">exactly it and that is exactly why you</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.830" end="00:16:00.980" style="s2">find me focused on the group of topics</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.760" end="00:16:03.470" style="s2">that I&#39;m focused on so I started out</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.980" end="00:16:06.260" style="s2">studying trade-offs and I started out</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.470" end="00:16:09.260" style="s2">studying them for my own reasons because</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.260" end="00:16:11.090" style="s2">they actually just simply were the key</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.260" end="00:16:14.660" style="s2">to cracking the puzzles that I found</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.090" end="00:16:17.000" style="s2">entertaining but once I began to reverse</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.660" end="00:16:18.830" style="s2">engineer what the rules of trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.000" end="00:16:21.320" style="s2">were and these were rules that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.830" end="00:16:22.730" style="s2">look up we don&#39;t they&#39;re not things that</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.320" end="00:16:24.020" style="s2">people are well enough versed in that</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.730" end="00:16:25.130" style="s2">there&#39;s some place you can go and say</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.020" end="00:16:27.020" style="s2">well what are the rules about how</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.130" end="00:16:30.440" style="s2">trade-offs work so that&#39;s what I worked</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.020" end="00:16:32.540" style="s2">on for my dissertation and those rules</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.440" end="00:16:35.390" style="s2">it turns out have nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.540" end="00:16:37.420" style="s2">biology they have to do with complex</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.390" end="00:16:41.180" style="s2">systems in which there is an objective</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.420" end="00:16:43.460" style="s2">any complex system with an objective has</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.180" end="00:16:45.500" style="s2">to abide by these rules and knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.460" end="00:16:49.850" style="s2">means that actually you&#39;re in a position</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.500" end="00:16:53.000" style="s2">to infer from dragonflies spruce trees</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.850" end="00:16:56.300" style="s2">whatever it may be you&#39;re able to infer</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.000" end="00:16:59.750" style="s2">what these tensions must look like and</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.300" end="00:17:04.370" style="s2">how a wise individual or a process that</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.750" end="00:17:06.050" style="s2">weeds out unwise designs and preserves</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.370" end="00:17:07.670" style="s2">the wise designs you can figure out</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.050" end="00:17:12.110" style="s2">exactly what that would look like and</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.670" end="00:17:15.410" style="s2">you can map it on to government&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.110" end="00:17:18.650" style="s2">really a perfectly natural thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.410" end="00:17:22.550" style="s2">you can also map it on to engineering</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.650" end="00:17:25.970" style="s2">space we can look at you know for</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.550" end="00:17:28.810" style="s2">example the design of aircraft and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.970" end="00:17:32.720" style="s2">can use the very same rules that govern</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.810" end="00:17:33.950" style="s2">you know a plant you know it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.720" end="00:17:35.660" style="s2">obvious when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.950" end="00:17:38.120" style="s2">something that flies but you can take</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.660" end="00:17:40.220" style="s2">the rules of trade off land and you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.120" end="00:17:43.190" style="s2">abstract them from plants and you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.220" end="00:17:45.140" style="s2">apply them to aircraft or governance or</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.190" end="00:17:47.110" style="s2">markets you can do it in those</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.140" end="00:17:49.640" style="s2">circumstances and the amazing thing is</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.110" end="00:17:52.070" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t take a whole heck of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.640" end="00:17:55.310" style="s2">retool the real work is just figuring</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.070" end="00:17:56.809" style="s2">out how the mapping goes right so you</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.310" end="00:17:59.720" style="s2">know it&#39;s very tempting for you</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.809" end="00:18:02.960" style="s2">to imagine that corporations are like</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.720" end="00:18:05.049" style="s2">creatures they&#39;re not that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.960" end="00:18:08.210" style="s2">right mapping and so if you try to map</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.049" end="00:18:10.100" style="s2">the creature rules onto corporations it</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.210" end="00:18:11.510" style="s2">won&#39;t work for various reasons including</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.100" end="00:18:13.700" style="s2">the fact that corporations don&#39;t die</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.510" end="00:18:17.840" style="s2">right and so their uncreate like in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.700" end="00:18:21.769" style="s2">way but there is a proper mapping and if</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.840" end="00:18:25.640" style="s2">you can find it the rules are quite</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.769" end="00:18:27.470" style="s2">intuitive in fact and the ability if</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.640" end="00:18:29.899" style="s2">people were more aware of what the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.470" end="00:18:31.220" style="s2">implications that these rules were we</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.899" end="00:18:33.620" style="s2">could take a lot of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.220" end="00:18:35.960" style="s2">trapped in one version of utopianism or</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.620" end="00:18:40.250" style="s2">another and we can say here&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.960" end="00:18:43.389" style="s2">utopianism will never work it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.250" end="00:18:46.519" style="s2">your idea isn&#39;t quite right or it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.389" end="00:18:49.429" style="s2">your idea can&#39;t possibly be right right</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.519" end="00:18:51.289" style="s2">to the extent that it is utopium it</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.429" end="00:18:53.510" style="s2">violates a rule of nature that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.289" end="00:18:55.159" style="s2">yet have a name I&#39;m still wrestling with</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.510" end="00:18:57.289" style="s2">what you mean by utopia is it because</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.159" end="00:18:59.899" style="s2">it&#39;s a closed system in some way and</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.289" end="00:19:01.940" style="s2">nature won&#39;t abide by something that</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.899" end="00:19:06.860" style="s2">that&#39;s perfect and in a certain sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.940" end="00:19:09.470" style="s2">closed simplistic fashion no I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.860" end="00:19:12.019" style="s2">there may be elements of that but first</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.470" end="00:19:14.809" style="s2">of all what I mean by utopian is two</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.019" end="00:19:17.059" style="s2">things utopians tend to focus on a</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.809" end="00:19:19.850" style="s2">single value that they wish to see</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.059" end="00:19:24.200" style="s2">maximized right and whether that value</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.850" end="00:19:26.779" style="s2">is freedom or justice or free love yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.200" end="00:19:29.779" style="s2">whatever it is anything that maximizes</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.779" end="00:19:32.149" style="s2">one value is a catastrophe because of</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.779" end="00:19:33.889" style="s2">its massive cost in every other value</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.149" end="00:19:36.950" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.889" end="00:19:39.739" style="s2">so the other thing that utopians do is</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.950" end="00:19:41.960" style="s2">they tend to imagine that they know what</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.739" end="00:19:44.600" style="s2">the system needs to be structured like</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.960" end="00:19:46.820" style="s2">in order to reach their one value right</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.600" end="00:19:49.009" style="s2">and they so they ignore the collateral</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.820" end="00:19:50.929" style="s2">damage of the other values they assume</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.009" end="00:19:53.720" style="s2">that those will be prettied up later or</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.929" end="00:19:56.119" style="s2">something it&#39;s impossible actually and</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.720" end="00:19:59.119" style="s2">they assume that they know what</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.119" end="00:20:02.320" style="s2">structure creates the elevation in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.119" end="00:20:07.220" style="s2">value and they are always under</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.320" end="00:20:12.460" style="s2">imaginative in the the unintended</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.220" end="00:20:12.460" style="s2">consequences so what I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.389" end="00:20:21.799" style="s2">effectively utopians are searching for</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.980" end="00:20:23.450" style="s2">perpetual motion machines and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.799" end="00:20:25.129" style="s2">realize that justice with perpetual</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.450" end="00:20:27.289" style="s2">motion there&#39;s a law of nature that says</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.129" end="00:20:28.970" style="s2">no such thinking can exist and as soon</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.289" end="00:20:31.519" style="s2">as you know that no such thing can exist</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.970" end="00:20:34.279" style="s2">then the question is alright step down</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.519" end="00:20:37.549" style="s2">from searching for that thing there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.279" end="00:20:39.919" style="s2">obstacle to an incredibly efficient</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.549" end="00:20:43.039" style="s2">machine there&#39;s an obstacle to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.919" end="00:20:44.480" style="s2">perfectly efficiently seen right so as</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.039" end="00:20:46.309" style="s2">soon as you recognize that you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.480" end="00:20:49.039" style="s2">be searching for a perfectly efficient</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.309" end="00:20:51.499" style="s2">machine then you can start searching for</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.039" end="00:20:53.269" style="s2">a marvelously efficient train and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.499" end="00:20:55.220" style="s2">that&#39;s really what I&#39;m arguing is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.269" end="00:20:57.470" style="s2">the state of governance which we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.220" end="00:21:00.460" style="s2">describe from here but that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.470" end="00:21:03.970" style="s2">pursuing is marvelously efficient</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.460" end="00:21:07.009" style="s2">marvelously effective and minimally</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.970" end="00:21:09.019" style="s2">invasive that it can be all of those</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.009" end="00:21:10.669" style="s2">things but as soon as you say I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.019" end="00:21:12.200" style="s2">want an invasive at all well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.669" end="00:21:13.789" style="s2">screwed it&#39;s going to be somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.200" end="00:21:15.950" style="s2">invasive if you say I wanted to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.789" end="00:21:17.480" style="s2">perfectly efficient no you&#39;re done it</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.950" end="00:21:20.570" style="s2">can&#39;t be perfectly efficient it can be</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.480" end="00:21:23.659" style="s2">marvelously efficient so this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.570" end="00:21:25.999" style="s2">the maturity recognizing that not only</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.659" end="00:21:28.730" style="s2">are there trade-offs in the world but</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.999" end="00:21:31.220" style="s2">that they are absolutely 100% guaranteed</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.730" end="00:21:33.950" style="s2">to apply to the thing that you value</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.220" end="00:21:36.799" style="s2">most right that that thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.950" end="00:21:38.359" style="s2">value most has a cost in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.799" end="00:21:40.549" style="s2">everything else and the more of it you</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.359" end="00:21:42.679" style="s2">want the higher the cost in every other</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.549" end="00:21:44.809" style="s2">thing you care about once you realize</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.679" end="00:21:45.730" style="s2">that then the question isn&#39;t how do I</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.809" end="00:21:48.550" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.730" end="00:21:50.830" style="s2">all of that one thing it&#39;s well how do I</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.550" end="00:21:53.020" style="s2">get most of that one thing and get</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.830" end="00:21:54.880" style="s2">enough of everything else in order that</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.020" end="00:21:56.560" style="s2">I can make a life out of it and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:22:55.200" end="00:23:00.389" style="s2">and in fact most of the members of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.239" end="00:23:02.639" style="s2">Academy are choosing to be part of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.389" end="00:23:05.339" style="s2">system in which getting rich is almost</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.639" end="00:23:07.649" style="s2">impossible and so it&#39;s not surprising in</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.339" end="00:23:10.589" style="s2">some sense that the values that are</p>

<p begin="00:23:54.299" end="00:23:58.349" style="s2">we can even see from here the day in</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.349" end="00:24:03.299" style="s2">immune because every class is going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.269" end="00:24:06.149" style="s2">be subject to some set of rules that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.299" end="00:24:09.839" style="s2">built around this very naive notion of</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.149" end="00:24:12.389" style="s2">privilege and white supremacy and all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.839" end="00:24:14.519" style="s2">that so that day is coming and the</p>

<p begin="00:24:53.150" end="00:24:58.700" style="s2">so in a certain way the system itself is</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.390" end="00:25:01.550" style="s2">pretty strong robust and anti fragile</p>

<p begin="00:25:26.170" end="00:25:33.850" style="s2">incredibly efficient I suspect that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.710" end="00:25:37.360" style="s2">answer is weirdly evolutionary so</p>

<p begin="00:25:37.360" end="00:25:43.850" style="s2">stuff in 1992 at the University of</p>

<p begin="00:25:43.850" end="00:25:49.580" style="s2">we took an anthropology class that</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.990" end="00:25:51.910" style="s2">described itself as about human</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.580" end="00:25:58.270" style="s2">evolution and it turned out to be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.910" end="00:26:03.500" style="s2">postmodern take on evolution those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.270" end="00:26:06.610" style="s2">have been morphing and bubbling through</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.500" end="00:26:08.960" style="s2">a quadrant of the university system</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.610" end="00:26:13.040" style="s2">since that point and of course a bit</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.960" end="00:26:16.580" style="s2">before each cohort that has encountered</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.040" end="00:26:19.700" style="s2">them has wheeled them in some</p>

<p begin="00:26:24.500" end="00:26:29.480" style="s2">have perished which means that the new</p>
