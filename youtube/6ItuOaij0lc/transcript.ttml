<p begin="00:01:57.750" end="00:02:00.840" style="s2">that you get to choose from and if one</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.549" end="00:02:03.090" style="s2">of those options doesn&#39;t work for you</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.840" end="00:02:06.079" style="s2">get to co-create new ones without taking</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.090" end="00:02:08.520" style="s2">away from the bigger the bigger group so</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.079" end="00:02:11.670" style="s2">self-management this one is really</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.520" end="00:02:12.480" style="s2">important to me as an individual I want</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.670" end="00:02:13.860" style="s2">autonomy over</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.480" end="00:02:15.780" style="s2">my own life I want to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.860" end="00:02:17.459" style="s2">access to the information I need to make</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.780" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">the decisions and then be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.459" end="00:02:19.830" style="s2">them on my own</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:23.459" style="s2">and I know in order to have that</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.830" end="00:02:25.650" style="s2">information collecting and distributing</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.459" end="00:02:28.349" style="s2">both like collective data and our own</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.650" end="00:02:31.140" style="s2">data in a way that&#39;s that&#39;s again you</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.349" end="00:02:33.750" style="s2">have no power over your own data so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.140" end="00:02:36.810" style="s2">you can feel comfortable choosing how</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.750" end="00:02:39.180" style="s2">that is used and so it&#39;s never about</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.810" end="00:02:40.799" style="s2">demanding everyone&#39;s going vegan we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.180" end="00:02:42.209" style="s2">now outlawing this it&#39;s about meeting</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.799" end="00:02:44.489" style="s2">people where they&#39;re at and giving them</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.209" end="00:02:46.980" style="s2">the tools to make their own decisions</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.489" end="00:02:50.879" style="s2">and if it is in fact ecologically and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.980" end="00:02:53.310" style="s2">health and healthier to go vegan then</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.879" end="00:02:55.290" style="s2">people will do that not a coercion but</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.310" end="00:02:57.900" style="s2">out of them feeling it in their body and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.290" end="00:03:07.190" style="s2">them having access the information that</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.900" end="00:03:09.930" style="s2">shows that that is true so is solidarity</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.190" end="00:03:13.049" style="s2">which is mutual and caring relationships</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.930" end="00:03:15.030" style="s2">and so clearly not everybody gets along</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.049" end="00:03:18.510" style="s2">never are we gonna have everyone get</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.030" end="00:03:20.459" style="s2">along but to create tools of peace and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.510" end="00:03:23.160" style="s2">inclusion and I think a big piece of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.459" end="00:03:24.930" style="s2">that is being able to say who you want</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.160" end="00:03:27.299" style="s2">to work with and don&#39;t want to work with</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.930" end="00:03:29.519" style="s2">who who do you live with and who rubs</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.299" end="00:03:31.560" style="s2">you the wrong way and being able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.519" end="00:03:34.829" style="s2">tailor your life and your groups and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.560" end="00:03:37.109" style="s2">your community around people that can</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.829" end="00:03:39.720" style="s2">see you for who you are and enjoy being</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.109" end="00:03:42.150" style="s2">with you makes life better for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.720" end="00:03:44.010" style="s2">and so curating communities and groups</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.150" end="00:03:46.260" style="s2">is part of what we do and creating</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.010" end="00:03:49.620" style="s2">mutual and caring relationships involves</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.260" end="00:03:51.450" style="s2">under self-management allowing people to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.620" end="00:03:53.400" style="s2">be with who they want but at no point do</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.450" end="00:03:55.530" style="s2">we get to kick somebody out completely I</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.400" end="00:03:59.239" style="s2">can say I don&#39;t want you at my table I</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.530" end="00:04:04.349" style="s2">can&#39;t say you don&#39;t get a table so</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.239" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">diversity this one is that we want a</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.349" end="00:04:09.030" style="s2">wide range of options over a narrow</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:11.129" style="s2">range of options and this is one area</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.030" end="00:04:13.410" style="s2">currently that there is a trade-off in</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.129" end="00:04:16.139" style="s2">if we have a monopoly there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.410" end="00:04:18.060" style="s2">efficiency there there is if we have one</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.139" end="00:04:21.209" style="s2">choice if everyone has the same building</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.060" end="00:04:22.530" style="s2">we can make that a much cheaper we all</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.209" end="00:04:24.630" style="s2">don&#39;t want the same building and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.530" end="00:04:25.700" style="s2">boring and so finding the trade-off it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.630" end="00:04:27.950" style="s2">like okay well if you get</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.700" end="00:04:29.810" style="s2">if you get the modular housing if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.950" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">dealing with housing it costs you</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.810" end="00:04:33.860" style="s2">$10,000 if you want a custom it you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:36.140" style="s2">you&#39;re the one choosing to add on to it</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.860" end="00:04:37.730" style="s2">if we have a dating site having everyone</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.140" end="00:04:39.620" style="s2">on the same dating site it has an</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.730" end="00:04:41.750" style="s2">efficiency because everyone&#39;s there you</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.620" end="00:04:43.790" style="s2">can but if it&#39;s only designed for</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.750" end="00:04:46.160" style="s2">heterosexual so it&#39;s only designed for</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.790" end="00:04:48.800" style="s2">monogamy if it&#39;s only designed for for</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.160" end="00:04:50.030" style="s2">the 90 percent then it&#39;s really designed</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.800" end="00:04:51.410" style="s2">for nobody because we&#39;re all need</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.030" end="00:04:53.090" style="s2">somewhere it&#39;s like you want to be able</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.410" end="00:04:54.500" style="s2">to be your own unique self and find</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.090" end="00:04:58.250" style="s2">somebody to matches that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.500" end="00:05:01.250" style="s2">compatible with that involves having one</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.250" end="00:05:03.740" style="s2">date in sight that is as adaptable and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.250" end="00:05:05.360" style="s2">diverse as possible and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.740" end="00:05:07.940" style="s2">continually looking for ways to make it</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.360" end="00:05:09.560" style="s2">work for you and that&#39;s part of creating</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.940" end="00:05:11.630" style="s2">the system to constantly look for ways</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.560" end="00:05:13.550" style="s2">to improve it and to empower people to</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.630" end="00:05:16.160" style="s2">bring their voice forward about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.550" end="00:05:22.070" style="s2">not working and be given the tools to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.160" end="00:05:25.340" style="s2">create those solutions themselves the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.070" end="00:05:28.730" style="s2">last one though is sustainability and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.340" end="00:05:30.710" style="s2">mean ecological survival is paramount</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.730" end="00:05:32.660" style="s2">right now we&#39;re on a planet we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.710" end="00:05:34.130" style="s2">potentially destroying and none of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.660" end="00:05:37.070" style="s2">other ones matter if we don&#39;t have air</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.130" end="00:05:38.870" style="s2">to breathe and water to drink and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.070" end="00:05:41.150" style="s2">creating a world that works when our</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.870" end="00:05:44.660" style="s2">capitalism is destroying our planet and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.150" end="00:05:46.850" style="s2">so giving people access to that</p>

<p begin="00:05:48.500" end="00:05:52.430" style="s2">is undeniable well clearly it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.780" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">undeniable or people wouldn&#39;t be denying</p>

<p begin="00:05:54.320" end="00:05:59.540" style="s2">that we can agree on the the algorithm</p>
