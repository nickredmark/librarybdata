<p begin="00:02:37.990" end="00:02:43.420" style="s2">CEO of the rites of passage Institute I</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.480" end="00:02:45.100" style="s2">actually started out as a doctor in</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.420" end="00:02:48.040" style="s2">family medicine and then I did 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.100" end="00:02:49.540" style="s2">of emergency medicine and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.040" end="00:02:52.930" style="s2">things I saw was what I call the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.540" end="00:02:55.720" style="s2">over-representation of teenagers how</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.930" end="00:02:58.630" style="s2">many boys and girls were ending up in</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.720" end="00:03:03.520" style="s2">emergency for yeah basically stupid</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.630" end="00:03:05.710" style="s2">reasons which I can talk about and as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.520" end="00:03:07.570" style="s2">result of some of my own things in life</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.710" end="00:03:10.690" style="s2">I started getting involved in some men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.570" end="00:03:12.220" style="s2">work about 25 years ago and I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.690" end="00:03:15.820" style="s2">astonished to find that all the men</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.220" end="00:03:17.650" style="s2">basically had the same problems and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.820" end="00:03:19.420" style="s2">said wow you know imagine if they&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.650" end="00:03:21.810" style="s2">something for us when we were teenagers</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.420" end="00:03:23.950" style="s2">our lives could have been very different</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.810" end="00:03:27.490" style="s2">well then as a result of that workshop</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.950" end="00:03:31.960" style="s2">we ran a men and boys father-son camp oh</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.490" end="00:03:33.520" style="s2">this is 1994 and it was just astounding</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.960" end="00:03:36.970" style="s2">we had three days out in the bush with</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.520" end="00:03:39.610" style="s2">28 men and boys sharing stories and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.970" end="00:03:41.110" style="s2">letting the boys ask questions and doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.610" end="00:03:43.000" style="s2">some really fun stuff and you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.110" end="00:03:45.910" style="s2">something extraordinary happened and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.000" end="00:03:48.280" style="s2">then I started exploring rites of</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.910" end="00:03:50.530" style="s2">passage and discovered that all over the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.280" end="00:03:52.780" style="s2">world communities indigenous communities</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.530" end="00:03:54.790" style="s2">would run a rite of passage for their</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.780" end="00:03:56.890" style="s2">boys and girls basically when they</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.790" end="00:03:58.300" style="s2">reached puberty between knowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.890" end="00:04:01.660" style="s2">fact that they were becoming young men</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.300" end="00:04:04.120" style="s2">and women and that all of these</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.660" end="00:04:05.740" style="s2">communities used the same elements to</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.120" end="00:04:07.540" style="s2">run these rites of passage they ordered</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.740" end="00:04:09.100" style="s2">the same things in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.540" end="00:04:11.410" style="s2">according to where they were but the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.100" end="00:04:13.750" style="s2">elements were always the same so then we</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.410" end="00:04:15.310" style="s2">started running some rites of passage</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.750" end="00:04:17.920" style="s2">once a year and I was still working as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.310" end="00:04:19.770" style="s2">doctor and I just saw that these</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.920" end="00:04:21.870" style="s2">programs were changing people&#39;s lives</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.770" end="00:04:24.100" style="s2">and I actually became increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.870" end="00:04:26.590" style="s2">frustrated with medicine for</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.100" end="00:04:28.540" style="s2">lots of reasons and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.590" end="00:04:31.540" style="s2">interested in rites of passage and their</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.540" end="00:04:33.640" style="s2">potential impact and as these things do</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.540" end="00:04:36.820" style="s2">it just progressively took over my life</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.640" end="00:04:40.570" style="s2">to the point where we&#39;ve now helped set</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.820" end="00:04:42.490" style="s2">up programs in probably about 80 to 100</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.570" end="00:04:44.650" style="s2">places in Australia including multiple</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.490" end="00:04:48.070" style="s2">schools and more than 20 countries</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.650" end="00:04:51.190" style="s2">globally we&#39;ve had over 150,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.070" end="00:04:54.490" style="s2">through our programs we&#39;ve got lots of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.190" end="00:04:56.800" style="s2">big projects having a lot of which has</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.490" end="00:04:59.980" style="s2">been in the last few years I think we</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.800" end="00:05:03.010" style="s2">thought the the increasing influence of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.980" end="00:05:05.430" style="s2">technology people are looking for and</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.010" end="00:05:07.960" style="s2">asking the question around what&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.430" end="00:05:08.650" style="s2">mm-hm and also what&#39;s happened to my</p>

<p begin="00:07:14.230" end="00:07:19.450" style="s2">tool but the ones who are struggling and</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.660" end="00:07:21.760" style="s2">have self-esteem issues just</p>

<p begin="00:07:21.760" end="00:07:29.890" style="s2">their phones and the actual thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.360" end="00:07:34.930" style="s2">missing is something to create this</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.890" end="00:07:39.850" style="s2">clear demarcation between your time as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.930" end="00:07:42.250" style="s2">child where your main thought is about</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.850" end="00:07:45.010" style="s2">yourself it&#39;s a very egocentric period</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.250" end="00:07:46.810" style="s2">as it&#39;s supposed to be you know being</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.010" end="00:07:49.360" style="s2">the center of the universe and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.810" end="00:07:52.840" style="s2">else looking after you which is very</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.360" end="00:07:55.120" style="s2">different from healthy adult psychology</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.840" end="00:07:58.090" style="s2">which is understanding that we&#39;re part</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.120" end="00:08:00.460" style="s2">of a community and and my work started</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.090" end="00:08:03.610" style="s2">with boys and you know we actually wrote</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.460" end="00:08:06.850" style="s2">a model it&#39;s been boy psychology or boy</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.610" end="00:08:08.770" style="s2">behavior and healthy adult man behavior</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.850" end="00:08:10.930" style="s2">but also it seems like there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.770" end="00:08:13.120" style="s2">there&#39;s you know I think Warren Farrell</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.930" end="00:08:14.740" style="s2">called it a boy boy crisis or something</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.120" end="00:08:17.560" style="s2">like this the difficulty of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.740" end="00:08:20.650" style="s2">transitioning into being an adult and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.560" end="00:08:22.990" style="s2">and and I guess rights you do rites of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.650" end="00:08:26.290" style="s2">passage for that and so one of my</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.990" end="00:08:28.060" style="s2">questions was you know how how this</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.290" end="00:08:30.460" style="s2">rites of passage</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.060" end="00:08:31.720" style="s2">how what would this look like and how it</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.460" end="00:08:34.210" style="s2">would be different than let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.720" end="00:08:36.550" style="s2">traditional rites of passage and what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.210" end="00:08:39.940" style="s2">it boys what&#39;s why boys and men and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.550" end="00:08:43.690" style="s2">what&#39;s why we we saw why is this so</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.940" end="00:08:45.610" style="s2">important well first of all I agree</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.690" end="00:08:48.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a boy crosses but I just have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.610" end="00:08:50.320" style="s2">say there&#39;s also a girl crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.040" end="00:08:51.390" style="s2">there&#39;s an elder crisis yeah and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.320" end="00:08:54.540" style="s2">a global so the next</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.390" end="00:08:55.850" style="s2">quite a few crisis points going on and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.540" end="00:08:59.550" style="s2">actually think they&#39;re all interrelated</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.850" end="00:09:01.650" style="s2">and the thing about boys is you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.550" end="00:09:03.210" style="s2">that they are supposed to be boys and</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.650" end="00:09:05.550" style="s2">children when they&#39;re children that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.210" end="00:09:07.680" style="s2">fantastic and in the main we do pretty</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.550" end="00:09:10.110" style="s2">good with our children but unless we</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.680" end="00:09:11.880" style="s2">create a transition and something to</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.110" end="00:09:15.390" style="s2">mark the fact that they&#39;re becoming men</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.880" end="00:09:18.600" style="s2">the danger is that they remain in boy</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.390" end="00:09:21.000" style="s2">behavior and boy thinking and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.600" end="00:09:25.320" style="s2">major problem if they then get to become</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.000" end="00:09:27.930" style="s2">something like a global leader or a head</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.320" end="00:09:30.930" style="s2">of a business you know or anything or</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.930" end="00:09:33.210" style="s2">even a father and the indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.930" end="00:09:35.940" style="s2">community directly noised that a shift</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.210" end="00:09:39.870" style="s2">had to happen and so they would take the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.940" end="00:09:41.880" style="s2">boys away and they would share stories</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.870" end="00:09:44.330" style="s2">as a way of passing on wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.880" end="00:09:47.430" style="s2">knowledge they would create challenges</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.330" end="00:09:50.520" style="s2">they would work to make a vision for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.430" end="00:09:54.900" style="s2">future for the for the young and they</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.520" end="00:09:57.030" style="s2">would also identify that each child each</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.900" end="00:09:59.970" style="s2">boy is different and they believe these</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.030" end="00:10:02.700" style="s2">boy had a spirit and so a critical part</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.970" end="00:10:04.470" style="s2">of the rite of passage was to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.700" end="00:10:07.140" style="s2">the spirit or the unique gifts and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.470" end="00:10:10.350" style="s2">talents of each boy</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.140" end="00:10:13.890" style="s2">and then that boy would then bring those</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.350" end="00:10:16.200" style="s2">those gifts to the community he is</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.890" end="00:10:18.090" style="s2">nothing so employs a lot of a meaning</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.200" end="00:10:20.430" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for purpose and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.090" end="00:10:22.710" style="s2">there&#39;s a big struggle for them to find</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.430" end="00:10:24.840" style="s2">that and this idea around that boy</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.710" end="00:10:27.810" style="s2">behaviors what&#39;s all about me and I want</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.840" end="00:10:30.030" style="s2">power and I can never be wrong and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.810" end="00:10:32.160" style="s2">want a mother you know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.030" end="00:10:36.240" style="s2">means still running around who just want</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.160" end="00:10:37.770" style="s2">power can never be wrong and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.240" end="00:10:39.960" style="s2">you know don&#39;t take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.770" end="00:10:42.180" style="s2">their actions and want a mother yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.960" end="00:10:44.690" style="s2">you know there&#39;s an argument that many</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.180" end="00:10:47.490" style="s2">of our world leaders are still</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.690" end="00:10:48.410" style="s2">functioning on boy psychology and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.490" end="00:10:50.970" style="s2">a big problem</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.410" end="00:10:53.460" style="s2">whereas in healthy man psychology we</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.970" end="00:10:56.250" style="s2">understand we&#39;re part of a community we</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.460" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">support others where we take</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.250" end="00:11:00.030" style="s2">responsibility and we&#39;re not looking for</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.800" end="00:11:02.910" style="s2">a mother we&#39;re actually looking for</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.030" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">genuine relationship with the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.910" end="00:11:08.170" style="s2">and when we look at all the issues</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:11.710" style="s2">happening with me too and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.170" end="00:11:12.640" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s boy behavior patriarchy is</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.710" end="00:11:15.310" style="s2">not the problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.640" end="00:11:17.470" style="s2">patriarchy is not a problem it&#39;s boy</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.310" end="00:11:21.400" style="s2">behavior which is a problem it&#39;s man in</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.470" end="00:11:25.780" style="s2">boys you know it&#39;s it&#39;s so it&#39;s boys in</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.400" end="00:11:28.180" style="s2">men&#39;s bodies and so so we believe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.780" end="00:11:30.610" style="s2">still possible to create a healthy rite</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.180" end="00:11:32.680" style="s2">of passage today we just need to know</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.610" end="00:11:35.320" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing so they don&#39;t become</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.680" end="00:11:38.250" style="s2">men because they did they remain too</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.320" end="00:11:41.410" style="s2">attached to the mother in some sense and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.250" end="00:11:43.360" style="s2">and they&#39;re not able to inspire home or</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.410" end="00:11:49.480" style="s2">leave this comfort of a domestic world</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.360" end="00:11:51.100" style="s2">in and yet go into the wilderness yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.480" end="00:11:53.800" style="s2">that&#39;s part of it I mean inna an</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.100" end="00:11:55.870" style="s2">indigenous community at 13 14 the boy</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.800" end="00:11:57.970" style="s2">would be taken away from his mother and</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.870" end="00:11:59.890" style="s2">some of them would not be allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.970" end="00:12:03.790" style="s2">talk to their mothers for three years</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.890" end="00:12:05.860" style="s2">and and and interestingly we see a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.790" end="00:12:07.570" style="s2">of teenage boys who retreat into their</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.860" end="00:12:10.000" style="s2">bedrooms and basically don&#39;t talk to</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.570" end="00:12:11.890" style="s2">their mothers for three years but you</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.000" end="00:12:15.250" style="s2">know they would be formally taken away</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.890" end="00:12:18.040" style="s2">and and it would be recognised as to</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.250" end="00:12:22.180" style="s2">what was going on and you know they</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.040" end="00:12:24.070" style="s2">would then be mentored by the men and</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.180" end="00:12:27.250" style="s2">the mothers would move to a new stage in</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.070" end="00:12:29.050" style="s2">life and would the social structure of</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.250" end="00:12:31.090" style="s2">the community would remain healthy</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.050" end="00:12:33.490" style="s2">whereas what happens now is the boys</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.090" end="00:12:36.130" style="s2">stay in the house they become monsters</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.490" end="00:12:38.260" style="s2">just eating everything that they can and</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.130" end="00:12:40.240" style="s2">and often it quite abusive to their</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.260" end="00:12:42.100" style="s2">mothers the mothers are beside</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.240" end="00:12:46.810" style="s2">themselves and don&#39;t know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.100" end="00:12:48.820" style="s2">and also this attachment remains the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.810" end="00:12:54.070" style="s2">average age that a boy in Australia</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.820" end="00:12:57.550" style="s2">leaves home is 28 Wow and you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.070" end="00:12:59.170" style="s2">that&#39;s just extraordinary and their</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.550" end="00:13:02.290" style="s2">mothers are still looking after them</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.170" end="00:13:04.510" style="s2">cooking for them washing for them and it</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.290" end="00:13:06.640" style="s2">you know it&#39;s very possibly remaining a</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.510" end="00:13:08.680" style="s2">boy this explains why they can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.640" end="00:13:10.630" style="s2">our relationships I imagine I mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.680" end="00:13:12.790" style="s2">that&#39;s right they can&#39;t go and have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.630" end="00:13:14.650" style="s2">relationship with a woman because</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.790" end="00:13:18.089" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re still in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.650" end="00:13:19.499" style="s2">with their mother that&#39;s right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.089" end="00:13:22.499" style="s2">and then they&#39;re looking for a</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.499" end="00:13:25.350" style="s2">substitute mother and then and then the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.499" end="00:13:27.509" style="s2">war starts between the man&#39;s woman and</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.350" end="00:13:29.339" style="s2">his mother as to who&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.509" end="00:13:32.639" style="s2">important woman in his life and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.339" end="00:13:34.829" style="s2">just it just doesn&#39;t go well yeah and it</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.639" end="00:13:37.019" style="s2">seems that the rights of money young</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.829" end="00:13:39.180" style="s2">people experience today is almost</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.019" end="00:13:41.910" style="s2">unconscious like they have to suffer a</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.180" end="00:13:44.279" style="s2">lot in order to become a man it seems</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.910" end="00:13:46.079" style="s2">like this the rites of passage might</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.279" end="00:13:48.990" style="s2">exist but as it exists not it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.079" end="00:13:50.970" style="s2">conscious thing it just know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.990" end="00:13:52.860" style="s2">soft they&#39;re creating their own they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.970" end="00:13:55.079" style="s2">creating their own this is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.860" end="00:13:58.259" style="s2">that&#39;s why I saw an emergency you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.079" end="00:14:01.350" style="s2">boys you know sometimes killing</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.259" end="00:14:04.709" style="s2">themselves or coming close on tire in</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.350" end="00:14:06.720" style="s2">cars on drugs in fights you know in all</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.709" end="00:14:09.569" style="s2">these sorts of things or you see it in</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.720" end="00:14:11.069" style="s2">the in the in the armed forces where</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.569" end="00:14:13.339" style="s2">they create their own rites of passage</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.069" end="00:14:17.160" style="s2">and they haze each other or in</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.339" end="00:14:19.079" style="s2">fraternities universities or in gangs so</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.160" end="00:14:22.019" style="s2">rites are passing they&#39;re actually a</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.079" end="00:14:24.269" style="s2">fundamental part of life the transition</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.019" end="00:14:27.389" style="s2">from one stage in life to the next will</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.269" end="00:14:29.730" style="s2">happen the question is whether it will</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.389" end="00:14:33.269" style="s2">be facilitated and happen in a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.730" end="00:14:35.699" style="s2">way which involves elders or whether</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.269" end="00:14:38.399" style="s2">it&#39;s created by the peers and when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.699" end="00:14:41.999" style="s2">a peer created rite of passage it</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.399" end="00:14:45.629" style="s2">becomes about power and abuse time again</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.999" end="00:14:46.379" style="s2">this is a gang yeah all of that right</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.629" end="00:14:48.420" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.379" end="00:14:50.459" style="s2">so how does that differ for it for girls</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.420" end="00:14:53.610" style="s2">maybe you could talk about girls for a</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.459" end="00:14:55.259" style="s2">minute because well you know let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.610" end="00:14:58.499" style="s2">through their rites of passage as well</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.259" end="00:15:02.069" style="s2">but a healthy girls rite of passage is</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.499" end="00:15:05.279" style="s2">facilitated by older women and is about</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.069" end="00:15:07.550" style="s2">honoring the the stages that she&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.279" end="00:15:10.920" style="s2">through and the fact that she&#39;s becoming</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.550" end="00:15:15.600" style="s2">you know a woman and a fertile woman and</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.920" end="00:15:18.029" style="s2">about getting her to learn to trust her</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.600" end="00:15:20.339" style="s2">inner knowing and in a voice and to</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.029" end="00:15:23.009" style="s2">trust and support the other women in her</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.339" end="00:15:25.259" style="s2">community all of that and when it</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.009" end="00:15:26.579" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen the girls don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.259" end="00:15:29.399" style="s2">each other they&#39;re actually in</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.579" end="00:15:30.769" style="s2">competition it becomes all about body</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.399" end="00:15:33.949" style="s2">image</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.769" end="00:15:36.050" style="s2">and I you know regularly saw girls who</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.949" end="00:15:38.509" style="s2">were creating their own rights of</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.050" end="00:15:41.209" style="s2">passage by getting drunk and you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.509" end="00:15:43.129" style="s2">losing their virginity in a terrible way</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.209" end="00:15:44.779" style="s2">or something like that and then coming</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.129" end="00:15:47.929" style="s2">into the emergency department where I</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.779" end="00:15:51.139" style="s2">was working and so you know teen</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.929" end="00:15:52.549" style="s2">pregnancy all of these things become</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.139" end="00:15:54.799" style="s2">their right of passage becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.549" end="00:15:57.350" style="s2">moment where they grow up and shift from</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.799" end="00:16:01.610" style="s2">being a girl to a woman so instead of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.350" end="00:16:05.179" style="s2">being a community celebration it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.610" end="00:16:08.509" style="s2">an individual moment of shame right and</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.179" end="00:16:11.660" style="s2">many women spend the rest of their lives</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.509" end="00:16:13.850" style="s2">on some level having to deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.660" end="00:16:16.339" style="s2">could we generalize and say that men</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.850" end="00:16:21.350" style="s2">often you know engage in antisocial</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.339" end="00:16:24.709" style="s2">behavior and women it&#39;s often social</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.350" end="00:16:28.189" style="s2">pathology like well I look at it</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.709" end="00:16:31.189" style="s2">slightly I looked at it yes I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.189" end="00:16:33.019" style="s2">way I saw it is that men will go out</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.189" end="00:16:34.670" style="s2">there and do the stupidest thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.019" end="00:16:37.220" style="s2">possible which I guess is antisocial</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.670" end="00:16:42.019" style="s2">behavior whereas girls will tend to</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.220" end="00:16:45.579" style="s2">internalize excuse me girls will tend to</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.019" end="00:16:49.910" style="s2">internalize and then get into a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.579" end="00:16:52.459" style="s2">unfortunate or difficult situation right</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.910" end="00:16:55.549" style="s2">it&#39;s almost self-harm or something like</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.459" end="00:16:58.730" style="s2">that correct it was a much more like</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.549" end="00:17:00.649" style="s2">it&#39;s Oh calm eating disorders not all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.730" end="00:17:02.509" style="s2">those things yeah and I&#39;ve heard that</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.649" end="00:17:05.389" style="s2">suicide for young girls this is like</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.509" end="00:17:09.380" style="s2">increasing because of social network and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.389" end="00:17:12.309" style="s2">Instagram and all of that yeah yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.380" end="00:17:15.649" style="s2">is definitely social media is having a</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.309" end="00:17:17.899" style="s2">you know very negative effect and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.649" end="00:17:20.059" style="s2">whole thing for me is you know we can</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.899" end="00:17:23.480" style="s2">spend the whole podcast talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.059" end="00:17:26.000" style="s2">the problems but they&#39;re well documented</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.480" end="00:17:29.389" style="s2">I think we have a tremendous opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.000" end="00:17:31.070" style="s2">in setting up healthy contemporary rites</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.389" end="00:17:34.340" style="s2">of passage which is what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.070" end="00:17:37.270" style="s2">doing for 25 years now and we see the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.340" end="00:17:40.610" style="s2">life-changing impact this has on</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.270" end="00:17:42.169" style="s2">everybody who attends so I saw the video</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.610" end="00:17:44.049" style="s2">you sent me where you were working with</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.169" end="00:17:47.929" style="s2">Aboriginal people</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.049" end="00:17:49.789" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m from Canada and and of course</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.929" end="00:17:52.519" style="s2">I&#39;ve been hearing about Aboriginal</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.789" end="00:17:55.720" style="s2">issues my whole life so I&#39;d love to hear</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.519" end="00:17:58.970" style="s2">you talk about that and sure well like</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.720" end="00:18:01.789" style="s2">you know Canada North America many other</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.970" end="00:18:05.990" style="s2">countries the indigenous population in</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.789" end="00:18:09.200" style="s2">Australia has been decimated has lost a</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.990" end="00:18:13.129" style="s2">lot of its culture and in most areas the</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.200" end="00:18:18.470" style="s2">rites of passage have been were banned</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.129" end="00:18:20.269" style="s2">for you know nearly 200 years and more</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.470" end="00:18:23.480" style="s2">and more the indigenous communities are</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.269" end="00:18:26.570" style="s2">recognizing that their culture and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.480" end="00:18:29.720" style="s2">creating something for their children is</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.570" end="00:18:32.740" style="s2">critical and 18 months ago I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.720" end="00:18:36.110" style="s2">approached by an Aboriginal elder who</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.740" end="00:18:38.230" style="s2">from the bachelor mode and he said to me</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.110" end="00:18:40.720" style="s2">we&#39;re very worried about our boys</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.230" end="00:18:43.759" style="s2">because they&#39;re running amuck and</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.720" end="00:18:45.649" style="s2">there&#39;s no right of passage there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.759" end="00:18:48.950" style="s2">nothing to bring them into manhood and</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.649" end="00:18:52.250" style="s2">and set up a mentoring system and all of</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.950" end="00:18:54.440" style="s2">that which we would like to do but it</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.250" end="00:18:56.480" style="s2">hasn&#39;t happened here for 200 years and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.440" end="00:19:00.730" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how to do it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.480" end="00:19:06.320" style="s2">can you help us which was familiar was a</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.730" end="00:19:07.789" style="s2">massive request and very humbling and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.320" end="00:19:10.730" style="s2">we agreed to do that</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.789" end="00:19:12.980" style="s2">so together using our right of passage</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.730" end="00:19:16.070" style="s2">the rite of passage framework that we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.980" end="00:19:20.799" style="s2">identified and as much culture as we</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.070" end="00:19:24.230" style="s2">could find from their community we ran a</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.799" end="00:19:26.450" style="s2">rite of passage last year which was the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.230" end="00:19:29.120" style="s2">first rite of passage for bachelor boys</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.450" end="00:19:32.269" style="s2">on Bachelor land in two hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.120" end="00:19:34.460" style="s2">and maybe we could put a link up here on</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.269" end="00:19:37.340" style="s2">the website yeah we&#39;ll do that reset</p>

<p begin="00:19:48.950" end="00:19:52.850" style="s2">living with their grandparents because</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.570" end="00:19:57.780" style="s2">bad things have happened with their</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.850" end="00:19:59.370" style="s2">parents and they they arrive on the can</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.780" end="00:20:02.940" style="s2">and they&#39;re often very resistant and</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.370" end="00:20:04.920" style="s2">difficult and Dean&#39;s something happens</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.940" end="00:20:07.320" style="s2">you know when they start hearing the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.920" end="00:20:08.940" style="s2">stories of the men when we go walking</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.320" end="00:20:10.980" style="s2">out in the bush when we listen to them</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.940" end="00:20:13.080" style="s2">when we talk to them about what they</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.980" end="00:20:14.670" style="s2">want to do with their lives and what</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.080" end="00:20:16.860" style="s2">they need to let go of if they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.670" end="00:20:18.990" style="s2">to become good men and then when we</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.860" end="00:20:21.120" style="s2">recognize and honor the gifts and</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.990" end="00:20:24.330" style="s2">talents and the genius and spirit that</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.120" end="00:20:27.000" style="s2">we see in each of them it completely</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.330" end="00:20:28.890" style="s2">changes their lives it&#39;s you know it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:20:28.890" end="00:20:35.940" style="s2">involved in well yeah III it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.480" end="00:20:38.220" style="s2">how encouraging encouraging it for it</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.940" end="00:20:39.810" style="s2">for young people it&#39;s just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.220" end="00:20:42.420" style="s2">of encouragement it&#39;s just extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.810" end="00:20:45.750" style="s2">what that can do how that can empower a</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.420" end="00:20:50.130" style="s2">young person it&#39;s like watering a plant</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.750" end="00:20:53.730" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a game-changer I mean we have</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.130" end="00:20:55.710" style="s2">so many boys who look and girls I talk</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.730" end="00:20:58.680" style="s2">mainly about boys but everything I say I</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.710" end="00:21:05.430" style="s2">believe is relevant to girls so many of</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.680" end="00:21:08.040" style="s2">our young who just don&#39;t recognize their</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.430" end="00:21:10.350" style="s2">own gifts and feel like that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.040" end="00:21:12.480" style="s2">there&#39;s another way they have to be you</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.350" end="00:21:14.340" style="s2">know they&#39;re sold through marketing that</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.480" end="00:21:16.920" style="s2">they have to look a certain way act a</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.340" end="00:21:18.420" style="s2">certain way wear certain clothes and if</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.920" end="00:21:20.550" style="s2">all of those things don&#39;t come together</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.420" end="00:21:23.010" style="s2">perfectly there&#39;s something wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.550" end="00:21:25.260" style="s2">them you know the majority of our boys</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.010" end="00:21:27.300" style="s2">and girls are walking around thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.260" end="00:21:30.510" style="s2">that there is something wrong with them</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.300" end="00:21:33.060" style="s2">oh you know that&#39;s extruding the makeup</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.510" end="00:21:36.830" style="s2">industry the makeup industry for girls</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.060" end="00:21:40.770" style="s2">the cosmetics industry is not based on</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.830" end="00:21:45.060" style="s2">highlighting their positive aspects it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.770" end="00:21:49.230" style="s2">it&#39;s based on covering over there- right</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.060" end="00:21:50.670" style="s2">no no the original meaning of makeup is</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.230" end="00:21:52.320" style="s2">actually to highlight the beauty of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.670" end="00:21:54.720" style="s2">person right that&#39;s what it should be</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.320" end="00:21:57.150" style="s2">right rather than cover up yeah believe</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.720" end="00:21:58.650" style="s2">parts of them or whatever it happens to</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.150" end="00:22:01.230" style="s2">be and you know men used to wear a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.650" end="00:22:04.070" style="s2">of jewelry and it was about pride and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.230" end="00:22:08.500" style="s2">was about you know you know the way we</p>

<p begin="00:22:22.870" end="00:22:28.000" style="s2">having an opportunity once again to hear</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.630" end="00:22:31.990" style="s2">the stories of older women and and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.000" end="00:22:34.330" style="s2">share their own stories and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.990" end="00:22:37.510" style="s2">told by their mothers or the older women</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.330" end="00:22:40.030" style="s2">who are there about the things they see</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.510" end="00:22:42.580" style="s2">in them the gifts they see they have the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.030" end="00:22:45.220" style="s2">view the the natural beauty and strength</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.580" end="00:22:48.789" style="s2">that they have you these girls just</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.220" end="00:22:52.470" style="s2">shine they they just they visibly grow</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.789" end="00:22:55.720" style="s2">in front of you and they become proud</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.470" end="00:22:58.059" style="s2">and the the theabout rights to passage</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.720" end="00:23:00.370" style="s2">which is very interesting it&#39;s supposed</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.059" end="00:23:03.940" style="s2">to be intergenerational so supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.370" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">be the elders with the the the young and</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.940" end="00:23:08.950" style="s2">and the big issue from the young is they</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:10.360" style="s2">don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re seen but when</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.950" end="00:23:10.900" style="s2">you mix the young and the elders</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.360" end="00:23:13.659" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.900" end="00:23:17.200" style="s2">the elders see the young they just do</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.659" end="00:23:19.960" style="s2">yeah and you know a big issue with</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.200" end="00:23:22.030" style="s2">elders is loneliness and lack of purpose</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.960" end="00:23:24.190" style="s2">and when you put them together with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.030" end="00:23:26.169" style="s2">young they get but you know their</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.190" end="00:23:30.130" style="s2">loneliness doesn&#39;t become an issue and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.169" end="00:23:31.929" style="s2">that the purpose is there so you know we</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.130" end="00:23:34.510" style="s2">know that there&#39;s an issue with our teen</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.929" end="00:23:37.270" style="s2">our teenagers everywhere that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.510" end="00:23:39.580" style="s2">well documented what we talk about less</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.270" end="00:23:42.490" style="s2">is that there is as great an issue with</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.580" end="00:23:46.419" style="s2">our elders yeah and the fact that those</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.490" end="00:23:50.950" style="s2">two things are completely linked that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.419" end="00:23:53.710" style="s2">that&#39;s so important isn&#39;t it I mean on</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.950" end="00:23:55.360" style="s2">one level the elders you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.710" end="00:24:00.100" style="s2">really have a culture unless you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.360" end="00:24:02.440" style="s2">elders right that&#39;s right and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.100" end="00:24:06.070" style="s2">holders of the culture and they pass it</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.440" end="00:24:09.220" style="s2">on to the young yeah and if they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.070" end="00:24:12.970" style="s2">if they&#39;re just sent out to pasture then</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.220" end="00:24:14.830" style="s2">the whole society dies we need yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.970" end="00:24:16.360" style="s2">need we need oh and also we need a</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.830" end="00:24:18.590" style="s2">process we need to be able to go through</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.360" end="00:24:20.960" style="s2">all the stages of life right</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.590" end="00:24:23.269" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s right I look at it like</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.960" end="00:24:26.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a staircase there&#39;s a staircase</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.269" end="00:24:29.690" style="s2">and we&#39;re all on that staircase and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.120" end="00:24:32.360" style="s2">idea is to keep moving gracefully and in</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.690" end="00:24:34.879" style="s2">a healthy way up the staircase yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.360" end="00:24:37.610" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is that for a boy or</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.879" end="00:24:40.519" style="s2">a girl to move from being a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.610" end="00:24:42.799" style="s2">child to a young adult their mothers and</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.519" end="00:24:46.070" style="s2">their fathers also also have to take a</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.799" end="00:24:48.110" style="s2">step the mothers have to let go the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.070" end="00:24:50.149" style="s2">fathers have to stop controlling and</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.110" end="00:24:51.710" style="s2">telling them what to do so the mothers</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.149" end="00:24:54.350" style="s2">and the fathers also need to move</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.710" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">towards the next stage of their lives</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.350" end="00:24:58.970" style="s2">well that&#39;s beauty and so the more but</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:25:01.759" style="s2">sure that young people get the more the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.970" end="00:25:04.190" style="s2">more that the elders are free to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.759" end="00:25:07.039" style="s2">themselves and you know develop their</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.190" end="00:25:08.990" style="s2">spiritual lives or or whatever right is</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.039" end="00:25:11.809" style="s2">that what you&#39;re saying that&#39;s right all</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.990" end="00:25:16.190" style="s2">we&#39;re all supposed to be moving up that</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.809" end="00:25:19.249" style="s2">staircase and and you know unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.190" end="00:25:21.529" style="s2">the a lot there&#39;s a lot of pressure for</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.249" end="00:25:24.289" style="s2">everyone to try and stay down the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.529" end="00:25:27.249" style="s2">staircase and pretend they&#39;re young yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.289" end="00:25:30.200" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s a lot of shame</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.249" end="00:25:35.179" style="s2">related to getting older especially</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.200" end="00:25:36.679" style="s2">unfortunately for women and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.179" end="00:25:38.600" style="s2">there&#39;s all this pressure to look young</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.679" end="00:25:41.230" style="s2">and and older men who are still</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.600" end="00:25:45.080" style="s2">competing and holding the young down as</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.230" end="00:25:47.149" style="s2">opposed to really giving extra respect</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.080" end="00:25:48.710" style="s2">to people because of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.149" end="00:25:50.509" style="s2">they&#39;re old I mean you see in</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.710" end="00:25:52.909" style="s2">traditional cultures like Italy where</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.509" end="00:25:55.009" style="s2">the the mother has a lot of power right</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.909" end="00:25:56.690" style="s2">she&#39;s she&#39;s very important yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.009" end="00:25:58.879" style="s2">course you know that the postmenopausal</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.690" end="00:26:02.869" style="s2">women are very important you know on</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.879" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">some level yeah yeah this almost seems</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.869" end="00:26:07.970" style="s2">like that we need to go back to our</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.600" end="00:26:09.590" style="s2">origins in some way or our tribal or</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.970" end="00:26:10.940" style="s2">tribal roots that we can understand a</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.590" end="00:26:14.779" style="s2">lot yeah I mean your relationship the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.940" end="00:26:20.269" style="s2">original people can tell us that about</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.779" end="00:26:23.539" style="s2">that well it&#39;s so interesting because at</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.269" end="00:26:25.700" style="s2">the site you know we have this emergence</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.539" end="00:26:28.029" style="s2">of artificial intelligence that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.700" end="00:26:30.259" style="s2">coming there&#39;s no doubt it&#39;s coming and</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.029" end="00:26:32.119" style="s2">technology is not going to become more</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.259" end="00:26:32.570" style="s2">of an influence out you know and so is</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.119" end="00:26:34.250" style="s2">not going to</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.570" end="00:26:36.590" style="s2">unless of an influence it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.250" end="00:26:39.649" style="s2">become more and and one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.590" end="00:26:41.179" style="s2">questions that people have is is</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.649" end="00:26:43.820" style="s2">technology and artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.179" end="00:26:44.539" style="s2">going to destroy us is it going to take</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.820" end="00:26:47.809" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.539" end="00:26:50.559" style="s2">mm-hm and and I look at it and my</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.809" end="00:26:53.000" style="s2">partner actually runs a global</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.559" end="00:26:56.779" style="s2">artificial intelligence software company</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.000" end="00:27:00.559" style="s2">and we talk about this a lot and and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.779" end="00:27:02.360" style="s2">believe that actually what is gonna save</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.559" end="00:27:03.799" style="s2">us and what&#39;s going to make the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.360" end="00:27:07.070" style="s2">difference as to whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.799" end="00:27:09.230" style="s2">technology destroys humanity is whether</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.070" end="00:27:11.929" style="s2">or whether we can actually really get in</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.230" end="00:27:14.629" style="s2">touch with what it means to be human and</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.929" end="00:27:17.600" style="s2">what it actually means to human is</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.629" end="00:27:20.120" style="s2">passing through the stages of life and</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.600" end="00:27:23.600" style="s2">recognizing them and creating rites of</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.120" end="00:27:27.080" style="s2">passage because the core reason for a</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.600" end="00:27:30.590" style="s2">rite of passage is not only to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.080" end="00:27:34.220" style="s2">a person&#39;s age and stage in life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.590" end="00:27:36.799" style="s2">also about recognizing their spirit</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.220" end="00:27:42.860" style="s2">their gifts their genius you know who</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.799" end="00:27:46.370" style="s2">they are as an individual that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.860" end="00:27:48.259" style="s2">it&#39;s about the community so so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.370" end="00:27:50.330" style="s2">about sort of restoring community isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.259" end="00:27:52.759" style="s2">it is is artificial</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.330" end="00:27:56.509" style="s2">are these new machines going to destroy</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.759" end="00:27:58.940" style="s2">humanity and even further or are they</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.509" end="00:28:02.080" style="s2">gonna allow us to self-organize into you</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.940" end="00:28:06.169" style="s2">know creative types of credits of get</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.080" end="00:28:09.740" style="s2">deeper communities yeah yeah so it</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.169" end="00:28:11.570" style="s2">becomes about creating a modern and</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.740" end="00:28:13.759" style="s2">appropriate rite of passage we can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.570" end="00:28:15.409" style="s2">back to creating aboriginal or African</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.759" end="00:28:17.600" style="s2">or Papua New Guinean rites of passage</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.409" end="00:28:21.399" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna do that and it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.600" end="00:28:23.450" style="s2">be appropriate but the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.399" end="00:28:26.029" style="s2">celebrating and recognizing the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.450" end="00:28:30.700" style="s2">different stages in life is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.029" end="00:28:30.700" style="s2">as relevant today as it&#39;s ever been</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.149" end="00:28:36.470" style="s2">so the rites of passage is I want to ask</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.940" end="00:28:39.080" style="s2">you about what they look like you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.470" end="00:28:42.200" style="s2">what do you actually do in your camps</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.080" end="00:28:43.970" style="s2">yeah and also how that differs from</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.200" end="00:28:44.970" style="s2">traditional rites of passage because I</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.970" end="00:28:47.549" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.970" end="00:28:50.700" style="s2">rites of passage we&#39;re often very brutal</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.549" end="00:28:52.799" style="s2">aren&#39;t they I mean even though they way</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.700" end="00:28:54.960" style="s2">you talked about young guys and how</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.799" end="00:28:57.120" style="s2">they&#39;re they can be very you know they</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.960" end="00:28:59.490" style="s2">can have this violence may be potential</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.120" end="00:29:01.470" style="s2">violence in them and and they want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.490" end="00:29:04.620" style="s2">push the edges and and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.470" end="00:29:07.110" style="s2">thing so so what would you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.620" end="00:29:09.120" style="s2">how do we how do we push people with</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.110" end="00:29:12.840" style="s2">that without you know in a loving way</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.120" end="00:29:16.049" style="s2">without destroying them or so in terms</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.840" end="00:29:19.409" style="s2">of the brutality side of it that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.049" end="00:29:21.360" style="s2">traditional rite of passage was created</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.409" end="00:29:23.820" style="s2">in the way it was because a boy was</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.360" end="00:29:27.240" style="s2">going to become a warrior or a hunter</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.820" end="00:29:30.480" style="s2">and so they had to be able to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.240" end="00:29:31.950" style="s2">the possibility of death or pain so the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.480" end="00:29:35.010" style="s2">majority of the rites of passage for</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.950" end="00:29:39.450" style="s2">boys involved the boys being out of face</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.010" end="00:29:42.960" style="s2">death and deal with pain the girls who</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.450" end="00:29:44.940" style="s2">were going to become you know often you</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.960" end="00:29:47.610" style="s2">know mothers and and and working thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.940" end="00:29:50.150" style="s2">that you know as within the community a</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.610" end="00:29:53.490" style="s2">lot of their rites of passage involved</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.150" end="00:29:57.450" style="s2">endurance and working together as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.490" end="00:30:00.120" style="s2">group today</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.450" end="00:30:03.570" style="s2">our boys are not going to become hunters</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.120" end="00:30:06.450" style="s2">and warriors it&#39;s more about we look at</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.570" end="00:30:07.890" style="s2">it we say to the boys what sort of men</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.450" end="00:30:10.679" style="s2">are you&#39;re going to become are you going</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.890" end="00:30:13.049" style="s2">to be men who make the world a better</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.679" end="00:30:15.600" style="s2">place and contribute positively or</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.049" end="00:30:18.090" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be men who take from the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.600" end="00:30:21.470" style="s2">world and leave it you know in a poorest</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.090" end="00:30:24.510" style="s2">state and you know also for women</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.470" end="00:30:27.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot more potential now for</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.510" end="00:30:29.100" style="s2">women to take positions of you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.480" end="00:30:31.020" style="s2">power and authority and all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.100" end="00:30:34.590" style="s2">things and and you know we very much</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.020" end="00:30:37.380" style="s2">believe that women should very much have</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.590" end="00:30:43.190" style="s2">an opportunity to access their own inner</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.380" end="00:30:45.840" style="s2">power and their inner warriors and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.190" end="00:30:51.020" style="s2">so in terms of the rights of passage</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.840" end="00:30:53.100" style="s2">today yes boys still need a way to</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.020" end="00:30:57.059" style="s2">understand that they have strength and</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.100" end="00:30:58.500" style="s2">power physically but it absolutely does</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.059" end="00:31:01.110" style="s2">not and should not be</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.500" end="00:31:03.090" style="s2">brutal and it should not be violent and</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.110" end="00:31:05.880" style="s2">in fact that&#39;s the big thing for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.090" end="00:31:09.750" style="s2">boys to learn to not be brutal and</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.880" end="00:31:12.240" style="s2">violent in their power yeah and and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.750" end="00:31:14.430" style="s2">to learn in the same way as the girls</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.240" end="00:31:16.290" style="s2">would have to trust their their inner</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.430" end="00:31:20.570" style="s2">voice and their inner knowing and to</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.290" end="00:31:23.520" style="s2">support each other and and for the girls</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.570" end="00:31:26.940" style="s2">too you know it&#39;s interesting to give</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.520" end="00:31:30.950" style="s2">the girls a real opportunity to you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.940" end="00:31:33.780" style="s2">to find their own inner power and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.950" end="00:31:35.550" style="s2">you know very much now the rites of</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.780" end="00:31:37.650" style="s2">passage whereas in the past was very</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.550" end="00:31:39.480" style="s2">clear a boy became a man a girl became a</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.650" end="00:31:45.060" style="s2">woman there are very different roles as</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.480" end="00:31:47.100" style="s2">we know and we see more and more men and</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.060" end="00:31:49.800" style="s2">you know men and women can do all roles</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.100" end="00:31:52.980" style="s2">now and so the rites of passage that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.800" end="00:31:55.680" style="s2">do have to reflect what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.980" end="00:31:58.650" style="s2">the community sure sure</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.680" end="00:32:01.200" style="s2">but do you think there&#39;s still do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.650" end="00:32:03.720" style="s2">think that this they&#39;re still I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.200" end="00:32:05.340" style="s2">they&#39;re still it&#39;s still important well</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.720" end="00:32:06.840" style="s2">for example it&#39;s still important for us</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.340" end="00:32:08.010" style="s2">to deal with pain and death he mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.840" end="00:32:09.900" style="s2">pain and death right it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.010" end="00:32:12.960" style="s2">important for us to contemplate that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.900" end="00:32:16.680" style="s2">think about that right but perhaps not</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.960" end="00:32:20.430" style="s2">use use use to not create pain and death</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.680" end="00:32:22.740" style="s2">or not use violence like like I would</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.430" end="00:32:24.540" style="s2">say a masculine person would have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.740" end="00:32:26.910" style="s2">know that he&#39;s capable of those those</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.540" end="00:32:30.450" style="s2">things and not use them and that would</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.910" end="00:32:32.910" style="s2">be real you know manhood so to speak yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.450" end="00:32:34.590" style="s2">what you know a model of the difference</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.910" end="00:32:36.300" style="s2">yeah completely</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.590" end="00:32:41.640" style="s2">in a model of the difference between boy</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.300" end="00:32:43.770" style="s2">and man behavior a boy can&#39;t stand with</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.640" end="00:32:45.480" style="s2">his emotion so if a six year old boy</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.770" end="00:32:47.550" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get what he wants</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.480" end="00:32:49.530" style="s2">he&#39;ll have a temper tantrum he&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.550" end="00:32:51.300" style="s2">and hit his mother and he&#39;ll tell he</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.530" end="00:32:52.980" style="s2">hates her and you&#39;re the worst mummy in</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.300" end="00:32:55.800" style="s2">the world and you know all of those</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.980" end="00:32:59.640" style="s2">things and that&#39;s okay in a six-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.800" end="00:33:01.860" style="s2">boy but for a 30 year old man or a 40</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.640" end="00:33:03.150" style="s2">year old man it&#39;s not appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.860" end="00:33:04.830" style="s2">you know we&#39;re allowed to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.150" end="00:33:06.990" style="s2">disappointed and we&#39;re allowed to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.830" end="00:33:08.929" style="s2">angry but we&#39;re not allowed to do is</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.990" end="00:33:12.150" style="s2">then transfer that on to others</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.929" end="00:33:15.090" style="s2">physically verbally or emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.150" end="00:33:17.280" style="s2">that&#39;s not okay and that&#39;s that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.090" end="00:33:19.080" style="s2">something that has to be taught and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.280" end="00:33:21.090" style="s2">know work through in in a right of</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.080" end="00:33:23.160" style="s2">passage and when you talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.090" end="00:33:26.220" style="s2">grief and loss one of the key elements</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.160" end="00:33:29.280" style="s2">of a rite of passage always was using</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.220" end="00:33:31.680" style="s2">stories as a way of passing on wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.280" end="00:33:33.750" style="s2">and knowledge so on our programs we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.680" end="00:33:37.020" style="s2">sit around everyday hopefully around a</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.750" end="00:33:39.180" style="s2">fire man boy man boy man boil on a</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.020" end="00:33:42.270" style="s2">girl&#39;s program you know woman girl woman</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.180" end="00:33:45.180" style="s2">go along and so you know the the men</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.270" end="00:33:47.070" style="s2">will talk about the first day we&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.180" end="00:33:49.170" style="s2">all right tell us the story about when</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.070" end="00:33:51.720" style="s2">you&#39;re a boy the age of these boys and</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.170" end="00:33:53.310" style="s2">what was your life like and what was</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.720" end="00:33:56.850" style="s2">your relationship like with your father</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.310" end="00:33:59.820" style="s2">back right and so that&#39;s the transition</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.850" end="00:34:01.920" style="s2">right it&#39;s a transmitting between father</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.820" end="00:34:04.530" style="s2">and son which is which is so important</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.920" end="00:34:06.270" style="s2">yeah and I think what you&#39;re lacking is</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.530" end="00:34:10.140" style="s2">this transmission and that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.270" end="00:34:12.480" style="s2">trying to provide right absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.140" end="00:34:15.450" style="s2">and often the most important message</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.480" end="00:34:17.970" style="s2">that the boy will get won&#39;t come from</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.450" end="00:34:20.429" style="s2">his own father&#39;s story it&#39;ll come from</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.970" end="00:34:22.070" style="s2">hearing the story of another man</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.429" end="00:34:24.390" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.070" end="00:34:27.660" style="s2">sometimes Tommy&#39;s but when they hear</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.390" end="00:34:29.460" style="s2">from many men that&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.660" end="00:34:31.890" style="s2">and and you spoke about grief and loss</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.460" end="00:34:34.950" style="s2">one of the circles we&#39;ll have as we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.890" end="00:34:37.050" style="s2">we get the older men to share stories of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.950" end="00:34:42.270" style="s2">their own experiences of grief and loss</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.050" end="00:34:45.540" style="s2">and the boys get to hear that every man</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.270" end="00:34:47.040" style="s2">goes through grief and loss and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.540" end="00:34:49.860" style="s2">actually by the time they get to our</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.040" end="00:34:54.450" style="s2">programs at 1415 a number of the boys</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.860" end="00:34:56.970" style="s2">have also experienced grief and loss so</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.450" end="00:34:58.950" style="s2">stories are a key part of a right kasi</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.970" end="00:35:03.720" style="s2">choke so when you asked about what we</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.950" end="00:35:06.060" style="s2">actually do we&#39;ll go away somewhere well</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.720" end="00:35:08.790" style="s2">we&#39;ll write a passage involves creating</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.060" end="00:35:11.400" style="s2">a separation of the person from their</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.790" end="00:35:15.390" style="s2">everyday life in their normal community</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.400" end="00:35:18.000" style="s2">and ideally into a container and so when</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.390" end="00:35:19.650" style="s2">we go away we begin we get everyone to</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.000" end="00:35:21.690" style="s2">hand in their watches and their mobile</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.650" end="00:35:24.240" style="s2">phones and all technology and reading</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.690" end="00:35:26.360" style="s2">material and we go into a container and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.240" end="00:35:30.790" style="s2">our container is the forest</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.360" end="00:35:33.200" style="s2">and everyday we&#39;ll share stories and</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.790" end="00:35:36.560" style="s2">we&#39;ll get the boys to do various</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.200" end="00:35:39.340" style="s2">challenges which may involve spending</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.560" end="00:35:42.170" style="s2">time on their own in a solo in the bush</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.340" end="00:35:44.170" style="s2">thinking about you know what behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.170" end="00:35:49.100" style="s2">they know they need to let go of and</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.170" end="00:35:50.720" style="s2">they know they all know yeah and we get</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.100" end="00:35:52.460" style="s2">the boys to create a vision for their</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.720" end="00:35:55.880" style="s2">future about what sort of men they want</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.460" end="00:35:59.000" style="s2">to be and we do this process the</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.880" end="00:36:01.210" style="s2">honouring that I described where each of</p>

<p begin="00:42:08.080" end="00:42:14.800" style="s2">world and and it&#39;s amazing how easy in</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.310" end="00:42:18.099" style="s2">many ways it is to build community just</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:21.580" style="s2">by getting people in circle or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.099" end="00:42:23.590" style="s2">to share their stories the first step in</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.580" end="00:42:26.050" style="s2">building community is sharing stories</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.590" end="00:42:27.790" style="s2">you know we do work in schools where we</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.050" end="00:42:29.680" style="s2">group get groups of school kids and</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.790" end="00:42:31.960" style="s2">we&#39;ll set them in you know ten in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.680" end="00:42:34.030" style="s2">circle and they each have two minutes to</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.960" end="00:42:35.920" style="s2">share their story and things that have</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.030" end="00:42:37.869" style="s2">happened in their lives and these kids</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.920" end="00:42:38.740" style="s2">who may have known each other for ten</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.869" end="00:42:40.960" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.740" end="00:42:42.640" style="s2">just keep sharing for two or three</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.960" end="00:42:46.270" style="s2">minutes learn things about each other</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.640" end="00:42:48.940" style="s2">that had no idea about and you you see</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.270" end="00:42:51.340" style="s2">the community building happening right</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.940" end="00:42:54.070" style="s2">before your eyes right that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.340" end="00:42:57.940" style="s2">interesting so what is it about stories</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.070" end="00:43:03.750" style="s2">that creates community white wire story</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.940" end="00:43:06.190" style="s2">is so important because stories are</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.750" end="00:43:08.890" style="s2">they&#39;re like a fluid thing and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.190" end="00:43:11.320" style="s2">our truth you know when I sweat someone</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.890" end="00:43:15.930" style="s2">shares their story then I have a chance</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.320" end="00:43:19.869" style="s2">to empathize and relate and connect and</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.930" end="00:43:21.820" style="s2">that person becomes real and and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.869" end="00:43:25.300" style="s2">good stories are associated with</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.820" end="00:43:29.760" style="s2">vulnerability and there&#39;s more and more</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.300" end="00:43:33.250" style="s2">coming out about how vulnerability is</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.760" end="00:43:34.839" style="s2">really the key connection and when</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.250" end="00:43:37.000" style="s2">everybody&#39;s being vulnerable and</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.839" end="00:43:39.369" style="s2">connecting that&#39;s when you start to Kay</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.000" end="00:43:41.440" style="s2">community and the best way to do that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.369" end="00:43:44.890" style="s2">through stories because the story is</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.440" end="00:43:47.770" style="s2">your your truth story is your truth</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.890" end="00:43:50.050" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah and how you articulate the</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.770" end="00:43:51.280" style="s2">world around you right how you you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.050" end="00:43:53.530" style="s2">cuz you have all this you have this</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.280" end="00:43:55.270" style="s2">chaotic chaotic like a world and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.530" end="00:43:58.300" style="s2">and then a story as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.270" end="00:44:02.619" style="s2">articulating that and making sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.300" end="00:44:05.380" style="s2">and making meaning out of it yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.619" end="00:44:07.690" style="s2">and and and I&#39;ve said in ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.380" end="00:44:10.380" style="s2">story circles 10 million story circles</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.690" end="00:44:13.300" style="s2">in my life and every time I am astounded</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.380" end="00:44:16.600" style="s2">by what comes out of people and when</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.300" end="00:44:20.590" style="s2">someone else cries I find myself crying</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.600" end="00:44:27.520" style="s2">hmm because you know Rio and I&#39;d feel</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.590" end="00:44:29.320" style="s2">them in that moment I feel yeah I had a</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.520" end="00:44:30.910" style="s2">similarity I don&#39;t cry that much but I</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.320" end="00:44:32.680" style="s2">had similar experience when I watched</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.910" end="00:44:37.030" style="s2">your video with the Aboriginal kids I</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.680" end="00:44:38.770" style="s2">just broke down yeah it was just it was</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.030" end="00:44:41.500" style="s2">so wonderful to see and it was like ah</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.770" end="00:44:44.770" style="s2">this is what people&#39;s essential humanity</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.500" end="00:44:47.020" style="s2">is is really about right this is okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.770" end="00:44:50.140" style="s2">people are sort of lost and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.020" end="00:44:52.540" style="s2">somebody somebody comes to them and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.140" end="00:44:54.190" style="s2">shows them you know just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.540" end="00:44:56.830" style="s2">opens the door just a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.190" end="00:44:58.750" style="s2">then and then suddenly suddenly they</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.830" end="00:45:01.720" style="s2">have meaning again in their life we had</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.750" end="00:45:03.610" style="s2">a boy come on our camp last week because</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.720" end="00:45:05.590" style="s2">we ran a second Aboriginal we ran the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.610" end="00:45:08.100" style="s2">same program for the second time we had</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.590" end="00:45:11.950" style="s2">a boy come from a very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.100" end="00:45:14.920" style="s2">situation at home and and he was</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.950" end="00:45:17.170" style="s2">suicidal he was openly suicidal and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.920" end="00:45:18.760" style="s2">we talked about future and he said I</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.170" end="00:45:20.650" style="s2">don&#39;t think I&#39;ll get that I think I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.760" end="00:45:24.040" style="s2">be around for very long you know all of</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.650" end="00:45:26.470" style="s2">that stuff and by the end of the camp 15</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.040" end="00:45:28.030" style="s2">year old boy on the last day I heard him</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.470" end="00:45:29.320" style="s2">talking with other boys and he and he</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.030" end="00:45:32.260" style="s2">was talking about what he was going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.320" end="00:45:33.640" style="s2">do on his 18th birthday and and a party</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.260" end="00:45:35.860" style="s2">that was gonna have at his grandmother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.640" end="00:45:38.830" style="s2">and a boat that he was gonna get to go</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.860" end="00:45:42.160" style="s2">fishing and you know in in a five day</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.830" end="00:45:45.400" style="s2">period we saw a boy move from having no</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.160" end="00:45:47.650" style="s2">hope for the future to actually planning</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.400" end="00:45:50.140" style="s2">and being excited about what he was</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.650" end="00:45:52.000" style="s2">gonna do years down the track you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.140" end="00:45:53.740" style="s2">now that boy is still gonna need a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.000" end="00:45:56.110" style="s2">of support and help and that boy is not</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.740" end="00:45:58.690" style="s2">out of trouble yet but just the fact</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.110" end="00:46:02.070" style="s2">that in five days he was able to shift</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.690" end="00:46:05.830" style="s2">from someone who is in a very dark place</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.070" end="00:46:09.670" style="s2">to actually being able to genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.830" end="00:46:12.070" style="s2">visualize a future for himself big thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.670" end="00:46:16.180" style="s2">I wrote a book called the making of men</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.070" end="00:46:18.820" style="s2">which is half about parenting and how we</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.180" end="00:46:20.830" style="s2">parent in a healthy way just doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.820" end="00:46:22.660" style="s2">things like spending time one-on-one</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.830" end="00:46:26.560" style="s2">with our children and turning off our</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.660" end="00:46:28.660" style="s2">mobile phones things like when they make</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.560" end="00:46:30.220" style="s2">a mistake or do something wrong that we</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.660" end="00:46:32.500" style="s2">don&#39;t shame them and</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.220" end="00:46:35.130" style="s2">separate the person from the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.500" end="00:46:37.810" style="s2">and user there&#39;s a learning opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.130" end="00:46:40.060" style="s2">things like practicing acknowledging</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.810" end="00:46:42.820" style="s2">their gifts and the things they do well</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.060" end="00:46:44.680" style="s2">so that was quite a lot of the first</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.820" end="00:46:47.349" style="s2">half of the book and also talks about</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.680" end="00:46:49.420" style="s2">the different boy and man behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.349" end="00:46:52.420" style="s2">the second half was all about rites of</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.420" end="00:46:54.900" style="s2">passage and how we can create them and</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.420" end="00:46:57.490" style="s2">the elements of a rite of passage and</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.900" end="00:46:59.380" style="s2">some stories from our own rites of</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.490" end="00:47:01.470" style="s2">passage that we&#39;ve run and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.380" end="00:47:06.869" style="s2">become a best-seller here in Australia</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.470" end="00:47:09.970" style="s2">and so it&#39;s quite a lot around the world</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.869" end="00:47:12.520" style="s2">yeah and if anybody&#39;s interested in</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.970" end="00:47:15.070" style="s2">getting a copy and says that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.520" end="00:47:17.800" style="s2">heard about it on your podcast very</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.070" end="00:47:19.810" style="s2">happy to give them a send them over a</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.800" end="00:47:23.260" style="s2">copy for you know I&#39;d love to read a</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.810" end="00:47:24.760" style="s2">note I&#39;ll send you a copy but if anybody</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.260" end="00:47:27.070" style="s2">once when we&#39;re happy to send them over</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.760" end="00:47:28.390" style="s2">one for data note $10 Australian or</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.070" end="00:47:30.730" style="s2">something what does it mean to be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.390" end="00:47:32.650" style="s2">warrior and and what is this association</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.730" end="00:47:35.290" style="s2">with war and violence maybe we talked</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.650" end="00:47:37.300" style="s2">about this already a little bit but I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.290" end="00:47:40.119" style="s2">like to speak to that because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.300" end="00:47:41.890" style="s2">things we say to the boys we actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.119" end="00:47:47.410" style="s2">say what&#39;s the difference between a</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.890" end="00:47:49.480" style="s2">soldier and a warrior hmm and they</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.410" end="00:47:54.119" style="s2">identified quickly that soldiers are</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.480" end="00:47:59.109" style="s2">told what to do follow orders basically</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.119" end="00:48:02.790" style="s2">whereas a true warrior is discerning and</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.109" end="00:48:07.390" style="s2">a true warrior does not use violence</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.790" end="00:48:10.210" style="s2">unnecessarily and a true warrior you</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.390" end="00:48:11.770" style="s2">know is about protecting their family</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.210" end="00:48:14.500" style="s2">and their loved ones and all of those</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.770" end="00:48:18.730" style="s2">sorts of things and this notion that</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.500" end="00:48:20.650" style="s2">boys are naturally violent I don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.730" end="00:48:23.859" style="s2">with that I think boys are actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.650" end="00:48:25.530" style="s2">naturally loyal or toxic masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.859" end="00:48:28.300" style="s2">this terrible idea that has been</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.530" end="00:48:30.220" style="s2">surfacing in the culture that that says</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.300" end="00:48:33.550" style="s2">that you know boys are sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.220" end="00:48:35.140" style="s2">made to be but are all potential rapists</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.550" end="00:48:38.740" style="s2">or something like this which is terrible</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.140" end="00:48:40.750" style="s2">I like to think that we&#39;re right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.740" end="00:48:43.420" style="s2">well the beautiful thing about our work</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.750" end="00:48:44.530" style="s2">is we get to see the special and to</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.420" end="00:48:49.780" style="s2">bring out the loving</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.530" end="00:48:52.540" style="s2">side of boys and we focus on that and we</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.780" end="00:48:55.630" style="s2">find that when they are in a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.540" end="00:49:01.090" style="s2">environment that supports them that they</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.630" end="00:49:04.090" style="s2">are you know fabulous and and I think a</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.090" end="00:49:06.760" style="s2">lot of boys are lost a lot of boys are</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.090" end="00:49:09.310" style="s2">heavily influenced from what they see on</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.760" end="00:49:13.600" style="s2">the internet and and the marketing</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.310" end="00:49:17.140" style="s2">that&#39;s all around and we could be doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.600" end="00:49:18.370" style="s2">it very differently and by yeah even</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.140" end="00:49:20.820" style="s2">things like we talked about before</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.370" end="00:49:26.760" style="s2">bringing in the influence of elders</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.820" end="00:49:31.090" style="s2">grandparents uncles or you know that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.760" end="00:49:33.940" style="s2">idea we could really change what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.090" end="00:49:37.030" style="s2">on but we as adults have to lead by</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.940" end="00:49:39.340" style="s2">example as well you know you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.030" end="00:49:41.140" style="s2">lay all the boys are the problem because</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.340" end="00:49:43.960" style="s2">boys actually learn from the behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.140" end="00:49:47.380" style="s2">they see you know that&#39;s a big part of</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.960" end="00:49:49.840" style="s2">it and you know I think we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.380" end="00:49:52.150" style="s2">taking in you know we&#39;re recognizing the</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.840" end="00:49:55.350" style="s2">problems and once again the whole meter</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.150" end="00:49:58.750" style="s2">movement has exposed a lot of problems</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.350" end="00:50:00.880" style="s2">amongst men and we need to we need to</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.750" end="00:50:02.860" style="s2">acknowledge that and then we really need</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.880" end="00:50:04.570" style="s2">to be looking at what are we going to do</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.860" end="00:50:07.630" style="s2">about this so that we don&#39;t keep</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.570" end="00:50:10.660" style="s2">perpetuating something you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.630" end="00:50:12.640" style="s2">unhealthy and really be working and</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.660" end="00:50:14.590" style="s2">looking at you know what is healthy</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.640" end="00:50:16.960" style="s2">masculinity and and you can&#39;t have a</p>
