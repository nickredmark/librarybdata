<p begin="00:01:40.799" end="00:01:46.380" style="s2">looked good on my face but also it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.700" end="00:01:47.820" style="s2">more about internally like what do I</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.380" end="00:01:48.810" style="s2">think looks good so I didn&#39;t bring a</p>

<p begin="00:01:52.860" end="00:01:58.920" style="s2">myself look good in society I care more</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.909" end="00:02:00.570" style="s2">about my internal validation so what</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.920" end="00:02:03.450" style="s2">makes what do I like what do I feel good</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.570" end="00:02:05.369" style="s2">good and I tried on lots of the men&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:15.570" style="s2">all of the ways that I do that did I</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.020" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">and the flipside of that too is of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.570" end="00:02:22.830" style="s2">course pushing things away like wanting</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:25.080" style="s2">to look like a scrub which I do a lot is</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.830" end="00:02:27.690" style="s2">just the flipside of needing to look</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.080" end="00:02:29.970" style="s2">really good for everyone and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.690" end="00:02:32.190" style="s2">as unhealthy so being like okay what</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.970" end="00:02:33.930" style="s2">makes me feel attractive what makes me</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.190" end="00:02:37.110" style="s2">feel powerful what makes me feel like my</p>

<p begin="00:02:45.120" end="00:02:50.400" style="s2">like it&#39;s me that it&#39;s it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.760" end="00:02:53.610" style="s2">that like oh that&#39;s the one I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.400" end="00:02:55.830" style="s2">looking for it&#39;s a strange feeling and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.610" end="00:02:57.450" style="s2">it&#39;s all about it&#39;s all about me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.830" end="00:03:00.870" style="s2">not about tracking a partner it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.450" end="00:03:03.239" style="s2">about getting a job or putting out a</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.870" end="00:03:05.580" style="s2">certain persona it&#39;s just about what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.239" end="00:03:07.080" style="s2">my most authentic self and it&#39;s been an</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.580" end="00:03:08.970" style="s2">it&#39;s a fun journey and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.080" end="00:03:10.080" style="s2">ever going to necessarily be done it by</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.970" end="00:03:11.730" style="s2">the time I&#39;m done I&#39;ll probably have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.080" end="00:03:14.280" style="s2">new haircut that I like absolutely match</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.730" end="00:03:17.190" style="s2">everything to that now I&#39;m in the mood</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.280" end="00:03:19.650" style="s2">to kind of start clothes shopping and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.190" end="00:03:22.019" style="s2">things that means something to me but</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.650" end="00:03:23.430" style="s2">all the things I like are available</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.019" end="00:03:27.060" style="s2">online and when you get them they never</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.430" end="00:03:29.010" style="s2">fit right we need an app for that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.060" end="00:03:30.660" style="s2">Apple when I can we&#39;re sure I can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.010" end="00:03:33.000" style="s2">like nope that rides up on me and I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.660" end="00:03:34.739" style="s2">suggest things what I would like I said</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.000" end="00:03:35.640" style="s2">my time doing creating apps in my head</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.739" end="00:03:39.830" style="s2">that I&#39;ve no idea how to actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.640" end="00:03:42.680" style="s2">perfect for things that my intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.830" end="00:03:45.090" style="s2">either does do but I need it to do more</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.680" end="00:03:46.440" style="s2">like science and math I&#39;m fairly good at</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.090" end="00:03:48.330" style="s2">science and math but I can&#39;t do all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.440" end="00:03:51.930" style="s2">compilations and algorithms needed to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.330" end="00:03:53.519" style="s2">like make decisions on the best products</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.930" end="00:03:55.350" style="s2">to buy and the best for yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.519" end="00:03:57.900" style="s2">millions of decisions we make in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.350" end="00:03:59.610" style="s2">lifetime but also for the things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.900" end="00:04:03.360" style="s2">I&#39;m not so great at like relationships</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.610" end="00:04:05.040" style="s2">and fashion and then again I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.360" end="00:04:06.600" style="s2">someone to dress me like for society but</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.040" end="00:04:07.769" style="s2">to be like hey here&#39;s my style here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.600" end="00:04:10.049" style="s2">wardrobe what should I wear to this</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.769" end="00:04:11.549" style="s2">event what should i what should I wear</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.049" end="00:04:15.440" style="s2">that I don&#39;t like it when my clothes do</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.549" end="00:04:18.539" style="s2">this right like I know for me I sweat</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.440" end="00:04:20.310" style="s2">and so if something&#39;s like in my armpits</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.539" end="00:04:22.740" style="s2">then it just gets gross and looks like</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.310" end="00:04:23.400" style="s2">it&#39;s sweaty and the more I like stress</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.740" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.400" end="00:04:27.990" style="s2">course than what happens so the more</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:30.479" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay like it it&#39;s a positive</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.990" end="00:04:33.720" style="s2">feedback loop it feels very negative and</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.479" end="00:04:34.889" style="s2">so finding clothes like it&#39;s all by</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.720" end="00:04:36.330" style="s2">something that I love and then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.889" end="00:04:38.820" style="s2">never wear it because the first time I</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.330" end="00:04:40.320" style="s2">wear it again it looks gross and so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.820" end="00:04:41.699" style="s2">know then I know that happens and then I</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.320" end="00:04:43.070" style="s2">feel self-conscious and then I just</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.699" end="00:04:47.910" style="s2">never wear it even though I loved it</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.070" end="00:04:49.139" style="s2">it&#39;s why I bought it and more rambling</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.910" end="00:04:51.680" style="s2">every day is rambling</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.139" end="00:04:54.830" style="s2">I&#39;ve got to go still write for an hour</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.680" end="00:04:57.419" style="s2">explain my global cooperative that</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.830" end="00:04:59.880" style="s2">energizes me and it&#39;s my mission on this</p>

<p begin="00:04:59.880" end="00:05:04.190" style="s2">just like I should actually leave the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.590" end="00:05:06.360" style="s2">house and be with people sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.190" end="00:05:11.090" style="s2">figuring those things out my hobbies are</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.360" end="00:05:13.500" style="s2">what my interests are boom attract you</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.090" end="00:05:15.960" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s funny the more I narrow it</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.500" end="00:05:17.849" style="s2">down who I&#39;m attracted to the more</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.960" end="00:05:20.490" style="s2">people attracted to that doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.849" end="00:05:24.270" style="s2">sense does it it was like everyone</p>
