<p begin="00:02:37.600" end="00:02:41.830" style="s2">involved in this whole stoic thing about</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.790" end="00:02:43.510" style="s2">nine months ago a Peter contacted me and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.830" end="00:02:45.130" style="s2">asked if I could teach the wim HOF</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.510" end="00:02:47.290" style="s2">method to the stoic thing I thought yeah</p>

<p begin="00:02:47.290" end="00:02:52.770" style="s2">sucked you take cold showers and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.580" end="00:02:55.120" style="s2">have to suffer more than anybody what</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.770" end="00:02:57.940" style="s2">then I started to read about that I wait</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.120" end="00:03:02.260" style="s2">a second I used to always think I was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.940" end="00:03:04.210" style="s2">stoic but as a small less stoic as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.260" end="00:03:06.490" style="s2">good presbyterian child from England</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.210" end="00:03:09.640" style="s2">suck it up don&#39;t show your emotions</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.490" end="00:03:11.530" style="s2">that&#39;s why I was and one of this wim HOF</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.640" end="00:03:13.780" style="s2">method journey a few years ago and I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.530" end="00:03:16.600" style="s2">in Australia two years ago taking my</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.780" end="00:03:20.350" style="s2">masters course on the wim HOF method and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.600" end="00:03:22.780" style="s2">learning how to breathe and all that</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.350" end="00:03:25.330" style="s2">week of breathing and meditating we had</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.780" end="00:03:27.010" style="s2">this blockage that we were working on</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.330" end="00:03:28.810" style="s2">this idea inside of us that we were</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.010" end="00:03:30.580" style="s2">observing trying to understand something</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.810" end="00:03:32.590" style="s2">about ourselves all week we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.580" end="00:03:37.450" style="s2">on this and it was until that final day</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.590" end="00:03:40.270" style="s2">his long breath work practice of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.450" end="00:03:42.820" style="s2">meditating and we went into the ice tub</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.270" end="00:03:43.630" style="s2">for the last time and is when I went</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.820" end="00:03:45.640" style="s2">that ice tub</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.630" end="00:03:48.670" style="s2">that&#39;s is anybody have an ice bath</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.640" end="00:03:50.800" style="s2">before yeah it&#39;s stressful you go in and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.670" end="00:03:52.420" style="s2">you have this enormous stress response</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.800" end="00:03:54.970" style="s2">to the cold you know fight it off and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.420" end="00:03:56.830" style="s2">you control it you observant and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.970" end="00:03:58.210" style="s2">breathe and you&#39;re relaxed into it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.830" end="00:04:00.670" style="s2">go okay this is what my stress is I</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.210" end="00:04:03.010" style="s2">understand what this is now and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.670" end="00:04:05.470" style="s2">right at that moment where this thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.010" end="00:04:08.400" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been carrying all week was</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.470" end="00:04:11.500" style="s2">right in front of me and my eyes opened</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:13.570" style="s2">and I breathed in and it was like my</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.500" end="00:04:16.930" style="s2">brain was this rubik&#39;s cube and it went</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.570" end="00:04:18.609" style="s2">click and everything fell into place all</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.930" end="00:04:21.190" style="s2">the colors were lined up and i saw my</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.609" end="00:04:22.270" style="s2">life in front of me I observed</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.190" end="00:04:25.930" style="s2">everything we went through this practice</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.270" end="00:04:29.560" style="s2">where you look down on who you are from</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.930" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">above that&#39;s what I did I was outside my</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.560" end="00:04:33.340" style="s2">body looking at myself and my whole life</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:35.310" style="s2">was presented in front of me and what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.340" end="00:04:38.410" style="s2">need to do everything fell into place</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.310" end="00:04:41.680" style="s2">there&#39;s this really incredible moment of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.410" end="00:04:45.640" style="s2">clarity and I knew exactly what my life</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.680" end="00:04:47.139" style="s2">was and then I had this big rush of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.640" end="00:04:49.689" style="s2">emotions</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.139" end="00:04:53.560" style="s2">and I cried for the first time in 32</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.689" end="00:04:56.080" style="s2">years lying in this ice tub cried</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.560" end="00:04:58.659" style="s2">hysterically is the weirdest thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.080" end="00:04:59.830" style="s2">realized that this stoic life I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.659" end="00:05:02.229" style="s2">living was actually just the smallest</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.830" end="00:05:04.810" style="s2">stoic how she&#39;s denying myself what life</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.229" end="00:05:07.060" style="s2">is I was observing my life I was saying</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.810" end="00:05:09.279" style="s2">no I don&#39;t want any of that don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.060" end="00:05:11.319" style="s2">any of that but the blinders on put the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.279" end="00:05:13.900" style="s2">blinkers on I&#39;m not gonna observe my</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.319" end="00:05:18.580" style="s2">life I was gonna stumble through and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.900" end="00:05:20.080" style="s2">ignore everything when I started this</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.580" end="00:05:24.069" style="s2">breath work practice it gave me this</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.080" end="00:05:28.750" style="s2">chance to look at my life to observe it</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.069" end="00:05:31.379" style="s2">and to understand what life is I could</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.750" end="00:05:35.740" style="s2">see the impressions and make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.379" end="00:05:37.539" style="s2">for the first time in my life can I</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.740" end="00:05:40.240" style="s2">change that small as to a big s just</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.539" end="00:05:41.560" style="s2">like that so then about 9 months ago</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.240" end="00:05:42.969" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about stoicism and how</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.560" end="00:05:45.370" style="s2">that applies to the wim HOF mathis why</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.969" end="00:05:47.979" style="s2">write into it a little bit and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.370" end="00:05:49.839" style="s2">Stoics their knowledge of the human body</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.979" end="00:05:51.629" style="s2">and the universe around them and this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.839" end="00:05:54.460" style="s2">going back to the ancient Greeks Daleks</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.629" end="00:05:58.210" style="s2">they believed in this thing called the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.460" end="00:06:02.050" style="s2">pneuma which is literally translation</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.210" end="00:06:03.189" style="s2">the breath is the breath and they</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.050" end="00:06:06.430" style="s2">believed that in the pneuma was this</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.189" end="00:06:07.659" style="s2">combination of fire and air and you get</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.430" end="00:06:10.539" style="s2">experiment with this yourself you could</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.659" end="00:06:14.649" style="s2">actually just blow on your hand and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.539" end="00:06:17.020" style="s2">cold or you can and it&#39;s hot you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.649" end="00:06:18.639" style="s2">change that combination of fire and air</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.020" end="00:06:20.770" style="s2">no we know it&#39;s just evaporation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.639" end="00:06:22.810" style="s2">why it feels cold but that&#39;s the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.770" end="00:06:24.729" style="s2">this combination of air and fire and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.810" end="00:06:27.520" style="s2">permeates everything in the universe and</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.729" end="00:06:29.529" style="s2">it makes up the human soul and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.520" end="00:06:31.810" style="s2">pneuma in the human soul the human body</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.529" end="00:06:33.339" style="s2">has these eight streams as our five</p>

<p begin="00:07:04.750" end="00:07:10.200" style="s2">little bit more correct and we can liken</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.010" end="00:07:13.900" style="s2">this hegemonic on to the the neocortex</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.200" end="00:07:15.669" style="s2">or frontal lobe of our brain and again</p>

<p begin="00:07:15.669" end="00:07:19.330" style="s2">and elephants also have one too but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.530" end="00:07:23.050" style="s2">don&#39;t know if they do breathwork whales</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.330" end="00:07:24.910" style="s2">probably do but this is our seat of</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.050" end="00:07:28.930" style="s2">logic right here this is where we</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.910" end="00:07:34.900" style="s2">observe our life right here and we use</p>

<p begin="00:07:43.570" end="00:07:48.250" style="s2">we are we have stress and when we look</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.970" end="00:07:49.600" style="s2">at our brain that put of an older view</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.250" end="00:07:51.250" style="s2">of our brain we got these three little</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.600" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">brains inside of us and our very small</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.250" end="00:07:55.630" style="s2">brain is our there&#39;s our reptilian brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:58.389" style="s2">at the top of our brainstem and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.630" end="00:08:00.460" style="s2">involved in our movement patterns it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.389" end="00:08:02.050" style="s2">involved in our five senses as our feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.460" end="00:08:03.490" style="s2">it&#39;s our touches our proprioception</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.050" end="00:08:05.110" style="s2">remember when you&#39;re learning to ride a</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.490" end="00:08:07.300" style="s2">bike it was difficult you kept falling</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.110" end="00:08:08.680" style="s2">off plus your reptile brain was trying</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.300" end="00:08:10.960" style="s2">to figure it out and once you learn how</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.680" end="00:08:12.100" style="s2">to do it you didn&#39;t forget anymore</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.960" end="00:08:14.320" style="s2">because you just map it into your</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.100" end="00:08:16.330" style="s2">proprioception then beyond that we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.320" end="00:08:17.950" style="s2">our limbic system it&#39;s a deeper part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.330" end="00:08:20.020" style="s2">our brain it&#39;s our proto mammalian brain</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.950" end="00:08:22.479" style="s2">and that is the part that&#39;s in charge of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.020" end="00:08:25.210" style="s2">our fight-or-flight is our stress</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.479" end="00:08:27.010" style="s2">response part of our brain it keeps us</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.210" end="00:08:30.100" style="s2">alive it&#39;s really important and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.010" end="00:08:31.690" style="s2">saber-tooth Tiger is attacking us you</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.100" end="00:08:33.400" style="s2">want a limbic system in charge of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.690" end="00:08:36.789" style="s2">going on it helps you run away really</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.400" end="00:08:38.380" style="s2">fast or fight it off have any of you</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.789" end="00:08:41.200" style="s2">ever been attacked by a saber-toothed</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.380" end="00:08:42.479" style="s2">tiger probably not how many of you carry</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.200" end="00:08:44.830" style="s2">a phone with you</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.479" end="00:08:47.320" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s your saber-toothed tiger</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.830" end="00:08:49.690" style="s2">right there that is keeping you wired</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.190" end="00:09:01.920" style="s2">and because of a limbic system our</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.290" end="00:09:04.029" style="s2">fight-or-flight system is in charge it</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.920" end="00:09:06.190" style="s2">operates so much quicker than our</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.029" end="00:09:06.940" style="s2">neocortex the neocortex just says well</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.190" end="00:09:09.339" style="s2">forget it</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.940" end="00:09:11.380" style="s2">I don&#39;t you&#39;re part of this I&#39;ll just go</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.339" end="00:09:13.000" style="s2">quiet can we do that we can put</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.380" end="00:09:14.899" style="s2">electrodes on people&#39;s heads and look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.000" end="00:09:17.240" style="s2">the activity inside the brain and see</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.899" end="00:09:18.740" style="s2">active and for so many people is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.240" end="00:09:20.839" style="s2">limbic system-- just buzzing it&#39;s on</p>

<p begin="00:09:45.470" end="00:09:51.589" style="s2">from before and it&#39;s where we plan for</p>

<p begin="00:09:51.589" end="00:09:54.980" style="s2">the past and worries about the future is</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.449" end="00:09:56.470" style="s2">that stuff we can&#39;t control but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.980" end="00:09:59.300" style="s2">gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.470" end="00:10:02.389" style="s2">but the prefrontal cortex is what</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.300" end="00:10:04.369" style="s2">understands things as observes us it</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.389" end="00:10:07.929" style="s2">observes the impressions on life and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.369" end="00:10:11.540" style="s2">makes decisions and it&#39;s gone quiet</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.929" end="00:10:14.360" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s happened when we use our</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.540" end="00:10:17.569" style="s2">breath we activate that prefrontal</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.360" end="00:10:20.870" style="s2">cortex and we can use our breath to fall</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.569" end="00:10:22.819" style="s2">into a very deep state of meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.870" end="00:10:25.220" style="s2">that&#39;s where we&#39;re gonna go in just a</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.819" end="00:10:27.410" style="s2">few minutes how many of you have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.220" end="00:10:28.790" style="s2">meditation practice trough hands how</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.410" end="00:10:30.249" style="s2">many have meditation practice how many</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.790" end="00:10:32.449" style="s2">meditate every day</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.249" end="00:10:34.189" style="s2">few of you how many of you tried</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.449" end="00:10:35.300" style="s2">meditation before and thought I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.189" end="00:10:38.089" style="s2">really too sure if I&#39;m doing this right</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.300" end="00:10:40.790" style="s2">I think I just wasted 20 minutes yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.089" end="00:10:42.350" style="s2">hurts to sit like that on the floor yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.790" end="00:10:43.910" style="s2">a lot of people are like that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.350" end="00:10:46.129" style="s2">know if you&#39;re meditating when we do</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.910" end="00:10:48.410" style="s2">breath work we know that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.129" end="00:10:50.059" style="s2">meditating and breath work isn&#39;t new I</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.410" end="00:10:52.100" style="s2">don&#39;t know if the stoic specifically did</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.059" end="00:10:53.629" style="s2">breath work but I do know that shamanic</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.100" end="00:10:55.009" style="s2">breath work is practiced in every single</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.629" end="00:10:57.740" style="s2">culture around the world since the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.009" end="00:11:00.110" style="s2">beginning of humans every culture has</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.740" end="00:11:03.889" style="s2">breath work so I&#39;m assuming the Stoics</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.110" end="00:11:06.019" style="s2">did too but I don&#39;t know for sure when</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.889" end="00:11:07.639" style="s2">we do breath work when we just sit and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.019" end="00:11:10.069" style="s2">we did this right before lunch we just</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.639" end="00:11:13.549" style="s2">sat with our breath you close your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.069" end="00:11:15.350" style="s2">and you observe your breath right away</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.549" end="00:11:18.079" style="s2">when you just sit quietly and observe</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.350" end="00:11:21.589" style="s2">your breath a part of your brain called</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.079" end="00:11:23.569" style="s2">the anterior cingulate it&#39;s part of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.589" end="00:11:26.389" style="s2">prefrontal cortex and wires back into</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.569" end="00:11:27.829" style="s2">the limbic system so your prefrontal</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.389" end="00:11:28.279" style="s2">cortex is just looking back and saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.829" end="00:11:30.410" style="s2">hey what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.279" end="00:11:33.110" style="s2">I&#39;m back there just talking on the door</p>

<p begin="00:11:33.110" end="00:11:38.660" style="s2">and stressed and worried and scared and</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.449" end="00:11:42.560" style="s2">upset okay I can see that now I can see</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.660" end="00:11:45.110" style="s2">you feel that way just paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.560" end="00:11:47.569" style="s2">to your breath just observing it does</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.110" end="00:11:50.499" style="s2">that it allows us to see our emotional</p>

<p begin="00:11:56.300" end="00:12:03.410" style="s2">different part of our brain wakes up I</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.879" end="00:12:06.139" style="s2">have to look it up the camera in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.410" end="00:12:08.870" style="s2">name of it the caudal medial part of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.139" end="00:12:10.970" style="s2">frontal cortex wakes up on that part of</p>
