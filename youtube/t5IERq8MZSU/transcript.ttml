<p begin="00:03:39.770" end="00:03:42.710" style="s2">well I could definitely do with him</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.090" end="00:03:43.940" style="s2">explaining the system itself because I</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.710" end="00:03:45.650" style="s2">don&#39;t really understand it I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.940" end="00:03:47.600" style="s2">absolutely understand the philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.650" end="00:03:51.140" style="s2">behind it but the mechanics I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.600" end="00:03:52.430" style="s2">really understand so much the same I</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.140" end="00:03:55.660" style="s2">love the idea of improving education</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.430" end="00:03:58.820" style="s2">very interested to here&#39;s approach hmm</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.660" end="00:04:01.190" style="s2">no I was I have all the questions about</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.820" end="00:04:03.460" style="s2">the cryptocurrency like wait how do you</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.190" end="00:04:07.550" style="s2">I just had generate in and how is it</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.460" end="00:04:08.840" style="s2">allocated I miss the part of or even</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.550" end="00:04:12.290" style="s2">those things that have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.840" end="00:04:14.060" style="s2">education I mean I haven&#39;t read yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.290" end="00:04:19.730" style="s2">I&#39;ve read the word narcho I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.060" end="00:04:22.580" style="s2">document at all but does it just my</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.730" end="00:04:25.310" style="s2">understanding before he gets here other</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.580" end="00:04:27.530" style="s2">than other than you know sitting exams</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.310" end="00:04:28.760" style="s2">and and and so you know going jumping</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.530" end="00:04:30.710" style="s2">through the traditional groups it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.760" end="00:04:34.490" style="s2">another way of generating credit</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.710" end="00:04:36.440" style="s2">you know a credit of attainment for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.490" end="00:04:38.330" style="s2">student and for the and for and for</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.440" end="00:04:39.860" style="s2">teachers as well it can go both ways as</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.330" end="00:04:41.860" style="s2">I said I don&#39;t fully understand it but</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.860" end="00:04:44.210" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the notion behind it I</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.860" end="00:04:47.509" style="s2">mean it seems to me a necessary first</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.210" end="00:04:50.240" style="s2">step not wanting to use this as a forum</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.509" end="00:04:51.440" style="s2">for my own for my own projects or</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.240" end="00:04:54.440" style="s2">anything but I mean it sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.440" end="00:04:56.090" style="s2">really great first step would be to get</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.440" end="00:04:57.740" style="s2">rid of standardized testing I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.090" end="00:04:59.750" style="s2">just get rid of it first of all you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.740" end="00:05:07.340" style="s2">what I mean and prepare the ground for a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.750" end="00:05:09.620" style="s2">brand new structure yeah maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.340" end="00:05:10.729" style="s2">kind of just discuss things in the same</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.620" end="00:05:11.960" style="s2">area until he comes back</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.729" end="00:05:13.789" style="s2">I don&#39;t know Jubilee are you able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.960" end="00:05:16.490" style="s2">chat with him somewhere else oh yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.789" end="00:05:18.979" style="s2">just send him a message ask if he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.490" end="00:05:21.830" style="s2">coming back but it&#39;s not green you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.979" end="00:05:23.840" style="s2">even there&#39;s a choice online he may have</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.830" end="00:05:26.900" style="s2">lost his internet connection</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.840" end="00:05:30.849" style="s2">yeah but Erica that would be an</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.900" end="00:05:34.820" style="s2">interesting discussion I agree that</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.849" end="00:05:36.710" style="s2">standardized testing has its challenges</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.820" end="00:05:38.930" style="s2">and it seems to have had a negative</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.710" end="00:05:40.849" style="s2">effect over the last decade since we</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.930" end="00:05:45.020" style="s2">implemented it in the States very</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.849" end="00:05:51.470" style="s2">strongly but I am not aware of any</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.020" end="00:05:54.080" style="s2">alternatives that also have the that</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.470" end="00:05:56.330" style="s2">solved the problems that it did to some</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.080" end="00:06:02.389" style="s2">extent solve what was that be an</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.330" end="00:06:05.270" style="s2">interesting conversation so so so one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.389" end="00:06:09.800" style="s2">the problems was an inconsistency in</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.270" end="00:06:13.610" style="s2">education so that level caught a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.800" end="00:06:17.509" style="s2">people were being not educated so we</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.610" end="00:06:19.639" style="s2">still have that problem they did it</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.509" end="00:06:21.320" style="s2">because some people are just passing</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.639" end="00:06:25.190" style="s2">kids on the tests and cheating and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.320" end="00:06:27.349" style="s2">but there was a big problem where easier</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.190" end="00:06:28.880" style="s2">and they changed the great boundaries</p>

<p begin="00:06:32.210" end="00:06:36.620" style="s2">nonsense well yes but that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.699" end="00:06:38.449" style="s2">implementation that doesn&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.620" end="00:06:42.219" style="s2">standardized testing is bad that says</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.449" end="00:06:44.540" style="s2">that proves the implementation is bad so</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.219" end="00:06:45.830" style="s2">it still might</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.540" end="00:06:48.890" style="s2">it&#39;s there still might be a better</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.830" end="00:06:51.770" style="s2">solution but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think just</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.890" end="00:06:52.760" style="s2">taking it away is that may be better</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.770" end="00:06:54.980" style="s2">than where we&#39;re at as the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.760" end="00:06:56.620" style="s2">implementation was so bad but rather</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.980" end="00:06:59.000" style="s2">than doing a fairly decent</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.620" end="00:07:01.130" style="s2">implementation of it would still might</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.000" end="00:07:04.430" style="s2">be better than the status quo before we</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.130" end="00:07:05.750" style="s2">started doing it and what what about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.430" end="00:07:08.390" style="s2">problems that it creates that I outlined</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.750" end="00:07:11.780" style="s2">do you see those as being either saved</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.390" end="00:07:15.080" style="s2">in the frame or not in particular</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.780" end="00:07:17.210" style="s2">problems I didn&#39;t dig into your post I</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.080" end="00:07:20.120" style="s2">wanted to we didn&#39;t find the priority so</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.210" end="00:07:35.980" style="s2">if you want to state those we can keep</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.120" end="00:07:35.980" style="s2">discussing another topic I&#39;ll do my best</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.650" end="00:07:53.240" style="s2">talking about the future yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.750" end="00:07:57.260" style="s2">and then you disappeared yeah and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.240" end="00:07:58.990" style="s2">can still see me now yes what the hell</p>

<p begin="00:08:04.310" end="00:08:09.500" style="s2">for two minutes we&#39;re not very direct</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.280" end="00:08:13.130" style="s2">all the timing so okay oh you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.500" end="00:08:13.730" style="s2">okay okay good so I&#39;ll just let&#39;s sorry</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.130" end="00:08:17.450" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.730" end="00:08:20.390" style="s2">okay I&#39;m back so a true digital native</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.450" end="00:08:21.770" style="s2">my set is a return to humanity right we</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.390" end="00:08:23.960" style="s2">were robotic and industrial age in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.770" end="00:08:25.760" style="s2">digital age we have robots to do the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.960" end="00:08:27.860" style="s2">robotic paper-pushing number-crunching</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.760" end="00:08:29.270" style="s2">stuff so there&#39;s a return to our</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.860" end="00:08:30.980" style="s2">humanity digital aid it wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.270" end="00:08:32.210" style="s2">somebody that&#39;s captured by digital</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.980" end="00:08:34.130" style="s2">devices giving their attention to</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.210" end="00:08:35.510" style="s2">somebody else the benefit it&#39;s somebody</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.130" end="00:08:37.970" style="s2">that knows how to manage their attention</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.510" end="00:08:39.680" style="s2">so we&#39;re mindfulness or work ethic using</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.970" end="00:08:42.229" style="s2">your attention to produce work so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.680" end="00:08:45.050" style="s2">whole basis of this system is quality</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.229" end="00:08:46.670" style="s2">student work work that is the digital</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.050" end="00:08:49.010" style="s2">that&#39;s how we build academic capital and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.670" end="00:08:50.480" style="s2">this whole the the event cycles that</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.010" end="00:08:52.160" style="s2">I&#39;ll talk about if we go into a little</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.480" end="00:08:53.600" style="s2">more detail about how it works are based</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.160" end="00:08:54.920" style="s2">out of a community coming together like</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.600" end="00:08:56.720" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do here in Harlem or we</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.920" end="00:08:57.430" style="s2">have been doing and got interrupted but</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.720" end="00:08:59.890" style="s2">we&#39;re going to restart</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.430" end="00:09:02.200" style="s2">and you produce high-quality academic</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.890" end="00:09:05.470" style="s2">content with that&#39;s for you know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.200" end="00:09:09.339" style="s2">kids produce it and you guide them I</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.470" end="00:09:11.950" style="s2">could talk about let me just skip right</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.339" end="00:09:13.570" style="s2">hold on I think you guys get most of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.950" end="00:09:15.339" style="s2">context of that kind of that coercive</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.570" end="00:09:17.200" style="s2">top-down educational model was good for</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.339" end="00:09:21.720" style="s2">industrial education it just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.200" end="00:09:25.540" style="s2">work anymore for us in a digital age and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.720" end="00:09:26.950" style="s2">so where we are now in life is unit uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.540" end="00:09:29.800" style="s2">but and and just all if you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.950" end="00:09:31.930" style="s2">mind at least initially focusing on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.800" end="00:09:33.730" style="s2">mechanics of the system itself how that</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.930" end="00:09:35.550" style="s2">functions yeah that would that would be</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.730" end="00:09:40.930" style="s2">I think really that&#39;s all of us yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.550" end="00:09:41.470" style="s2">yeah okay okay so beautiful that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.930" end="00:09:45.040" style="s2">I figured</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.470" end="00:09:46.750" style="s2">um I already I&#39;m in a weird twilight</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.040" end="00:09:47.800" style="s2">zone sir and he said all this stuff two</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.750" end="00:09:49.570" style="s2">seconds ago and as to remember that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.800" end="00:09:50.920" style="s2">guys been hearing it the ask should I</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.570" end="00:09:53.230" style="s2">talk about that because you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.920" end="00:09:55.779" style="s2">about getting into detail I think it</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.230" end="00:09:57.459" style="s2">helps us to if we know that ask as you</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.779" end="00:09:59.350" style="s2">go right through the detail that helps</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.459" end="00:10:00.459" style="s2">us put it in context exactly let me just</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.350" end="00:10:01.779" style="s2">say the ask and then I&#39;ll jump into</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.459" end="00:10:04.450" style="s2">detail about how it&#39;s built beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.779" end="00:10:06.490" style="s2">thank you so we have a non-profit that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.450" end="00:10:09.339" style="s2">got like 30 grand that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.490" end="00:10:10.450" style="s2">revived so you know I could probably go</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.339" end="00:10:11.250" style="s2">three board members but if people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.450" end="00:10:16.480" style="s2">interested</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.250" end="00:10:19.720" style="s2">my alarm sorry that&#39;s one piece is</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.480" end="00:10:21.610" style="s2">reviving that nonprofit and then host</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.720" end="00:10:23.440" style="s2">starting these cycles of events that</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.610" end="00:10:26.290" style="s2">I&#39;ll talk about I have a book coming out</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.440" end="00:10:28.450" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m Stage four of having a book</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.290" end="00:10:30.580" style="s2">kind of I have a final manuscript it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.450" end="00:10:32.830" style="s2">been edited by a great editor the cover</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.580" end="00:10:34.660" style="s2">design is almost done and it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.830" end="00:10:36.190" style="s2">last step to publish I just decided to</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.660" end="00:10:37.360" style="s2">not use the publisher that was you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.190" end="00:10:38.830" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna just do it myself</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.360" end="00:10:43.810" style="s2">baby knows about that I&#39;ve must feedback</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.830" end="00:10:45.910" style="s2">on that that&#39;s number two and then the I</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.810" end="00:10:47.320" style="s2">think the most important I should have</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.910" end="00:10:49.420" style="s2">put it first is this site for that</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.320" end="00:10:51.279" style="s2">nonprofit I wanted to be a funnel using</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.420" end="00:10:53.560" style="s2">the book to funnel people into our</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.279" end="00:10:55.300" style="s2">distribution list of updates to then</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.560" end="00:10:57.510" style="s2">have them show up at events here in</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.300" end="00:10:59.800" style="s2">Harlem first and then maybe other places</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.510" end="00:11:01.209" style="s2">so that&#39;s really where the core core of</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.800" end="00:11:04.510" style="s2">my work is people somebody knows how to</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.209" end="00:11:06.010" style="s2">build those funnels to get from interest</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.510" end="00:11:07.420" style="s2">in podcast so I go speak on podcasts to</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.010" end="00:11:08.740" style="s2">get interest to a site but then I</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.420" end="00:11:10.570" style="s2">collect email addresses and then I</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.740" end="00:11:15.130" style="s2">didn&#39;t get people at events</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.570" end="00:11:18.480" style="s2">um okay so how it works any questions</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.130" end="00:11:18.480" style="s2">before I say anything else about the ask</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.650" end="00:11:29.500" style="s2">great no yeah yay so we&#39;re gonna launch</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.090" end="00:11:31.000" style="s2">I&#39;m not principal of high school right</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.500" end="00:11:33.130" style="s2">now so we&#39;re just going to recreate what</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.000" end="00:11:36.820" style="s2">we had running there for ten to seven</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.130" end="00:11:37.720" style="s2">years I was there we had a $500,000</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.820" end="00:11:39.160" style="s2">recording studio and something that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.720" end="00:11:40.720" style="s2">don&#39;t have acts but I think it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.160" end="00:11:42.760" style="s2">to do it in this more distributed way</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.720" end="00:11:45.160" style="s2">actually you know when a distributed</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.760" end="00:11:46.150" style="s2">entity gets a decentralized and you gets</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.160" end="00:11:48.130" style="s2">attacked it just becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.150" end="00:11:50.140" style="s2">decentralized so I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.130" end="00:11:51.580" style="s2">attacks that I&#39;ve dealt with are</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.140" end="00:11:56.410" style="s2">actually just made this movement</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.580" end="00:11:58.660" style="s2">stronger um so the first event we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.410" end="00:11:59.920" style="s2">gonna 30k with whatever left after board</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.660" end="00:12:01.030" style="s2">insurance we&#39;re going to bring back all</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.920" end="00:12:02.830" style="s2">the kids that I&#39;ve worked with that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.030" end="00:12:04.930" style="s2">made these pieces with in the past who</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.830" end="00:12:06.580" style="s2">who inspired me to do this we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.930" end="00:12:09.220" style="s2">have an event for them only a private</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.580" end="00:12:12.340" style="s2">event for them introduce this concept to</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.220" end="00:12:13.630" style="s2">them and have some my staff that will be</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.340" end="00:12:16.540" style="s2">that they&#39;re already part of this to</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.630" end="00:12:19.000" style="s2">think about some early pieces that they</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.540" end="00:12:21.730" style="s2">could do and see who&#39;s available and</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.000" end="00:12:25.120" style="s2">who&#39;s interested and start developing</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.730" end="00:12:27.100" style="s2">educational capital there now the system</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.120" end="00:12:29.830" style="s2">I have it worked out from kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.100" end="00:12:31.120" style="s2">playing with things for so long but I</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.830" end="00:12:33.910" style="s2">think the way to design it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.120" end="00:12:35.560" style="s2">would be to build demand for technology</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.910" end="00:12:38.260" style="s2">instead of building technology to create</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.560" end="00:12:39.400" style="s2">imagine a demand so I just want to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.260" end="00:12:42.040" style="s2">these invention if we could have some</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.400" end="00:12:44.050" style="s2">engineers present listening they could</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.040" end="00:12:46.300" style="s2">pricy tools that would serve us to then</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.050" end="00:12:47.800" style="s2">be able to you know my wife sister is</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.300" end="00:12:49.210" style="s2">building the same thing in Japan and</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.800" end="00:12:51.280" style="s2">she&#39;s dying to have some shared</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.210" end="00:12:52.540" style="s2">resources there and there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.280" end="00:12:55.960" style="s2">movement in Japan to opt out of high</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.540" end="00:12:57.280" style="s2">school completely and so there are three</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.960" end="00:12:58.900" style="s2">so I&#39;m just gonna talk about kind of how</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.280" end="00:13:00.520" style="s2">it&#39;s built socially in these events and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.900" end="00:13:02.230" style="s2">I can get down I&#39;m a software engineer</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.520" end="00:13:03.610" style="s2">that&#39;s where I started my career now</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.230" end="00:13:05.040" style="s2">that&#39;s where my heart is so I can get</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.610" end="00:13:07.180" style="s2">more and more into detail as you guys</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.040" end="00:13:08.440" style="s2">ask but I really think the important</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.180" end="00:13:10.590" style="s2">thing now isn&#39;t to worry about detail</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.440" end="00:13:12.850" style="s2">let it arise naturally from our</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.590" end="00:13:14.530" style="s2">interactions doing these things if we</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.850" end="00:13:16.120" style="s2">have the right people in the room so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.530" end="00:13:18.190" style="s2">events there are three levels that</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.120" end="00:13:19.420" style="s2">remodel we&#39;re using and I should give</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.190" end="00:13:22.620" style="s2">credit to the guy the credits I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.420" end="00:13:23.980" style="s2">know his name off top my head but a lab</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.620" end="00:13:26.770" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.980" end="00:13:29.110" style="s2">is where we imagine projects for</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.770" end="00:13:30.670" style="s2">students in terms of how to guide them</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.110" end="00:13:32.050" style="s2">through so they can have be successful</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.670" end="00:13:34.540" style="s2">in producing high quality content not</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.050" end="00:13:36.100" style="s2">fail at that the studio where we work</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.540" end="00:13:37.720" style="s2">with students it&#39;s what we call Super</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.100" end="00:13:39.310" style="s2">Saturday in my school we all come</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.720" end="00:13:41.470" style="s2">together on a Saturday a few Saturdays</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.310" end="00:13:43.240" style="s2">in a row and work with the kids and see</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.470" end="00:13:44.770" style="s2">what work they&#39;ve done and get feedback</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.240" end="00:13:46.360" style="s2">right that&#39;s the studio and then the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.770" end="00:13:48.910" style="s2">salon where we share the kids work at</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.360" end="00:13:50.200" style="s2">the end and show the ones that earn the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.910" end="00:13:51.940" style="s2">credit that made it onto this blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.200" end="00:13:54.130" style="s2">but if we can keep the pieces high</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.940" end="00:13:55.960" style="s2">quality each pieces even if the website</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.130" end="00:13:57.840" style="s2">just has the pieces and it&#39;s got no</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.960" end="00:13:59.560" style="s2">technology behind it it&#39;ll start earning</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.840" end="00:14:01.900" style="s2">capital and will start building</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.560" end="00:14:03.130" style="s2">infrastructure too based on actual</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.900" end="00:14:04.930" style="s2">demand that people have a proper were</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.130" end="00:14:06.490" style="s2">going to break something and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.930" end="00:14:10.930" style="s2">going to need support that technology</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.490" end="00:14:12.220" style="s2">can help us with I&#39;ll pause there for a</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.930" end="00:14:14.380" style="s2">second medic we can start going more</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.220" end="00:14:16.450" style="s2">technical depending on where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.380" end="00:14:20.680" style="s2">interested I think I&#39;m still kind of at</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.450" end="00:14:22.350" style="s2">a loss on the overall concept so there</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.680" end="00:14:26.470" style="s2">may be some stuff that you spoke about</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.350" end="00:14:28.420" style="s2">but I mean you so you&#39;ve mentioned it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.470" end="00:14:31.840" style="s2">something instead of high school and</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.420" end="00:14:34.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve mentioned a building content is</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.840" end="00:14:36.340" style="s2">the content that they&#39;re building I mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.480" end="00:14:38.640" style="s2">is the learning experience the students</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.340" end="00:14:45.070" style="s2">building the content or other students</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.640" end="00:14:46.800" style="s2">expected to make use of the content the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.070" end="00:14:50.320" style="s2">students are generating the content and</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.800" end="00:14:53.550" style="s2">for credit and so what I&#39;m really doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.320" end="00:14:57.340" style="s2">is if Bitcoin is a ledger of accounts</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.550" end="00:15:00.100" style="s2">for for monetary value whatever you call</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.340" end="00:15:03.220" style="s2">that value this is a this is a ledger of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.100" end="00:15:05.560" style="s2">accounts of these credits of academics</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.220" end="00:15:07.810" style="s2">like if they&#39;re social capital academic</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.560" end="00:15:10.300" style="s2">capital right so they&#39;ll upload a piece</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.810" end="00:15:14.350" style="s2">of work and they get a credit I have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.300" end="00:15:16.570" style="s2">question as well so yeah if a young</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.350" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">person was to decide to enroll in your</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.570" end="00:15:22.840" style="s2">program right and and skip high school</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:25.210" style="s2">and you know engage in a series and to</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.840" end="00:15:26.560" style="s2">take a series of projects in exchange</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.210" end="00:15:27.940" style="s2">for credits and they do really really</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.560" end="00:15:29.620" style="s2">well they get all a bunch of credits</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.940" end="00:15:31.690" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.620" end="00:15:33.520" style="s2">those credits currently allow them to</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.690" end="00:15:35.890" style="s2">access any higher educational</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.520" end="00:15:37.270" style="s2">institutions are they recognized that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.890" end="00:15:41.529" style="s2">all by any other higher education</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.270" end="00:15:45.540" style="s2">institutions is there a process by which</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.529" end="00:15:47.140" style="s2">that is underway for that to happen we</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.540" end="00:15:51.610" style="s2">lost you again</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.140" end="00:15:59.260" style="s2">I think he&#39;s frozen in 20 seconds so</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.610" end="00:16:02.230" style="s2">probably or the final bit of my question</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.260" end="00:16:05.170" style="s2">was am i completely missed any notion my</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.230" end="00:16:06.580" style="s2">internet I think so yeah yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.170" end="00:16:10.750" style="s2">we&#39;re all seeing each other pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.580" end="00:16:13.900" style="s2">so you guys yeah I promise you you will</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.750" end="00:16:15.130" style="s2">get the notion when I&#39;m gonna move in</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.900" end="00:16:20.670" style="s2">the house and see if I make the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.130" end="00:16:23.680" style="s2">difference I will help answer and</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.670" end="00:16:26.560" style="s2">Bentley&#39;s question is how the</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.680" end="00:16:28.630" style="s2">cryptocurrency is generated so when they</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.560" end="00:16:30.430" style="s2">do a project it&#39;s as I understand it</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.630" end="00:16:33.550" style="s2">correct they create a credit so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.430" end="00:16:35.890" style="s2">how its generated but how is it right</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.550" end="00:16:37.209" style="s2">and that is also how its dispersed so if</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.890" end="00:16:42.520" style="s2">you&#39;re part of that project you get a</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.209" end="00:16:44.589" style="s2">credit but if there&#39;s 20 people working</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.520" end="00:16:48.279" style="s2">on a project to be at 120th of a credit</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.589" end="00:16:50.430" style="s2">or do they it&#39;s generating 20 credits in</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.279" end="00:16:57.070" style="s2">there then you don&#39;t not go to school</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.430" end="00:17:00.220" style="s2">this is the key exams right do you guys</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.070" end="00:17:05.829" style="s2">all know I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re all in</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.220" end="00:17:08.740" style="s2">the u.s. you all know what I do know NEP</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.829" end="00:17:11.189" style="s2">exams are but your connections we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.740" end="00:17:15.520" style="s2">in great volume like great sound quality</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.189" end="00:17:27.730" style="s2">yeah it seems like you&#39;re I think is</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.520" end="00:17:29.309" style="s2">worse okay so they are a teeny events</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.730" end="00:17:33.040" style="s2">placement classes</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.309" end="00:17:37.929" style="s2">yeah so I think his was more about I</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.040" end="00:17:39.550" style="s2">guess that instead so then I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.929" end="00:17:41.380" style="s2">I&#39;m answering for him because he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.550" end="00:17:43.270" style="s2">frozen because I did read the thing but</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.380" end="00:17:46.130" style="s2">I didn&#39;t quite understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.270" end="00:17:51.590" style="s2">it and also like you&#39;re generating</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.130" end="00:17:53.330" style="s2">education content but are you watching</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.590" end="00:17:57.110" style="s2">the education content is it being judged</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.330" end="00:17:58.820" style="s2">on how you learn from it which means</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.110" end="00:18:03.290" style="s2">we&#39;re introducing standardized tests</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.820" end="00:18:05.540" style="s2">again right of like if you do one on</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.290" end="00:18:07.340" style="s2">World War two and then people watch it I</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.540" end="00:18:09.380" style="s2">was able to retain that information is</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.340" end="00:18:12.410" style="s2">that what you&#39;re being judged on like is</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.380" end="00:18:14.840" style="s2">it just there only one World War two one</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.410" end="00:18:16.640" style="s2">or it would there be dozens and dozens</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.840" end="00:18:19.280" style="s2">of World War two ones if someone else</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.640" end="00:18:22.100" style="s2">wants to create one then so the part</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.280" end="00:18:25.040" style="s2">that&#39;s confusing me about it is even</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.100" end="00:18:26.990" style="s2">before that so you&#39;re it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.040" end="00:18:30.410" style="s2">you&#39;re getting credits for creating</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.990" end="00:18:35.540" style="s2">content not for viewing or using the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.410" end="00:18:39.220" style="s2">content in a day well then who what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.540" end="00:18:41.510" style="s2">the point of making the content if no I</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.220" end="00:18:45.640" style="s2">think the idea is people watch it cuz</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.510" end="00:18:45.640" style="s2">it&#39;s fun like it&#39;s educational and</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.730" end="00:18:49.490" style="s2">people and I can see that content</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.780" end="00:18:52.060" style="s2">creation is probably one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.490" end="00:18:55.700" style="s2">ways to learn something is by teaching</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.060" end="00:18:57.560" style="s2">but but the thing is eventually all the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.700" end="00:18:59.360" style="s2">you know thousands of people need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.560" end="00:19:01.220" style="s2">learn the same thing if their goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.360" end="00:19:04.040" style="s2">create teaching content no one&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.220" end="00:19:07.760" style="s2">to view that content which is fine but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.040" end="00:19:10.360" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t call it creating content if no</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.760" end="00:19:14.330" style="s2">one&#39;s gonna use it you know I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.360" end="00:19:19.100" style="s2">an exercise of constraints in general is</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.330" end="00:19:22.580" style="s2">like what are you incentivizing dabber</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.100" end="00:19:24.560" style="s2">we haven&#39;t are we doing that provider</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.580" end="00:19:31.040" style="s2">right now but is it my back I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.560" end="00:19:33.530" style="s2">I did see me here you know okay any</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.040" end="00:19:35.600" style="s2">questions for you with so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.530" end="00:19:37.850" style="s2">cryptocurrency that they that is created</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.600" end="00:19:40.670" style="s2">when people generate content and it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.850" end="00:19:43.280" style="s2">distributed based on the just that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.670" end="00:19:45.860" style="s2">created content so if you create a video</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.280" end="00:19:47.960" style="s2">that explains the history of World War</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.860" end="00:19:50.060" style="s2">two and there was 10 people working on</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.960" end="00:19:51.710" style="s2">that project and yes it gets a credit do</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.060" end="00:19:53.990" style="s2">they each get one tenth of a credit or</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.710" end="00:19:56.300" style="s2">do they not generates 10 because there</p>

<p begin="00:20:01.370" end="00:20:04.550" style="s2">so rare that I talk to people that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.570" end="00:20:08.000" style="s2">interested there so it&#39;s a basic income</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.550" end="00:20:11.570" style="s2">guarantee so they get a wallet that gets</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.000" end="00:20:13.580" style="s2">a disbursement monthly for a small</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.570" end="00:20:15.440" style="s2">number depending on what the inflation</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.580" end="00:20:18.500" style="s2">schedule for the monetary value is right</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.440" end="00:20:20.210" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;ll be easier or harder at</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.500" end="00:20:23.840" style="s2">different times and I we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.210" end="00:20:25.400" style="s2">that monetary policy level too but it</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.840" end="00:20:27.230" style="s2">would they would a few kids some kids</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.400" end="00:20:29.710" style="s2">and each geographic region would get a</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.230" end="00:20:33.500" style="s2">basic income guarantee for having</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.710" end="00:20:36.590" style="s2">created whatever you can create metrics</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.500" end="00:20:37.880" style="s2">incentivize right on they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.590" end="00:20:40.670" style="s2">demonstrated they can master their</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.880" end="00:20:45.590" style="s2">attention do quality work and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.670" end="00:20:47.480" style="s2">people actually watched right so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.590" end="00:20:49.070" style="s2">think that&#39;s where jubblies at asking</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.480" end="00:20:51.980" style="s2">the detailed lessons I&#39;m still stuck at</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.070" end="00:20:52.520" style="s2">the top level so regardless of how it</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.980" end="00:20:57.080" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.520" end="00:20:59.810" style="s2">the students create educational content</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.080" end="00:21:04.010" style="s2">they are compensated for that if it</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.810" end="00:21:06.530" style="s2">works well who&#39;s using that educational</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.010" end="00:21:17.000" style="s2">content and is the compensation based I</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.530" end="00:21:18.770" style="s2">mean yeah or is it metric like to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.000" end="00:21:20.690" style="s2">that is it based on entertainment value</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.770" end="00:21:24.590" style="s2">like YouTube what to watch the content</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.690" end="00:21:26.120" style="s2">is it retention on whether it&#39;s kids</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.590" end="00:21:27.890" style="s2">unique and there&#39;s not many people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.120" end="00:21:29.330" style="s2">created content in that area like what</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.890" end="00:21:31.070" style="s2">is the actual answer I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.330" end="00:21:33.200" style="s2">that&#39;s with Bentley&#39;s question if not</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.070" end="00:21:34.970" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry one final bit because the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.200" end="00:21:36.560" style="s2">question then becomes who becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.970" end="00:21:37.130" style="s2">arbiter of whether or not it&#39;s deserving</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.560" end="00:21:39.290" style="s2">of credit</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.130" end="00:21:41.660" style="s2">thank you yes I can that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.290" end="00:21:43.460" style="s2">right well I have a five page summary of</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.660" end="00:21:44.780" style="s2">a lot of this I shared and we after the</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.460" end="00:21:48.770" style="s2">second charity but let&#39;s try to get to</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.780" end="00:21:50.330" style="s2">it now so let me start so let me just</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.770" end="00:21:51.560" style="s2">try to remember bently the original and</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.330" end="00:21:54.800" style="s2">I think we can weave into those and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.560" end="00:21:57.710" style="s2">guys can guide me yeah maybe it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.800" end="00:22:00.710" style="s2">good let this get like a two-sentence</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.710" end="00:22:02.720" style="s2">description because I don&#39;t think I I</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.710" end="00:22:04.340" style="s2">don&#39;t think the core I think everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.720" end="00:22:08.630" style="s2">making assumptions on what the core is</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.340" end="00:22:10.130" style="s2">yeah what really helps I think what</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.630" end="00:22:12.320" style="s2">would and</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.130" end="00:22:14.090" style="s2">answer it kind of intellectually what</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.320" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">helps us to see it to see it in action</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.090" end="00:22:16.760" style="s2">to see it happening to see what was</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:18.260" style="s2">happening at the school for the past</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.760" end="00:22:19.340" style="s2">seven years and I have hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.260" end="00:22:21.350" style="s2">videos just to show you some of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.340" end="00:22:23.360" style="s2">content so you get a sense of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.350" end="00:22:25.429" style="s2">of quality content that can get produced</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.360" end="00:22:27.890" style="s2">in this context and the content that I</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.429" end="00:22:30.020" style="s2">have is mostly done at lunch after</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.890" end="00:22:32.900" style="s2">school like not for credit because but</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.020" end="00:22:34.400" style="s2">we did get it into the system itself and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.900" end="00:22:36.260" style="s2">this is part of the system this works</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.400" end="00:22:38.120" style="s2">like the IP inside the current system</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.260" end="00:22:39.770" style="s2">tops out some of some testing so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.120" end="00:22:42.710" style="s2">not not starting a new educational</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.770" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">system but I am taking the credit the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.710" end="00:22:47.270" style="s2">gold right now high school credits don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:48.169" style="s2">mean shit sorry but they write depending</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.270" end="00:22:49.370" style="s2">what school unless you went to that</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.169" end="00:22:50.510" style="s2">great school which means you went to</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.370" end="00:22:51.640" style="s2">that great elementary school which means</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.510" end="00:22:54.770" style="s2">you went to that great principal in</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.640" end="00:22:56.120" style="s2">preschool if you were at my school my</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.770" end="00:22:57.980" style="s2">transcript doesn&#39;t mean anything to</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.120" end="00:22:59.630" style="s2">college right they know I&#39;m a second</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.980" end="00:23:00.799" style="s2">chance school they&#39;re like those credits</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.630" end="00:23:02.600" style="s2">are meaningless so I&#39;m getting them</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.799" end="00:23:04.700" style="s2">access to high-quality gold standard</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.600" end="00:23:06.650" style="s2">credit that anybody the top level</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.700" end="00:23:07.610" style="s2">schools could get or anybody can get</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.650" end="00:23:08.570" style="s2">even if you dropped out of school you</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.610" end="00:23:10.220" style="s2">can get one of these credits but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.570" end="00:23:11.659" style="s2">equivalent in AP tests you still have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.220" end="00:23:14.120" style="s2">do high school equivalency the normal</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.659" end="00:23:16.789" style="s2">way but it&#39;s a way to start</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.120" end="00:23:18.830" style="s2">decentralizing who defines credits right</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.789" end="00:23:21.230" style="s2">now the politics are favoring adult</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.830" end="00:23:24.020" style="s2">interests not student interests so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.230" end="00:23:26.150" style="s2">and and at the core of it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.020" end="00:23:28.190" style="s2">replacing the standardized exam as the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.150" end="00:23:29.450" style="s2">unit of measurement and and we are</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.190" end="00:23:31.309" style="s2">creating unit of measurement that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.450" end="00:23:33.350" style="s2">very reductive right I&#39;m really reducing</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.309" end="00:23:34.880" style="s2">that one credit or zero credit and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.350" end="00:23:36.200" style="s2">then we get to that question of who gets</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.880" end="00:23:38.600" style="s2">to choose whether it&#39;s a credit or not</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.200" end="00:23:41.270" style="s2">right so the whole system is based on</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.600" end="00:23:42.620" style="s2">quality student works quality products</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.270" end="00:23:44.059" style="s2">that is where the capital that is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.620" end="00:23:45.620" style="s2">whole system so if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.059" end="00:23:48.080" style="s2">evaluate people to decide if they should</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.620" end="00:23:50.390" style="s2">be the ones eligible to determine these</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.080" end="00:23:52.400" style="s2">credits it&#39;s how many of these credits</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.390" end="00:23:55.130" style="s2">and they built themselves how many</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.400" end="00:23:56.659" style="s2">credits as a teacher working with</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.130" end="00:24:05.210" style="s2">students how many of your students put</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.659" end="00:24:09.159" style="s2">up credit they&#39;re losing audio again and</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.210" end="00:24:13.970" style="s2">I back so frustrating</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.159" end="00:24:15.230" style="s2">can you guys hear me again yeah feels</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.970" end="00:24:21.830" style="s2">choppy but we can hear you</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.230" end="00:24:24.220" style="s2">or maybe not Harlem why fine Harlem</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.830" end="00:24:24.220" style="s2">Internet</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.850" end="00:24:35.870" style="s2">but I think that goes to like a whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.350" end="00:24:38.150" style="s2">other these technology credits are</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.870" end="00:24:39.830" style="s2">accessible down the line having access</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.150" end="00:24:42.860" style="s2">to the cameras having access to better</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.830" end="00:24:45.350" style="s2">internet having access is going to make</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.860" end="00:24:47.630" style="s2">the process much easier in their words</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.350" end="00:24:50.660" style="s2">than it does in the ones that have less</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.630" end="00:24:53.450" style="s2">less capacity or if you are at home to</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.660" end="00:24:55.580" style="s2">do this yourself right I love like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.450" end="00:24:58.490" style="s2">so that&#39;s my favorite question to answer</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.580" end="00:25:00.110" style="s2">and I&#39;ve got so that I work I work with</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.490" end="00:25:01.640" style="s2">foster kids like this is my populations</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.110" end="00:25:05.330" style="s2">if I don&#39;t serve my population and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.640" end="00:25:07.070" style="s2">would be some sneaky bastard right the</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.330" end="00:25:08.720" style="s2">way those basic incomes are organized</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.070" end="00:25:10.160" style="s2">the contract the smart contract that</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.720" end="00:25:11.570" style="s2">runs those basic income awards how you</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.160" end="00:25:13.880" style="s2">determine who gets a basic income award</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.570" end="00:25:16.220" style="s2">it&#39;s through these geographic zip codes</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.880" end="00:25:18.950" style="s2">but digitally designed zip codes on that</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.220" end="00:25:22.040" style="s2">the app that generates to decide what</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.950" end="00:25:25.790" style="s2">area local area in and we use physical</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.040" end="00:25:28.190" style="s2">location as a proxy for race so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.790" end="00:25:30.500" style="s2">perfect but we then ensure that anybody</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.190" end="00:25:33.890" style="s2">from each local area earns the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.500" end="00:25:35.150" style="s2">number of credits right so that for one</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.890" end="00:25:37.400" style="s2">neighborhood to earn a credit the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.150" end="00:25:38.660" style="s2">local areas have to all earn a credit</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.400" end="00:25:40.730" style="s2">also so if you want to earn more credits</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.660" end="00:25:42.440" style="s2">in New York City you&#39;d have to help the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.730" end="00:25:43.670" style="s2">geographic area that&#39;s having the most</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.440" end="00:25:45.110" style="s2">trouble producing credits have them</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.670" end="00:25:48.350" style="s2">produce credits and that helps</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.110" end="00:25:50.890" style="s2">incentivize funds going to neighborhoods</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.350" end="00:25:54.620" style="s2">that have more you know resource issues</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.890" end="00:25:56.990" style="s2">so if I could get back to you said</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.620" end="00:25:58.730" style="s2">quality the students producing quality</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.990" end="00:26:02.210" style="s2">work when you say quality work are you</p>

<p begin="00:26:09.950" end="00:26:13.370" style="s2">creating training materials and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.900" end="00:26:16.190" style="s2">getting judged on that or are they</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.370" end="00:26:21.200" style="s2">training are they what are they doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.190" end="00:26:23.030" style="s2">what is the exam Majan NPR podcast you</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.200" end="00:26:24.470" style="s2">know like well produced you know there</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.030" end="00:26:26.240" style="s2">has research that has academic skills</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.470" end="00:26:27.350" style="s2">has research they come up with their own</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.240" end="00:26:27.950" style="s2">questions they&#39;re answering their own</p>

<p begin="00:26:27.950" end="00:26:31.280" style="s2">well we&#39;re focused I call their research</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.990" end="00:26:32.830" style="s2">skills their use of attention their</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.280" end="00:26:34.580" style="s2">mindfulness how do they deal with</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.830" end="00:26:36.120" style="s2">revisions and frustration tolerance</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.580" end="00:26:38.460" style="s2">right we&#39;re dealing with the skills not</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.120" end="00:26:39.720" style="s2">Cerie to produce quality work and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.460" end="00:26:41.340" style="s2">mindfulness has to be the first standard</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.720" end="00:26:43.380" style="s2">right if we&#39;re talking about our human</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.340" end="00:26:46.200" style="s2">attention so there&#39;s a lot packed into</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.380" end="00:26:47.640" style="s2">it but it&#39;s they&#39;re creating no they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.200" end="00:26:49.800" style="s2">creating content that is being judged</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.640" end="00:26:51.930" style="s2">for the quality of their fact-checking</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.800" end="00:26:53.490" style="s2">for sure right and for their research</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.930" end="00:26:55.110" style="s2">and for the work that they did there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.490" end="00:26:56.550" style="s2">three levels when I teach my teachers</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.110" end="00:26:58.410" style="s2">how to teach we talked about three</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.550" end="00:27:00.090" style="s2">levels the basic level you have</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.410" end="00:27:02.010" style="s2">flashcard you have tests you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.090" end="00:27:03.120" style="s2">that content level right and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.010" end="00:27:04.230" style="s2">there&#39;s an application level where you</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.120" end="00:27:06.390" style="s2">start thinking about what you just</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.230" end="00:27:08.190" style="s2">digested and asking your own questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.390" end="00:27:09.750" style="s2">and you know discussing it and finding</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.190" end="00:27:12.030" style="s2">your position and then you create</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.750" end="00:27:14.310" style="s2">something look I&#39;m these credits only</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.030" end="00:27:15.660" style="s2">capture that third extension level not</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.310" end="00:27:17.040" style="s2">what the high schools do they capture</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.660" end="00:27:20.190" style="s2">that next level that we did it laundry</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.040" end="00:27:23.010" style="s2">after school mostly okay ap level I</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.190" end="00:27:25.290" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you mean by okay so let</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.010" end="00:27:28.890" style="s2">me let me see if I&#39;m understanding they</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.290" end="00:27:31.050" style="s2">produce content not edge not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.890" end="00:27:33.600" style="s2">educational content so they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.050" end="00:27:37.500" style="s2">they have a question they research and</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.600" end="00:27:41.160" style="s2">then they produce some sort of content</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.500" end="00:27:43.080" style="s2">that then other people could read or</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.160" end="00:27:48.300" style="s2">benefit from right it could be video</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.080" end="00:27:51.120" style="s2">written or whatever and then is this</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.300" end="00:27:55.770" style="s2">process funded off of that content</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.120" end="00:27:58.800" style="s2">creation or is that separate great is</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.770" end="00:27:59.790" style="s2">the process funded let me make sure I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.800" end="00:28:04.650" style="s2">answering the right question what do you</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.790" end="00:28:06.570" style="s2">mean explain what well where does money</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.650" end="00:28:08.130" style="s2">come into it yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.570" end="00:28:09.990" style="s2">you talk about giving these credits and</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.130" end="00:28:13.590" style="s2">I guess the credits aren&#39;t actual money</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.990" end="00:28:15.180" style="s2">but right right so I think that when</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.590" end="00:28:16.560" style="s2">we&#39;re doing an analogue right now with</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.180" end="00:28:18.150" style="s2">these event cycles that I&#39;m planning out</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.560" end="00:28:20.100" style="s2">we&#39;re simulating and so I&#39;m using cash</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.150" end="00:28:24.390" style="s2">that we have already we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.100" end="00:28:26.130" style="s2">raised but if we start building block</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.390" end="00:28:27.930" style="s2">chains decentralized we start building</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.130" end="00:28:32.160" style="s2">way from my my wife sister to start this</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.930" end="00:28:33.540" style="s2">in Osaka we&#39;d be giving people funding</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.160" end="00:28:35.190" style="s2">Internet money right that means nothing</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.540" end="00:28:36.210" style="s2">and they would be getting this basic</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.190" end="00:28:39.420" style="s2">income every month and building these</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.210" end="00:28:40.320" style="s2">useless coins but if it starts if</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.420" end="00:28:41.520" style="s2">they&#39;re started to be network effects</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.320" end="00:28:42.960" style="s2">enough people had these coins in their</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.520" end="00:28:44.400" style="s2">hands they might all start advocating to</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.960" end="00:28:46.200" style="s2">trade these coins and if we set them up</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.400" end="00:28:48.300" style="s2">as a side chain of Bitcoin so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.200" end="00:28:49.440" style="s2">clear conversion that people don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.300" end="00:28:49.890" style="s2">to figure that piece out it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.440" end="00:28:51.720" style="s2">figured</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.890" end="00:28:53.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a chance one day they get traded</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.720" end="00:28:55.770" style="s2">for something and then we&#39;re interfacing</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.940" end="00:28:58.710" style="s2">from academic capital which is my focus</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.770" end="00:28:59.940" style="s2">to so people would be putting in their</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.710" end="00:29:04.020" style="s2">sweat equity and the teachers the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.940" end="00:29:06.179" style="s2">students all - you know - one day maybe</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.020" end="00:29:08.549" style="s2">have these coins need something that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.179" end="00:29:09.570" style="s2">master teachers the gatekeepers are an</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.549" end="00:29:11.040" style="s2">important role that we haven&#39;t talked</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.570" end="00:29:13.770" style="s2">about but its gatekeepers are people</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.040" end="00:29:16.200" style="s2">that have reliably for a number of years</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.770" end="00:29:19.260" style="s2">helped kids produce content that was of</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.200" end="00:29:22.380" style="s2">quality to the right so it&#39;s recursive</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.260" end="00:29:23.669" style="s2">and so then they become the gatekeepers</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.380" end="00:29:25.710" style="s2">and they get money for there&#39;s a way for</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.669" end="00:29:28.830" style="s2">them to get income from that they got be</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.710" end="00:29:31.020" style="s2">funny money coins - right and so yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.830" end="00:29:33.960" style="s2">it sounds like the main project is</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.020" end="00:29:37.350" style="s2">giving students ap credit for practicing</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.960" end="00:29:38.880" style="s2">and learning journalism right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.350" end="00:29:41.820" style="s2">that&#39;s a way to say it from the game</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.880" end="00:29:44.309" style="s2">from the you know industrial context</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.820" end="00:29:46.230" style="s2">that&#39;s a good perspective oh yes well I</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.309" end="00:29:47.610" style="s2">don&#39;t see that that is industrial at all</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.230" end="00:29:51.299" style="s2">I mean that could be just as much game</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.610" end="00:29:54.390" style="s2">be yeah it&#39;s journalism is just</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.299" end="00:29:56.549" style="s2">investigation and and putting things out</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.390" end="00:29:59.610" style="s2">that&#39;s for the social studies credits</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.549" end="00:30:01.020" style="s2">but like a scientist credit right we we</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.610" end="00:30:02.250" style="s2">have talked about more it&#39;s gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.020" end="00:30:04.020" style="s2">to be more like software engineering</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.250" end="00:30:05.190" style="s2">code writing code I think there&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.020" end="00:30:07.470" style="s2">way to access to say muscle in your</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.190" end="00:30:08.850" style="s2">brain that&#39;s mathy and so it could be</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.470" end="00:30:10.470" style="s2">tutorial videos that nobody ever watches</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.850" end="00:30:12.390" style="s2">unless the fuse kids really do a great</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.470" end="00:30:14.460" style="s2">job explaining so we you know they you</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.390" end="00:30:18.720" style="s2">have to deal with math separately so the</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.460" end="00:30:20.400" style="s2">NPR example is just one type well money</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.720" end="00:30:22.470" style="s2">kind of money does a lot of things that</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.400" end="00:30:23.910" style="s2">I think requires some understanding just</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.470" end="00:30:28.200" style="s2">understand the content you have to spend</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.910" end="00:30:32.010" style="s2">some economic you know it was required</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.200" end="00:30:33.750" style="s2">output always some sort of media so the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.010" end="00:30:36.570" style="s2">tells me that can be uploaded right but</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.750" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">it could be PDF all right it could be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.570" end="00:30:42.480" style="s2">pazzo media or digital file it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.320" end="00:30:50.850" style="s2">digital file right yeah all right so it</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.480" end="00:30:52.679" style="s2">never involves I don&#39;t know okay so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.850" end="00:30:54.570" style="s2">so it doesn&#39;t fall into what we call</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.679" end="00:30:56.130" style="s2">journalism but I would still I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.570" end="00:30:59.550" style="s2">generally call it that&#39;s a good way to</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.130" end="00:31:01.200" style="s2">say it yeah I&#39;d like that we had okay if</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.550" end="00:31:02.790" style="s2">we have kids who have been known to lead</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.200" end="00:31:03.419" style="s2">all the social movements are successful</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.790" end="00:31:05.999" style="s2">arty</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.419" end="00:31:09.269" style="s2">18 to 21 now 18 to 25 who I work with</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.999" end="00:31:11.849" style="s2">and if they get academics they get</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.269" end="00:31:13.769" style="s2">credit for this on an academic network I</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.849" end="00:31:15.149" style="s2">think that yeah I think it&#39;s exciting if</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.769" end="00:31:16.649" style="s2">they fill the gap that&#39;s right now in</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.149" end="00:31:18.239" style="s2">our media landscape of deep</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.649" end="00:31:19.829" style="s2">investigative stuff and their teachers</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.239" end="00:31:21.809" style="s2">are fact-checking so now we have actual</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.829" end="00:31:24.589" style="s2">you know meaningful fact-checking I</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.809" end="00:31:28.049" style="s2">think that&#39;s exciting</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.589" end="00:31:30.869" style="s2">yeah I think a generation I mean our</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.049" end="00:31:32.519" style="s2">generation is kind of screwed like the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.869" end="00:31:36.269" style="s2">generation coming up being able to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.519" end="00:31:38.489" style="s2">actual wow I can&#39;t even think of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.269" end="00:31:41.099" style="s2">words to look critically at what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.489" end="00:31:43.200" style="s2">happening to be able to connect each</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.099" end="00:31:46.739" style="s2">other&#39;s and how that critical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.200" end="00:31:49.349" style="s2">is huge that&#39;s it and even if we mess</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.739" end="00:31:51.719" style="s2">this up and do a crap job of it that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.349" end="00:31:55.129" style="s2">measuring quality student work is still</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.719" end="00:31:55.129" style="s2">doing better than a standardized test</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.279" end="00:31:59.999" style="s2">and yeah when you said call it okay when</p>

<p begin="00:32:05.820" end="00:32:08.909" style="s2">right that they would be getting this</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.469" end="00:32:12.419" style="s2">funny money to that if it had value</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.909" end="00:32:13.919" style="s2">would be you know and they are people</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.419" end="00:32:15.509" style="s2">who have I think it should be ten years</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.919" end="00:32:16.709" style="s2">look we have to start doing this and see</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.509" end="00:32:19.049" style="s2">what it feels like but I think it should</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.709" end="00:32:20.759" style="s2">be people that have a rate of acceptance</p>

<p begin="00:32:27.539" end="00:32:30.299" style="s2">success so you&#39;ve kind of normalized</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.099" end="00:32:32.099" style="s2">your practice with the existing</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.299" end="00:32:34.079" style="s2">gatekeepers for a number of years so</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.099" end="00:32:35.669" style="s2">you&#39;ve invested many years of your work</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.079" end="00:32:38.190" style="s2">but my teachers did this in their</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.669" end="00:32:39.839" style="s2">classrooms as part as their practice you</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.190" end="00:32:41.009" style="s2">know the ones that adopted it just did</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.839" end="00:32:42.539" style="s2">it as part of it so they didn&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.009" end="00:32:43.589" style="s2">separately from school it was and it</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.539" end="00:32:45.119" style="s2">helped their classrooms be more</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.589" end="00:32:46.739" style="s2">interesting to social my social studies</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.119" end="00:32:49.499" style="s2">teachers making movies is much more fun</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.739" end="00:32:50.820" style="s2">than the crap they used to do going on</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.499" end="00:32:52.440" style="s2">the street interviewing people like Vox</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.820" end="00:32:54.169" style="s2">Pop was much more fun of a lesson than</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.440" end="00:32:56.399" style="s2">listening to the teacher lecture so</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.169" end="00:32:57.749" style="s2">write this stuff once we make it</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.399" end="00:32:58.889" style="s2">available I can&#39;t imagine what the</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.749" end="00:33:00.509" style="s2">community&#39;s going to do with it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.889" end="00:33:02.519" style="s2">gonna the important thing is to build it</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.509" end="00:33:04.859" style="s2">in a way that itself improves so my</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.519" end="00:33:05.969" style="s2">stupid ideas disappear very quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.859" end="00:33:07.320" style="s2">you know we forget that they ever</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.969" end="00:33:09.479" style="s2">existed it&#39;s something much better can</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.320" end="00:33:12.089" style="s2">show up and that&#39;s why we have to like a</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.479" end="00:33:13.889" style="s2">you know open source version of that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.089" end="00:33:15.779" style="s2">our demand of doing this in reality</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.889" end="00:33:17.190" style="s2">builds the technology rather than trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.779" end="00:33:19.590" style="s2">to build a tool first</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.190" end="00:33:22.680" style="s2">and so built into the system even if the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.590" end="00:33:25.290" style="s2">cryptocurrency breaks it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.680" end="00:33:26.790" style="s2">incentivizing the wrong thing built into</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.290" end="00:33:28.110" style="s2">the system is a way to correct that</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.790" end="00:33:31.650" style="s2">because then people can do investigative</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.110" end="00:33:33.900" style="s2">journalism on that and can figure out a</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.650" end="00:33:35.280" style="s2">way to maybe not have the cryptic wait I</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.900" end="00:33:41.100" style="s2">couldn&#39;t hear any of what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.280" end="00:33:44.630" style="s2">my know if it&#39;s constant oh wait no that</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.100" end="00:33:48.060" style="s2">was Bentley who dropped out that having</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.630" end="00:33:49.830" style="s2">the incentivization of any currency is</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.060" end="00:33:53.880" style="s2">always going to be game of fat like it</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.830" end="00:33:55.740" style="s2">can be problematic and so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.880" end="00:33:57.960" style="s2">introducing an incentive and then seeing</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.740" end="00:34:00.030" style="s2">what happens but in this case because</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.960" end="00:34:02.250" style="s2">people can see what happens they can do</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.030" end="00:34:05.540" style="s2">investigative journalism on it itself</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.250" end="00:34:09.210" style="s2">and improve the system I hope so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.540" end="00:34:11.640" style="s2">yeah I love that cool so I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.210" end="00:34:13.200" style="s2">get back to your actual aspirations I</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.640" end="00:34:15.480" style="s2">don&#39;t know how well we can do any of</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.200" end="00:34:18.180" style="s2">these but that you want to revive the</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.480" end="00:34:19.020" style="s2">nonprofit so I don&#39;t know exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.180" end="00:34:21.600" style="s2">that entails</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.020" end="00:34:24.330" style="s2">but yeah you didn&#39;t board of directors</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.600" end="00:34:25.920" style="s2">and to do to do that I mean we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.330" end="00:34:27.900" style="s2">that but we can maybe help you bring a</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.920" end="00:34:29.970" style="s2">stronger find them and how to do that or</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.900" end="00:34:32.130" style="s2">you also said self glitching your book</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.970" end="00:34:34.890" style="s2">and then the site the website for events</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.130" end="00:34:36.420" style="s2">which to me you said it was the number</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.890" end="00:34:38.430" style="s2">one you won and I think that actually is</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.420" end="00:34:41.340" style="s2">what we could we could help with as far</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.430" end="00:34:46.470" style="s2">as not necessarily creating the website</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.340" end="00:34:47.730" style="s2">but I know that um like this is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.470" end="00:34:51.180" style="s2">thing that you&#39;re doing right like</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.730" end="00:34:52.860" style="s2">digital uploads are the thing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.180" end="00:34:54.780" style="s2">giving currency to so having somebody</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.860" end="00:34:57.800" style="s2">work on the website from within this</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.780" end="00:35:00.330" style="s2">community right having them brainstorm</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.800" end="00:35:01.890" style="s2">possibly what that looks like is it one</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.330" end="00:35:05.480" style="s2">person coding it and then putting it up</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.890" end="00:35:08.040" style="s2">and they get you know the currency or</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.480" end="00:35:09.780" style="s2">having a group of them brainstorm like</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.040" end="00:35:11.370" style="s2">to follow this process the lab right</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.780" end="00:35:13.710" style="s2">imagine what a website looks like</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.370" end="00:35:15.270" style="s2">then the studio of actually creating the</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.710" end="00:35:18.360" style="s2">website and then the salon of like</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.270" end="00:35:22.560" style="s2">launching the website so do you guys</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.360" end="00:35:23.760" style="s2">know Zack Stein it&#39;s a lab with me he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.560" end="00:35:26.760" style="s2">the one that I&#39;m doing the lab part with</p>

<p begin="00:35:26.760" end="00:35:30.000" style="s2">I love you you that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.560" end="00:35:30.780" style="s2">doing right we&#39;re using this model for</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.000" end="00:35:32.070" style="s2">ourselves and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.780" end="00:35:33.930" style="s2">one of us stands in the student role one</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.070" end="00:35:35.370" style="s2">of them stands in the feature we call</p>

<p begin="00:35:35.370" end="00:35:39.900" style="s2">gatekeeper we&#39;d actually been using this</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.630" end="00:35:41.700" style="s2">model to generate the content yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.900" end="00:35:46.560" style="s2">yeah I you you get it exactly you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.700" end="00:35:47.670" style="s2">you&#39;re way ahead of me so the site and</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.560" end="00:35:49.110" style="s2">it couldn&#39;t be something as simple as</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.670" end="00:35:51.960" style="s2">helping me get on podcast once the book</p>

<p begin="00:35:53.280" end="00:35:56.670" style="s2">for the site I have an idea I have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.420" end="00:35:58.080" style="s2">pretty good idea of but some some of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.670" end="00:36:00.690" style="s2">understand funnels is the piece that I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:36:26.400" end="00:36:30.990" style="s2">setting up that funnel I think is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.740" end="00:36:32.850" style="s2">most urgent for me because I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.990" end="00:36:34.500" style="s2">able to send people to a property</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.850" end="00:36:36.900" style="s2">internet property that they can then</p>

<p begin="00:36:40.950" end="00:36:45.060" style="s2">here on is upload about content but</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.780" end="00:36:47.850" style="s2">there are so many supporting roles that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.060" end="00:36:51.710" style="s2">aren&#39;t upload about content like hey who</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.850" end="00:36:54.060" style="s2">is the idea people who can think of what</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.710" end="00:36:56.070" style="s2">what this website could look like right</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.060" end="00:36:57.930" style="s2">cuz because if you have your idea and</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.070" end="00:37:00.840" style="s2">then you have to hire someone whether</p>

<p begin="00:37:07.500" end="00:37:12.780" style="s2">empowered to want to create it together</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.330" end="00:37:14.490" style="s2">right and it&#39;s it&#39;s own thing which is</p>

<p begin="00:37:56.150" end="00:38:01.280" style="s2">University had a blockchain conference</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.510" end="00:38:02.720" style="s2">there and I met the administration and</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.280" end="00:38:05.630" style="s2">they&#39;re willing to accept them like AP</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.720" end="00:38:07.910" style="s2">credits and we can work with the mastery</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.630" end="00:38:09.980" style="s2">org folks they have a much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.910" end="00:38:11.900" style="s2">community of schools that accept their</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.980" end="00:38:13.010" style="s2">transcript which is exactly this work</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.900" end="00:38:14.870" style="s2">their way they&#39;re a little bit ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.010" end="00:38:18.410" style="s2">us so once this stuff comes out they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.870" end="00:38:19.820" style="s2">just going to be ahead of everybody this</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.410" end="00:38:21.740" style="s2">already exists elsewhere you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.820" end="00:38:31.160" style="s2">replicating an existing model basically</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.740" end="00:38:32.690" style="s2">yeah yeah model what are the limitations</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.160" end="00:38:34.340" style="s2">of that that it can&#39;t roll out or it</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.690" end="00:38:35.840" style="s2">could you&#39;re just filling a hole where</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.340" end="00:38:37.820" style="s2">it hasn&#39;t got to yet kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.840" end="00:38:39.140" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole story in there I was</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.820" end="00:38:40.490" style="s2">running a school we were doing this and</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.140" end="00:38:43.010" style="s2">I had no interest in going beyond my</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.490" end="00:38:45.020" style="s2">school and then I got taken out of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.010" end="00:38:47.720" style="s2">school and all of my staff kind of fired</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.020" end="00:38:49.040" style="s2">like we all got blown up so now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.720" end="00:38:51.200" style="s2">recreating that because we want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.040" end="00:38:52.460" style="s2">continue that work that work was our you</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.200" end="00:38:54.650" style="s2">know I moved in next door to the school</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.460" end="00:38:56.390" style="s2">for a reason and all of my staff like we</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.650" end="00:38:57.650" style="s2">we had something working together with</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.390" end="00:38:59.240" style="s2">these specific people like I have a team</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.650" end="00:39:01.250" style="s2">and we love working together so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.240" end="00:39:03.560" style="s2">just going to keep doing what we do</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.250" end="00:39:05.420" style="s2">yeah but that&#39;s what happened is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.560" end="00:39:10.730" style="s2">the department education and their</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.420" end="00:39:12.980" style="s2">wisdom terminated our program I just had</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.730" end="00:39:14.600" style="s2">a thought from before about using the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.980" end="00:39:16.910" style="s2">credits because the point is if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.600" end="00:39:19.640" style="s2">trainable then the currency becomes much</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.910" end="00:39:21.110" style="s2">more valid right like credits are not</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.640" end="00:39:22.790" style="s2">tradable the credits are like a high</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.110" end="00:39:24.470" style="s2">school transcripts right it&#39;s you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.790" end="00:39:25.910" style="s2">your credentials and your skill set and</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.470" end="00:39:27.500" style="s2">what it&#39;s all skills based so it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.910" end="00:39:29.570" style="s2">skills you&#39;ve mastered or had</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.500" end="00:39:31.130" style="s2">experiences with the currency that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.570" end="00:39:32.060" style="s2">earn the basic income with yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.130" end="00:39:34.190" style="s2">the currency that you can do whatever</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.060" end="00:39:35.660" style="s2">you want with if that&#39;s if you find ways</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.190" end="00:39:37.460" style="s2">to trade it right that&#39;s two different</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.660" end="00:39:39.800" style="s2">things the credits on the trend on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.460" end="00:39:41.210" style="s2">blockchain the the credit ledger of</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.800" end="00:39:43.640" style="s2">academic capital of your credits ones</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.210" end="00:39:45.080" style="s2">and zeroes is just your transcript right</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.640" end="00:39:46.670" style="s2">so you don&#39;t spend it you keep it</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.080" end="00:39:48.680" style="s2">because you know something about like</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.670" end="00:39:49.970" style="s2">getting hired and it could be a bonus or</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.680" end="00:39:51.230" style="s2">the university could</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.970" end="00:39:52.730" style="s2">give you a scholarship and it started</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.230" end="00:39:54.320" style="s2">but that&#39;s based on the currency part</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.730" end="00:39:56.750" style="s2">right so if you have this funny money</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.320" end="00:39:58.130" style="s2">and nobody trades on an exchange a smart</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.750" end="00:39:59.270" style="s2">employer if you watch these videos and</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.130" end="00:40:00.830" style="s2">say wow these are in high quality I</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.270" end="00:40:02.180" style="s2">would hire these people could say hey</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.830" end="00:40:04.130" style="s2">I&#39;ll trade that funny money and give you</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.180" end="00:40:05.330" style="s2">sign-on bonus with it and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.130" end="00:40:07.130" style="s2">stuck with this funny money and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.330" end="00:40:08.900" style="s2">there&#39;s more people fighting to make it</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.130" end="00:40:10.550" style="s2">real right because then the university</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.900" end="00:40:11.990" style="s2">or businesses that hold it would say hey</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.550" end="00:40:13.340" style="s2">we need to get rid of this and maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.990" end="00:40:15.500" style="s2">can get some money out of it so we just</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.340" end="00:40:17.270" style="s2">wanted to spread as much as possible in</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.500" end="00:40:19.099" style="s2">the community and that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.270" end="00:40:20.119" style="s2">now digital cash is being designed we</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.099" end="00:40:21.830" style="s2">haven&#39;t created that yet it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.119" end="00:40:24.710" style="s2">interesting times culturally to</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.830" end="00:40:27.650" style="s2">introduce education at the foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.710" end="00:40:30.440" style="s2">our digital cash economy right yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.650" end="00:40:32.150" style="s2">so I&#39;m confused what if any link is</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.440" end="00:40:35.390" style="s2">there then between these academic</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.150" end="00:40:38.750" style="s2">credits and the currency earning the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.390" end="00:40:43.790" style="s2">academic credits gives you a and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.750" end="00:40:44.810" style="s2">the the the contract or the the logic</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.790" end="00:40:45.920" style="s2">for doing it has to be totally</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.810" end="00:40:47.510" style="s2">transparent everybody knows how it works</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.920" end="00:40:49.040" style="s2">but there&#39;s some logic that certain</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.510" end="00:40:52.099" style="s2">people are in the basic income by</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.040" end="00:40:53.960" style="s2">earning these credits so most people</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.099" end="00:40:57.230" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be earning the money most</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.960" end="00:40:59.690" style="s2">people would just be the credit the</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.230" end="00:41:01.750" style="s2">smallest people if they were really</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.690" end="00:41:04.609" style="s2">smart then they would they would</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.750" end="00:41:07.640" style="s2">essentially a cash reward well being</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.609" end="00:41:09.560" style="s2">yeah like high-level contributors or</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.640" end="00:41:11.330" style="s2">whatever right with geography with it</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.560" end="00:41:12.980" style="s2">with an equalising across geographies so</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.330" end="00:41:14.570" style="s2">that one neighborhood can&#39;t be earning</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.980" end="00:41:18.650" style="s2">them without the other neighborhoods</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.570" end="00:41:25.609" style="s2">also earning them so it&#39;s like the top</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.650" end="00:41:27.020" style="s2">earners in that neighborhood of</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.609" end="00:41:28.400" style="s2">high-level contributors which there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.020" end="00:41:30.020" style="s2">likely to be right what if there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.400" end="00:41:31.640" style="s2">uneven distribute use distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.020" end="00:41:32.420" style="s2">high-level contributors across</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.640" end="00:41:33.680" style="s2">neighborhoods</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.420" end="00:41:39.920" style="s2">why are you flattening this thing I</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.680" end="00:41:41.930" style="s2">don&#39;t understand um for to even mix</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.920" end="00:41:44.150" style="s2">candy talked about you can be racist or</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.930" end="00:41:46.310" style="s2">anti racist you can&#39;t be agnostic here</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.150" end="00:41:48.290" style="s2">either intentionally trying to stop the</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.310" end="00:41:49.520" style="s2">system from and I think but know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.290" end="00:41:51.140" style="s2">a point to this I think it is digital</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.520" end="00:41:52.940" style="s2">economy to create a digital credit</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.140" end="00:41:54.830" style="s2">system for digital education that</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.940" end="00:41:56.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t include diversity it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.830" end="00:41:58.310" style="s2">our gene pool we want to mix our gene</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.240" end="00:41:59.810" style="s2">pool to be healthy we need diversity to</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.310" end="00:42:02.120" style="s2">educate our kids at least where I live</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.810" end="00:42:04.040" style="s2">if I may say so is doing the exact</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.120" end="00:42:06.890" style="s2">opposite of acknowledging diversity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.040" end="00:42:09.260" style="s2">it&#39;s stamping out the diversity that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.890" end="00:42:10.700" style="s2">diversity exists yeah there are more</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.260" end="00:42:12.140" style="s2">people contributing here than there are</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.700" end="00:42:14.000" style="s2">here therefore there should be more</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.140" end="00:42:16.910" style="s2">people are only money here than there is</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.000" end="00:42:19.520" style="s2">here right before actually reversing</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.910" end="00:42:21.650" style="s2">that diversity in favor of some</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.520" end="00:42:25.040" style="s2">preconceived notion of you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.650" end="00:42:28.280" style="s2">mean we can&#39;t be racist or whatever if</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.040" end="00:42:29.930" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;re get to go to a top high</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.280" end="00:42:32.570" style="s2">school where your parents are paying</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.930" end="00:42:34.100" style="s2">tens of thousands of dollars the chances</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.570" end="00:42:35.720" style="s2">are you can create better content</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.100" end="00:42:37.460" style="s2">because quite frankly your parents can</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.720" end="00:42:38.630" style="s2">pay someone to create better content for</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.460" end="00:42:41.030" style="s2">you to do the editing and add the music</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.630" end="00:42:43.790" style="s2">do those things for it and so yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.030" end="00:42:45.650" style="s2">you&#39;re topping that the top 1% and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.790" end="00:42:47.990" style="s2">there&#39;s 5,000 people that there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.650" end="00:42:49.850" style="s2">top 1% but if you&#39;re doing this on</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.990" end="00:42:51.950" style="s2">library unlike the local library</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.850" end="00:42:53.870" style="s2">computers and your your system doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.950" end="00:42:55.580" style="s2">have I think this is a way to wait for</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.870" end="00:42:57.650" style="s2">it and there is that built-in system of</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.580" end="00:43:00.110" style="s2">the journalism reporting so that if it</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.650" end="00:43:01.280" style="s2">is highly problematic rich people move</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.110" end="00:43:02.540" style="s2">to the poor neighborhood so they can be</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.280" end="00:43:05.360" style="s2">the talker and you can do all that</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.540" end="00:43:07.730" style="s2">things then it&#39;s in the system to figure</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.360" end="00:43:08.990" style="s2">that out and it&#39;s artificially posed I</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.730" end="00:43:12.980" style="s2">mean it is artificial and you could I</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.990" end="00:43:14.450" style="s2">agree with you that we&#39;re imposing and</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.980" end="00:43:16.210" style="s2">think about it and we have to unpack</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.450" end="00:43:18.200" style="s2">this a little bit but think about gender</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.210" end="00:43:19.820" style="s2">we&#39;re just going to say that both</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.200" end="00:43:21.440" style="s2">genders have to equally is that should</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.820" end="00:43:23.570" style="s2">that be right should more guys do it you</p>

<p begin="00:50:25.210" end="00:50:30.520" style="s2">friends with money but they very likely</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.580" end="00:50:31.540" style="s2">have they might have media presence and</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.520" end="00:50:33.100" style="s2">they might be able to figure out the</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.540" end="00:50:34.660" style="s2">marketing piece without needing the</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.100" end="00:50:36.400" style="s2">money and the outside force right like</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.660" end="00:50:38.800" style="s2">Bernie Sanders is making more money than</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.400" end="00:50:41.350" style="s2">the other politicians because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.800" end="00:50:43.240" style="s2">tapping into this different way of</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.350" end="00:50:45.610" style="s2">making money that is a tiny bit from a</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.240" end="00:50:47.440" style="s2">bunch of people rather than a bunch from</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.610" end="00:50:49.150" style="s2">from very few people right and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.440" end="00:50:49.990" style="s2">like you frozen you can always we watch</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.150" end="00:50:53.109" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.990" end="00:50:55.660" style="s2">that I&#39;m having like the board of</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.109" end="00:50:57.819" style="s2">directors if there is legal admits a lot</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.660" end="00:50:59.650" style="s2">of what you said yeah no go ahead if</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.819" end="00:51:01.270" style="s2">they have to be a certain age and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.650" end="00:51:02.559" style="s2">onus of three is the minimum right you</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.270" end="00:51:03.760" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily and you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.559" end="00:51:06.400" style="s2">necessarily pay them because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.760" end="00:51:08.230" style="s2">not-for-profit and so having them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.400" end="00:51:09.309" style="s2">like if you&#39;re generating what we just</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.230" end="00:51:10.869" style="s2">talked about and having them come</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.309" end="00:51:12.069" style="s2">together and create the website you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.869" end="00:51:13.960" style="s2">also ask them of the board of directors</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.069" end="00:51:16.569" style="s2">right maybe this is different Saturday&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.960" end="00:51:18.880" style="s2">or different outcomes of like hey who</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.569" end="00:51:20.680" style="s2">wants to be on this board you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.880" end="00:51:21.940" style="s2">18 if that&#39;s the rule you have to live</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.680" end="00:51:24.730" style="s2">in the state of New York I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.940" end="00:51:27.069" style="s2">what those rules are right yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.730" end="00:51:28.390" style="s2">by the way like full transparency we</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.069" end="00:51:30.460" style="s2">need money like you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.390" end="00:51:32.170" style="s2">like normally we would sit on this board</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.460" end="00:51:33.250" style="s2">would be flan through mist so you have</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.170" end="00:51:36.010" style="s2">millions of dollars and Friends of</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.250" end="00:51:37.630" style="s2">billions of dollars but what can we do</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.010" end="00:51:40.270" style="s2">that&#39;s different than that we still need</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.630" end="00:51:42.130" style="s2">the money but how can we get the people</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.270" end="00:51:43.809" style="s2">to sit here because when you&#39;re doing an</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.130" end="00:51:47.260" style="s2">education one like to me you would want</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.809" end="00:51:48.640" style="s2">the gatekeeper a student and a catalyst</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.260" end="00:51:49.869" style="s2">you called them right like that would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.640" end="00:51:51.790" style="s2">kind of perfect for it if there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.869" end="00:51:53.380" style="s2">three because you want each of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.790" end="00:51:55.240" style="s2">stakeholders to be there representing</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.380" end="00:51:57.460" style="s2">that and you want them to have the</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.240" end="00:51:58.809" style="s2">perfect combination of traits so three</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.460" end="00:52:01.510" style="s2">is probably not the number it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.809" end="00:52:03.369" style="s2">going to end up being more than just</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.510" end="00:52:05.920" style="s2">made you just yeah thank you I just got</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.369" end="00:52:09.549" style="s2">I just had a breakthrough in that</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.920" end="00:52:10.869" style="s2">there&#39;s I have a board that was on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.549" end="00:52:12.280" style="s2">board for this nonprofit before I got</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.869" end="00:52:14.559" style="s2">shut down when they shut down my program</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.280" end="00:52:15.970" style="s2">the board shut down but I have a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.559" end="00:52:18.190" style="s2">of people with money but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.970" end="00:52:20.500" style="s2">they&#39;re interested in Robert&#39;s Rules of</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.190" end="00:52:22.000" style="s2">Order type board at this point but if</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.500" end="00:52:23.619" style="s2">there was a board run by students and</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.000" end="00:52:26.349" style="s2">they could observe and they could be the</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.619" end="00:52:30.400" style="s2">money I think there would be much more</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.349" end="00:52:31.930" style="s2">inclined to participate right so let the</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.400" end="00:52:33.460" style="s2">students be in charge and let these guys</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.930" end="00:52:34.240" style="s2">just watch the video afterwards or</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.460" end="00:52:36.069" style="s2">whatever they don&#39;t have a big</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.240" end="00:52:37.990" style="s2">commitment but they can just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.069" end="00:52:39.250" style="s2">oversee and if they get inspired to give</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.990" end="00:52:40.809" style="s2">they can ask their for you know like</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.250" end="00:52:42.430" style="s2">they can do some of that but the kids I</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.809" end="00:52:43.839" style="s2">think that&#39;s great yeah because we have</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.430" end="00:52:45.160" style="s2">them I know I know that I&#39;ve worked with</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.839" end="00:52:47.559" style="s2">them for years and they want to work</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.160" end="00:52:48.549" style="s2">with this so I we already have them um I</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.559" end="00:52:49.900" style="s2">was trying to go in a different</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.549" end="00:52:53.109" style="s2">direction with a different community but</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.900" end="00:52:55.119" style="s2">maybe we mix them together yeah I feel</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.109" end="00:52:56.950" style="s2">like the students that are magical in in</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.119" end="00:52:58.839" style="s2">my head are also going to be great at</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.950" end="00:53:01.180" style="s2">crowdfunding and like social media and</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.839" end="00:53:02.990" style="s2">the things that are the new way to make</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.180" end="00:53:05.000" style="s2">money which is like having 10</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.990" end="00:53:06.619" style="s2">and fans give you a dollar giving ten</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.000" end="00:53:09.530" style="s2">thousand fans give you 100 bucks each is</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.619" end="00:53:11.900" style="s2">like you know mega mega money but that</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.530" end="00:53:13.430" style="s2">they can tap into that and these people</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.900" end="00:53:15.290" style="s2">are older and have connections and</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.430" end="00:53:18.590" style="s2">resources as well they come through this</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.290" end="00:53:28.730" style="s2">and they have a story with it which is</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.590" end="00:53:30.590" style="s2">huge and we have frozen again so okay we</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.730" end="00:53:33.080" style="s2">figured out your board we figured out</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.590" end="00:53:36.680" style="s2">the side and website the third one was</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.080" end="00:53:38.000" style="s2">the self-publishing - the book um which</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.680" end="00:53:39.860" style="s2">I feel like I don&#39;t want to reach happen</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.000" end="00:53:41.390" style="s2">to the kids but yeah like I mean they</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.860" end="00:53:45.350" style="s2">could treat it I&#39;ll be like why are you</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.390" end="00:53:47.030" style="s2">publishing a book oh so previous</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.350" end="00:53:48.770" style="s2">previous records but it is something</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.030" end="00:53:51.800" style="s2">that is tangible and will reach a</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.770" end="00:53:54.170" style="s2">different generation and I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.800" end="00:53:55.730" style="s2">I&#39;m hoping this generation still reads</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.170" end="00:53:58.960" style="s2">the Pope it worth you generations away</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.730" end="00:54:02.450" style="s2">from no longer reading at all but having</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.960" end="00:54:05.900" style="s2">um how to self publish and I feel like</p>

<p begin="00:55:11.000" end="00:55:14.240" style="s2">don&#39;t have anything else to say I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.740" end="00:55:16.910" style="s2">book will come out soon I&#39;m excited to</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.240" end="00:55:17.110" style="s2">see get more feedback on that so that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.910" end="00:55:19.790" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.110" end="00:55:21.620" style="s2">and so when I was saying about</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.790" end="00:55:23.540" style="s2">self-publishing was that I think there</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.620" end="00:55:27.890" style="s2">are people in the game B space who have</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.540" end="00:55:29.900" style="s2">self-published books and getting like to</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.890" end="00:55:31.520" style="s2">find them as like a mentor to just kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.900" end="00:55:32.690" style="s2">of what like hat most people in gave me</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.520" end="00:55:34.760" style="s2">space are open for an hour-long</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.690" end="00:55:37.360" style="s2">conversation about pretty much anything</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.760" end="00:55:39.110" style="s2">searching was their area of expertise</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.360" end="00:55:40.280" style="s2">self-publishing maybe isn&#39;t their area</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.110" end="00:55:43.220" style="s2">of expertise but if they went through</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.280" end="00:55:46.580" style="s2">that process there ahead of you right</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.220" end="00:55:48.380" style="s2">which is kind of part of the soup that</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.580" end="00:55:50.210" style="s2">would be stuff that&#39;s all I need right</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.380" end="00:55:52.010" style="s2">because it&#39;s just with foster care in</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.210" end="00:55:53.480" style="s2">all my life the more I can flatten the</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.010" end="00:55:56.300" style="s2">learning curve by somebody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.480" end="00:55:57.950" style="s2">frustrating learning yeah right I just</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.300" end="00:56:00.830" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna star in a trip anyway but I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.950" end="00:56:04.310" style="s2">rather minimize yeah so with our kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.830" end="00:56:06.050" style="s2">more meta project we have this vision of</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.310" end="00:56:08.120" style="s2">being able to scale share and being able</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.050" end="00:56:09.740" style="s2">to reach out to the mentorship we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.120" end="00:56:11.870" style="s2">yet have of course that system this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.740" end="00:56:14.030" style="s2">part of creating that system but I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.870" end="00:56:16.370" style="s2">what we could possibly do is have an</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.030" end="00:56:17.900" style="s2">hour-long conversation not with us cuz I</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.370" end="00:56:19.250" style="s2">don&#39;t like we can one of us can</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.900" end="00:56:21.320" style="s2">facilitate it because I ride are</p>

<p begin="01:00:43.750" end="01:00:49.660" style="s2">this is kind of a karmic way of building</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.040" end="01:00:54.490" style="s2">a community of people that support each</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.660" end="01:00:56.530" style="s2">other is by you know giving first so yes</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.490" end="01:01:02.470" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of my</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.530" end="01:01:04.750" style="s2">motivation yeah for me fairly similar to</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.470" end="01:01:06.640" style="s2">Bentley we&#39;re about a project that</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.750" end="01:01:08.080" style="s2">brought me into the game be space but</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.640" end="01:01:09.490" style="s2">over time I think we all sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.080" end="01:01:10.630" style="s2">independently noticed oh there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.490" end="01:01:12.850" style="s2">of projects here and everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.630" end="01:01:14.800" style="s2">struggling in a lot of the same ways and</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.850" end="01:01:18.280" style="s2">when you hear us talk about the meta</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.800" end="01:01:20.080" style="s2">project it&#39;s a project to help structure</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.280" end="01:01:22.090" style="s2">and sort of organize all those projects</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.080" end="01:01:23.500" style="s2">what you know so we can stop remitting</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.090" end="01:01:24.940" style="s2">the wheel if there&#39;s ten of us let&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.500" end="01:01:27.160" style="s2">get together figure it out one so that</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.940" end="01:01:29.020" style="s2">we can all reuse that information to me</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.160" end="01:01:31.840" style="s2">that&#39;s the purpose of these meetings is</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.020" end="01:01:33.070" style="s2">so that like if you know I have the same</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.840" end="01:01:35.740" style="s2">challenge and you have have the same</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.070" end="01:01:37.780" style="s2">challenge with brainstorm start to see</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.740" end="01:01:39.430" style="s2">you know the common themes over time and</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.780" end="01:01:41.950" style="s2">then start to build a playbook for</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.430" end="01:01:43.990" style="s2">here&#39;s what any project can do and</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.950" end="01:01:47.640" style="s2">here&#39;s what certain projects might want</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.990" end="01:01:47.640" style="s2">to try as well yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.710" end="01:01:51.839" style="s2">and for me I&#39;ve got a particular</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.720" end="01:01:53.980" style="s2">interest because it was a</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.839" end="01:01:58.270" style="s2">transformational project in education</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.980" end="01:02:01.119" style="s2">and as a teacher who bemoans constantly</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.270" end="01:02:02.680" style="s2">what education has actually become you</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.119" end="01:02:04.690" style="s2">know I was interested on that level and</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.680" end="01:02:07.030" style="s2">also everything that Jubilee said about</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.690" end="01:02:08.680" style="s2">forming new connections I mean that for</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.030" end="01:02:11.319" style="s2">me the notion of cross-pollination</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.680" end="01:02:13.059" style="s2">between these groups is really important</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.319" end="01:02:14.740" style="s2">you know what I mean like the result of</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.059" end="01:02:16.329" style="s2">this conversation this group I&#39;m part of</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.740" end="01:02:18.309" style="s2">a few other groups as well maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.329" end="01:02:20.920" style="s2">something that&#39;s come up here today will</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.309" end="01:02:22.630" style="s2">be you know something that really helps</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.920" end="01:02:23.559" style="s2">to move another conversation along you</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.630" end="01:02:25.869" style="s2">know what I mean something I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.559" end="01:02:27.550" style="s2">here and so on and so on you know what I</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.869" end="01:02:29.380" style="s2">mean and these things all linked</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.550" end="01:02:31.210" style="s2">together in entirely unpredictable ways</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.380" end="01:02:32.650" style="s2">and so the more we can do this the</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.210" end="01:02:34.809" style="s2">better as far as I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.650" end="01:02:37.240" style="s2">end no no that&#39;s not sure it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.809" end="01:02:40.150" style="s2">end in itself but it might as well be</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.240" end="01:02:42.220" style="s2">because it creates soil for all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.150" end="01:02:44.109" style="s2">possibilities in the future that we</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.220" end="01:02:47.530" style="s2">can&#39;t possibly know of you know and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.109" end="01:02:49.510" style="s2">it is almost an end in itself and to</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.530" end="01:02:50.920" style="s2">think for me to interact with you guys</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.510" end="01:02:52.690" style="s2">you guys are kind of like a lab right</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.920" end="01:02:54.730" style="s2">for me the people the gatekeepers that</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.690" end="01:02:58.359" style="s2">would be right the people causing other</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.730" end="01:02:59.680" style="s2">people right and it to think that a</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.359" end="01:03:01.809" style="s2">group of people like you with your</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.680" end="01:03:04.599" style="s2">generous hearts are would be the ones</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.809" end="01:03:06.250" style="s2">working out that how to define quality</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.599" end="01:03:08.230" style="s2">work working out the nitty-gritty of how</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.250" end="01:03:11.440" style="s2">to decide what work is quality what work</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.230" end="01:03:12.670" style="s2">isn&#39;t versus Cuomo and the politicians</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.440" end="01:03:13.809" style="s2">who spend no time and lawyers who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.670" end="01:03:16.869" style="s2">never walked into an effing school</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.809" end="01:03:18.369" style="s2">building and then to work the teachers</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.869" end="01:03:19.869" style="s2">that I work with they always say like if</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.369" end="01:03:21.309" style="s2">this is what teaching is like I would I</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.869" end="01:03:22.900" style="s2">would you know like love being a teacher</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.309" end="01:03:24.640" style="s2">but it&#39;s not and some of them have out</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.900" end="01:03:26.619" style="s2">have retired early because the</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.640" end="01:03:28.480" style="s2">industrial system is such malpractice I</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.619" end="01:03:31.240" style="s2">grew up in the Waldorf schools is</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.480" end="01:03:32.559" style="s2">Rudolph Steiner schools and I was lucky</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.240" end="01:03:34.720" style="s2">enough to grow up in a system that</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.559" end="01:03:36.630" style="s2">opened my heart and and made me</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.720" end="01:03:39.250" style="s2">passionate about doing work you know and</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.630" end="01:03:42.609" style="s2">but that and I want to share that right</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.250" end="01:03:44.940" style="s2">so it&#39;s always you know absolutely be</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.609" end="01:03:47.710" style="s2">the greatest job in the world teaching</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.940" end="01:03:49.180" style="s2">absolutely a privilege and an honor and</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.710" end="01:03:51.069" style="s2">a non-stop pleasure it really should</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.180" end="01:03:54.160" style="s2">they&#39;ve done anything they can&#39;t stop it</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.069" end="01:03:57.400" style="s2">being there motherfuckers preparing it</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.160" end="01:04:00.280" style="s2">should pay more yeah yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.400" end="01:04:01.300" style="s2">that&#39;s super honestly honestly if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.280" end="01:04:03.430" style="s2">could actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.300" end="01:04:04.869" style="s2">fully experienced the joy of teaching as</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.430" end="01:04:06.040" style="s2">it should be you know I mean I think a</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.869" end="01:04:08.349" style="s2">lot of teachers will do it for half the</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.040" end="01:04:10.089" style="s2">money you know dollars enough to cover</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.349" end="01:04:12.520" style="s2">my building that that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.089" end="01:04:14.470" style="s2">all it&#39;s enough you know yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.520" end="01:04:18.720" style="s2">yeah the best teachers I had all had a</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.470" end="01:04:21.640" style="s2">spouse that could support them sorry</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.720" end="01:04:22.869" style="s2">that&#39;s teachers I had all had a spouse</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.640" end="01:04:27.520" style="s2">that could support them</p>

<p begin="01:04:27.520" end="01:04:34.270" style="s2">that they need it is not in where I live</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.089" end="01:04:36.760" style="s2">it does not pay a living wage it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.270" end="01:04:39.460" style="s2">just about tracking people it&#39;s that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.760" end="01:04:40.690" style="s2">teachers are so distracted by having to</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.460" end="01:04:42.550" style="s2">figure out how to keep their lives</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.690" end="01:04:44.890" style="s2">running that they cannot focus on the</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.550" end="01:04:47.619" style="s2">students and then I thought about energy</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.890" end="01:04:50.740" style="s2">wise they&#39;re in a coercive system that</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.619" end="01:04:53.650" style="s2">is out to demoralize and punish them but</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.740" end="01:04:57.910" style="s2">yeah yeah so they&#39;re all doing it for</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.650" end="01:04:59.500" style="s2">altruistic needs and I mean for being</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.910" end="01:05:04.210" style="s2">altruistic every single one of them I</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.500" end="01:05:06.400" style="s2">believe and then they they run out more</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.210" end="01:05:08.740" style="s2">energy right and then they have to do</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.400" end="01:05:11.500" style="s2">something else anyways it&#39;s like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.740" end="01:05:13.030" style="s2">taking resources so everyone&#39;s resources</p>
