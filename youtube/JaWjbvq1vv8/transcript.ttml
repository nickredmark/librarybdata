<p begin="00:04:52.400" end="00:04:55.680" style="s2">i&#39;m doing with alliances is based off</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.720" end="00:04:58.720" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.680" end="00:05:01.199" style="s2">at maple at the monastic academy i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.720" end="00:05:02.479" style="s2">trying to help our monasteries to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.199" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">flourish and grow</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.479" end="00:05:09.199" style="s2">and we have this kind of uh broad</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.800" end="00:05:10.000" style="s2">world-saving project that needs to grow</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.199" end="00:05:11.919" style="s2">uh from</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.000" end="00:05:14.240" style="s2">one to two to three to ultimately we</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.919" end="00:05:17.280" style="s2">hope to have 500 monasteries</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.240" end="00:05:20.160" style="s2">there&#39;s this big ambitious world-saving</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.280" end="00:05:21.440" style="s2">project and i&#39;m imagining uh that people</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.160" end="00:05:24.160" style="s2">here also have</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.440" end="00:05:25.759" style="s2">some kind of ambition or they want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.160" end="00:05:26.400" style="s2">save the world in some capacity they</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.759" end="00:05:28.400" style="s2">have something</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.400" end="00:05:29.520" style="s2">to offer that they want to offer to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.400" end="00:05:33.440" style="s2">world and</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.520" end="00:05:35.360" style="s2">see realize and so um</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.440" end="00:05:36.560" style="s2">a lot of what i&#39;m talking about with</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.360" end="00:05:40.240" style="s2">alliances</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.560" end="00:05:43.280" style="s2">can be uh sort of seen from</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.240" end="00:05:45.199" style="s2">the light of this perspective that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.280" end="00:05:47.680" style="s2">want to save the world or we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.199" end="00:05:48.880" style="s2">something that we need to realize some</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.680" end="00:05:51.120" style="s2">goal some project</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.880" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">that we want to bring about a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.120" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">this might be</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:56.720" style="s2">seen as sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:05:58.639" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of an overlap with what you</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.720" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">might call like traditional</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.639" end="00:06:02.560" style="s2">networking advice or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">but for me this is really coming from</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.560" end="00:06:06.560" style="s2">a perspective of i want to help save the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:08.880" style="s2">world i want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.560" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">realize a better world for ourselves for</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.880" end="00:06:12.800" style="s2">all humans</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.680" end="00:06:14.880" style="s2">and even for all life on earth and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.800" end="00:06:16.240" style="s2">a lot of these things will make sense if</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.880" end="00:06:17.840" style="s2">you&#39;re in that context and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.240" end="00:06:20.639" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve heard from some people</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.840" end="00:06:22.720" style="s2">sometimes like oh this seems kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.639" end="00:06:24.880" style="s2">creepy or weird</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.720" end="00:06:26.560" style="s2">the way that you&#39;re looking at this and</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.880" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">i think it doesn&#39;t make so much sense if</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.560" end="00:06:29.039" style="s2">you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:31.520" style="s2">these ambitions or you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.039" end="00:06:32.880" style="s2">save the world you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.520" end="00:06:34.400" style="s2">aiming in that direction if you just</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.880" end="00:06:35.199" style="s2">kind of want to run your own company or</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.400" end="00:06:37.199" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.199" end="00:06:38.960" style="s2">maybe it won&#39;t make as much sense but if</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.199" end="00:06:39.759" style="s2">you have these big ambitions or you</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.960" end="00:06:41.759" style="s2">really want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.759" end="00:06:43.520" style="s2">uh have a benefit on the world then a</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.759" end="00:06:45.199" style="s2">lot of the strategies that i&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.520" end="00:06:48.479" style="s2">talking about today will kind of make</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.199" end="00:06:51.440" style="s2">more sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.479" end="00:06:52.240" style="s2">um at the monastery we talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.440" end="00:06:53.599" style="s2">in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.240" end="00:06:56.000" style="s2">trustworthy leaders and i have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.599" end="00:06:57.840" style="s2">separate post about this uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.000" end="00:06:59.360" style="s2">that you can read but we say that we a</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.840" end="00:07:00.560" style="s2">trustworthy leader is someone who has</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.360" end="00:07:02.720" style="s2">these three skills</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.560" end="00:07:05.199" style="s2">of wisdom love and power and that those</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.720" end="00:07:07.599" style="s2">are mutually reinforcing</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.199" end="00:07:10.319" style="s2">so the wisdom comes from the meditation</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.599" end="00:07:12.080" style="s2">component from contemplative practice</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:14.080" style="s2">the love comes from seeing others</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.080" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">perspectives caring about others</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.080" end="00:07:17.120" style="s2">benefiting them and the power is what</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:18.960" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about today</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.120" end="00:07:20.560" style="s2">in terms of strategy how do you really</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.960" end="00:07:23.039" style="s2">have an impact how do you</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.560" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">really help people uh what do you</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.039" end="00:07:27.680" style="s2">actually do to make that</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:28.000" style="s2">happen so if you have these ambitions if</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.680" end="00:07:29.919" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.000" end="00:07:31.759" style="s2">sort of seeking power to put it bluntly</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.919" end="00:07:34.479" style="s2">then alliances are going to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.759" end="00:07:36.319" style="s2">if you have love and you see clearly</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.479" end="00:07:37.840" style="s2">that other people are suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.319" end="00:07:39.440" style="s2">there are real problems in the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.840" end="00:07:40.319" style="s2">then this is going to make sense if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.440" end="00:07:41.919" style="s2">have wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.319" end="00:07:46.000" style="s2">if you see reality clearly you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.919" end="00:07:46.000" style="s2">that power has enormous uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.080" end="00:07:49.360" style="s2">effect in the world and that it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.840" end="00:07:51.360" style="s2">acquiring power so</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.360" end="00:07:53.280" style="s2">from these angles it makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.360" end="00:07:54.879" style="s2">cultivate power it makes sense to have</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.280" end="00:07:56.960" style="s2">strategy it makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.879" end="00:07:58.800" style="s2">cultivate alliances if you&#39;re not coming</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.960" end="00:08:01.360" style="s2">from that angle it may not be</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.800" end="00:08:01.360" style="s2">so helpful</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">a lot of my thinking about these topics</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.680" end="00:08:09.440" style="s2">comes from studying the work of sama</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:11.120" style="s2">borya who&#39;s a friend of mine and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.440" end="00:08:13.599" style="s2">pretty sure he participates in the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:16.800" style="s2">regularly is that right peter</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.599" end="00:08:19.120" style="s2">yeah so um this is a quote that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.800" end="00:08:19.840" style="s2">from his work green founder theory that</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:22.720" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.840" end="00:08:23.360" style="s2">captivated me for a few reasons it says</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.720" end="00:08:25.120" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.360" end="00:08:26.400" style="s2">can be used to accomplish a very broad</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.120" end="00:08:28.800" style="s2">range of goals</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.400" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">as such many kinds of actors will aim to</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.800" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">acquire power</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:32.959" style="s2">in the pursuit of their goals the more</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:34.240" style="s2">effective they are</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.959" end="00:08:36.320" style="s2">and the better their understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.240" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">reality is the likelier</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.320" end="00:08:40.719" style="s2">they are to seek power this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:42.560" style="s2">fascinating claim he says</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:44.640" style="s2">the more you understand reality the more</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.560" end="00:08:46.880" style="s2">you&#39;re going to want power</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.640" end="00:08:47.680" style="s2">and we at the monastery are seeking to</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.880" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.680" end="00:08:51.440" style="s2">this direct understanding of reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.440" end="00:08:53.040" style="s2">that&#39;s what you could define wisdom as</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.440" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">do you clearly see what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.040" end="00:08:58.399" style="s2">happening away from human perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:09:00.160" style="s2">away from traditional stories about</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.399" end="00:09:03.120" style="s2">looking at things can you see things</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.160" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">clearly directly do you understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.120" end="00:09:05.519" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:07.680" style="s2">and if you understand that reality then</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.519" end="00:09:09.040" style="s2">naturally you&#39;ll want power and so that</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.680" end="00:09:12.480" style="s2">sort of leads to this</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.040" end="00:09:13.200" style="s2">wisdom to power arrow samo himself not</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.480" end="00:09:14.880" style="s2">coming from</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.200" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">a contemplative background stumbled on</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.880" end="00:09:22.480" style="s2">this he says if you understand reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:25.120" style="s2">you&#39;re going to want power so if</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.480" end="00:09:26.720" style="s2">if that&#39;s you if you are seeking power</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.120" end="00:09:28.240" style="s2">if you have these ambitions if you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.720" end="00:09:30.720" style="s2">the compassion to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.240" end="00:09:32.160" style="s2">save the world then that&#39;s why uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.720" end="00:09:35.120" style="s2">alliances might be helpful and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.160" end="00:09:36.320" style="s2">i hope that they&#39;ll benefit you and uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.120" end="00:09:39.600" style="s2">moving forward with these</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.320" end="00:09:41.440" style="s2">different projects as far as i can tell</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.600" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t really understand everything in</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.440" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">the world i&#39;m not omniscient but</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:46.560" style="s2">there are real problems that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.720" end="00:09:48.800" style="s2">facing there&#39;s there are</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.560" end="00:09:50.560" style="s2">clear crises that we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.800" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">collectively as a species and on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.560" end="00:09:54.320" style="s2">planet</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:54.959" style="s2">and my goal bluntly speaking is to save</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.320" end="00:09:57.040" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.959" end="00:09:58.959" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;m trying to do it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.040" end="00:10:01.040" style="s2">of uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.959" end="00:10:02.800" style="s2">not kosher in some circles to say that</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.040" end="00:10:05.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh are you naive or</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.800" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">silly or something but as far as i can</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.200" end="00:10:08.480" style="s2">tell the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">needs saving and so that&#39;s why it makes</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.480" end="00:10:11.680" style="s2">sense to have these</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:13.440" style="s2">different world-saving projects like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.680" end="00:10:14.320" style="s2">monastery like things that other people</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.440" end="00:10:16.399" style="s2">are doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.320" end="00:10:17.680" style="s2">none of these are sufficient we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.399" end="00:10:19.920" style="s2">to need a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.680" end="00:10:20.959" style="s2">perspectives and angles and skills and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.920" end="00:10:23.519" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.959" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">but i think that these different things</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.519" end="00:10:27.440" style="s2">are necessary</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.800" end="00:10:29.600" style="s2">and uh are what&#39;s needed to actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.440" end="00:10:31.839" style="s2">save the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.600" end="00:10:34.079" style="s2">and a big part of that is that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.839" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">really save the world by yourself</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.079" end="00:10:38.160" style="s2">uh i would have done it already if i</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:40.079" style="s2">could you would have probably done it</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.160" end="00:10:42.160" style="s2">already if you could no one</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.079" end="00:10:43.839" style="s2">single-handedly can save the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.160" end="00:10:45.519" style="s2">alone it&#39;s actually something that needs</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.839" end="00:10:47.519" style="s2">to be done together</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.519" end="00:10:49.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s where alliances start to make</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.519" end="00:10:51.680" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.120" end="00:10:52.240" style="s2">in alliance you work closely with one</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.680" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.240" end="00:10:55.760" style="s2">three other people or organizations many</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:10:57.760" style="s2">people even</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.760" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">many organizations but you kind of have</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.760" end="00:11:00.160" style="s2">a clear sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.800" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">who you&#39;re working with what the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.160" end="00:11:02.720" style="s2">different skills and strengths and</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.360" end="00:11:04.399" style="s2">weaknesses are of people</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.720" end="00:11:06.480" style="s2">and you try to go in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.399" end="00:11:07.600" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to realize something</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.480" end="00:11:14.160" style="s2">bigger and better</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.600" end="00:11:16.880" style="s2">than you could realize on your own</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:18.079" style="s2">it&#39;s another quote from samo he&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.880" end="00:11:21.200" style="s2">general he&#39;s interested in</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.079" end="00:11:23.200" style="s2">competitive uh things like uh money or</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.200" end="00:11:26.079" style="s2">power politics things like this</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.200" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">um so and he says interestingly that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.079" end="00:11:29.279" style="s2">best way to win</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.120" end="00:11:30.959" style="s2">adversarial encounters is to focus</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.279" end="00:11:33.279" style="s2">energy on building out</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.959" end="00:11:34.959" style="s2">cooperative relationships so even in the</p>

<p begin="00:11:35.760" end="00:11:40.240" style="s2">the best strategy is to cooperate build</p>

<p begin="00:11:40.240" end="00:11:44.000" style="s2">in the long run acquiring power and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:45.200" style="s2">empowering others are mutually</p>

<p begin="00:11:45.200" end="00:11:50.160" style="s2">rather than mutually exclusive so if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.079" end="00:11:51.920" style="s2">get power and you share it with others</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.160" end="00:11:53.760" style="s2">that&#39;s going to bring you more power in</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.920" end="00:11:54.639" style="s2">the future than if you had just kept</p>

<p begin="00:11:54.639" end="00:11:59.839" style="s2">for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.760" end="00:12:01.120" style="s2">this is also a very different way of</p>

<p begin="00:12:01.120" end="00:12:04.880" style="s2">you know you may have been used to</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.560" end="00:12:07.200" style="s2">people often think of power as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.880" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">zero sum you know i&#39;m gonna get power</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.200" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have it they have power</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:11.120" style="s2">and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:12.639" style="s2">but this is a way of looking at power</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.120" end="00:12:14.399" style="s2">that we want to cooperate</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:17.519" style="s2">we want the most people to have the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.399" end="00:12:17.519" style="s2">power for the most good</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.440" end="00:12:23.279" style="s2">so in that context he starts talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.200" end="00:12:27.519" style="s2">about alliances he makes a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.279" end="00:12:27.519" style="s2">between a narrow and a broad alliance</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:32.800" style="s2">so most alliances are narrow he says two</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.880" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">players can cooperate in one domain</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.800" end="00:12:36.720" style="s2">while battling in a different domain i</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">call this a narrow alliance</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.720" end="00:12:43.440" style="s2">so an example of this might be say</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:44.320" style="s2">a politician walks into a convenience</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.440" end="00:12:46.880" style="s2">store</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.320" end="00:12:47.600" style="s2">temporarily they have an alliance the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.880" end="00:12:50.639" style="s2">cashier</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.600" end="00:12:53.040" style="s2">the store owners and the politician they</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.639" end="00:12:54.480" style="s2">they all want the politician to purchase</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.040" end="00:12:56.480" style="s2">like peanuts or something</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.480" end="00:12:58.720" style="s2">uh get some kind of snack at the grocery</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.480" end="00:13:01.040" style="s2">store or the convenience store</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.720" end="00:13:02.240" style="s2">but as soon as that transaction is done</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.040" end="00:13:04.959" style="s2">their relationship</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.240" end="00:13:06.160" style="s2">is over they may have totally different</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.959" end="00:13:06.800" style="s2">politics they may want to see a</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.160" end="00:13:09.200" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.800" end="00:13:11.120" style="s2">world realize they may even hate each</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.200" end="00:13:11.680" style="s2">other but they all want the politician</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.120" end="00:13:13.440" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.680" end="00:13:14.800" style="s2">purchase a snack at the convenience</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.440" end="00:13:16.560" style="s2">store</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.800" end="00:13:18.399" style="s2">this is sort of an extreme example but a</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.560" end="00:13:19.920" style="s2">lot of things are like this if you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.399" end="00:13:21.440" style="s2">a relationship with a co-worker for</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.920" end="00:13:22.880" style="s2">example uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.440" end="00:13:24.560" style="s2">that might very well be a narrow</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.880" end="00:13:27.279" style="s2">alliance where you work together</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.560" end="00:13:28.560" style="s2">in the context of uh you know the work</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.279" end="00:13:29.920" style="s2">that you&#39;re working on together</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.560" end="00:13:31.440" style="s2">but then at the end of the day you two</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.920" end="00:13:32.320" style="s2">aren&#39;t necessarily friends or aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.440" end="00:13:34.560" style="s2">very close</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.320" end="00:13:35.680" style="s2">you don&#39;t have these long-term existing</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.560" end="00:13:37.519" style="s2">relationships that</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.680" end="00:13:38.720" style="s2">you cooperate no matter what in whatever</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.519" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">context you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.720" end="00:13:42.399" style="s2">and that&#39;s what abroad alliances says</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.720" end="00:13:44.399" style="s2">when two players are coordinating</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.399" end="00:13:46.000" style="s2">to achieve most of their goals and no</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.399" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">longer contest one each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.000" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">one another i call it a broad alliance</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:52.639" style="s2">so a good example of this would be uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">station and i we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.639" end="00:13:56.959" style="s2">on the same team uh she&#39;s at willow i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.120" end="00:13:58.639" style="s2">here at oak sometimes i&#39;m at medieval</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.959" end="00:14:00.480" style="s2">there are different contexts that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.639" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">work together but we&#39;re always on</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.480" end="00:14:03.920" style="s2">each other&#39;s team we&#39;re trying to help</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.320" end="00:14:05.199" style="s2">each other in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.920" end="00:14:06.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of different ways that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.199" end="00:14:07.199" style="s2">help each other we&#39;re always trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.800" end="00:14:09.440" style="s2">stay</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.199" end="00:14:11.360" style="s2">apprised of what each other are doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.440" end="00:14:11.839" style="s2">and we work well together and are trying</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.360" end="00:14:14.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.839" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">realize something bigger and better than</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.240" end="00:14:18.880" style="s2">just what we would do</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.279" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">alone he also says something very</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.880" end="00:14:23.279" style="s2">interesting to me here he says that</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:24.800" style="s2">narrow alliances are the default between</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.279" end="00:14:28.160" style="s2">most players and an empire that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.800" end="00:14:30.079" style="s2">samo&#39;s technical vocabulary but he says</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.160" end="00:14:32.320" style="s2">broad alliances are unusual</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.079" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">and for me this was just reading that</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.320" end="00:14:36.720" style="s2">sentence was</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:38.800" style="s2">revelatory because i realized that in</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.720" end="00:14:41.199" style="s2">the monastery in the monastic setting</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.800" end="00:14:42.639" style="s2">broad alliances are actually normal it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.199" end="00:14:43.519" style="s2">normal to have a broad alliance with</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.639" end="00:14:45.040" style="s2">someone</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.519" end="00:14:47.040" style="s2">all the time your roles are changing</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.040" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">people come and go from the monastery</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.040" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">even when they&#39;re in the monastery</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:51.760" style="s2">they&#39;re changing locations or roles</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:53.839" style="s2">all of the times the circumstances are</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.760" end="00:14:56.079" style="s2">changing and yet</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:14:57.279" style="s2">you have these continued relationships</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.079" end="00:14:59.199" style="s2">where you&#39;re really trying to support</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.279" end="00:15:01.040" style="s2">each other you trust each other</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.199" end="00:15:02.639" style="s2">you see that the other person is a good</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.040" end="00:15:03.360" style="s2">person trying to bring about good things</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.639" end="00:15:06.720" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.360" end="00:15:08.560" style="s2">and you want to help them no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.720" end="00:15:10.560" style="s2">so you know again station and i have</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.560" end="00:15:12.079" style="s2">been in many different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.560" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">contexts and relationships with each</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.079" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">other but we&#39;re always trying to help</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:15.839" style="s2">each other and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:18.000" style="s2">that&#39;s actually normal i could talk</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.839" end="00:15:19.199" style="s2">about anyone in the monastic training</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.000" end="00:15:21.519" style="s2">that i&#39;ve done and</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.199" end="00:15:23.440" style="s2">the default would be for me that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.519" end="00:15:25.360" style="s2">have a broad alliance</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.440" end="00:15:27.440" style="s2">but in most domains in most settings</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.360" end="00:15:28.880" style="s2">narrow alliances are the norm</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.440" end="00:15:30.720" style="s2">where you just have these like short</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.880" end="00:15:33.360" style="s2">term or sort of narrow</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.720" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">focused alliances and what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.360" end="00:15:37.040" style="s2">about here</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:37.759" style="s2">is broad alliances we want to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.040" end="00:15:40.800" style="s2">notice</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.759" end="00:15:42.800" style="s2">build deepen strengthen these</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:45.920" style="s2">broad alliances that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.800" end="00:15:45.920" style="s2">talking about today</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.240" end="00:15:52.000" style="s2">so there&#39;s a few different ways to look</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.480" end="00:15:54.399" style="s2">at power and the basic</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.000" end="00:15:55.279" style="s2">distinction that i would say is worth</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.399" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">looking at is</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.279" end="00:15:59.199" style="s2">the distinction between networks and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.199" end="00:16:01.040" style="s2">hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.199" end="00:16:02.240" style="s2">in social science this is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.040" end="00:16:05.440" style="s2">equivalent of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.240" end="00:16:07.120" style="s2">uh particle and wave distinction</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.440" end="00:16:08.639" style="s2">a lot of times people make these into</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.120" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">kind of a binary where like</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.639" end="00:16:12.639" style="s2">oh i don&#39;t like hierarchical power i</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:14.079" style="s2">want these like networks or like</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.639" end="00:16:17.040" style="s2">anarchical power</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.079" end="00:16:18.959" style="s2">things like this um but at least as far</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.040" end="00:16:22.160" style="s2">as i can tell most social structures</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.959" end="00:16:24.480" style="s2">are a mixture of both there are</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.160" end="00:16:25.199" style="s2">you can describe power and social</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.480" end="00:16:26.880" style="s2">structures</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.199" end="00:16:28.480" style="s2">either in a networked view or</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.880" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">hierarchies view just in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.480" end="00:16:31.199" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:32.639" style="s2">subatomic particles can be seen as</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.199" end="00:16:34.480" style="s2">particles or waves</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.639" end="00:16:36.240" style="s2">and then the way that you look at them</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.480" end="00:16:39.440" style="s2">changes you come to different</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.240" end="00:16:39.440" style="s2">results based on that</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.240" end="00:16:44.320" style="s2">so it&#39;s worth looking at alliances both</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.720" end="00:16:47.920" style="s2">from the perspective of networks</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.320" end="00:16:49.279" style="s2">and from the perspective of hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.920" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">i&#39;ll start with networks because i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.279" end="00:16:55.519" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit easier to understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:57.360" style="s2">uh the applications here so</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.519" end="00:16:59.040" style="s2">uh this is a diagram that i made with an</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.360" end="00:17:01.839" style="s2">ally of men very close</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.040" end="00:17:03.279" style="s2">ally and we basically made a map of our</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.839" end="00:17:04.000" style="s2">different networks you know i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.279" end="00:17:06.160" style="s2">the names in here</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.000" end="00:17:07.520" style="s2">but i&#39;m the dot at the bottom and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.160" end="00:17:09.280" style="s2">the dot at the top</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.520" end="00:17:10.799" style="s2">and we sort of mapped out the different</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.280" end="00:17:11.280" style="s2">people that we&#39;re connected to that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.799" end="00:17:14.640" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:16.480" style="s2">alliances with and what their uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.640" end="00:17:17.679" style="s2">who they are and how they&#39;re connected</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.480" end="00:17:20.959" style="s2">so uh the big</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.679" end="00:17:24.319" style="s2">gray dots are different organizations</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.959" end="00:17:25.600" style="s2">um and then the little gray dots are</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.319" end="00:17:26.799" style="s2">different people that we knew and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.600" end="00:17:30.720" style="s2">again the black dots</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.799" end="00:17:32.960" style="s2">are my ally and me so in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.720" end="00:17:34.720" style="s2">he and i had mutual connections where we</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.960" end="00:17:38.320" style="s2">were both connected to</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.720" end="00:17:40.080" style="s2">uh particular people but in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.320" end="00:17:41.520" style="s2">he was connected to people that i wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.080" end="00:17:43.679" style="s2">and i was connected to people</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.520" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">that he wasn&#39;t connected to and so then</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.679" end="00:17:47.919" style="s2">the question became</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:49.360" style="s2">what is going on here um are there any</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.919" end="00:17:51.039" style="s2">connections that would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.360" end="00:17:52.880" style="s2">worth making that aren&#39;t currently</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.039" end="00:17:54.480" style="s2">connected you know maybe this person on</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.880" end="00:17:56.160" style="s2">the far right would really benefit</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.480" end="00:17:58.080" style="s2">from knowing this person on the far</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.160" end="00:17:59.679" style="s2">bottom left they&#39;re they&#39;re both working</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.080" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">on similar things or they have something</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.679" end="00:18:02.480" style="s2">that they</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:04.559" style="s2">could support each other in and you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.480" end="00:18:07.440" style="s2">look at it in this networked view where</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.559" end="00:18:09.200" style="s2">rather than you know seeing things in</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.440" end="00:18:09.679" style="s2">terms of specific organizations you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.200" end="00:18:10.880" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.679" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">lots of different nodes and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.880" end="00:18:14.240" style="s2">connections between the nodes and see if</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:17.360" style="s2">there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.240" end="00:18:19.520" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of inviting itself to arise</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.360" end="00:18:20.640" style="s2">is there anything that could emerge from</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.520" end="00:18:22.240" style="s2">what&#39;s present here</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.640" end="00:18:24.080" style="s2">that&#39;s greater than what&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:27.120" style="s2">present</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.080" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">from this perspective i think about it</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.120" end="00:18:30.880" style="s2">in terms of serving the network</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:32.240" style="s2">so of course i care about the monastery</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.880" end="00:18:34.559" style="s2">and our local goals</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.240" end="00:18:36.160" style="s2">uh i care about the network that i&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.559" end="00:18:37.679" style="s2">of multiple monasteries seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.160" end="00:18:40.080" style="s2">succeed seeing that flourish</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.679" end="00:18:41.120" style="s2">i have those aims but i also care about</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.080" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">the overall network</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.120" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">i also care about other people even if</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:46.960" style="s2">they&#39;re not in the project</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:47.840" style="s2">that i&#39;m in they i want to see them</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.960" end="00:18:51.760" style="s2">benefited</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.840" end="00:18:52.960" style="s2">um so sometimes uh there are non-obvious</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.760" end="00:18:56.000" style="s2">connections that</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.960" end="00:18:57.840" style="s2">are just waiting to happen that i can</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.000" end="00:18:59.840" style="s2">help happen and typically of course you</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.840" end="00:19:04.640" style="s2">want to make sure that both people are</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.840" end="00:19:05.919" style="s2">uh interested in this uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.640" end="00:19:07.280" style="s2">connection you want to get sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.919" end="00:19:08.240" style="s2">what&#39;s known as a double opt-in</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.280" end="00:19:09.840" style="s2">introduction</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.240" end="00:19:11.360" style="s2">you talk to one person and say hey</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.840" end="00:19:12.480" style="s2">there&#39;s this other person they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.360" end="00:19:13.679" style="s2">this would you like to</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.480" end="00:19:15.679" style="s2">meet them and then you talk to the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.679" end="00:19:16.880" style="s2">person hey there&#39;s this person would you</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.679" end="00:19:18.160" style="s2">like to meet them and if they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.880" end="00:19:19.520" style="s2">interested in meeting each other then</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.160" end="00:19:22.480" style="s2">you make the introduction</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.520" end="00:19:24.400" style="s2">um but in any case that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.480" end="00:19:27.200" style="s2">introduction can really help someone say</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.400" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">one person needs this really obscure</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.200" end="00:19:30.720" style="s2">like programming skill and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:32.640" style="s2">someone else has that and is looking for</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.720" end="00:19:33.840" style="s2">a job then that can</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.640" end="00:19:35.760" style="s2">you can connect them together and</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.840" end="00:19:36.480" style="s2">something will happen that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.760" end="00:19:38.240" style="s2">predicted</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.480" end="00:19:40.000" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t necessarily directly benefit</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.240" end="00:19:43.679" style="s2">you but the network as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.000" end="00:19:45.200" style="s2">is stronger the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.679" end="00:19:48.880" style="s2">everyone is benefited when there are</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.200" end="00:19:50.799" style="s2">these stronger connections</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.880" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">so that&#39;s the networked view of power</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.799" end="00:19:55.039" style="s2">the other one is hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:57.440" style="s2">and most people have this kind of a view</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.039" end="00:19:59.760" style="s2">of a hierarchy where there&#39;s like a ceo</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.440" end="00:20:02.320" style="s2">a vice president and multiple teams of</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.760" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">like individual contributors for example</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.320" end="00:20:06.799" style="s2">in other words an org chart an</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.919" end="00:20:06.799" style="s2">organization chart</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.120" end="00:20:10.159" style="s2">that&#39;s a really valid way to look at</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.799" end="00:20:12.480" style="s2">hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.159" end="00:20:13.360" style="s2">those are relevant to know the official</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.480" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2">or chart</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.360" end="00:20:16.799" style="s2">of an organization but it&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:19.200" style="s2">limited view</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.799" end="00:20:20.400" style="s2">often in social structures and power the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.200" end="00:20:23.440" style="s2">way that things are</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.400" end="00:20:26.240" style="s2">explicitly presented is not the full</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.440" end="00:20:28.159" style="s2">reality there&#39;s sort of implicit uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.240" end="00:20:31.360" style="s2">information there that may not be</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.159" end="00:20:33.360" style="s2">explicit or made verbal</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.360" end="00:20:35.120" style="s2">is like shared verbal knowledge between</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.360" end="00:20:36.720" style="s2">people there are sort of these</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.120" end="00:20:38.720" style="s2">different connections that people have</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.720" end="00:20:40.480" style="s2">that might be like back channels or like</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.720" end="00:20:42.159" style="s2">secret alliances or maybe two people</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.480" end="00:20:45.520" style="s2">like secretly hate each other or</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.159" end="00:20:47.039" style="s2">things like this um so this is a drawing</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.520" end="00:20:50.480" style="s2">from tom crichlow</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.039" end="00:20:53.360" style="s2">uh who recently wrote a great post about</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.480" end="00:20:54.159" style="s2">navigating power and he&#39;s got this like</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.360" end="00:20:56.880" style="s2">much more</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.159" end="00:20:58.240" style="s2">realistic map uh and the details don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.880" end="00:21:00.720" style="s2">matter so much as like</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.240" end="00:21:02.320" style="s2">uh actually there&#39;s a lot more people</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.720" end="00:21:05.039" style="s2">and there&#39;s these secret</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.320" end="00:21:06.640" style="s2">you know hidden relationships and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.039" end="00:21:08.159" style="s2">sort of working he&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.640" end="00:21:10.400" style="s2">from the context of being an outside</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.159" end="00:21:12.080" style="s2">consultant hired to work with a company</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:14.000" style="s2">and so he&#39;s trying to make his own</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.080" end="00:21:15.520" style="s2">internal personal map</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.000" end="00:21:16.720" style="s2">of what&#39;s going on in the organization</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.520" end="00:21:17.520" style="s2">so even though they&#39;ve got their</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.720" end="00:21:19.760" style="s2">official</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.520" end="00:21:20.799" style="s2">uh org chart he&#39;s trying to work out who</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.760" end="00:21:22.799" style="s2">really has power</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.799" end="00:21:24.000" style="s2">you know who&#39;s secretly you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.799" end="00:21:25.200" style="s2">headlined here</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.000" end="00:21:27.520" style="s2">uh even though they still have</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.200" end="00:21:29.280" style="s2">officially recognized power they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.520" end="00:21:32.400" style="s2">actually in power things like this</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.280" end="00:21:34.640" style="s2">this happens all the time and so uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.400" end="00:21:36.720" style="s2">useful to know that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.640" end="00:21:38.480" style="s2">explicit org chart of an organization is</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.720" end="00:21:40.960" style="s2">not necessarily the real</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.480" end="00:21:43.760" style="s2">power structure at least in terms of you</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.960" end="00:21:45.679" style="s2">know whatever goals you may have</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.760" end="00:21:47.919" style="s2">this is true for organizations that</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.679" end="00:21:51.280" style="s2">you&#39;re in but also working with</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.919" end="00:21:53.760" style="s2">other organizations um you know so i</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.280" end="00:21:54.640" style="s2">i think about these hierarchies for my</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.760" end="00:21:56.720" style="s2">own organization</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.640" end="00:21:57.919" style="s2">we have multiple locations and so each</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.720" end="00:21:59.120" style="s2">of those has a hierarchy and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.919" end="00:22:00.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a hierarchy of the overall</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.120" end="00:22:02.720" style="s2">organizations</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.080" end="00:22:03.200" style="s2">and i&#39;ve got basically a power map in my</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.720" end="00:22:05.360" style="s2">head</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.200" end="00:22:06.320" style="s2">of how those are related but then i also</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.360" end="00:22:08.960" style="s2">make these maps</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.320" end="00:22:10.080" style="s2">in my head for for other organizations</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.960" end="00:22:12.720" style="s2">that i&#39;m working with say</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.080" end="00:22:14.240" style="s2">peter invites me to the stoa you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.720" end="00:22:15.280" style="s2">that&#39;s like a separate organization that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.240" end="00:22:17.039" style="s2">i&#39;m not part of but</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.280" end="00:22:18.240" style="s2">he wants me to be part of it that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.039" end="00:22:19.120" style="s2">kind of thing where it might be useful</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.240" end="00:22:21.440" style="s2">for me to</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.120" end="00:22:22.480" style="s2">make a map either in my head or</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.440" end="00:22:25.760" style="s2">explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.480" end="00:22:27.600" style="s2">of what the power structures are there</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.760" end="00:22:29.200" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the context that i</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.600" end="00:22:32.320" style="s2">invented borea mapping in</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.200" end="00:22:33.919" style="s2">uh this is kind of combining samo&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.320" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">empire theory with</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.919" end="00:22:39.360" style="s2">simon wordley&#39;s worldly mapping uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.120" end="00:22:40.559" style="s2">basically making a visual representation</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:42.000" style="s2">of hierarchies and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.559" end="00:22:43.919" style="s2">something you can read more about after</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.000" end="00:22:45.600" style="s2">this uh talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.919" end="00:22:47.360" style="s2">but the idea is that there are these</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.600" end="00:22:49.760" style="s2">different power classes</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.360" end="00:22:51.679" style="s2">uh high mid low and then also out so in</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.760" end="00:22:53.360" style="s2">the example of the stoa i would be</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.679" end="00:22:55.280" style="s2">out with respect to the stoa because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.360" end="00:22:56.799" style="s2">not in the organization officially but</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.280" end="00:22:59.360" style="s2">i&#39;m still connected to it</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.799" end="00:22:59.840" style="s2">and then there&#39;s uh live and dead</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.360" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">players</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:03.120" style="s2">people who are they&#39;re not literally</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:06.720" style="s2">alive or dead</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.120" end="00:23:07.919" style="s2">but this is what i call vitality so</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.720" end="00:23:09.760" style="s2">some people are just following an</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.919" end="00:23:10.559" style="s2">existing script and some people are</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.760" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">doing things</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.559" end="00:23:14.559" style="s2">that are novel and in a totally new way</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:16.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.559" end="00:23:18.640" style="s2">live or dead so in this case the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.640" end="00:23:21.600" style="s2">engineer who technically has</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.640" end="00:23:22.559" style="s2">low power is a live player who&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.600" end="00:23:23.919" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.559" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">in a new way that hasn&#39;t been done</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.919" end="00:23:26.799" style="s2">before whereas the ceo and the hr</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:29.679" style="s2">department</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.799" end="00:23:30.960" style="s2">are you know doing the normal day-to-day</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.679" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">things that they&#39;ve always done for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.960" end="00:23:32.880" style="s2">last decade</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:34.480" style="s2">even though the engineer is doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.880" end="00:23:36.159" style="s2">something totally new and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.480" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">actually a form of power in itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:39.280" style="s2">even if you&#39;re low in the official</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.840" end="00:23:42.799" style="s2">hierarchy you can have</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.280" end="00:23:45.760" style="s2">uh a lot of power in terms of the skills</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.799" end="00:23:47.200" style="s2">that you have or how you&#39;re doing things</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.760" end="00:23:50.159" style="s2">and then there&#39;s actually a third axis</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.200" end="00:23:53.360" style="s2">here the uh you can see different colors</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.159" end="00:23:54.000" style="s2">so uh the green is like who you are</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.360" end="00:23:55.600" style="s2">aligned</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.000" end="00:23:57.360" style="s2">allied with who you&#39;re working with who</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.600" end="00:23:58.559" style="s2">you have a good relationship with yellow</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.360" end="00:24:00.480" style="s2">is someone that&#39;s neutral</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.559" end="00:24:01.840" style="s2">and then the red is like an enemy you</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.480" end="00:24:03.840" style="s2">know they may not be trying to kill you</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.840" end="00:24:05.120" style="s2">but they might not be on your same team</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.840" end="00:24:06.480" style="s2">with respect to the things that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.120" end="00:24:07.120" style="s2">trying to accomplish and so you want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.480" end="00:24:08.559" style="s2">know that</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.120" end="00:24:10.080" style="s2">sometimes people are just going to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.559" end="00:24:10.960" style="s2">antagonistic to the things you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.080" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">to bring about</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.960" end="00:24:15.600" style="s2">and rather than being blind to that like</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.279" end="00:24:17.760" style="s2">oh you know we&#39;re all in this together</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.600" end="00:24:19.600" style="s2">uh you want to be aware if someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.760" end="00:24:20.159" style="s2">actively working against you or is just</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.600" end="00:24:22.080" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.159" end="00:24:23.520" style="s2">biased against it so that you can take</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.080" end="00:24:26.960" style="s2">that into account and</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.520" end="00:24:28.960" style="s2">uh act differently</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.960" end="00:24:30.559" style="s2">so this is sort of a simplistic one but</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.960" end="00:24:33.120" style="s2">here&#39;s another example of a boream app</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.559" end="00:24:35.360" style="s2">that&#39;s more complicated</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.120" end="00:24:36.240" style="s2">probably more realistic as well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.360" end="00:24:39.360" style="s2">based off of</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.240" end="00:24:41.279" style="s2">a chapter in simon&#39;s book uh called the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.360" end="00:24:43.840" style="s2">scenario he has this really lovely</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.279" end="00:24:44.880" style="s2">uh like exercise in his book that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.840" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">supposed to use</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.880" end="00:24:48.480" style="s2">to make a worldly map to see if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:50.159" style="s2">understand it and</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.480" end="00:24:52.080" style="s2">how also how what decisions you would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.159" end="00:24:53.840" style="s2">made you would make based off of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.080" end="00:24:56.880" style="s2">information that he gives you</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.840" end="00:24:59.919" style="s2">um but it&#39;s also a good chance to map</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.880" end="00:25:00.799" style="s2">uh social structures using this empire</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.919" end="00:25:03.360" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.799" end="00:25:04.880" style="s2">or borea mapping and so i made a map of</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.360" end="00:25:06.720" style="s2">that and this is more realistic because</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.880" end="00:25:08.720" style="s2">typically organizations have you know on</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.720" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">the order of like</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.720" end="00:25:11.919" style="s2">15 20 people or more or something like</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:14.000" style="s2">that and you&#39;ll see in this case</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.919" end="00:25:15.440" style="s2">some of these are like teams a digital</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.000" end="00:25:17.600" style="s2">team for example</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.440" end="00:25:19.760" style="s2">um sales team and so on and those can be</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.600" end="00:25:21.120" style="s2">treated as whole entities or in samos</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.760" end="00:25:25.279" style="s2">language empires</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.120" end="00:25:28.159" style="s2">for themselves so my suggestion is</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.279" end="00:25:29.520" style="s2">uh basically if you&#39;re working with a</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.159" end="00:25:31.039" style="s2">hierarchical power structure</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.520" end="00:25:33.600" style="s2">either your own organization or someone</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.039" end="00:25:37.200" style="s2">else&#39;s of course you want to be aware of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.600" end="00:25:38.640" style="s2">the official sanctioned org charts</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.200" end="00:25:40.559" style="s2">but you also want to have your own</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.640" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">mental understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.559" end="00:25:44.000" style="s2">the power dynamics in that organization</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:44.720" style="s2">again whether it&#39;s your own or someone</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.000" end="00:25:45.919" style="s2">else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.720" end="00:25:48.400" style="s2">that there are these different power</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.919" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">dynamics and you want to have a solid</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.400" end="00:25:52.000" style="s2">understanding of that and making your</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:53.360" style="s2">own kind of map can be helpful for that</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.000" end="00:25:54.080" style="s2">this is just the way that i make these</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.360" end="00:25:56.640" style="s2">maps but</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.080" end="00:25:57.600" style="s2">you can make your own drawing i mean uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.640" end="00:25:59.440" style="s2">we saw uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.600" end="00:26:01.039" style="s2">tom&#39;s drawing back here this is how he</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.440" end="00:26:02.400" style="s2">draws them out it doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.039" end="00:26:03.919" style="s2">how you draw them out you don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.400" end="00:26:05.440" style="s2">need to draw them out the idea is you</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.919" end="00:26:07.039" style="s2">just you want to have your own</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.440" end="00:26:08.799" style="s2">understanding of the power dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.039" end="00:26:10.400" style="s2">especially because these are constantly</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.799" end="00:26:12.480" style="s2">changing and certainly they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.400" end="00:26:13.919" style="s2">always reflective of the officially</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.480" end="00:26:17.279" style="s2">sanctioned</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.919" end="00:26:17.279" style="s2">power statements about power</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.960" end="00:26:25.279" style="s2">a lot of the things that people tend to</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.039" end="00:26:26.799" style="s2">do when they realize this is make a swot</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.279" end="00:26:28.880" style="s2">diagram</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.799" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">and there&#39;s this really lovely chapter</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.880" end="00:26:31.279" style="s2">in simon&#39;s book where he makes fun of</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:33.279" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.279" end="00:26:35.840" style="s2">he talks about the example of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.279" end="00:26:38.799" style="s2">mysticallys in</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.840" end="00:26:40.159" style="s2">what&#39;s now known as kinglionitis and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.799" end="00:26:41.760" style="s2">300 spartans</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.159" end="00:26:43.279" style="s2">uh he&#39;s making the point that where you</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.760" end="00:26:43.760" style="s2">choose a battle really matters and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.279" end="00:26:46.000" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.760" end="00:26:47.039" style="s2">they had this battle in the hot gates uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.000" end="00:26:50.240" style="s2">where the like</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.039" end="00:26:50.559" style="s2">300 or 4 000 greeks could fight against</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.240" end="00:26:52.960" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.559" end="00:26:54.480" style="s2">200 000 persians and because they picked</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.960" end="00:26:57.120" style="s2">that location to fight</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.480" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">it they had much higher success than</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.120" end="00:26:59.679" style="s2">they would have</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">otherwise and that&#39;s because simon&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.679" end="00:27:04.320" style="s2">claiming they had an actual map</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:04.960" style="s2">of the landscape um and so he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.320" end="00:27:08.720" style="s2">what if</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.960" end="00:27:10.559" style="s2">uh you know the mysticallys had said uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.720" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">no worries everyone i made a swat</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.559" end="00:27:14.799" style="s2">diagram uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:16.080" style="s2">instead of a map uh we&#39;re gonna be great</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.799" end="00:27:18.880" style="s2">these are our strengths these are</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.080" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">weaknesses now let&#39;s do battle</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.880" end="00:27:23.200" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of silly and this is the view</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:25.120" style="s2">that i&#39;d always had of swat diagrams</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.200" end="00:27:27.039" style="s2">they never really made sense to me why</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.120" end="00:27:28.960" style="s2">you would make them uh it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.039" end="00:27:30.960" style="s2">people have strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.960" end="00:27:32.880" style="s2">what are these opportunities what are</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.960" end="00:27:35.279" style="s2">these threats</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.880" end="00:27:36.960" style="s2">uh but i would say that in the context</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.279" end="00:27:39.200" style="s2">of something like your own</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.960" end="00:27:40.640" style="s2">understanding of the landscape of power</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.200" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a boream app or something</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.640" end="00:27:43.840" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:45.039" style="s2">then given that assuming you have that</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.840" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">as a prerequisite</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.039" end="00:27:49.120" style="s2">then a swot diagram starts to make a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:49.840" style="s2">of sense because you do have an actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.120" end="00:27:51.200" style="s2">good map</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.840" end="00:27:53.200" style="s2">of the social reality so if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.200" end="00:27:54.480" style="s2">juxtapose this sort of thing or this</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.200" end="00:27:56.960" style="s2">sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.480" end="00:27:57.840" style="s2">or this sort of thing with a swot</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.960" end="00:28:01.120" style="s2">diagram</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.840" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">then it starts to make sense so this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.120" end="00:28:04.320" style="s2">an example</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:06.799" style="s2">fake swot diagram that i made i actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.320" end="00:28:08.240" style="s2">like to use different terms for the last</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.799" end="00:28:09.919" style="s2">two because they sort of make more sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.240" end="00:28:11.679" style="s2">to me i talk about them in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.919" end="00:28:13.600" style="s2">objectives and traps</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.679" end="00:28:15.200" style="s2">so people have different strengths and</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.600" end="00:28:18.720" style="s2">weaknesses and you want to know</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.200" end="00:28:18.720" style="s2">what their strengths and weaknesses are</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.360" end="00:28:22.480" style="s2">but you also want to know what their</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.720" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">goals are or their objectives</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.480" end="00:28:26.640" style="s2">so this person joe who&#39;s in your</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.720" end="00:28:27.919" style="s2">organization as a fundraiser he has his</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.640" end="00:28:30.240" style="s2">own goals he wants to</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.919" end="00:28:31.360" style="s2">in this case increase his money and get</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.240" end="00:28:32.880" style="s2">a promotion</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.360" end="00:28:34.720" style="s2">he wants to increase his earnings as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.880" end="00:28:36.559" style="s2">fundraiser and make a promotion</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.720" end="00:28:38.399" style="s2">so he has his own personal goals that</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:39.919" style="s2">may or may not be related to the goals</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.399" end="00:28:40.880" style="s2">of the larger organization you want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.919" end="00:28:42.720" style="s2">know that</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.880" end="00:28:44.000" style="s2">and then you have traps you are</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.720" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">understand that you yourself</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.000" end="00:28:47.520" style="s2">also have strengths and weaknesses and</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.840" end="00:28:48.799" style="s2">so you have this inter-personal</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.520" end="00:28:52.399" style="s2">interrelational</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.799" end="00:28:54.000" style="s2">uh traps thing where it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.399" end="00:28:56.720" style="s2">given what i know about myself</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.000" end="00:28:57.440" style="s2">and given what i know about other people</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.720" end="00:28:59.039" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.440" end="00:29:00.960" style="s2">what are the possible traps that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.039" end="00:29:02.320" style="s2">could fall into what are the things that</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.960" end="00:29:04.960" style="s2">we could do that would be</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.320" end="00:29:05.520" style="s2">problematic um so in this case i was</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.960" end="00:29:07.760" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:08.640" style="s2">well because he&#39;s sort of aloof and</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.760" end="00:29:11.120" style="s2">impulsive</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.640" end="00:29:12.320" style="s2">he might not seek feedback when he needs</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.120" end="00:29:15.279" style="s2">it and he might</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.320" end="00:29:16.159" style="s2">resign if he feels isolated for long</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.279" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">periods of time</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.159" end="00:29:20.799" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of uh you know an extreme</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:22.640" style="s2">example that i just made up but</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.799" end="00:29:24.080" style="s2">you know when we have these</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.640" end="00:29:25.679" style="s2">relationships with people there are</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.080" end="00:29:27.520" style="s2">traps that we can fall into</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.679" end="00:29:28.640" style="s2">where you know you have your weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.520" end="00:29:29.919" style="s2">and they have their weaknesses and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.640" end="00:29:31.520" style="s2">those can combine</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.919" end="00:29:33.279" style="s2">in to create friction and you want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.520" end="00:29:36.159" style="s2">anticipate that</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.279" end="00:29:37.120" style="s2">rather than you know just stumbling into</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.159" end="00:29:40.799" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.120" end="00:29:41.440" style="s2">unknowingly um so the point here is if</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.799" end="00:29:43.520" style="s2">you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.440" end="00:29:45.840" style="s2">a landscape of power that you&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.520" end="00:29:48.240" style="s2">drawn out that you&#39;ve mapped out</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.840" end="00:29:49.120" style="s2">then it makes more sense to have a swot</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.240" end="00:29:51.200" style="s2">diagram where you</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.120" end="00:29:52.399" style="s2">kind of take stock of different people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.200" end="00:29:54.480" style="s2">strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.399" end="00:29:55.679" style="s2">also their goals and any traps that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.480" end="00:29:57.440" style="s2">might fall into</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.679" end="00:29:58.799" style="s2">and this is actually a similar point</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.440" end="00:30:00.880" style="s2">that simon makes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.799" end="00:30:01.919" style="s2">something like 18 chapters later in his</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.880" end="00:30:05.440" style="s2">book he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.919" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">oh let&#39;s make a swat diagram and he says</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.440" end="00:30:09.360" style="s2">swat isn&#39;t that the curse of simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:11.279" style="s2">management</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.360" end="00:30:12.880" style="s2">yes but it also has its uses</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.279" end="00:30:13.520" style="s2">particularly if we understand the</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.880" end="00:30:15.600" style="s2">landscape</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.520" end="00:30:16.880" style="s2">if we have a map in other words the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.600" end="00:30:18.240" style="s2">problem with swot isn&#39;t that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.880" end="00:30:20.159" style="s2">useless but instead that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.240" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">apply it to landscapes we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:24.799" style="s2">understand so in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:26.240" style="s2">if we have a map of social reality where</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.799" end="00:30:26.960" style="s2">we understand the different power</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.240" end="00:30:29.200" style="s2">dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.960" end="00:30:31.279" style="s2">and that is somewhat accurate not just</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.200" end="00:30:34.240" style="s2">giving in to the official org chart but</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.279" end="00:30:35.600" style="s2">sort of a more nuanced understanding</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.240" end="00:30:36.320" style="s2">then it makes sense to have a swap</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.600" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">diagram</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.320" end="00:30:39.840" style="s2">and you can actually make these not only</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:42.720" style="s2">for individual people but also</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.840" end="00:30:43.279" style="s2">teams or organizations as a whole so</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.720" end="00:30:44.720" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.279" end="00:30:46.320" style="s2">something you really need to be aware of</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.720" end="00:30:48.080" style="s2">is everyone</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.320" end="00:30:49.679" style="s2">both individuals and teams and</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.080" end="00:30:50.559" style="s2">organizations they all have strengths</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.679" end="00:30:51.760" style="s2">and weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.559" end="00:30:53.840" style="s2">i personally have strengths and</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.760" end="00:30:54.720" style="s2">weaknesses you personally have strengths</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.840" end="00:30:56.880" style="s2">and weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.720" end="00:30:57.840" style="s2">you know the monastery has strengths and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.880" end="00:31:00.159" style="s2">weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.840" end="00:31:00.960" style="s2">maybe willow and oak are california</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.159" end="00:31:02.640" style="s2">location and</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.960" end="00:31:04.080" style="s2">canada locations maybe they have</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.640" end="00:31:05.840" style="s2">different strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.080" end="00:31:07.360" style="s2">maybe the stoa has different strengths</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.840" end="00:31:08.159" style="s2">and weaknesses we all have different</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.360" end="00:31:09.679" style="s2">goals</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.159" end="00:31:11.840" style="s2">and we have different traps that we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.679" end="00:31:13.039" style="s2">fall into interrelationally so you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.840" end="00:31:16.080" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.039" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">map this out at any scope of attention</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.080" end="00:31:18.559" style="s2">that you want</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.720" end="00:31:20.159" style="s2">i could make a map just of our</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.559" end="00:31:23.120" style="s2">california location or</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.159" end="00:31:24.720" style="s2">of our national organization as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.120" end="00:31:27.039" style="s2">i could make a map of the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:28.720" style="s2">i could make a map of any organization</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.039" end="00:31:31.039" style="s2">google facebook whatever</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.720" end="00:31:32.240" style="s2">and you can do that at any scale and all</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.039" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">of those are going to have</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.240" end="00:31:35.279" style="s2">strengths weaknesses objectives or goals</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:37.519" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.279" end="00:31:38.399" style="s2">traps that you could fall into in</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.519" end="00:31:41.919" style="s2">relation</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.399" end="00:31:41.919" style="s2">with those different scales</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.559" end="00:31:48.240" style="s2">so one of the really nice things about</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.480" end="00:31:51.600" style="s2">alliances is that you can have</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.240" end="00:31:53.679" style="s2">uh very blunt conversations whenever i</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.600" end="00:31:55.039" style="s2">talk to my allies</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.679" end="00:31:56.880" style="s2">we just have these very frank</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.039" end="00:31:59.840" style="s2">conversations that aren&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.880" end="00:32:00.880" style="s2">uh necessarily like socially sanctioned</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.840" end="00:32:03.600" style="s2">if you just have</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.880" end="00:32:04.240" style="s2">like chat over coffee and you know for</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.600" end="00:32:06.559" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.240" end="00:32:08.159" style="s2">the basic question is what do you need</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.559" end="00:32:10.080" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.159" end="00:32:10.960" style="s2">typically my allies will really need</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.080" end="00:32:11.840" style="s2">something there&#39;s something they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.960" end="00:32:13.360" style="s2">bottlenecked on</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.840" end="00:32:15.120" style="s2">and i want to know what that is in case</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.360" end="00:32:16.880" style="s2">i&#39;m suddenly able to</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.120" end="00:32:18.799" style="s2">provide that to them that i might not be</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.880" end="00:32:20.240" style="s2">able to often i&#39;m not but if i know</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.799" end="00:32:22.399" style="s2">about it then that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.240" end="00:32:23.840" style="s2">step to being able to realize that i</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.399" end="00:32:24.559" style="s2">want to have this kind of situational</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.840" end="00:32:26.399" style="s2">awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.559" end="00:32:27.679" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing what&#39;s going well</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.399" end="00:32:29.039" style="s2">what&#39;s not going well what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.679" end="00:32:30.640" style="s2">challenges are they facing</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.240" end="00:32:35.600" style="s2">and if i know all of those things then i</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.399" end="00:32:37.760" style="s2">might be able to help</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.600" end="00:32:39.360" style="s2">and similarly i want other people to</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.760" end="00:32:41.120" style="s2">know what&#39;s going on with me and</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.360" end="00:32:42.480" style="s2">my goals and my or you know what&#39;s going</p>

<p begin="00:32:42.480" end="00:32:46.000" style="s2">and have that situational awareness into</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.159" end="00:32:46.960" style="s2">what i&#39;m doing so that if they suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.000" end="00:32:50.480" style="s2">have the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.960" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2">to help me then they will help me</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.480" end="00:32:54.960" style="s2">you know so for our organization this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:56.159" style="s2">this is a diagram that i made of what i</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.960" end="00:32:58.320" style="s2">think we need</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.159" end="00:33:00.000" style="s2">monasteries have the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.320" end="00:33:02.880" style="s2">create these trustworthy leaders</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.000" end="00:33:04.000" style="s2">these trustworthy communities culture</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.880" end="00:33:06.960" style="s2">economy and</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.000" end="00:33:08.640" style="s2">ultimately a trustworthy humanity but</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.960" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">all of that is only possible if we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.640" end="00:33:13.200" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:15.120" style="s2">land and people and specifically uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.200" end="00:33:16.320" style="s2">right now we&#39;re doing pretty well on</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.120" end="00:33:19.039" style="s2">people we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.320" end="00:33:19.600" style="s2">a lot of interest we&#39;re doing okay on</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.039" end="00:33:22.240" style="s2">land</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.600" end="00:33:24.559" style="s2">we&#39;re hoping to move in california to a</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.240" end="00:33:26.000" style="s2">new location</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.559" end="00:33:28.480" style="s2">but the main thing that we seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.000" end="00:33:30.880" style="s2">bottlenecked on both at our individual</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.480" end="00:33:31.919" style="s2">locations and also as our organization</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.880" end="00:33:33.679" style="s2">as whole is money</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.919" end="00:33:35.360" style="s2">and so with my allies i can just frankly</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.679" end="00:33:35.919" style="s2">say look we&#39;re trying to raise this much</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.360" end="00:33:37.919" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.919" end="00:33:39.440" style="s2">for these reasons uh do you know anyone</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.919" end="00:33:41.600" style="s2">that would help and maybe they do</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:43.519" style="s2">and maybe they don&#39;t but at least i can</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.600" end="00:33:44.880" style="s2">talk to them very frankly about it and</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.519" end="00:33:46.880" style="s2">you know often they&#39;re able to connect</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.880" end="00:33:48.720" style="s2">me with people who might want to give us</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.880" end="00:33:50.240" style="s2">money or might want to give us land or</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.720" end="00:33:52.000" style="s2">might know someone who wants to join the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.240" end="00:33:52.799" style="s2">monastery or something like that and if</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.000" end="00:33:54.480" style="s2">i can just speak</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.799" end="00:33:56.240" style="s2">bluntly about that with them then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.480" end="00:33:59.600" style="s2">more likely that it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.240" end="00:34:01.279" style="s2">happen and they can speak similarly</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.600" end="00:34:02.880" style="s2">bluntly with me you know they can say</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.279" end="00:34:04.880" style="s2">oh we&#39;re having this problem in our</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.880" end="00:34:06.399" style="s2">engineering team and we&#39;re switching to</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.880" end="00:34:07.279" style="s2">this new technology and i don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.399" end="00:34:08.720" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.279" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">it but we need more people that</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.720" end="00:34:11.839" style="s2">understand this and</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:13.359" style="s2">then i might meet someone who knows</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.839" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">about that and is actually looking for a</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.359" end="00:34:16.000" style="s2">job</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:17.359" style="s2">and i can connect them and so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.000" end="00:34:19.839" style="s2">guarantee that you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.359" end="00:34:21.359" style="s2">get what you need but if if having an</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.839" end="00:34:22.480" style="s2">alliance like this or even many</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.359" end="00:34:24.720" style="s2">alliances like this</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.480" end="00:34:26.079" style="s2">a strong network of alliances indeed is</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.720" end="00:34:28.320" style="s2">the conditions for</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.079" end="00:34:29.520" style="s2">good consequences to arise for someone</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.320" end="00:34:32.399" style="s2">someone will kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.520" end="00:34:33.280" style="s2">uh benefit from having these uh this</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.399" end="00:34:35.040" style="s2">awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.280" end="00:34:45.119" style="s2">who your alliances are and what they</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.040" end="00:34:45.119" style="s2">need and what&#39;s happening for them</p>
