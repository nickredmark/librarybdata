<p begin="00:02:09.149" end="00:02:17.130" style="s2">customary to introduce the speaker as if</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.630" end="00:02:19.760" style="s2">you know me better than him but and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.130" end="00:02:22.739" style="s2">usually when someone is being introduced</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:26.099" style="s2">people tell things about him things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.739" end="00:02:27.540" style="s2">are true about that speaker now of</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.099" end="00:02:31.950" style="s2">course you&#39;ve all come here because you</p>

<p begin="00:02:42.840" end="00:02:50.819" style="s2">things that are wrong about him so these</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.599" end="00:02:55.470" style="s2">are actual things that have been said</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.819" end="00:02:58.980" style="s2">about him in media mostly in hit pieces</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.470" end="00:03:02.280" style="s2">and you know character assassination</p>

<p begin="00:06:01.080" end="00:06:06.120" style="s2">gonna theorize about exactly what that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.210" end="00:06:09.690" style="s2">is because there are lots of theories</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.120" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">about exactly what it is in what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.690" end="00:06:14.430" style="s2">saying that is threatening and and to</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:18.199" style="s2">whom it is threatening and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.430" end="00:06:21.930" style="s2">actually many of them are correct but</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.199" end="00:06:23.340" style="s2">let&#39;s just listen to him and let&#39;s hear</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.930" end="00:06:25.680" style="s2">what he has to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.340" end="00:06:30.710" style="s2">and we&#39;ll figure out why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.680" end="00:06:35.250" style="s2">threatening later so please give a warm</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.710" end="00:06:45.360" style="s2">welcome to dr. Jordan B Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.250" end="00:06:45.360" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.060" end="00:07:28.199" style="s2">well that&#39;s an introduction that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.289" end="00:07:36.240" style="s2">going to have to live up to so I was mmm</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.199" end="00:07:38.280" style="s2">thinking the other day about numbers you</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.240" end="00:07:41.129" style="s2">know there are mathematicians who think</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.280" end="00:07:43.800" style="s2">that there isn&#39;t anything more real than</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.129" end="00:07:48.030" style="s2">numbers and that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.800" end="00:07:51.300" style="s2">proposition I mean it&#39;s obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.030" end="00:07:56.159" style="s2">case that once you invent or discover</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.300" end="00:07:59.400" style="s2">numbers that that confers on you a</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.159" end="00:08:03.810" style="s2">tremendous power and who knows the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.400" end="00:08:05.969" style="s2">limits of that power and the claim that</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.810" end="00:08:08.879" style="s2">numbers are more real than anything else</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.969" end="00:08:11.069" style="s2">is predicated in part on the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.879" end="00:08:13.050" style="s2">when you discover them or invent them</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.069" end="00:08:17.659" style="s2">and start to utilize them that your</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.050" end="00:08:21.300" style="s2">ability to operate in the world expands</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.659" end="00:08:22.830" style="s2">immensely and and so that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.300" end="00:08:26.069" style="s2">ways of judging whether or not something</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.830" end="00:08:29.699" style="s2">is real is whether or not when you use</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.069" end="00:08:33.649" style="s2">it that facilitates your means of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.699" end="00:08:37.949" style="s2">operating in the world interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.649" end="00:08:43.010" style="s2">numbers are abstractions and so that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.949" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">raises another question which is well</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.010" end="00:08:52.680" style="s2">what&#39;s more real the thing that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.440" end="00:08:56.010" style="s2">abstracted from or the abstractions and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.680" end="00:08:57.690" style="s2">again that&#39;s not obvious and maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.010" end="00:09:00.060" style="s2">question of more real isn&#39;t germane</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.690" end="00:09:02.130" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s a question of equal reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.060" end="00:09:04.380" style="s2">but it&#39;s not obvious that abstractions</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.130" end="00:09:06.149" style="s2">aren&#39;t real and you can make a damn</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.380" end="00:09:08.399" style="s2">strong case that they&#39;re more real than</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.149" end="00:09:11.220" style="s2">anything else and so then you might ask</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.399" end="00:09:15.060" style="s2">yourself well then what are the most</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.220" end="00:09:17.880" style="s2">real abstractions and so that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.060" end="00:09:20.069" style="s2">going to start to talk about tonight I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.880" end="00:09:23.959" style="s2">going to talk about it in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.069" end="00:09:23.959" style="s2">to as many rules as I can</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.319" end="00:09:29.550" style="s2">lay out simultaneously I&#39;ll go through</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.439" end="00:09:33.240" style="s2">the rules first</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.550" end="00:09:38.040" style="s2">so rule 1 is stand up straight with your</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.240" end="00:09:41.279" style="s2">shoulders back and rule 2 is treat</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.040" end="00:09:44.490" style="s2">yourself like you&#39;re someone responsible</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.279" end="00:09:46.860" style="s2">for helping on number 3 which is very</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.490" end="00:09:49.259" style="s2">tightly associated with number 2 they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.860" end="00:09:51.300" style="s2">sort of variations on a theme is make</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.259" end="00:09:54.720" style="s2">friends with those people who want the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.300" end="00:09:57.420" style="s2">best for you and by the way these last</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.720" end="00:09:59.819" style="s2">two rules aren&#39;t injunctions designed to</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.420" end="00:10:01.230" style="s2">make your life easier they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.819" end="00:10:05.040" style="s2">injunctions designed to make your life</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.230" end="00:10:07.499" style="s2">more difficult Kierkegaard said at one</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.040" end="00:10:09.689" style="s2">point that his role in life given that</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.499" end="00:10:11.999" style="s2">everything was proceeding to become</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.689" end="00:10:14.129" style="s2">easier and easier in all possible ways</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.999" end="00:10:16.620" style="s2">that there would come a time when people</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.129" end="00:10:18.809" style="s2">would cry out for difficulty and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.620" end="00:10:21.839" style="s2">that&#39;s partly how he envisioned his role</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.809" end="00:10:24.540" style="s2">in the world interestingly enough as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.839" end="00:10:26.430" style="s2">universal benefactor of mankind who</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.540" end="00:10:28.680" style="s2">would strive to do nothing other than to</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.430" end="00:10:31.199" style="s2">make life more difficult for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.680" end="00:10:34.230" style="s2">right and so rule two and three are like</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.199" end="00:10:36.209" style="s2">that because treat yourself as if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.230" end="00:10:38.910" style="s2">someone responsible for helping isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.209" end="00:10:41.459" style="s2">the same as be nice to yourself it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.910" end="00:10:43.559" style="s2">that and to associate with people who</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.459" end="00:10:45.809" style="s2">want the best for you means that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.559" end="00:10:49.759" style="s2">get to demand the best from you and</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.809" end="00:10:52.050" style="s2">that&#39;s also not an easy thing rule 4 is</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.759" end="00:10:54.389" style="s2">compare yourself to who you were</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.050" end="00:10:56.370" style="s2">yesterday and not to who someone else is</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.389" end="00:11:00.809" style="s2">today and that&#39;s an injunction about</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.370" end="00:11:03.120" style="s2">envy right it&#39;s easy you need people who</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.809" end="00:11:05.040" style="s2">you need things that are above you</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.120" end="00:11:06.449" style="s2">because you need to do something</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.040" end="00:11:08.100" style="s2">worthwhile with your life you need</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.449" end="00:11:10.649" style="s2">something to aim at but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.100" end="00:11:12.240" style="s2">consequences of that is that you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.649" end="00:11:14.939" style="s2">become envious of people that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:17.189" style="s2">believe have attained more in a deserve</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.939" end="00:11:19.110" style="s2">adore undeserved manner and that can</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.189" end="00:11:21.720" style="s2">make you bitter and so it&#39;s much better</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.110" end="00:11:23.480" style="s2">to compare yourself to yourself and to</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.720" end="00:11:26.339" style="s2">use yourself as the target for</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.480" end="00:11:28.079" style="s2">improvement in comparison rule 5 is</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.339" end="00:11:30.149" style="s2">don&#39;t let your children do anything that</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.079" end="00:11:32.819" style="s2">makes you dislike them and the rule of</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.149" end="00:11:36.270" style="s2">thumb there is if you dislike them then</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.819" end="00:11:38.460" style="s2">other people will and it&#39;s a bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.270" end="00:11:40.860" style="s2">to allow your children to act in a way</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.460" end="00:11:43.830" style="s2">that makes other children dislike them</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.860" end="00:11:44.790" style="s2">or adults dislike them given that</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.830" end="00:11:46.500" style="s2">they&#39;re going to have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.790" end="00:11:48.510" style="s2">children and they&#39;re going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.500" end="00:11:51.750" style="s2">deal with adults so your primary</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.510" end="00:11:53.540" style="s2">responsibility as a parent is to help</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.750" end="00:11:57.300" style="s2">your child learn how to behave so that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.540" end="00:11:59.880" style="s2">the social world opens up its arms to</p>

<p begin="00:11:59.880" end="00:12:04.200" style="s2">and you&#39;ve done your job if you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.430" end="00:12:04.620" style="s2">manage that and it&#39;s not a simple thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.200" end="00:12:07.740" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.620" end="00:12:10.380" style="s2">rule six is put your house in perfect</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.740" end="00:12:15.840" style="s2">order before you criticize the world and</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.380" end="00:12:17.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not take no action for others</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.840" end="00:12:21.110" style="s2">until you have your act together that</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.880" end="00:12:24.590" style="s2">isn&#39;t what the rule means it means that</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.110" end="00:12:27.720" style="s2">bind your ambition with humility and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.590" end="00:12:29.910" style="s2">work on what&#39;s right in front of you</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.720" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">that you will suffer for if you get</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.910" end="00:12:35.160" style="s2">wrong before you engage in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:39.150" style="s2">large-scale transformation of other</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.160" end="00:12:42.300" style="s2">people rule seven is do what is</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.150" end="00:12:46.020" style="s2">meaningful and not what is expedient and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.300" end="00:12:50.880" style="s2">I would say in some sense in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.020" end="00:12:52.860" style="s2">that&#39;s the core ethos of the book not</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.880" end="00:12:54.660" style="s2">exactly because rule eight which is tell</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.860" end="00:12:57.750" style="s2">the truth or at least don&#39;t lie is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.660" end="00:13:00.270" style="s2">necessary conjunction to that or a</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.750" end="00:13:01.980" style="s2">necessary additional element because I</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.270" end="00:13:04.350" style="s2">don&#39;t think that you can pursue what is</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.980" end="00:13:06.270" style="s2">meaningful without telling the truth and</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.350" end="00:13:08.040" style="s2">the reason for that is if you don&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.270" end="00:13:09.780" style="s2">the truth or let&#39;s say if you lie which</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.040" end="00:13:12.630" style="s2">is an easier way to think about it you</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.780" end="00:13:15.960" style="s2">corrupt the mechanisms the instinctual</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.630" end="00:13:18.360" style="s2">mechanisms that that that manifest</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.960" end="00:13:21.180" style="s2">themselves as meaning and then you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.360" end="00:13:25.050" style="s2">trust them and that&#39;s a very bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.180" end="00:13:27.270" style="s2">so the fundamental reason to not lie is</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.050" end="00:13:29.310" style="s2">because you corrupt your own perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.270" end="00:13:31.020" style="s2">if you lie and when you corrupt your own</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.310" end="00:13:32.880" style="s2">perceptions then you can&#39;t rely on</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.020" end="00:13:34.890" style="s2">yourself and if you can&#39;t rely on</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.880" end="00:13:37.560" style="s2">yourself then well good luck to you</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.890" end="00:13:40.140" style="s2">because what are you going to rely on in</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.560" end="00:13:42.600" style="s2">the absence of your own judgment here</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.140" end="00:13:49.200" style="s2">you&#39;ve got nothing if you if you lose</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.600" end="00:13:50.160" style="s2">that rule rule eight is as I said tell</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.200" end="00:13:54.180" style="s2">the truth they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.160" end="00:13:55.290" style="s2">or at least don&#39;t lie rule 9 assume that</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.180" end="00:13:57.110" style="s2">the person that you&#39;re listening to</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.290" end="00:13:59.250" style="s2">knows something you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.110" end="00:14:01.890" style="s2">and that&#39;s not so much a mark of respect</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.250" end="00:14:03.860" style="s2">for the person although it is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.890" end="00:14:06.750" style="s2">a mark of recognition of your own</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.860" end="00:14:09.570" style="s2">unbearable ignorance you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.750" end="00:14:13.560" style="s2">things you have to do in life is decide</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.570" end="00:14:17.130" style="s2">whether you&#39;re more you have to make</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.560" end="00:14:20.340" style="s2">friends more with let me see let me just</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.130" end="00:14:22.710" style="s2">let me rephrase that properly you have</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.340" end="00:14:25.590" style="s2">to decide what&#39;s more important what you</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.710" end="00:14:27.350" style="s2">know or what you don&#39;t know first of all</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.590" end="00:14:30.630" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of what you don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.350" end="00:14:32.700" style="s2">so if you make friends with that if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.630" end="00:14:34.020" style="s2">decide that&#39;s important then well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.700" end="00:14:35.730" style="s2">a good thing because you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.020" end="00:14:37.560" style="s2">surrounded by what you don&#39;t know your</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.730" end="00:14:39.690" style="s2">entire life and so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.560" end="00:14:42.800" style="s2">appreciative of that then that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.690" end="00:14:46.710" style="s2">to make things go better for you but but</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.800" end="00:14:49.380" style="s2">the other element of that is well why</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.710" end="00:14:50.880" style="s2">should you be appreciative of what you</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.380" end="00:14:52.710" style="s2">don&#39;t know and answer to that is well</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.880" end="00:14:55.680" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t if your life is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.710" end="00:14:58.320" style="s2">perfect in every way you have exactly</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.680" end="00:14:59.940" style="s2">what you need and want you&#39;ve put</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.320" end="00:15:01.470" style="s2">everything in order around you then what</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.940" end="00:15:04.770" style="s2">you know is sufficient but if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.470" end="00:15:06.960" style="s2">believe that things could still be put</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.770" end="00:15:09.210" style="s2">right around you in your own personal</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.960" end="00:15:10.950" style="s2">life and with regard to the effect that</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.210" end="00:15:12.750" style="s2">you have on other people then obviously</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.950" end="00:15:14.220" style="s2">what you don&#39;t yet know is more</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.750" end="00:15:16.650" style="s2">important than what you do know and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.220" end="00:15:18.450" style="s2">should be paying attention to find out</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.650" end="00:15:20.700" style="s2">what you don&#39;t know at every possible</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.450" end="00:15:22.110" style="s2">moment and if you&#39;re fortunate when you</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.700" end="00:15:24.840" style="s2">have a conversation with someone and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.110" end="00:15:27.780" style="s2">you&#39;re actually interested in what they</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.840" end="00:15:29.580" style="s2">say then even if they&#39;re not very good</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.780" end="00:15:31.590" style="s2">at communicating even if they&#39;re awkward</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.580" end="00:15:33.990" style="s2">or even if they display a certain amount</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.590" end="00:15:36.030" style="s2">of enmity towards you there&#39;s always the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.990" end="00:15:38.190" style="s2">possibility that they might tell you</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.030" end="00:15:39.620" style="s2">something you don&#39;t know in which case</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.190" end="00:15:43.230" style="s2">you can walk away from the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.620" end="00:15:45.840" style="s2">less ignorant and corrupt than you were</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.230" end="00:15:47.460" style="s2">when you started the conversation and if</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.840" end="00:15:49.680" style="s2">your life isn&#39;t everything that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.460" end="00:15:52.080" style="s2">would like it to be then being slightly</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.680" end="00:15:56.430" style="s2">less ignorant and corrupt is probably a</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.080" end="00:15:59.339" style="s2">good thing and so rule 10 is be precise</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.430" end="00:16:01.800" style="s2">in your speech and that&#39;s that&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:16:03.510" end="00:16:08.370" style="s2">of a New Testament injunction which is</p>

<p begin="00:16:13.310" end="00:16:20.340" style="s2">which is a very strange theory let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.610" end="00:16:22.740" style="s2">but which I would say is far more in</p>

<p begin="00:16:25.650" end="00:16:35.270" style="s2">you might imagine because it is the case</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.890" end="00:16:38.130" style="s2">that you don&#39;t get what you don&#39;t aim at</p>

<p begin="00:16:52.650" end="00:16:55.770" style="s2">you radically increase the probability</p>

<p begin="00:16:55.770" end="00:16:59.910" style="s2">course you all know that because you</p>

<p begin="00:17:09.420" end="00:17:13.920" style="s2">yourself is that you wake up in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.940" end="00:17:16.470" style="s2">morning and you have a landscape of</p>

<p begin="00:19:01.440" end="00:19:05.910" style="s2">people but long term it&#39;s it&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.590" end="00:19:08.430" style="s2">in the least and of course other people</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.910" end="00:19:09.780" style="s2">don&#39;t appreciate it as well rule 11 is</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.430" end="00:19:12.480" style="s2">don&#39;t bother children when they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.480" end="00:19:18.570" style="s2">discussion of courage of encouragement</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.060" end="00:19:20.700" style="s2">more specifically because I&#39;ve I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.570" end="00:19:23.310" style="s2">trying to understand for example what</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.700" end="00:19:25.140" style="s2">role parents play in the lives of their</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.310" end="00:19:27.780" style="s2">children and I would say this is a role</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.140" end="00:19:30.900" style="s2">that that that is of fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.780" end="00:19:33.510" style="s2">importance as well as attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.900" end="00:19:35.790" style="s2">guide your children so that they act in</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.510" end="00:19:38.550" style="s2">a socially desirable manner so that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.790" end="00:19:41.310" style="s2">world opens itself up to them you also</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.550" end="00:19:43.710" style="s2">want to encourage them which is not the</p>

<p begin="00:19:43.710" end="00:19:48.450" style="s2">same at all and to encourage someone is</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.170" end="00:19:53.190" style="s2">to say something like or to act out</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.450" end="00:19:54.840" style="s2">something like look kid as you the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.190" end="00:19:56.430" style="s2">world&#39;s already difficult because the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.840" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">world isn&#39;t easy for children any more</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.430" end="00:20:00.000" style="s2">than it&#39;s easy for adults that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:01.890" style="s2">difficulties are they&#39;re not the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.000" end="00:20:04.740" style="s2">they&#39;re child size difficulties but</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.890" end="00:20:07.920" style="s2">they&#39;re still difficulties the world is</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.740" end="00:20:10.260" style="s2">a very hard place and it&#39;s a bitter</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.920" end="00:20:12.270" style="s2">place in many ways and it&#39;s not only a</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.260" end="00:20:14.640" style="s2">hard and bitter place it&#39;s also touched</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.270" end="00:20:17.880" style="s2">with betrayal and malevolence and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.640" end="00:20:20.780" style="s2">the fundamental bottom line but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.880" end="00:20:24.210" style="s2">something in you that is capable of</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.780" end="00:20:28.190" style="s2">taking that full-on and transcending it</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.210" end="00:20:30.860" style="s2">and that&#39;s encouragement you say well as</p>

<p begin="00:20:30.860" end="00:20:36.060" style="s2">you&#39;re up to the challenge and to</p>

<p begin="00:20:41.400" end="00:20:46.170" style="s2">things which kids of course do if</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.260" end="00:20:49.760" style="s2">they&#39;re skateboarding to interfere with</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.170" end="00:20:52.470" style="s2">that is to interfere with the child&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.760" end="00:20:54.840" style="s2">willingness to voluntarily expose</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.470" end="00:20:57.660" style="s2">themselves to the risks that they need</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.840" end="00:20:59.820" style="s2">to expose themselves to in order to</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.660" end="00:21:02.220" style="s2">develop the sort of competence that</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.820" end="00:21:05.790" style="s2">allows them to thrive in a world they</p>

<p begin="00:21:05.790" end="00:21:11.460" style="s2">interfere with children when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.820" end="00:21:13.860" style="s2">taking necessary risks is not love or</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.460" end="00:21:16.230" style="s2">empathy but cowardice on the part of</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.860" end="00:21:17.850" style="s2">parents and it&#39;s deeply damaging to</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.230" end="00:21:20.460" style="s2">children and I can tell you as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.850" end="00:21:22.950" style="s2">clinical psychologist I&#39;ve never had a</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.460" end="00:21:26.040" style="s2">client come to my office in all the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.950" end="00:21:28.110" style="s2">hundreds in in in all the hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.040" end="00:21:31.140" style="s2">encounters I&#39;ve had with people in my</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.110" end="00:21:35.160" style="s2">office I&#39;ve never had a client say my</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.140" end="00:21:39.720" style="s2">parents made me too independent right</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.160" end="00:21:42.140" style="s2">that hasn&#39;t happened once right now my</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.720" end="00:21:45.930" style="s2">parents made me too dependent or I</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.140" end="00:21:49.550" style="s2">conspired with my parents to perpetuate</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.930" end="00:21:53.370" style="s2">my dependence that happened all the time</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.550" end="00:21:55.050" style="s2">so there&#39;s a rule of thumb which I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.370" end="00:21:57.450" style="s2">is a good one which I believe is often</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.050" end="00:21:59.040" style="s2">applied in nursing homes by people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.450" end="00:22:01.980" style="s2">work in nursing homes which is of course</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.040" end="00:22:04.020" style="s2">a very difficult job and the rule is do</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.980" end="00:22:06.540" style="s2">not do anything for anyone they can do</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.020" end="00:22:09.810" style="s2">for themselves and the reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.540" end="00:22:11.700" style="s2">is that it&#39;s a form of theft right you</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.810" end="00:22:13.950" style="s2">don&#39;t first of all if you if you do</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.700" end="00:22:15.990" style="s2">something for someone and it facilitates</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.950" end="00:22:19.290" style="s2">their movement forward then they moved</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.990" end="00:22:21.030" style="s2">forward because you helped them which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.290" end="00:22:22.530" style="s2">something I was very careful about as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.030" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">therapist I don&#39;t want to give my</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.530" end="00:22:28.740" style="s2">clients advice first it might fail in</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:32.040" style="s2">which case they are going to pay for my</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.740" end="00:22:34.800" style="s2">advice and second if it succeeds then I</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.040" end="00:22:36.570" style="s2">get to be the successful one and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.800" end="00:22:39.780" style="s2">want to steal the success from my</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.570" end="00:22:41.910" style="s2">clients that&#39;s a bad idea I want to help</p>

<p begin="00:23:53.460" end="00:23:59.700" style="s2">around in your car because why take</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.620" end="00:24:01.890" style="s2">foolhardy risks but given that there is</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.700" end="00:24:05.010" style="s2">no security in life in the final</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.890" end="00:24:09.410" style="s2">analysis then encouragement is a much</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.010" end="00:24:12.720" style="s2">better medication than sheltering and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.410" end="00:24:16.049" style="s2">and that&#39;s what that&#39;s that&#39;s I think in</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.720" end="00:24:18.960" style="s2">keeping with the idea that what life is</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.049" end="00:24:21.390" style="s2">essentially is not a place to attain</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.960" end="00:24:23.040" style="s2">happiness or even to aim for happiness</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.390" end="00:24:25.380" style="s2">even though you should be grateful if</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.040" end="00:24:28.559" style="s2">some comes along now and then but a call</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.380" end="00:24:30.059" style="s2">to something like adventure and I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.559" end="00:24:33.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the proper way of conceptualizing</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.059" end="00:24:35.280" style="s2">it certainly if you go watch a story a</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.000" end="00:24:37.679" style="s2">movie you read a book something like</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.280" end="00:24:40.500" style="s2">that if you encounter a narrative that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.679" end="00:24:43.260" style="s2">gripping whether it&#39;s a romance or a</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.500" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">classic adventure story then the element</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.260" end="00:24:47.700" style="s2">of it that&#39;s gripping is the adventure</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:50.730" style="s2">and so to portray life as an adventure</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.700" end="00:24:53.730" style="s2">in romance and and in the world is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.730" end="00:24:58.559" style="s2">proper way to portray it and the way</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.730" end="00:25:01.529" style="s2">that you facilitate the adventure is</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.559" end="00:25:03.299" style="s2">encouragement I had a client once I</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.529" end="00:25:06.629" style="s2">really liked him he was a good guy his</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.299" end="00:25:08.610" style="s2">smart guy good-looking young guy had</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.629" end="00:25:12.440" style="s2">everything going for him you know he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.610" end="00:25:12.440" style="s2">good musician he was a talented athlete</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.710" end="00:25:18.600" style="s2">but he hadn&#39;t been encouraged I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.269" end="00:25:22.230" style="s2">say he told me about his relationship</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.600" end="00:25:24.419" style="s2">with his girlfriend he said his</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.230" end="00:25:28.200" style="s2">girlfriend wanted to go biking around</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.419" end="00:25:31.049" style="s2">southern Ontario she was about 19 or 20</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.200" end="00:25:33.110" style="s2">and he thought he might join her and</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.049" end="00:25:35.909" style="s2">when she went and talked to her parents</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.110" end="00:25:38.909" style="s2">they made every provision possible to</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.909" end="00:25:40.499" style="s2">help her prepare for the journey to make</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.909" end="00:25:42.330" style="s2">sure her bike was in good shape to make</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.499" end="00:25:44.490" style="s2">sure she had the right equipment to help</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.330" end="00:25:45.960" style="s2">her plot out a route and when he went</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.490" end="00:25:47.509" style="s2">and talked to his parents all they did</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.960" end="00:25:50.840" style="s2">was worry that he was going to get hurt</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.509" end="00:25:55.289" style="s2">and like he might get hurt because</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.840" end="00:25:56.429" style="s2">people get hurt but they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.289" end="00:25:58.049" style="s2">understand that they were choosing</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.429" end="00:25:59.879" style="s2">between the hurt that he might encounter</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.049" end="00:26:01.710" style="s2">by going out in the world and having an</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.879" end="00:26:03.899" style="s2">adventure let&#39;s say with his girlfriend</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.710" end="00:26:06.330" style="s2">or the hurt that he would encounter by</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.899" end="00:26:09.240" style="s2">staying at home cowering in his basement</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.330" end="00:26:11.369" style="s2">under the protection of his over loving</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.240" end="00:26:13.559" style="s2">parents while his girlfriend ventured</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.369" end="00:26:15.149" style="s2">bravely into the world you think well</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.559" end="00:26:17.190" style="s2">which of those two things is most likely</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.149" end="00:26:19.440" style="s2">to be damaging and the answer to that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.190" end="00:26:22.080" style="s2">well his parents wouldn&#39;t worry as much</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.440" end="00:26:24.659" style="s2">as if he was in the basement and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.080" end="00:26:29.879" style="s2">the wrong worry even because they should</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.659" end="00:26:31.440" style="s2">worry more not less so in rule 12 is pet</p>

<p begin="00:27:20.730" end="00:27:26.130" style="s2">and when things are more out of control</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.860" end="00:27:28.170" style="s2">perhaps it&#39;s across days and when things</p>

<p begin="00:27:28.170" end="00:27:33.690" style="s2">the wall its acro across hours or even</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.720" end="00:27:35.910" style="s2">minutes and during those minutes then</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.690" end="00:27:37.650" style="s2">you concentrate on doing as well as you</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.910" end="00:27:40.050" style="s2">can with what&#39;s right in front of you</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.650" end="00:27:42.690" style="s2">for the longest unit of time that you</p>

<p begin="00:27:46.260" end="00:27:51.390" style="s2">suffering away madly then you also take</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.900" end="00:27:53.700" style="s2">the time to appreciate everything you</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.390" end="00:27:56.430" style="s2">can that manifests itself that allows</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.700" end="00:27:59.670" style="s2">itself to be appreciated and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.430" end="00:28:02.070" style="s2">the metaphor of the cat I suppose and so</p>

<p begin="00:28:04.080" end="00:28:08.550" style="s2">your shoulders back and I&#39;m going to use</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.640" end="00:28:10.950" style="s2">it as a platform for laying out the</p>

<p begin="00:28:10.950" end="00:28:16.770" style="s2">beginning of the lecture so some of you</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.970" end="00:28:19.800" style="s2">might be familiar with the central</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.770" end="00:28:23.310" style="s2">Taoist symbol and it&#39;s a symbol of Dow</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.800" end="00:28:26.040" style="s2">and Dow is a very strange word it</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.310" end="00:28:29.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have an easily translatable</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.040" end="00:28:31.440" style="s2">single meaning at least in English it</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.520" end="00:28:33.720" style="s2">means a variety of things that means the</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.440" end="00:28:35.640" style="s2">path of life so that would mean the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.720" end="00:28:37.230" style="s2">path that you take as you move forward</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.640" end="00:28:39.690" style="s2">through life but it would mean more also</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.230" end="00:28:42.480" style="s2">the proper path so it&#39;s that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.690" end="00:28:45.060" style="s2">proper path through life so the idea now</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.480" end="00:28:46.590" style="s2">is a symbol of reality and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.060" end="00:28:48.300" style="s2">things that means is the path you take</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.590" end="00:28:51.360" style="s2">through life and so there&#39;s an implicit</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.300" end="00:28:53.370" style="s2">idea there that the fundamental reality</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.360" end="00:28:56.070" style="s2">of life is the path you take through</p>

<p begin="00:28:59.010" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">while we&#39;re mobile creatures and we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:29:58.110" end="00:30:02.820" style="s2">make up reality and one can transform</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.750" end="00:30:06.090" style="s2">into the other at any moment and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.820" end="00:30:07.470" style="s2">that&#39;s the taoist idea of reality and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.090" end="00:30:09.810" style="s2">there&#39;s yin and yang and they make up</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.470" end="00:30:12.060" style="s2">the world and the question is perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.810" end="00:30:13.220" style="s2">our question is well what exactly does</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.060" end="00:30:16.230" style="s2">that mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.220" end="00:30:18.570" style="s2">well it actually means something it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.230" end="00:30:21.210" style="s2">kind of abstraction and it&#39;s actually an</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.570" end="00:30:24.120" style="s2">incredibly helpful abstraction once you</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.210" end="00:30:27.630" style="s2">understand the abstraction it might be</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.120" end="00:30:29.400" style="s2">the most real abstraction there is so</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.630" end="00:30:30.930" style="s2">I&#39;m going to lay out a little bit I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.400" end="00:30:33.420" style="s2">lay out for you a little bit about what</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.930" end="00:30:35.130" style="s2">these two domains refer to and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.420" end="00:30:37.530" style="s2">going to make a case that they&#39;re real</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.130" end="00:30:39.020" style="s2">and then I&#39;m going to tell you what it</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.530" end="00:30:47.100" style="s2">means that they&#39;re real</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.020" end="00:30:50.160" style="s2">so you could think of Yin as chaos now</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.100" end="00:30:52.260" style="s2">we need to know what chaos is no chaos</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.160" end="00:30:54.570" style="s2">is what God made the world out of at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.260" end="00:30:56.760" style="s2">beginning of time so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.570" end="00:30:59.970" style="s2">that chaos is is it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.760" end="00:31:01.920" style="s2">potential and so you can imagine and</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.970" end="00:31:03.330" style="s2">this is not how we think as modern</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.920" end="00:31:05.670" style="s2">people because we tend to think in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.330" end="00:31:08.570" style="s2">materialist way but it is how we act and</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.670" end="00:31:12.390" style="s2">as I said already you act as if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.570" end="00:31:14.670" style="s2">confront potential and you treat</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.390" end="00:31:17.670" style="s2">potential level as if it&#39;s real and if</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.670" end="00:31:19.800" style="s2">your attitude towards it confers on you</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.670" end="00:31:22.820" style="s2">a certain moral obligation which is why</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.800" end="00:31:25.440" style="s2">you know what people mean when they say</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.820" end="00:31:29.160" style="s2">you&#39;re not living up to your potential</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.440" end="00:31:31.650" style="s2">no one ever says well what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.160" end="00:31:33.150" style="s2">by potential not unless they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.650" end="00:31:36.450" style="s2">argumentative because you already know</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.150" end="00:31:38.790" style="s2">and very few people say while I&#39;m fully</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.450" end="00:31:39.640" style="s2">living up to my potential so you admit</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.790" end="00:31:42.820" style="s2">to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.640" end="00:31:44.790" style="s2">reality that undergirds that conception</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.820" end="00:31:48.940" style="s2">that makes that question a possibility</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.790" end="00:31:51.010" style="s2">immediately the potential is while</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.940" end="00:31:53.740" style="s2">potential is the future that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.010" end="00:31:55.780" style="s2">it and we believe in the future we</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.740" end="00:31:57.850" style="s2">believe that it exists even though it</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.780" end="00:32:01.300" style="s2">isn&#39;t here and it&#39;s not measurable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.850" end="00:32:03.700" style="s2">it only exists as a potential set of</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.300" end="00:32:05.260" style="s2">realizable possibilities that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.700" end="00:32:06.760" style="s2">future is and it&#39;s really what we</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.260" end="00:32:09.160" style="s2">contend with we don&#39;t really contend</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.760" end="00:32:10.870" style="s2">with the present precisely we orient</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.160" end="00:32:12.610" style="s2">ourselves towards the future and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.870" end="00:32:17.440" style="s2">future comes at us from every direction</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.610" end="00:32:19.030" style="s2">and we we decide as we encounter the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.440" end="00:32:21.390" style="s2">future which parts of it we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.030" end="00:32:23.950" style="s2">interact with and how we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.390" end="00:32:26.170" style="s2">construct the present and the past as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.950" end="00:32:28.840" style="s2">consequence of doing that and so part of</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.170" end="00:32:31.320" style="s2">chaos is potential and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.840" end="00:32:34.810" style="s2">positive part it&#39;s like if you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.320" end="00:32:36.220" style="s2">bind what you look for is potential is</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.810" end="00:32:40.750" style="s2">there another way of conceptualizing</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.220" end="00:32:43.000" style="s2">this do I have a different way of acting</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.750" end="00:32:44.530" style="s2">can I make another plan is there</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.000" end="00:32:46.660" style="s2">something that I&#39;m not taking into</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.530" end="00:32:48.880" style="s2">account that would make this terrible</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.660" end="00:32:52.660" style="s2">situation tolerable that&#39;s all an</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.880" end="00:32:55.450" style="s2">attempt to to call upon potential and to</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.660" end="00:32:58.180" style="s2">use it to transfigure a reality that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.450" end="00:32:59.440" style="s2">intolerable and maybe it&#39;s intolerable</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.180" end="00:33:01.650" style="s2">because of the way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.440" end="00:33:04.660" style="s2">conceptualizing it now I&#39;m not being</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.650" end="00:33:06.640" style="s2">naive about that I understand perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.660" end="00:33:09.100" style="s2">well that people can find themselves so</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.640" end="00:33:11.380" style="s2">badly cornered in life that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.100" end="00:33:14.050" style="s2">basically done no matter what they do</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.380" end="00:33:16.210" style="s2">people obviously develop fatal illnesses</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.050" end="00:33:18.400" style="s2">and and they die and and their</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.210" end="00:33:20.560" style="s2">businesses collapse and genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.400" end="00:33:24.430" style="s2">terrible things can happen to you that</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.560" end="00:33:26.530" style="s2">aren&#39;t your fault that you can&#39;t fix I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.430" end="00:33:28.270" style="s2">not saying that you can just gerrymander</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.530" end="00:33:29.560" style="s2">the world by changing your attitude it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.270" end="00:33:32.370" style="s2">not that straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.560" end="00:33:36.070" style="s2">but I am saying that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.370" end="00:33:37.960" style="s2">tremendous ability to transform the</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.070" end="00:33:39.790" style="s2">landscape of possibility that reveals</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.960" end="00:33:42.630" style="s2">itself in front of you and that when</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.790" end="00:33:45.040" style="s2">things are terrible that&#39;s your best bet</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.630" end="00:33:47.470" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean it will succeed</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.040" end="00:33:51.070" style="s2">it just means you don&#39;t have a better</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.470" end="00:33:53.290" style="s2">option and so chaos that potential is</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.070" end="00:33:55.750" style="s2">also something that manifests itself</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.290" end="00:33:57.190" style="s2">a terrible manner so imagine this this</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.750" end="00:33:59.440" style="s2">is a good way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.190" end="00:34:01.780" style="s2">it&#39;s imagine that you have a an intimate</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.440" end="00:34:06.550" style="s2">relationship let&#39;s let&#39;s say a marriage</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.780" end="00:34:09.429" style="s2">and the marriage is predicated on trust</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.550" end="00:34:14.020" style="s2">and fidelity which is a variant of trust</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.429" end="00:34:16.780" style="s2">and that the trust and fidelity is an</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.020" end="00:34:18.580" style="s2">axiom of your memories you might think</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.780" end="00:34:20.530" style="s2">well what does that mean it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.580" end="00:34:23.620" style="s2">let&#39;s play it out imagine you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.530" end="00:34:27.040" style="s2">married for 10 years and then your wife</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.620" end="00:34:29.410" style="s2">tells you that she has had three affairs</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.040" end="00:34:31.780" style="s2">each of them lasted three years and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.410" end="00:34:32.830" style="s2">last one has lasted five years and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.780" end="00:34:36.490" style="s2">still ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.830" end="00:34:40.110" style="s2">or maybe you discover that okay so then</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.490" end="00:34:42.610" style="s2">you might say well what happens then</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.110" end="00:34:45.520" style="s2">well what happens is that everything you</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.610" end="00:34:47.110" style="s2">thought was wrong right and this is such</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.520" end="00:34:50.440" style="s2">an interesting thing because it actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.110" end="00:34:53.590" style="s2">means you had the past and you think the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.440" end="00:34:55.900" style="s2">past is fixed it&#39;s done with that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.590" end="00:34:57.640" style="s2">it&#39;s the past but all of a sudden you</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.900" end="00:34:59.620" style="s2">find out that one of the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.640" end="00:35:02.110" style="s2">thought about the past and it happens to</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.620" end="00:35:04.660" style="s2">be a very important thing wasn&#39;t true at</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.110" end="00:35:06.630" style="s2">all and so what that means is that whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.660" end="00:35:09.880" style="s2">past that you thought was what it was</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.630" end="00:35:12.910" style="s2">wasn&#39;t what it was at all and so it</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.880" end="00:35:15.880" style="s2">transforms itself from an actuality</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.910" end="00:35:19.240" style="s2">into potential and most of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.880" end="00:35:20.740" style="s2">potential is negative and unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.240" end="00:35:23.380" style="s2">relieved that your wife had an affair</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.740" end="00:35:25.120" style="s2">well but that&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.380" end="00:35:27.190" style="s2">consideration because you know you could</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.120" end="00:35:30.130" style="s2">imagine a situation where your marriage</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.190" end="00:35:32.560" style="s2">is dreadfully unhappy and you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.130" end="00:35:34.870" style="s2">looking for an excuse to leave it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.560" end="00:35:36.250" style="s2">possible that that revelation even</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.870" end="00:35:38.740" style="s2">though it would be shocking would also</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.250" end="00:35:40.990" style="s2">come with a fair bit of relief and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.740" end="00:35:43.660" style="s2">this potent the potential that manifests</p>

<p begin="00:36:05.170" end="00:36:07.019" style="s2">that it&#39;s more complicated than that</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.490" end="00:36:09.670" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.019" end="00:36:14.410" style="s2">that&#39;s the introduction of chaos into</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.670" end="00:36:18.130" style="s2">order right and the the the oldest story</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.410" end="00:36:21.750" style="s2">we have is something like order is</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.130" end="00:36:26.140" style="s2">susceptible to disruption by chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.750" end="00:36:28.420" style="s2">the human that the fundamental demand</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.140" end="00:36:30.430" style="s2">that&#39;s made on the human being is to</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.420" end="00:36:33.490" style="s2">contend with the chaos that disrupts</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.430" end="00:36:35.230" style="s2">order not to live in order and not to</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.490" end="00:36:37.480" style="s2">live in chaos but to be able to contend</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.230" end="00:36:39.490" style="s2">with the chaos that disrupts order and</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.480" end="00:36:41.769" style="s2">so when you encourage your children for</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.490" end="00:36:44.200" style="s2">example what you&#39;re doing is encouraging</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.769" end="00:36:46.089" style="s2">them to become the Masters of the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.200" end="00:36:48.069" style="s2">that can disrupt order rather than</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.089" end="00:36:50.559" style="s2">denizens of order which makes them</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.069" end="00:36:53.049" style="s2">tyrants or denizens of chaos which makes</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.559" end="00:36:55.180" style="s2">them nihilistic and hopeless so you</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.049" end="00:36:57.130" style="s2">train your children you encourage your</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.180" end="00:36:59.559" style="s2">children and yourself and your partner</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.130" end="00:37:02.529" style="s2">if you have any sense to be a master of</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.559" end="00:37:07.990" style="s2">emergent chaos and to be able to contend</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.529" end="00:37:10.480" style="s2">with that and so so chaos is potential</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.990" end="00:37:12.910" style="s2">and it&#39;s this disruptive it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.480" end="00:37:15.099" style="s2">capacity of the infinite world to</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.910" end="00:37:16.990" style="s2">disrupt your finite considerations</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.099" end="00:37:18.910" style="s2">that&#39;s another way of looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.990" end="00:37:21.359" style="s2">another way of looking at it is it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.910" end="00:37:23.589" style="s2">serpent in the Garden of Eden and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.359" end="00:37:25.900" style="s2">reason that that story is set up the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.589" end="00:37:29.799" style="s2">it is is because it&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.900" end="00:37:32.799" style="s2">represent that there&#39;s no place that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.799" end="00:37:35.740" style="s2">so bounded and secure even if it&#39;s set</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.799" end="00:37:38.859" style="s2">up by God himself that doesn&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.740" end="00:37:40.839" style="s2">agent of chaos inside it it&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.859" end="00:37:42.910" style="s2">the same idea that the Dallas put</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.839" end="00:37:44.019" style="s2">forward with their with their symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.910" end="00:37:45.940" style="s2">representation</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.019" end="00:37:50.230" style="s2">it&#39;s just portrayed in a different</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.940" end="00:37:52.720" style="s2">manner and the question is well what do</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.230" end="00:37:55.119" style="s2">you do in the garden given that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.720" end="00:37:57.279" style="s2">a snake in it and the answer to that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.119" end="00:38:02.289" style="s2">something like you&#39;ve become the master</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.279" end="00:38:04.750" style="s2">of snakes and so and that&#39;s a deep idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.289" end="00:38:06.640" style="s2">that&#39;s the same idea as confronting the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.750" end="00:38:08.799" style="s2">dragon and getting the treasure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.640" end="00:38:11.170" style="s2">the same idea as going to the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.799" end="00:38:13.240" style="s2">the ocean and rescuing your father from</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.170" end="00:38:16.180" style="s2">the belly of the whale it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.240" end="00:38:17.920" style="s2">idea and that&#39;s an element in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.180" end="00:38:20.260" style="s2">greatest of stories and the greatest of</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.920" end="00:38:22.030" style="s2">stories is heroic</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.260" end="00:38:23.740" style="s2">Roark&#39;s story and the heroic story is to</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.030" end="00:38:25.900" style="s2">voluntarily confront the unknown when it</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.740" end="00:38:28.180" style="s2">manifests itself and to gather something</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.900" end="00:38:30.070" style="s2">of value as a consequence and to share</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.180" end="00:38:31.810" style="s2">it with the community there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.070" end="00:38:35.050" style="s2">story that&#39;s more emblematic of what it</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.810" end="00:38:39.090" style="s2">means to be human than that that that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.050" end="00:38:43.840" style="s2">us that&#39;s our best bet</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.090" end="00:38:46.120" style="s2">alright so chaos chaos is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.840" end="00:38:48.400" style="s2">catastrophe that will suddenly enter</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.120" end="00:38:50.530" style="s2">your life chaos is the flood that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.400" end="00:38:52.930" style="s2">definitely coming chaos is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.530" end="00:38:55.060" style="s2">ever-present possibility of apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.930" end="00:38:57.700" style="s2">in your personal life in your familial</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.060" end="00:39:00.130" style="s2">life and in this broader social life</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.700" end="00:39:03.490" style="s2">right chaos is the consequence of your</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.130" end="00:39:06.700" style="s2">finite fragility existing in a world</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.490" end="00:39:09.340" style="s2">that&#39;s beyond you chaos is potential</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.700" end="00:39:11.170" style="s2">chaos is what lies before you chaos is</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.340" end="00:39:13.330" style="s2">what you can call on when you need</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.170" end="00:39:16.030" style="s2">something to rescue yourself from</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.330" end="00:39:18.610" style="s2">malfunctioning order it&#39;s a permanent</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.030" end="00:39:22.030" style="s2">element of existence chaos is what you</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.610" end="00:39:24.790" style="s2">don&#39;t know chaos is what&#39;s outside the</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.030" end="00:39:27.040" style="s2">fire chaos is what&#39;s outside the walls</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.790" end="00:39:29.860" style="s2">of your house chaos is what&#39;s outside</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.040" end="00:39:32.580" style="s2">the walls of your town chaos is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.860" end="00:39:40.860" style="s2">outside of the borders of your country</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.580" end="00:39:40.860" style="s2">all of that is chaos and potential order</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.920" end="00:39:46.690" style="s2">order is where you are when what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.500" end="00:39:49.600" style="s2">doing is working in the manner that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.690" end="00:39:52.060" style="s2">intended okay it&#39;s a very specific</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.600" end="00:39:54.130" style="s2">definition how do you know that you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.060" end="00:39:55.180" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing well you don&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.130" end="00:39:57.100" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing because</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.180" end="00:39:59.350" style="s2">you don&#39;t know everything everything you</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.100" end="00:40:01.270" style="s2">do is bounded by ignorance well you</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.350" end="00:40:03.580" style="s2">still have to operate in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.270" end="00:40:06.610" style="s2">so what you do is you make finite plans</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.580" end="00:40:10.000" style="s2">and the new execute plans and then you</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.610" end="00:40:12.400" style="s2">execute strategies to to make those</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.000" end="00:40:14.470" style="s2">plans manifest themselves and if the</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.400" end="00:40:16.240" style="s2">plans manifest themselves the way that</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.470" end="00:40:18.910" style="s2">you desired then you regard your</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.240" end="00:40:20.470" style="s2">knowledge as sufficient that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.910" end="00:40:22.090" style="s2">definition of truth and it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.470" end="00:40:24.070" style="s2">definition of truth that you can use</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.090" end="00:40:26.470" style="s2">because you don&#39;t have everything at</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.070" end="00:40:29.770" style="s2">hand and when you&#39;re where what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.470" end="00:40:31.150" style="s2">doing is working that&#39;s order and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.770" end="00:40:33.430" style="s2">might think well I should just stay</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.150" end="00:40:34.240" style="s2">there because that&#39;s a comfortable place</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.430" end="00:40:36.910" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.240" end="00:40:38.560" style="s2">and there&#39;s a certain amount of truth to</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.910" end="00:40:45.160" style="s2">that except for one thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.560" end="00:40:49.540" style="s2">if you&#39;ve defined a domain of order and</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.160" end="00:40:51.360" style="s2">you stand in it and you wait the</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.540" end="00:40:54.310" style="s2">disorder will enter all by itself</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.360" end="00:40:57.190" style="s2">because things aren&#39;t static things</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.310" end="00:40:59.710" style="s2">change all the time and your attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.190" end="00:41:02.590" style="s2">bind yourself within a static structure</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.710" end="00:41:05.650" style="s2">is destined to fail because everything</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.590" end="00:41:07.900" style="s2">around you is in flux and the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.650" end="00:41:10.600" style="s2">you&#39;ve parceled out as permanent will</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.900" end="00:41:12.700" style="s2">transform itself across time here&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.600" end="00:41:15.490" style="s2">example let&#39;s say you&#39;re a perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.700" end="00:41:17.560" style="s2">well adapted eleven-year-old and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.490" end="00:41:18.820" style="s2">actually possible to meet it 11 year old</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.560" end="00:41:20.200" style="s2">children are often very delightful</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.820" end="00:41:23.020" style="s2">because they&#39;re like adult children</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.200" end="00:41:25.960" style="s2">they&#39;re not teenagers they&#39;re like as</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.020" end="00:41:27.670" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re the most mature form of</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.960" end="00:41:29.740" style="s2">children and they can be really</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.670" end="00:41:33.310" style="s2">delightful people and then like three</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.740" end="00:41:35.260" style="s2">years later you hate them and and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.310" end="00:41:37.450" style="s2">reason for that is that of course as</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.260" end="00:41:40.119" style="s2">soon as they hit puberty which is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.450" end="00:41:42.250" style="s2">emergence of chaos into the into the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.119" end="00:41:44.530" style="s2">already developed childhood structures</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.250" end="00:41:46.090" style="s2">really the emergence of sexuality into a</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.530" end="00:41:48.250" style="s2">structure that didn&#39;t have to adapt to</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.090" end="00:41:49.810" style="s2">sexuality and maybe even the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.250" end="00:41:53.020" style="s2">of aggression to some degree but mostly</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.810" end="00:41:55.359" style="s2">sexuality if the child maintains only</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.020" end="00:41:57.910" style="s2">the 11-year old personality by the time</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.359" end="00:41:59.710" style="s2">they&#39;re 16 they&#39;re no longer a</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.910" end="00:42:02.170" style="s2">delightful 11 year old there are very</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.710" end="00:42:03.970" style="s2">immature 16 year old and the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.170" end="00:42:05.560" style="s2">I&#39;m pointing that out is because just</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.970" end="00:42:07.180" style="s2">because something works for you now</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.560" end="00:42:10.150" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going to work for you</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.180" end="00:42:12.700" style="s2">five years from now and so in order to</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.150" end="00:42:14.050" style="s2">remain stable you can&#39;t be stagnant</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.700" end="00:42:18.190" style="s2">they&#39;re not the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.050" end="00:42:20.470" style="s2">stability is a dynamic not a not</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.190" end="00:42:22.030" style="s2">something static and so not only do you</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.470" end="00:42:23.920" style="s2">have to be where you are</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.030" end="00:42:25.570" style="s2">but you have to be going to where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.920" end="00:42:28.600" style="s2">going and you have to be participating</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.570" end="00:42:31.480" style="s2">in both of those things actively so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.600" end="00:42:33.550" style="s2">stability plus transformation and and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.480" end="00:42:35.530" style="s2">would say that manifests itself you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.550" end="00:42:37.690" style="s2">when you&#39;re there because that manifests</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.530" end="00:42:39.940" style="s2">itself as meaningful that&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.690" end="00:42:41.680" style="s2">the instinct of meaning which is an</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.940" end="00:42:43.900" style="s2">instinct and perhaps the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:45.670" style="s2">instinct is precisely the instinct that</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.900" end="00:42:47.730" style="s2">tells you when where you are as</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.670" end="00:42:49.980" style="s2">sufficiently stable but your</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.730" end="00:42:52.080" style="s2">forming yourself at a sufficient rate to</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.980" end="00:42:53.970" style="s2">keep up with everything that&#39;s changing</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.080" end="00:42:57.000" style="s2">and you know that because if you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.970" end="00:42:58.710" style="s2">your job you might say to yourself well</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.000" end="00:43:01.859" style="s2">my job is really secure but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.710" end="00:43:04.410" style="s2">very challenging and you think well why</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.859" end="00:43:06.630" style="s2">do you care about that it&#39;s very secure</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.410" end="00:43:08.940" style="s2">and the answer to that is well if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.630" end="00:43:10.980" style="s2">not challenging it&#39;s it&#39;s deadening in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.940" end="00:43:12.960" style="s2">sense right the spirit goes out of it if</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.980" end="00:43:15.630" style="s2">it&#39;s not challenging you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.960" end="00:43:17.970" style="s2">challenged and why is that well the</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.630" end="00:43:20.040" style="s2">answer is well tomorrow is coming and</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.970" end="00:43:20.490" style="s2">whoever you are now isn&#39;t enough for</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.040" end="00:43:22.920" style="s2">tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.490" end="00:43:25.109" style="s2">and so today you also have to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.920" end="00:43:26.640" style="s2">preparing for tomorrow and next week and</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.109" end="00:43:29.070" style="s2">next year and if your job isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.640" end="00:43:30.869" style="s2">challenging then it isn&#39;t doing that for</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.070" end="00:43:32.940" style="s2">you and you find it deadening not</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.869" end="00:43:35.310" style="s2">meaningful and the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.940" end="00:43:36.900" style="s2">that it violates your most essential</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.310" end="00:43:39.390" style="s2">instinct and your most essential</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.900" end="00:43:42.630" style="s2">instinct is the instinct for meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.390" end="00:43:44.250" style="s2">it signifies that it actually signifies</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.630" end="00:43:48.090" style="s2">that you have the balance between chaos</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.250" end="00:43:49.440" style="s2">and order right deeply right which is</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.090" end="00:43:51.300" style="s2">why it&#39;s the most fundamental of</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.440" end="00:43:55.859" style="s2">instincts because chaos and order are</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.300" end="00:43:57.570" style="s2">the most real of things all right so you</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.859" end="00:44:00.300" style="s2">have the chaos that surrounds you and in</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.570" end="00:44:02.880" style="s2">some some sense infinite in scope and</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.300" end="00:44:06.390" style="s2">then you have the order that you produce</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.880" end="00:44:08.430" style="s2">which is your mastery of it well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.390" end="00:44:11.060" style="s2">take order apart for a minute we want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.430" end="00:44:14.040" style="s2">think about the structure of order and</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.060" end="00:44:15.780" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that chaos is bad an</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.040" end="00:44:17.369" style="s2">order is good I&#39;m not saying that at all</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.780" end="00:44:19.230" style="s2">that&#39;s not the right way to look at it</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.369" end="00:44:20.670" style="s2">it&#39;s the balance piece it&#39;s the balance</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.230" end="00:44:22.950" style="s2">between them that&#39;s of crucial</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.670" end="00:44:24.869" style="s2">importance they just think they exist as</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.950" end="00:44:26.609" style="s2">super ordinate categories whether you</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.869" end="00:44:29.790" style="s2">like them or not is really not that</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.609" end="00:44:31.590" style="s2">relevant they&#39;re there they&#39;re there the</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.790" end="00:44:34.530" style="s2">fundamental constituent elements of</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.590" end="00:44:36.540" style="s2">reality you might say well what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.530" end="00:44:38.240" style="s2">evidence for that and I can tell you one</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.540" end="00:44:41.400" style="s2">piece of evidence which I won&#39;t go into</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.240" end="00:44:44.700" style="s2">for very much time you have two</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.400" end="00:44:46.170" style="s2">hemispheres and each in your brain the</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.700" end="00:44:48.510" style="s2">brain is composed of two hemispheres</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.170" end="00:44:50.940" style="s2">which implies something about the nature</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.510" end="00:44:52.890" style="s2">of the world given that your brain is</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.940" end="00:44:54.240" style="s2">hypothetically adapted to the structure</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.890" end="00:44:56.010" style="s2">of the world it&#39;s not just your brain</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.240" end="00:44:59.310" style="s2">because animal brains have the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.010" end="00:45:01.800" style="s2">fundamental structure this bifurcated</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.310" end="00:45:03.510" style="s2">structure and the bifurcation in</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.800" end="00:45:05.670" style="s2">it&#39;s that there&#39;s two fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.510" end="00:45:07.620" style="s2">realities because otherwise why would</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.670" end="00:45:10.320" style="s2">you need a bifurcated structure or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.620" end="00:45:12.180" style="s2">you need a triune brain or one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.320" end="00:45:13.980" style="s2">divided into four but that isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.180" end="00:45:17.070" style="s2">you have you have one that&#39;s divided</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.980" end="00:45:20.100" style="s2">into two and if your working definition</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.070" end="00:45:22.140" style="s2">of reality is scientific biological</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.100" end="00:45:24.960" style="s2">let&#39;s say then your definition of</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.140" end="00:45:28.080" style="s2">reality is reality is that which shapes</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.960" end="00:45:30.570" style="s2">life you can&#39;t actually do better than</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.080" end="00:45:33.000" style="s2">that from a Darwinian perspective and if</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.570" end="00:45:35.490" style="s2">the reality that shaped life produced a</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.000" end="00:45:37.740" style="s2">bifurcated representational structure</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.490" end="00:45:40.770" style="s2">then that implies that the proper way to</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.740" end="00:45:43.260" style="s2">represent reality and perhaps that</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.770" end="00:45:44.910" style="s2">reality itself is in fact bifurcated and</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.260" end="00:45:47.700" style="s2">I believe it&#39;s bifurcated in the manner</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.910" end="00:45:49.410" style="s2">I just described and the neurological</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.700" end="00:45:51.420" style="s2">evidence for that is actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.410" end="00:45:53.280" style="s2">overwhelming it&#39;s come from multiple</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.420" end="00:45:55.260" style="s2">sources some of them Russians some of</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.280" end="00:45:57.420" style="s2">them American that&#39;s where most of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.260" end="00:45:59.910" style="s2">work has been done your left hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.420" end="00:46:02.280" style="s2">is specialized for operation in those</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.910" end="00:46:04.350" style="s2">situations that you know and understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.280" end="00:46:06.480" style="s2">and your right hemisphere is specialized</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.350" end="00:46:10.770" style="s2">for operation in those situations that</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.480" end="00:46:13.020" style="s2">you neither know nor understand and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.770" end="00:46:14.550" style="s2">proper way to orient yourself in life is</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.020" end="00:46:18.090" style="s2">to get the balance between those two</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.550" end="00:46:19.950" style="s2">sets of operations correct and the way</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.090" end="00:46:22.560" style="s2">that manifests itself in your subjective</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.950" end="00:46:29.280" style="s2">experience is as meaningful engagement</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.560" end="00:46:32.550" style="s2">and so that&#39;s not a bad first pass what</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.280" end="00:46:36.270" style="s2">would you say justification for the view</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.550" end="00:46:37.340" style="s2">that these two domains are the most real</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.270" end="00:46:42.990" style="s2">domains</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.340" end="00:46:45.660" style="s2">okay so order what is order well if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.990" end="00:46:49.110" style="s2">just sit there and do nothing that will</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.660" end="00:46:51.270" style="s2">be chaos why well because you&#39;ll you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.110" end="00:46:55.340" style="s2">suffer and die that&#39;s what will happen</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.270" end="00:46:58.010" style="s2">so without action on your part</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.340" end="00:47:01.230" style="s2">deterioration and death is a certainty</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.010" end="00:47:02.850" style="s2">okay so you need to act well then we</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.230" end="00:47:06.950" style="s2">built on an action-platformer</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.850" end="00:47:06.950" style="s2">I mean we&#39;re the consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.710" end="00:47:16.369" style="s2">three billion years of evolution for</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.560" end="00:47:19.339" style="s2">action action movement forward in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.369" end="00:47:21.230" style="s2">face of necessity is the prime dictum of</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.339" end="00:47:21.710" style="s2">life that&#39;s a good way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.230" end="00:47:25.730" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.710" end="00:47:28.369" style="s2">we&#39;re embodied action what do you have</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.730" end="00:47:29.930" style="s2">to do when you act well at minimum you</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.369" end="00:47:30.560" style="s2">have to do whatever keeps you able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.930" end="00:47:32.839" style="s2">act</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.560" end="00:47:34.430" style="s2">these are truisms right I mean you have</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.839" end="00:47:36.290" style="s2">to have something to eat you have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.430" end="00:47:39.819" style="s2">have some fresh water you need some</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.290" end="00:47:42.859" style="s2">shelter right you need some</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.819" end="00:47:47.210" style="s2">companionship you need a sexual partner</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.859" end="00:47:49.430" style="s2">you need children you need play you need</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.210" end="00:47:51.800" style="s2">to be touched there&#39;s there&#39;s a and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.430" end="00:47:55.430" style="s2">mean I actually mean need by the way</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.800" end="00:47:58.040" style="s2">people deprived of play go insane people</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.430" end="00:48:00.230" style="s2">who aren&#39;t touched died these things are</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.040" end="00:48:02.270" style="s2">necessary well assuming that survival</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.230" end="00:48:04.310" style="s2">itself is necessary but we&#39;ll start with</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.270" end="00:48:06.680" style="s2">that we&#39;ll start with the assumption</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.310" end="00:48:10.579" style="s2">that just sitting there and suffering</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.680" end="00:48:12.079" style="s2">and dying is not the right solution okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.579" end="00:48:14.690" style="s2">so you have to act in the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.079" end="00:48:17.329" style="s2">you have to act in the world that in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.690" end="00:48:19.940" style="s2">manner that stops you from deteriorating</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.329" end="00:48:21.770" style="s2">and dying at minimum and that means that</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.940" end="00:48:25.460" style="s2">you have to address the problems that</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.770" end="00:48:27.440" style="s2">are intrinsic to that destiny now you</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.460" end="00:48:28.849" style="s2">have all sorts of systems that evolved</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.440" end="00:48:31.160" style="s2">have evolved to help you do that</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.849" end="00:48:33.859" style="s2">motivational systems we have to eat so</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.160" end="00:48:36.260" style="s2">you get hungry you have to find water</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.859" end="00:48:38.450" style="s2">and consume it so you get thirsty you</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.260" end="00:48:41.300" style="s2">get lonely you get curious there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.450" end="00:48:43.220" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s specialized biological</p>

<p begin="00:49:59.390" end="00:50:03.619" style="s2">cognitive systems that&#39;s how do you</p>

<p begin="00:50:34.209" end="00:50:40.609" style="s2">now it&#39;s not all bad news because to use</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.239" end="00:50:42.559" style="s2">the right hemisphere in a judicious</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.609" end="00:50:44.599" style="s2">manner is also something that adds</p>

<p begin="00:50:47.749" end="00:50:53.449" style="s2">so because potential is not only</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.539" end="00:50:55.609" style="s2">negative it&#39;s also positive it can be it</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.449" end="00:50:59.989" style="s2">can be dealt with in ways that are</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.609" end="00:51:02.920" style="s2">deeply enriching and meaningful order</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.989" end="00:51:06.920" style="s2">okay so you have to do something</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.920" end="00:51:08.869" style="s2">otherwise the consequences are dire to</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.920" end="00:51:11.289" style="s2">do something you have to value something</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.869" end="00:51:14.209" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a definitional issue</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.289" end="00:51:16.130" style="s2">because to do something is to act out</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.209" end="00:51:17.989" style="s2">the proposition that the thing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.130" end="00:51:19.969" style="s2">doing the thing you&#39;re aiming at let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.989" end="00:51:22.670" style="s2">say is preferable to the thing you have</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.969" end="00:51:23.749" style="s2">and preferable means you&#39;ll do it so</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.670" end="00:51:26.239" style="s2">those things are tied together so</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.749" end="00:51:29.869" style="s2">tightly you can&#39;t disentangle them if</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.239" end="00:51:31.729" style="s2">you say I&#39;m aiming at X but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.869" end="00:51:33.410" style="s2">value it then there&#39;s something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.729" end="00:51:35.869" style="s2">with the way that you&#39;re conceptualizing</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.410" end="00:51:36.330" style="s2">the statement because to aim at</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.869" end="00:51:38.190" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.330" end="00:51:41.610" style="s2">and to work to bring it into existence</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.190" end="00:51:43.380" style="s2">is the same as valuing it and if you say</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.610" end="00:51:45.930" style="s2">well I don&#39;t value it then something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.380" end="00:51:47.910" style="s2">out of kilter either you&#39;re acting out a</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.930" end="00:51:49.680" style="s2">falsehood or you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.910" end="00:51:51.300" style="s2">talking about it&#39;s one of those two</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.680" end="00:51:53.870" style="s2">things and you meet people like that or</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.300" end="00:51:55.770" style="s2">deeply confused they&#39;re their action</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.870" end="00:51:59.400" style="s2">patterns and their verbal</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.770" end="00:52:01.500" style="s2">self-representation don&#39;t mesh but that</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.400" end="00:52:03.540" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re critics of</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.500" end="00:52:07.170" style="s2">value it just means that they&#39;re deeply</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.540" end="00:52:09.060" style="s2">confused so you have to act or you</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.170" end="00:52:11.250" style="s2">suffer in order to act you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.060" end="00:52:12.780" style="s2">a value structure because to act you</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.250" end="00:52:15.120" style="s2">have to value one thing more than</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.780" end="00:52:18.710" style="s2">another which means that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.120" end="00:52:23.360" style="s2">inhabit a structure of value you have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.710" end="00:52:26.120" style="s2">okay so you need a structure value</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.360" end="00:52:30.120" style="s2">because it&#39;s the antidote to catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.120" end="00:52:32.430" style="s2">now if you act out a structure of value</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.120" end="00:52:34.980" style="s2">socially which you will because your</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.430" end="00:52:38.760" style="s2">social you&#39;re not gonna pursue your aims</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.980" end="00:52:41.490" style="s2">in isolation because you&#39;re not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.760" end="00:52:44.510" style="s2">not a solitary animal you&#39;re a social</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.490" end="00:52:47.700" style="s2">animal you&#39;re a tribal animal deeply</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.510" end="00:52:49.740" style="s2">tribal we live in groups we live in</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.700" end="00:52:52.650" style="s2">families we live in communities we live</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.740" end="00:52:55.470" style="s2">in large societies we&#39;re social at every</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.650" end="00:52:59.760" style="s2">level of analysis and we&#39;ve been social</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.470" end="00:53:02.400" style="s2">for as long as we&#39;ve been primates so</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.760" end="00:53:04.590" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s that&#39;s at least six million</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.400" end="00:53:08.460" style="s2">years and it might be more like 60</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.590" end="00:53:10.380" style="s2">million years it&#39;s really a long time so</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.460" end="00:53:12.810" style="s2">it&#39;s not an arbitrary social</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.380" end="00:53:16.080" style="s2">construction it&#39;s far far deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.810" end="00:53:17.550" style="s2">that now what happens when you act out a</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.080" end="00:53:21.650" style="s2">structure of value in a social</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.550" end="00:53:24.480" style="s2">environment you produce a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.650" end="00:53:28.110" style="s2">inevitably well let&#39;s think it through</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.480" end="00:53:30.380" style="s2">why well let&#39;s say that you say that one</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.110" end="00:53:33.480" style="s2">thing is more worth doing than another</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.380" end="00:53:34.740" style="s2">whatever happens to be and then you tell</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.480" end="00:53:35.970" style="s2">a bunch of people about what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.740" end="00:53:37.560" style="s2">doing and they decide that they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.970" end="00:53:39.240" style="s2">come along and help you do this thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.560" end="00:53:41.610" style="s2">that&#39;s valuable because they also think</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.240" end="00:53:43.260" style="s2">it&#39;s valuable and maybe you get 20</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.610" end="00:53:45.630" style="s2">people together to do this thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.260" end="00:53:47.250" style="s2">whatever it happens to be and the first</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.630" end="00:53:48.780" style="s2">thing you discover is that some of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.250" end="00:53:49.370" style="s2">people are way better at doing whatever</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.780" end="00:53:52.250" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.370" end="00:53:54.170" style="s2">they&#39;re doing than other people so and</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.250" end="00:53:56.150" style="s2">that and who knows why that is because</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.170" end="00:53:58.610" style="s2">it depends on what you chose to do you</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.150" end="00:54:00.380" style="s2">know if you chose a then it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.610" end="00:54:02.780" style="s2">different group of people who were good</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.380" end="00:54:04.280" style="s2">at it than if you chose B because people</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.780" end="00:54:07.190" style="s2">differ in their abilities but one thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.280" end="00:54:09.050" style="s2">you will not escape from if you make an</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.190" end="00:54:11.780" style="s2">organization to do something valuable is</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.050" end="00:54:14.180" style="s2">the brute fact that it will be a</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.780" end="00:54:17.090" style="s2">minority of the people who are good at</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.180" end="00:54:20.960" style="s2">doing it and there&#39;s actually a law it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.090" end="00:54:24.080" style="s2">called prices law and it&#39;s a real law it</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.960" end="00:54:26.180" style="s2">even governs the size of cities and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.080" end="00:54:26.900" style="s2">mass of stars and the heights of plants</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.180" end="00:54:28.550" style="s2">in the jungle</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.900" end="00:54:30.800" style="s2">it just doesn&#39;t govern human</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.550" end="00:54:32.930" style="s2">interactions and prices law says that</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.800" end="00:54:34.820" style="s2">the square root of the number of people</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.930" end="00:54:38.030" style="s2">engaged in the enterprise will do half</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.820" end="00:54:39.350" style="s2">the work so if you have ten people doing</p>

<p begin="00:54:39.350" end="00:54:42.770" style="s2">work but if you have a hundred people</p>

<p begin="00:57:10.080" end="00:57:15.570" style="s2">includes the inevitability of suffering</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.200" end="00:57:18.270" style="s2">and malevolence betrayal at the hands of</p>

<p begin="00:57:22.140" end="00:57:25.560" style="s2">intolerable and the question is well</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.240" end="00:57:27.210" style="s2">what do you do in the face of something</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.560" end="00:57:28.350" style="s2">that&#39;s intolerable and the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.210" end="00:57:30.330" style="s2">well you try to find something that</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.350" end="00:57:32.490" style="s2">justifies it right you want to have</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.330" end="00:57:35.100" style="s2">something that gets you the hell out of</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.490" end="00:57:37.500" style="s2">bed in the morning and not just any old</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.100" end="00:57:39.420" style="s2">morning but a morning when your father</p>

<p begin="00:57:45.360" end="00:57:49.800" style="s2">better be the purpose that you found in</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.610" end="00:57:51.480" style="s2">life and if the purpose is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.800" end="00:57:53.310" style="s2">such that it gets you out of bed in</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.480" end="00:57:56.220" style="s2">those mornings it better be a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.310" end="00:57:58.740" style="s2">damn noble purpose because otherwise why</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.220" end="00:58:00.390" style="s2">would you bother and so not only do you</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.740" end="00:58:04.140" style="s2">need a value structure you need one</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.390" end="00:58:06.810" style="s2">that&#39;s of sufficient tension let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.140" end="00:58:09.000" style="s2">or sufficient value or sufficient</p>

<p begin="00:58:09.000" end="00:58:13.770" style="s2">for because you&#39;re going to suffer and</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.970" end="00:58:16.350" style="s2">you better have something that makes the</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.770" end="00:58:17.010" style="s2">suffering justifiable and so not only do</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.350" end="00:58:18.750" style="s2">you need the value</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.010" end="00:58:20.940" style="s2">structure so that you don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.750" end="00:58:23.010" style="s2">deteriorate and die you need the value</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.940" end="00:58:25.560" style="s2">structure so that when the flood comes</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.010" end="00:58:27.180" style="s2">in your life as it certainly will that</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.560" end="00:58:29.600" style="s2">you have built a vessel that will</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.180" end="00:58:32.880" style="s2">sustain you through the catastrophe and</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.600" end="00:58:35.070" style="s2">that&#39;s not this pursuit of happiness</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.880" end="00:58:36.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not even the pursuit of security</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.070" end="00:58:39.450" style="s2">it&#39;s none of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.720" end="00:58:41.610" style="s2">it&#39;s your the orientation that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.450" end="00:58:43.830" style="s2">managed to produce in your own life</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.610" end="00:58:45.930" style="s2">towards a higher good that&#39;s so high</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.830" end="00:58:50.370" style="s2">that it&#39;s worth bearing the burden of</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.930" end="00:58:52.950" style="s2">being to produce you implement that in</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.370" end="00:58:55.620" style="s2">the world you produce a hierarchy now</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.950" end="00:58:57.150" style="s2">you might say well and then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.620" end="00:58:59.400" style="s2">problem of hierarchy and the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.150" end="00:59:00.480" style="s2">hierarchy is a very few people are going</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.400" end="00:59:02.700" style="s2">to be very good at whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.480" end="00:59:04.620" style="s2">hierarchy does and then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.700" end="00:59:06.480" style="s2">second problem with hierarchy which is</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.620" end="00:59:09.060" style="s2">the problem I just laid out when I asked</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.480" end="00:59:10.950" style="s2">you about your spectacular levels of</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.060" end="00:59:14.520" style="s2">attainment and found out that they were</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.950" end="00:59:15.990" style="s2">very it was very unlikely I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.520" end="00:59:18.360" style="s2">that you haven&#39;t attained worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.990" end="00:59:20.550" style="s2">things that&#39;s not my point my point is</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.360" end="00:59:23.130" style="s2">is that very high levels of attainment</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.550" end="00:59:25.350" style="s2">are extraordinarily rare and that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.130" end="00:59:26.970" style="s2">inevitability as soon as you decide that</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.350" end="00:59:29.130" style="s2">something&#39;s worth doing to</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.970" end="00:59:31.440" style="s2">inevitabilities people stack up at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.130" end="00:59:33.630" style="s2">top minority of people stack up at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.440" end="00:59:35.640" style="s2">top and take most of the proceeds</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.630" end="00:59:37.740" style="s2">whatever they happen to be or deserve</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.640" end="00:59:39.210" style="s2">them or earn them whatever however I</p>

<p begin="00:59:39.210" end="00:59:44.010" style="s2">almost everybody else stacks up at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.610" end="00:59:45.660" style="s2">bottom and so the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.010" end="00:59:47.340" style="s2">hierarchies is that even though they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.660" end="00:59:49.470" style="s2">necessary they tend to produce a</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.340" end="00:59:52.200" style="s2">situation where most people stack up at</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.470" end="00:59:54.270" style="s2">the bottom and so that&#39;s the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.200" end="00:59:56.370" style="s2">that we have to contend with you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.270" end="00:59:57.510" style="s2">get rid of the hierarchies because if</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.370" end="00:59:59.190" style="s2">you get rid of the hierarchies there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.510" end="01:00:00.660" style="s2">no value structure and if there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.190" end="01:00:02.880" style="s2">value structure not only do you</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.660" end="01:00:05.100" style="s2">deteriorate and die you want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.880" end="01:00:08.040" style="s2">deteriorate and die and that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.100" end="01:00:09.960" style="s2">good solution but if you do generate a</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.040" end="01:00:12.750" style="s2">hierarchy then you have the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.960" end="01:00:14.430" style="s2">the hierarchy and the problem of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.750" end="01:00:16.920" style="s2">hierarchy is that it will dis possess</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.430" end="01:00:19.080" style="s2">most people now to the degree that the</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.920" end="01:00:22.170" style="s2">post modernists have something to say</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.080" end="01:00:24.540" style="s2">that&#39;s what they say is hierarchies dis</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.170" end="01:00:27.450" style="s2">possess okay and then we can look at</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.540" end="01:00:30.289" style="s2">that clearly and carefully and we can</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.450" end="01:00:32.599" style="s2">say that doesn&#39;t mean a</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.289" end="01:00:36.199" style="s2">that hierarchies themselves are corrupt</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.599" end="01:00:37.819" style="s2">or that we can dispense with them but it</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.199" end="01:00:40.429" style="s2">also doesn&#39;t mean that we have no moral</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.819" end="01:00:42.400" style="s2">obligation to the dispossessed and we</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.429" end="01:00:45.079" style="s2">say well how do we deal with that</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.400" end="01:00:46.579" style="s2">politically conceptually and the way we</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.079" end="01:00:48.589" style="s2">deal with that at least in part is to</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.579" end="01:00:50.989" style="s2">produce a political spectrum that ranges</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.589" end="01:00:52.369" style="s2">from left to right that deals with</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.989" end="01:00:54.349" style="s2">hierarchy and the problems that</p>

<p begin="01:00:59.929" end="01:01:05.709" style="s2">will be patriotically in favor of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.619" end="01:01:08.539" style="s2">current hierarchy or even more</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.709" end="01:01:11.839" style="s2">abstractly they&#39;re in favor of the idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.539" end="01:01:13.249" style="s2">of hierarchy itself and you say well</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.839" end="01:01:17.059" style="s2">more power to the people on the right</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.249" end="01:01:18.829" style="s2">because you need hierarchies so they</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.059" end="01:01:20.329" style="s2">should support them but then you have to</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.829" end="01:01:22.279" style="s2">take the people on the left you say yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.329" end="01:01:24.619" style="s2">but what about the people who are</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.279" end="01:01:26.900" style="s2">dispossessed by the hierarchy and what</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.619" end="01:01:28.549" style="s2">you have to say to them is yeah we</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.900" end="01:01:30.410" style="s2">actually have to do something about that</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.549" end="01:01:31.910" style="s2">and you think well how do we do</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.410" end="01:01:34.160" style="s2">something about that and the answer is</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.910" end="01:01:37.279" style="s2">we don&#39;t actually know because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.160" end="01:01:40.669" style="s2">no permanent solution to the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.279" end="01:01:43.489" style="s2">dispossession by the hierarchy we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.669" end="01:01:45.019" style="s2">know how to fix it say well we could</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.489" end="01:01:47.079" style="s2">flatten the hierarchies it&#39;s like not</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.019" end="01:01:49.400" style="s2">without disrupting the value structure</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.079" end="01:01:51.829" style="s2">that&#39;s a price you don&#39;t want to pay</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.400" end="01:01:56.199" style="s2">well we could take from the top and put</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.829" end="01:01:59.329" style="s2">it at the bottom it&#39;s like yes</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.199" end="01:02:01.219" style="s2">hypothetically we could but it turns out</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.329" end="01:02:05.059" style="s2">that when you try that in practice it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.219" end="01:02:07.900" style="s2">very very easy to rapidly go too far and</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.059" end="01:02:12.079" style="s2">then what you end up with naught is less</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.900" end="01:02:14.630" style="s2">dispossessed you end up with no one who</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.079" end="01:02:17.140" style="s2">has anything and that&#39;s not a good</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.630" end="01:02:20.859" style="s2">solution to the problem of scarcity</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.140" end="01:02:23.839" style="s2">right to make everyone equally dead or</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.859" end="01:02:26.479" style="s2">equally starving which is essentially</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.839" end="01:02:28.819" style="s2">what the Communist States did across the</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.479" end="01:02:31.640" style="s2">entirety of the twentieth century is not</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.819" end="01:02:34.279" style="s2">the proper way to address the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.640" end="01:02:35.779" style="s2">hierarchy now it has to be addressed</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.279" end="01:02:37.630" style="s2">even if you&#39;re on the right because</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.779" end="01:02:40.339" style="s2">here&#39;s one thing that happens</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.630" end="01:02:42.199" style="s2">hierarchies tend to ossify you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.339" end="01:02:44.120" style="s2">because what happens is that the people</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.199" end="01:02:45.590" style="s2">at the top maybe they got there by</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.120" end="01:02:48.230" style="s2">merit but it&#39;s easy for them to</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.590" end="01:02:50.570" style="s2">gerrymander the system so they can stay</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.230" end="01:02:52.610" style="s2">there without merit or perhaps their</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.570" end="01:02:54.950" style="s2">children can stay there without merit or</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.610" end="01:02:57.140" style="s2">they can or the hierarchy becomes</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.950" end="01:02:59.540" style="s2">corrupt so that people who only use</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.140" end="01:03:01.400" style="s2">tyranny and power can climb it and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.540" end="01:03:03.080" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a hierarchy of competence</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.400" end="01:03:05.300" style="s2">and value anymore you have a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.080" end="01:03:07.100" style="s2">of brute power which looks like a</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.300" end="01:03:09.290" style="s2">tyranny so there&#39;s all sorts of ways</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.100" end="01:03:11.360" style="s2">that hierarchies can deteriorate and we</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.290" end="01:03:15.200" style="s2">have to be awake to ensure that that</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.360" end="01:03:17.990" style="s2">doesn&#39;t occur also if the hierarchy gets</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.200" end="01:03:20.450" style="s2">so steep that everybody stacks up at</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.990" end="01:03:21.860" style="s2">zero and no one can climb it which is</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.450" end="01:03:23.960" style="s2">basically the definition of a</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.860" end="01:03:26.720" style="s2">malfunctioning tyranny than all the</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.960" end="01:03:28.390" style="s2">people at the bottom rightly think well</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.720" end="01:03:31.130" style="s2">why don&#39;t we just destroy the game</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.390" end="01:03:33.470" style="s2">because we&#39;re already at zero so what</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.130" end="01:03:34.970" style="s2">the hell do we have to lose and so one</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.470" end="01:03:37.310" style="s2">of the things that you want to do if</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.970" end="01:03:39.590" style="s2">you&#39;re a sensible conservative is make</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.310" end="01:03:41.510" style="s2">sure that the hierarchy maintains its</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.590" end="01:03:44.240" style="s2">rooting incompetence that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.510" end="01:03:47.210" style="s2">transparent and that it&#39;s Klima Bowl</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.240" end="01:03:50.090" style="s2">because otherwise it will ossify and</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.210" end="01:03:52.130" style="s2">steepen and then it will destroy itself</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.090" end="01:03:54.800" style="s2">and if you&#39;re a conservative and you</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.130" end="01:03:56.750" style="s2">value stability and the hierarchy then</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.800" end="01:03:58.790" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to set up a situation</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.750" end="01:04:02.540" style="s2">where the most likely outcome is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.790" end="01:04:04.160" style="s2">the hierarchy destroys itself so so we</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.540" end="01:04:06.440" style="s2">can be intelligent about this we could</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.160" end="01:04:08.690" style="s2">say look don&#39;t be thinking you can get</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.440" end="01:04:10.310" style="s2">rid of hierarchies they&#39;ve been around</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.690" end="01:04:13.070" style="s2">this is why I wrote chapter one I talked</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.310" end="01:04:16.630" style="s2">about lobsters the reason I talked about</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.070" end="01:04:19.040" style="s2">them is because not only is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.630" end="01:04:21.830" style="s2">hierarchical structure itself as a</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.040" end="01:04:25.310" style="s2">permanent feature of existence at least</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.830" end="01:04:27.800" style="s2">a third of a billion years old which by</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.310" end="01:04:30.980" style="s2">the way means that you cannot attribute</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.800" end="01:04:33.560" style="s2">it to capitalism the free market or the</p>

<p begin="01:04:33.560" end="01:04:37.790" style="s2">willing to make the case that all three</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.300" end="01:04:39.950" style="s2">of those elements contributed to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.790" end="01:04:42.550" style="s2">existence of dominance hierarchies among</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.950" end="01:04:45.020" style="s2">crustaceans which seems highly unlikely</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.550" end="01:04:47.000" style="s2">so and and this is actually something</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.020" end="01:04:49.070" style="s2">that&#39;s that it&#39;s you could think about</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.000" end="01:04:52.490" style="s2">it as an idea that&#39;s actually directed</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.070" end="01:04:55.970" style="s2">towards the productive left if you want</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.490" end="01:04:57.860" style="s2">to help the dispossessed don&#39;t blame the</p>

<p begin="01:04:57.860" end="01:05:03.920" style="s2">capitalism because it&#39;s wrong it&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.130" end="01:05:05.690" style="s2">that the problem is way deeper than that</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.920" end="01:05:07.670" style="s2">and here&#39;s something else that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.690" end="01:05:10.730" style="s2">interesting about capitalism a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.670" end="01:05:12.890" style="s2">things you might consider you know we</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.730" end="01:05:16.580" style="s2">have become spectacularly wealthy since</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.890" end="01:05:18.770" style="s2">1895 right first in the West Iceland is</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.580" end="01:05:19.910" style="s2">a classic example I mean you guys are so</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.770" end="01:05:21.500" style="s2">much more wealthy than you were a</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.910" end="01:05:23.570" style="s2">hundred years ago that it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.500" end="01:05:25.610" style="s2">impossible to believe and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.570" end="01:05:27.830" style="s2">first happened in the West exponential</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.610" end="01:05:29.630" style="s2">economic growth starting in about 1895</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.830" end="01:05:31.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a long tail I mean people were</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.630" end="01:05:33.860" style="s2">improving before that but it really</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.160" end="01:05:35.030" style="s2">kicked in around 1895 and first happened</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.860" end="01:05:36.650" style="s2">in the West and now it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.030" end="01:05:40.670" style="s2">everywhere in the world I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.650" end="01:05:42.950" style="s2">you know this but you know the UN set a</p>

<p begin="01:06:18.860" end="01:06:23.810" style="s2">a consequence as far as as far as the</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.320" end="01:06:25.910" style="s2">data indicate of the operation of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.810" end="01:06:29.030" style="s2">free market system which does produce</p>

<p begin="01:06:29.030" end="01:06:33.970" style="s2">as I can tell the only system that has</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.830" end="01:06:38.450" style="s2">ever produced wealth and as law or has</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.970" end="01:06:40.190" style="s2">every system produces inequality but the</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.450" end="01:06:43.370" style="s2">only system we know of that produces</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.190" end="01:06:46.460" style="s2">produces wealth and inequality is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.370" end="01:06:48.440" style="s2">free market so here&#39;s a question for</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.460" end="01:06:50.030" style="s2">everyone left and right how many units</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.440" end="01:06:52.940" style="s2">of inequality will you tolerate to</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.030" end="01:06:56.380" style="s2">produce one unit of wealth and if the</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.940" end="01:06:59.750" style="s2">answer is zero then you&#39;ve gone too far</p>

<p begin="01:07:03.260" end="01:07:07.520" style="s2">you try to impose that all there will be</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.640" end="01:07:11.270" style="s2">as mayhem because the price we pay for</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.520" end="01:07:11.600" style="s2">wealth is inequality now that doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:07:16.430" end="01:07:19.280" style="s2">into the other problem which is the</p>

<p begin="01:07:59.180" end="01:08:02.900" style="s2">progressive tax policies and you can</p>

<p begin="01:08:15.350" end="01:08:18.830" style="s2">lawyer then maybe you could be a</p>

<p begin="01:09:56.060" end="01:10:01.460" style="s2">happens in the Old Testament is Israel</p>

<p begin="01:10:20.150" end="01:10:23.480" style="s2">comes up and says you aren&#39;t paying</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.890" end="01:10:25.760" style="s2">enough attention to the widows and the</p>

<p begin="01:10:43.010" end="01:10:48.200" style="s2">and the consequences of that lasts for</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.560" end="01:10:50.210" style="s2">generations like seven generations and</p>

<p begin="01:10:57.800" end="01:11:01.940" style="s2">six stories like that in the Old</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.660" end="01:11:04.090" style="s2">Testament it&#39;s all documented by a man</p>

<p begin="01:11:32.300" end="01:11:36.680" style="s2">optimized and you do that by doing</p>

<p begin="01:13:06.810" end="01:13:12.700" style="s2">chaos and order then you can say the</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.460" end="01:13:17.800" style="s2">order orders a hierarchy okay so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.700" end="01:13:21.820" style="s2">the next question next to questions is</p>

<p begin="01:13:24.310" end="01:13:29.920" style="s2">hierarchy what&#39;s well either what is at</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.850" end="01:13:32.380" style="s2">the top of the hierarchy or what should</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.920" end="01:13:34.300" style="s2">be at the top of the hierarchy said</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.380" end="01:13:36.760" style="s2">hierarchy is a structure of value so</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.300" end="01:13:40.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the question is what should be of</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.760" end="01:13:42.370" style="s2">all commit value okay so now we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.480" end="01:13:44.890" style="s2">take that apart a little bit the first</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.370" end="01:13:49.770" style="s2">thing I would say is order is not a</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.890" end="01:13:55.210" style="s2">hierarchy order is a set of hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.770" end="01:13:57.250" style="s2">that&#39;s a different thing so I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.210" end="01:14:00.700" style="s2">you how to think about that I think so</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.250" end="01:14:04.360" style="s2">imagine you have a child and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.700" end="01:14:07.600" style="s2">playing soccer and your child&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.360" end="01:14:08.520" style="s2">good soccer player no I&#39;ll tell you a</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.600" end="01:14:12.730" style="s2">different story</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.520" end="01:14:15.070" style="s2">this actually happened so I&#39;m gonna tell</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.730" end="01:14:16.989" style="s2">you a story about hockey and I&#39;m since</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.070" end="01:14:20.020" style="s2">I&#39;m Canadian what the hell I might as</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.989" end="01:14:21.790" style="s2">well tell you a story about hockey um my</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.020" end="01:14:25.210" style="s2">son played hockey he still plays hockey</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.790" end="01:14:27.250" style="s2">he&#39;s a pretty good hockey player and my</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.210" end="01:14:27.700" style="s2">wife and I used to go watch him play</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.250" end="01:14:29.140" style="s2">hockey</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.700" end="01:14:31.180" style="s2">there was an arena just down the street</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.140" end="01:14:33.550" style="s2">from us and there was a nice</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.180" end="01:14:36.190" style="s2">neighborhood League there and so they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.550" end="01:14:38.650" style="s2">sort the kids into teams and then they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.190" end="01:14:41.500" style="s2">let them play a few demo games and if</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.650" end="01:14:44.200" style="s2">any team was getting stomped flat or any</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.500" end="01:14:45.850" style="s2">other team was winning too much then</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.200" end="01:14:50.050" style="s2">they&#39;d rebalanced the team so that they</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.850" end="01:14:53.770" style="s2">were approximately equal in skill so</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.050" end="01:14:56.230" style="s2">that was the sorting of the teams so and</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.770" end="01:14:58.510" style="s2">then they then they were on their teams</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.230" end="01:15:00.220" style="s2">and then they play you know 15 games</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.510" end="01:15:02.770" style="s2">during the regular season they&#39;d have a</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.220" end="01:15:04.570" style="s2">little tournament to see who won and it</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.770" end="01:15:08.140" style="s2">was really good it was good friendly</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.570" end="01:15:10.360" style="s2">League and so my son&#39;s team was in I</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.140" end="01:15:13.420" style="s2">think it was the championship game if I</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.360" end="01:15:16.060" style="s2">remember correctly and there&#39;s one kid</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.420" end="01:15:18.489" style="s2">on his team who was the best player on</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.060" end="01:15:20.660" style="s2">the team but by quite a margin you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.489" end="01:15:22.550" style="s2">he was very fast on his feet</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.660" end="01:15:23.900" style="s2">he could he could skate rings around a</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.550" end="01:15:27.370" style="s2">lot of the kids he was good at stick</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.900" end="01:15:31.250" style="s2">handling he was a good hockey player but</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.370" end="01:15:33.580" style="s2">he had some problems this kid one</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.250" end="01:15:35.750" style="s2">problem was he wouldn&#39;t pass the puck</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.580" end="01:15:37.040" style="s2">now you think well why the hell should</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.750" end="01:15:38.510" style="s2">you pass the puck if you had the best</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.040" end="01:15:42.440" style="s2">hockey player which is pretty much what</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.510" end="01:15:45.080" style="s2">he thought and the answer is well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.440" end="01:15:48.110" style="s2">part of a team right you want to be the</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.080" end="01:15:50.780" style="s2">best person on the team fair enough and</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.110" end="01:15:54.620" style="s2">you want to win the hockey game but you</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.780" end="01:15:57.890" style="s2">also want to what make your team mates</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.620" end="01:15:59.330" style="s2">better players how&#39;s that maybe you even</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.890" end="01:16:01.220" style="s2">want to make the people on other teams</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.330" end="01:16:03.560" style="s2">better players I mean I know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.220" end="01:16:06.050" style="s2">going a little bit too far but you</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.560" end="01:16:07.910" style="s2">certainly want to make your teammates</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.050" end="01:16:09.200" style="s2">better players and you might think well</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.910" end="01:16:11.170" style="s2">why would you do that because if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.200" end="01:16:14.600" style="s2">better then maybe you won&#39;t be the best</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.170" end="01:16:17.300" style="s2">well that&#39;s a boneheaded way of looking</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.600" end="01:16:19.310" style="s2">at the world because first of all if you</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.300" end="01:16:21.500" style="s2">amp up the competition around you maybe</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.310" end="01:16:24.080" style="s2">that&#39;ll motivate you to be even better</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.500" end="01:16:26.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s a hell of a way to win by</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.080" end="01:16:29.060" style="s2">making everyone else lose that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.720" end="01:16:32.480" style="s2">much of a victory and so if you have any</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.060" end="01:16:34.580" style="s2">sense you pass the damn puck even if</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.480" end="01:16:36.080" style="s2">you&#39;re the better player especially you</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.580" end="01:16:39.410" style="s2">especially do that let&#39;s say you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.080" end="01:16:43.370" style="s2">it comfortable two goal lead well then</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.410" end="01:16:46.220" style="s2">maybe you can risk taking the time away</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.370" end="01:16:48.710" style="s2">from that specific game to build up the</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.220" end="01:16:51.230" style="s2">confident confidence and ability of your</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.710" end="01:16:52.670" style="s2">teammates and then maybe everybody</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.230" end="01:16:55.070" style="s2">thinks that you&#39;re a bit of a leader and</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.670" end="01:16:56.210" style="s2">they make you team captain not even so</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.070" end="01:16:59.050" style="s2">much because you&#39;re the best hockey</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.210" end="01:17:02.390" style="s2">player but because well because why</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.050" end="01:17:03.620" style="s2">that&#39;s the question okay so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.390" end="01:17:05.360" style="s2">watching the game and it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.620" end="01:17:08.510" style="s2">exciting and it&#39;s real close game and</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.360" end="01:17:11.540" style="s2">it&#39;s like 3 2 3 and it&#39;s a minute left</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.510" end="01:17:13.730" style="s2">and the other team zips down the nice</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.540" end="01:17:18.050" style="s2">and scores a really brilliant goal and</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.730" end="01:17:19.370" style="s2">so my son&#39;s team loses except that they</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.050" end="01:17:22.190" style="s2">were in the championship and it was a</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.370" end="01:17:23.660" style="s2">really good game so you know whether or</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.190" end="01:17:26.390" style="s2">not they lost is not all that obvious</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.660" end="01:17:28.220" style="s2">they lost that game but you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.390" end="01:17:32.390" style="s2">a broader context to take into</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.220" end="01:17:34.159" style="s2">consideration ok so this kid the this</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.390" end="01:17:35.989" style="s2">the star goes</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.159" end="01:17:38.090" style="s2">off the ice and he takes his hockey</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.989" end="01:17:40.429" style="s2">stick and he smashes it on to the cement</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.090" end="01:17:42.619" style="s2">and he&#39;s all angry because as far as he</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.429" end="01:17:44.959" style="s2">was concerned he was robbed and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.619" end="01:17:46.699" style="s2">that&#39;s because of his useless teammates</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.959" end="01:17:48.860" style="s2">who he didn&#39;t really spend any time</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.699" end="01:17:51.320" style="s2">helping by the way and maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.860" end="01:17:53.150" style="s2">because the referees were unfair and who</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.320" end="01:17:56.179" style="s2">the hell knows why but it wasn&#39;t fair</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.150" end="01:18:01.360" style="s2">and his idiot farther rushes over to him</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.179" end="01:18:03.769" style="s2">and consoles him in on his loss and</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.360" end="01:18:09.439" style="s2">supports him in his notion that he was</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.769" end="01:18:16.789" style="s2">robbed and I thought you unspeakable son</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.439" end="01:18:19.489" style="s2">of a because he was an arrogant</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.789" end="01:18:22.579" style="s2">narcissist and it was way more important</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.489" end="01:18:25.189" style="s2">to him that he had a son who was a star</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.579" end="01:18:30.099" style="s2">than that he had a son who is a good</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.189" end="01:18:33.769" style="s2">person and that&#39;s absolutely inexcusable</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.099" end="01:18:37.369" style="s2">he made the wrong choice he sacrificed</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.769" end="01:18:40.999" style="s2">his son&#39;s soul in part to help him save</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.369" end="01:18:43.479" style="s2">face for a hockey game that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.999" end="01:18:43.479" style="s2">acceptable</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.719" end="01:18:49.849" style="s2">ok so here&#39;s what you tell your children</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.800" end="01:18:51.139" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter whether you win or</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.849" end="01:18:53.689" style="s2">lose it matters how you play the game</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.139" end="01:18:55.909" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what the father should</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.689" end="01:18:57.829" style="s2">have told the son and he should have</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.909" end="01:19:00.079" style="s2">meant it and even better he should have</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.829" end="01:19:01.969" style="s2">known what it meant but who knows what</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.079" end="01:19:03.559" style="s2">that means because you tell your</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.969" end="01:19:05.630" style="s2">children that and maybe they&#39;re not so</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.559" end="01:19:07.999" style="s2">happy because they lost a game and they</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.630" end="01:19:09.860" style="s2">look at you like you&#39;re an alien and</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.999" end="01:19:12.380" style="s2">they think well what the hell do you</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.860" end="01:19:14.269" style="s2">mean by that because obviously it</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.380" end="01:19:16.340" style="s2">matters whether you win and it does</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.269" end="01:19:18.590" style="s2">matter whether you win so what is it</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.340" end="01:19:19.849" style="s2">that you mean when you say that and your</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.590" end="01:19:22.459" style="s2">kid asks well what do you mean by that</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.849" end="01:19:28.340" style="s2">and you go well I don&#39;t know what it</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.459" end="01:19:31.209" style="s2">means but it&#39;s a good rule so what do</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.340" end="01:19:34.459" style="s2">you mean by that here&#39;s what you mean</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.209" end="01:19:36.079" style="s2">and it relates to rule 5 which is don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.459" end="01:19:37.459" style="s2">make your don&#39;t let your children do</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.079" end="01:19:39.169" style="s2">anything that makes you dislike them</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.459" end="01:19:41.150" style="s2">because other people will dislike them</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.169" end="01:19:42.889" style="s2">then and you don&#39;t want other people to</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.150" end="01:19:44.689" style="s2">dislike your children unless you want</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.889" end="01:19:47.840" style="s2">your children to inhabit a world where</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.689" end="01:19:49.610" style="s2">everyone dislikes them and maybe you do</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.840" end="01:19:50.869" style="s2">you don&#39;t like your children and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.610" end="01:19:52.639" style="s2">you don&#39;t like your children because you</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.869" end="01:19:54.500" style="s2">let them behave in ways that makes you</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.639" end="01:19:56.449" style="s2">not like them and so the way you take</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.500" end="01:19:57.739" style="s2">revenge is by not correcting them so</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.449" end="01:19:59.119" style="s2">that other people will punish them</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.739" end="01:20:01.219" style="s2">because you don&#39;t have the courage to</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.119" end="01:20:02.719" style="s2">discipline them and if you think that</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.219" end="01:20:04.429" style="s2">people don&#39;t play that game then you</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.719" end="01:20:07.070" style="s2">don&#39;t know much about people because</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.429" end="01:20:11.659" style="s2">they play that game all the time all</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.070" end="01:20:12.920" style="s2">right so it matters how you play the</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.659" end="01:20:15.110" style="s2">game it doesn&#39;t matter whether you win</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.920" end="01:20:16.940" style="s2">or lose let&#39;s take that apart well so</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.110" end="01:20:18.860" style="s2">the first thing is and this goes back to</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.940" end="01:20:22.070" style="s2">the idea the hierarchy is order a</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.860" end="01:20:24.889" style="s2">hierarchy and the answer is no it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.070" end="01:20:27.190" style="s2">set of all hierarchies or you could say</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.889" end="01:20:30.320" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s the set of all possible</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.190" end="01:20:32.000" style="s2">hierarchies because you know in a</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.320" end="01:20:33.320" style="s2">society at a given time there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.000" end="01:20:34.730" style="s2">hierarchies that function but that</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.320" end="01:20:37.760" style="s2">transforms and then there&#39;s new</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.730" end="01:20:40.730" style="s2">hierarchies that function the the</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.760" end="01:20:43.040" style="s2">specifics of the hierarchies change but</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.730" end="01:20:46.010" style="s2">the fact of the hierarchies remains and</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.040" end="01:20:48.500" style="s2">so you can imagine a hierarchy as a meta</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.010" end="01:20:51.170" style="s2">structure that consists of a multitude</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.500" end="01:20:53.510" style="s2">of possible hierarchies and that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.170" end="01:20:55.250" style="s2">to change as life continues and so what</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.510" end="01:20:58.190" style="s2">you want for your children is not to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.250" end="01:20:59.810" style="s2">the master of a hierarchy you want for</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.190" end="01:21:03.290" style="s2">your children to be the master of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.810" end="01:21:04.849" style="s2">set of all possible hierarchies because</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.290" end="01:21:07.580" style="s2">then no matter how things change they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.849" end="01:21:09.800" style="s2">ready say well how is it that you get</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.580" end="01:21:12.349" style="s2">ready for things to change and the</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.800" end="01:21:15.440" style="s2">answer is play so that people will</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.349" end="01:21:18.260" style="s2">invite you to play right and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.440" end="01:21:20.869" style="s2">rule for for children for raising</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.260" end="01:21:21.980" style="s2">children and it really it&#39;s a rule one</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.869" end="01:21:23.900" style="s2">of the things you can do with your</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.980" end="01:21:25.670" style="s2">children this is something good for men</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.900" end="01:21:27.650" style="s2">because men are more likely to do this</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.670" end="01:21:30.320" style="s2">than women although women can do it too</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.650" end="01:21:32.119" style="s2">but men are more likely to do it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.320" end="01:21:34.360" style="s2">really good for children to engage in</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.119" end="01:21:36.619" style="s2">rough-and-tumble play play fighting</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.360" end="01:21:39.320" style="s2">first of all if you have children and</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.619" end="01:21:41.840" style="s2">you&#39;ve played with them physically you</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.320" end="01:21:45.409" style="s2">know that they absolutely love it they</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.840" end="01:21:48.080" style="s2">will rough-and-tumble play with you</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.409" end="01:21:51.560" style="s2">until you are completely exhausted and</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.080" end="01:21:54.290" style="s2">they&#39;re not even vaguely ready to quit</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.560" end="01:21:56.810" style="s2">they have an inexhaustible hunger for it</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.290" end="01:21:59.960" style="s2">and they like it they like to be pushed</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.810" end="01:22:02.059" style="s2">to the edge so I knew this when I was a</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.960" end="01:22:03.949" style="s2">new father</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.059" end="01:22:07.010" style="s2">because I read work by a man named yak</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.949" end="01:22:08.479" style="s2">panksepp who was a genius an effective</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.010" end="01:22:10.639" style="s2">neuroscientist one of the world&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.479" end="01:22:12.139" style="s2">neuroscientists perhaps the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.639" end="01:22:13.609" style="s2">greatest neuroscientist although there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.139" end="01:22:15.099" style="s2">four or five people that might compete</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.609" end="01:22:17.449" style="s2">with him he wrote a book called</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.099" end="01:22:19.069" style="s2">affective neuroscience emotional</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.449" end="01:22:21.499" style="s2">neuroscience which is a work of real</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.069" end="01:22:23.089" style="s2">genius he discovered the play circuit in</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.499" end="01:22:25.129" style="s2">mammals because there&#39;s a separate play</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.089" end="01:22:27.739" style="s2">circuit in mammals a specialized circuit</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.129" end="01:22:29.599" style="s2">and he did a lot of work on rats and</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.739" end="01:22:31.280" style="s2">showing that in order for a rat to</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.599" end="01:22:33.439" style="s2">become socialized because rats are</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.280" end="01:22:35.719" style="s2">highly social they had to engage in</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.439" end="01:22:38.089" style="s2">iterative bouts of rough-and-tumble play</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.719" end="01:22:40.999" style="s2">and here&#39;s a cool thing it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.089" end="01:22:43.280" style="s2">ridiculously cool thing so and this has</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.999" end="01:22:46.059" style="s2">to do in some sense with the postmodern</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.280" end="01:22:48.879" style="s2">critique of the patriarchal tyranny so</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.059" end="01:22:54.889" style="s2">if you take to juvenile rats</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.879" end="01:22:57.409" style="s2">males and you imagine you give them an</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.889" end="01:22:58.819" style="s2">opportunity to play so you throw two of</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.409" end="01:23:02.300" style="s2">them into a little play arena and you</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.819" end="01:23:04.939" style="s2">let the wrestle okay the next time that</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.300" end="01:23:06.679" style="s2">you bring them to the same place you can</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.939" end="01:23:09.079" style="s2">measure how much work they&#39;ll do to open</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.679" end="01:23:11.599" style="s2">the door to the arena how many times</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.079" end="01:23:14.030" style="s2">they&#39;ll push a button say to open the</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.599" end="01:23:16.159" style="s2">door or haw-haw-haw hard they&#39;ll pull if</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.030" end="01:23:18.260" style="s2">you tie a strength spring to their tail</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.159" end="01:23:20.239" style="s2">and so you can get an estimate of their</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.260" end="01:23:21.739" style="s2">motivation because the more motivated</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.239" end="01:23:24.800" style="s2">they are to play the harder they&#39;ll work</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.739" end="01:23:27.319" style="s2">and rats will work really hard to play</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.800" end="01:23:29.119" style="s2">so you know that they want to play I</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.319" end="01:23:30.889" style="s2">mean assuming that you&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.119" end="01:23:32.389" style="s2">accept the fact that if you work for</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.889" end="01:23:34.879" style="s2">something you want it it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.389" end="01:23:39.319" style="s2">operational definition so rats will work</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.879" end="01:23:41.419" style="s2">to play now if you let the rats out in</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.319" end="01:23:43.189" style="s2">the play arena and one rat is ten</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.419" end="01:23:45.769" style="s2">percent bigger than the other then that</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.189" end="01:23:47.749" style="s2">rat will win you might say well what</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.769" end="01:23:49.010" style="s2">does winning mean and rats wrestle like</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.749" end="01:23:51.469" style="s2">people wrestle</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.010" end="01:23:53.359" style="s2">they even pin each other and they</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.469" end="01:23:54.949" style="s2">manifest play behavior to begin with</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.359" end="01:23:56.749" style="s2">like dogs playing in a park you know how</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.949" end="01:23:58.909" style="s2">a dog looks when it wants to play it</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.749" end="01:24:01.550" style="s2">sort of hunkers down a little bit looks</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.909" end="01:24:03.319" style="s2">up at you like expectance expectantly</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.550" end="01:24:06.439" style="s2">kind of move back and forth which is</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.319" end="01:24:07.939" style="s2">like okay human I&#39;m ready to play and if</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.439" end="01:24:09.619" style="s2">you have any sense and you know how to</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.939" end="01:24:10.969" style="s2">play then you look at the dog and you</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.619" end="01:24:11.659" style="s2">sort of go like this and the dog goes</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.969" end="01:24:14.719" style="s2">like this</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.659" end="01:24:15.949" style="s2">and you cuff the dog not too hard and</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.719" end="01:24:17.719" style="s2">the dog bites you</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.949" end="01:24:19.909" style="s2">not too hard and then you can play and</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.719" end="01:24:21.769" style="s2">you&#39;re both happy with that and kids can</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.909" end="01:24:24.079" style="s2">do that with dogs because kids</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.769" end="01:24:26.239" style="s2">understand dogs and dogs and kids know</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.079" end="01:24:28.489" style="s2">how to play if if your dog can&#39;t play</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.239" end="01:24:30.139" style="s2">then you should not own a dog because</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.489" end="01:24:33.679" style="s2">you&#39;re not smart enough to own a dog</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.139" end="01:24:38.110" style="s2">so it&#39;s true and if you have a dog that</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.679" end="01:24:38.110" style="s2">can&#39;t play then don&#39;t have a kid right</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.039" end="01:24:50.030" style="s2">it&#39;s true the stupidest dog I ever saw</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.139" end="01:24:54.860" style="s2">was owned by a psychologist that was</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.030" end="01:24:57.320" style="s2">really embarrassing so okay so you put</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.860" end="01:24:59.420" style="s2">the rat two rats together and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.320" end="01:25:02.090" style="s2">the 10% bigger rod and there&#39;s the 10%</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.420" end="01:25:05.150" style="s2">smaller rat and the 10% bigger rat</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.090" end="01:25:08.269" style="s2">stomps the small rat and pins him so he</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.150" end="01:25:11.050" style="s2">wins and so now you&#39;re a postmodernist</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.269" end="01:25:13.729" style="s2">doing the experiment and you say</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.050" end="01:25:16.699" style="s2">powerful tyrannical rat dominates</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.729" end="01:25:19.309" style="s2">hierarchy really really that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.699" end="01:25:21.889" style="s2">conclude end of experiment and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.309" end="01:25:26.030" style="s2">and it looks correct because powerful</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.889" end="01:25:31.639" style="s2">dominant rat dominated and one it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.030" end="01:25:34.249" style="s2">okay except for one thing rats live with</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.639" end="01:25:36.499" style="s2">rats they don&#39;t wander they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.249" end="01:25:38.449" style="s2">psychopathic individuals wandering from</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.499" end="01:25:41.809" style="s2">isolated community to isolated community</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.449" end="01:25:43.219" style="s2">they know all the other rats and that</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.809" end="01:25:45.800" style="s2">means they have to keep playing with</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.219" end="01:25:49.070" style="s2">them and the rules for playing with</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.800" end="01:25:51.709" style="s2">someone thirty times are not the same as</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.070" end="01:25:55.070" style="s2">the rules for playing with someone once</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.709" end="01:25:57.860" style="s2">so panksepp had the rats play repeatedly</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.070" end="01:25:59.599" style="s2">and what he observed was okay now the</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.860" end="01:26:01.670" style="s2">next time you put those rats together</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.599" end="01:26:04.400" style="s2">the situation is a little different</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.670" end="01:26:06.769" style="s2">the little rat comes bouncing out and</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.400" end="01:26:09.139" style="s2">does the playful dog thing too the big</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.769" end="01:26:11.630" style="s2">rat so now the rule is you&#39;re the little</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.139" end="01:26:13.909" style="s2">rat you lost you have to be the creature</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.630" end="01:26:15.949" style="s2">that invites to play that&#39;s now your</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.909" end="01:26:17.690" style="s2">status so you bounce around and you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.949" end="01:26:19.309" style="s2">the big rats all cool and he&#39;s smoking a</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.690" end="01:26:21.619" style="s2">cigarette and doesn&#39;t want to doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.309" end="01:26:23.030" style="s2">want to play but he&#39;ll flick it away at</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.619" end="01:26:25.189" style="s2">some point and think all right what the</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.030" end="01:26:27.469" style="s2">hell you know and so then he gets in it</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.189" end="01:26:29.030" style="s2">and so he can stomp the little rat again</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.469" end="01:26:31.430" style="s2">because he&#39;s a bigger rat</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.030" end="01:26:34.190" style="s2">if the big rat doesn&#39;t let the little</p>

<p begin="01:26:34.190" end="01:26:40.370" style="s2">play boats then the little rat won&#39;t ask</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.810" end="01:26:42.560" style="s2">him to play anymore you think well if</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.370" end="01:26:44.240" style="s2">you think about you don&#39;t think so what</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.560" end="01:26:46.130" style="s2">you don&#39;t think why did yo King Sepp</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.240" end="01:26:47.900" style="s2">waste his time studying playing rats you</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.130" end="01:26:49.820" style="s2">think oh my god that&#39;s an absolute</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.900" end="01:26:51.950" style="s2">miracle because it shows you that</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.820" end="01:26:54.020" style="s2">there&#39;s an ethic of fair play that</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.950" end="01:26:57.860" style="s2">emerges as a consequence of repeated</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.020" end="01:27:00.980" style="s2">bouts of play even among rats it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.860" end="01:27:03.500" style="s2">basic it isn&#39;t even human that ethic the</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.980" end="01:27:06.470" style="s2">ethic of fair play is deeper than human</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.500" end="01:27:09.830" style="s2">it&#39;s real and it&#39;s the ethic that</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.470" end="01:27:11.750" style="s2">governs iterated interactions and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.830" end="01:27:13.700" style="s2">not just in rats that we&#39;ve seen this so</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.750" end="01:27:15.560" style="s2">you know chimpanzees are pretty damn</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.700" end="01:27:17.480" style="s2">brutal they&#39;re way more brutal than you</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.560" end="01:27:19.760" style="s2">think and they&#39;re really really strong</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.480" end="01:27:22.640" style="s2">maybe six times as strong as an adult</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.760" end="01:27:24.830" style="s2">male now there&#39;s the estimates vary but</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.640" end="01:27:26.570" style="s2">they&#39;re plenty strong enough to tear you</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.830" end="01:27:28.730" style="s2">to bits and that happens now and then</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.570" end="01:27:31.250" style="s2">people have chimps for pets and they</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.730" end="01:27:33.260" style="s2">become adults and it&#39;s like don&#39;t mess</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.250" end="01:27:36.280" style="s2">with the chimp because it&#39;ll tear you to</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.260" end="01:27:38.360" style="s2">pieces and so and chimps are brutal and</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.280" end="01:27:41.600" style="s2">this is interesting because they&#39;re our</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.360" end="01:27:44.060" style="s2">closest relatives and so Jane Goodall</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.600" end="01:27:46.370" style="s2">discovered in the 1970s that rats our</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.060" end="01:27:49.070" style="s2">tribe or chimps are tribal they live in</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.370" end="01:27:51.530" style="s2">tribal groups like we do and they have a</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.070" end="01:27:53.180" style="s2">territory that&#39;s the known territory and</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.530" end="01:27:55.430" style="s2">there&#39;s a perimeter that&#39;s the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.180" end="01:27:58.700" style="s2">that&#39;s chaos and other chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.430" end="01:28:01.160" style="s2">inhabit the chaos foreign chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.700" end="01:28:03.650" style="s2">and the juvenile chimps patrol the</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.160" end="01:28:07.220" style="s2">perimeters in groups of four or five and</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.650" end="01:28:08.900" style="s2">if they spy us a foreign chimp or two of</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.220" end="01:28:10.610" style="s2">them if they outnumber them because they</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.900" end="01:28:13.700" style="s2">can&#39;t count but they have a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.610" end="01:28:15.710" style="s2">quantity if five chimps come across to</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.700" end="01:28:18.290" style="s2">foreign chimps they will tear them to</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.710" end="01:28:21.590" style="s2">bits and I actually mean that literally</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.290" end="01:28:23.660" style="s2">that&#39;s what they do and chimps also hunt</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.590" end="01:28:25.460" style="s2">they hunt colobus monkeys and they weigh</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.660" end="01:28:27.380" style="s2">about 40 pounds and they&#39;re quite</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.460" end="01:28:29.960" style="s2">carnivorous and they will eat them alive</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.380" end="01:28:32.980" style="s2">well they&#39;re screaming so there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.960" end="01:28:35.120" style="s2">lot of empathy regulating chimp</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.980" end="01:28:36.740" style="s2">aggression which is something to think</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.120" end="01:28:38.840" style="s2">about when you think about human beings</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.740" end="01:28:40.550" style="s2">because it&#39;s not obvious what regulates</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.840" end="01:28:42.949" style="s2">our aggression and you might think well</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.550" end="01:28:45.230" style="s2">it&#39;s your conscience and like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.949" end="01:28:47.120" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s your conscience and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.230" end="01:28:49.429" style="s2">it&#39;s something else if you read the book</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.120" end="01:28:51.410" style="s2">of you read The Rape of Nanking for</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.429" end="01:28:53.090" style="s2">example and you&#39;ll start wondering very</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.410" end="01:28:56.000" style="s2">very rapidly about whether people have</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.090" end="01:28:58.760" style="s2">any conscience at all so that&#39;s a story</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.000" end="01:29:01.280" style="s2">of absolutely atrocious Japanese</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.760" end="01:29:03.710" style="s2">behavior in China at at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.280" end="01:29:05.690" style="s2">World War two it&#39;s a horrifying book so</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.710" end="01:29:10.610" style="s2">read it with caution but it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.690" end="01:29:12.500" style="s2">instructive so anyways the chimps the</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.610" end="01:29:14.540" style="s2">chimps are very brutal creatures and so</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.500" end="01:29:16.130" style="s2">you might think well let&#39;s look at a</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.540" end="01:29:17.239" style="s2">chimp hierarchy because chimps have</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.130" end="01:29:19.130" style="s2">dominance hierarchies and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.239" end="01:29:22.040" style="s2">basically male-dominated although there</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.130" end="01:29:24.410" style="s2">are lots of powerful female chimps say</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.040" end="01:29:26.900" style="s2">ok who becomes the dominant chimp and</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.410" end="01:29:29.330" style="s2">the answer might be and this would be</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.900" end="01:29:33.739" style="s2">the postmodern answer the most powerful</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.330" end="01:29:35.210" style="s2">tyrannical brutal chimp rules because</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.739" end="01:29:37.850" style="s2">its power that moves you up the</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.210" end="01:29:39.830" style="s2">hierarchy it&#39;s like that happens</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.850" end="01:29:42.770" style="s2">sometimes among chimps but you know what</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.830" end="01:29:47.260" style="s2">happens to tyrant chimps they have an</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.770" end="01:29:51.080" style="s2">off day and to subordinate chimps each</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.260" end="01:29:53.570" style="s2">3/4 the size gang up to make a one and a</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.080" end="01:29:57.590" style="s2">half super chimp and then they tear him</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.570" end="01:30:01.210" style="s2">to pieces right so here&#39;s the rule if</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.590" end="01:30:04.190" style="s2">you&#39;re a chimp tyrants meet bloody ends</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.210" end="01:30:07.190" style="s2">so how do you conduct yourself as a</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.190" end="01:30:09.320" style="s2">chimp if you want to be at the top of</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.190" end="01:30:11.060" style="s2">the hierarchy and have preferential</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.320" end="01:30:13.040" style="s2">access to the things that being at the</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.060" end="01:30:16.910" style="s2">top of the hierarchy would give you an</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.040" end="01:30:20.060" style="s2">answer is engage in mutually reciprocal</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.910" end="01:30:21.890" style="s2">interactions with your peers the chimps</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.060" end="01:30:23.630" style="s2">that rise to the top that stay there</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.890" end="01:30:25.940" style="s2">stabili and also have the most stable</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.630" end="01:30:27.830" style="s2">functioning troops by the way are the</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.940" end="01:30:29.870" style="s2">ones that have friends that are</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.830" end="01:30:31.610" style="s2">long-term and permanent and engage in</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.870" end="01:30:33.440" style="s2">reciprocal interactions not only with</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.610" end="01:30:37.239" style="s2">their friends but also with the females</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.440" end="01:30:40.190" style="s2">and the infants and so even among chimps</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.239" end="01:30:42.110" style="s2">patriarchal tyranny a is not the norm</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.190" end="01:30:45.080" style="s2">and B is not the proper mode of</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.110" end="01:30:47.870" style="s2">approaching the situation and so that</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.080" end="01:30:49.699" style="s2">speaks to a broader ethic the same kind</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.870" end="01:30:52.160" style="s2">of ethic that is spoken to with regards</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.699" end="01:30:53.090" style="s2">to the rat studies of play behavior and</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.160" end="01:30:56.150" style="s2">you can see this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.090" end="01:30:57.409" style="s2">throughout the animal kingdom there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.150" end="01:30:59.090" style="s2">there&#39;s a pattern of reciprocal</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.409" end="01:31:01.760" style="s2">interaction that seems to stabilize</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.090" end="01:31:04.100" style="s2">social animals that isn&#39;t predicated on</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.760" end="01:31:07.280" style="s2">brute force now maybe the simpler the</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.100" end="01:31:09.409" style="s2">animal the more its predicated on brute</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.280" end="01:31:11.320" style="s2">force but we are by no means simple</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.409" end="01:31:13.969" style="s2">animals and the idea that our</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.320" end="01:31:16.580" style="s2">hierarchies are fundamentally tyrannical</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.969" end="01:31:20.090" style="s2">the patriarchy which is a word that</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.580" end="01:31:23.900" style="s2">nobody who thinks carefully should ever</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.090" end="01:31:25.940" style="s2">use casually that term is predicated on</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.900" end="01:31:27.860" style="s2">the idea that hey that our hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.940" end="01:31:30.320" style="s2">are tyrannical which they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.860" end="01:31:32.449" style="s2">although they can become that way and be</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.320" end="01:31:34.730" style="s2">that the most reliable means to</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.449" end="01:31:37.190" style="s2">attaining status within a hierarchy is</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.730" end="01:31:40.909" style="s2">through the expression of power and both</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.190" end="01:31:42.980" style="s2">of those things are wrong they&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.909" end="01:31:45.110" style="s2">and nonetheless that&#39;s the primary</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.980" end="01:31:48.140" style="s2">theory of the social sciences and the</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.110" end="01:31:50.630" style="s2">humanities enough of that we&#39;ve we have</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.140" end="01:31:53.900" style="s2">enough data to indicate that none of</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.630" end="01:31:56.150" style="s2">that&#39;s sufficiently sophisticated to</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.900" end="01:31:58.909" style="s2">constitute a reasonable explanation of</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.150" end="01:32:01.159" style="s2">the world so we should dispense with it</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.909" end="01:32:03.380" style="s2">as fast as possible all it&#39;s doing is</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.159" end="01:32:04.969" style="s2">dividing us into tribes and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.380" end="01:32:15.739" style="s2">solving the problems that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.969" end="01:32:24.020" style="s2">hypothetically intended to solve so ok</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.739" end="01:32:26.360" style="s2">so now back to the question so there</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.020" end="01:32:29.390" style="s2">isn&#39;t a hierarchy there&#39;s a set of</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.360" end="01:32:31.580" style="s2">hierarchies and it&#39;s like the set of</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.390" end="01:32:33.679" style="s2">games so here&#39;s what you&#39;re telling your</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.580" end="01:32:36.140" style="s2">child when you say doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.679" end="01:32:37.580" style="s2">whether you win or lose it matters how</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.140" end="01:32:41.989" style="s2">you play the game what you&#39;re telling</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.580" end="01:32:44.300" style="s2">them is life is not a game it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.989" end="01:32:46.310" style="s2">a sequence of the same games it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.300" end="01:32:49.340" style="s2">multiple sequences of different games</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.310" end="01:32:52.159" style="s2">and if you want to be a successful</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.340" end="01:32:54.199" style="s2">player in the set of multiple sequence</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.159" end="01:32:57.230" style="s2">of different games then you have to</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.199" end="01:32:59.239" style="s2">adopt a higher order ethic and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.230" end="01:33:03.199" style="s2">subordinate that ethic to victory in any</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.239" end="01:33:06.590" style="s2">one game ever so you put the manner in</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.199" end="01:33:08.900" style="s2">which you play above your victory in in</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.590" end="01:33:09.920" style="s2">each instance and the reason that that</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.900" end="01:33:11.900" style="s2">produces</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.920" end="01:33:14.150" style="s2">the best possible outcome for you is</p>

<p begin="01:33:33.440" end="01:33:38.679" style="s2">going to deal with a lot of different</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.000" end="01:33:43.040" style="s2">people single people like individuals</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.679" end="01:33:46.100" style="s2">groups of people children and adults and</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.040" end="01:33:48.679" style="s2">what they have to be prepared for is to</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.100" end="01:33:51.650" style="s2">interact with that set of people in the</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.679" end="01:33:53.719" style="s2">best possible manner because and so what</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.650" end="01:33:55.639" style="s2">do you want well let&#39;s say your child&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.719" end="01:33:57.679" style="s2">too and it&#39;s still pretty egocentric</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.639" end="01:34:00.199" style="s2">because children shoot two-year-olds are</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.679" end="01:34:02.090" style="s2">quite egocentric they can&#39;t share yet</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.199" end="01:34:04.340" style="s2">they don&#39;t really learn how to share in</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.090" end="01:34:06.469" style="s2">any technical sense till they&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.340" end="01:34:11.600" style="s2">three it&#39;s hard for them to learn to</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.469" end="01:34:13.820" style="s2">share between two and four they learn to</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.600" end="01:34:16.159" style="s2">share and to play and the way they learn</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.820" end="01:34:17.510" style="s2">is by at least in part by engaging in</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.159" end="01:34:20.119" style="s2">reciprocal interactions with their</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.510" end="01:34:21.560" style="s2">parents now what is it that it what is</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.119" end="01:34:24.560" style="s2">it that&#39;s your job when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.560" end="01:34:26.540" style="s2">socializing a child who&#39;s 2 to 4 you</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.560" end="01:34:28.850" style="s2">have to do it between the ages of 2 &amp; 4</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.540" end="01:34:31.190" style="s2">by the way because if you don&#39;t manage</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.850" end="01:34:33.199" style="s2">it by the time they&#39;re 4 then you might</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.190" end="01:34:34.940" style="s2">as well give up because it isn&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.199" end="01:34:36.619" style="s2">to happen and the literature on</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.940" end="01:34:39.050" style="s2">antisocial behavior in children is</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.619" end="01:34:42.590" style="s2">crystal clear on this point if your</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.050" end="01:34:44.840" style="s2">child&#39;s antisocial at 4 you&#39;ve failed</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.590" end="01:34:45.409" style="s2">and there isn&#39;t anything that can be</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.840" end="01:34:48.280" style="s2">done about it</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.409" end="01:34:50.810" style="s2">it&#39;s a dismal literature and believe me</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.280" end="01:34:52.460" style="s2">psychologists and sociologists and</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.810" end="01:34:55.190" style="s2">anthropologists and criminologists have</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.460" end="01:34:57.830" style="s2">tried for like six decades to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.190" end="01:35:00.199" style="s2">how to remediate antisocial behavior in</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.830" end="01:35:05.570" style="s2">older children and adolescents and they</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.199" end="01:35:09.739" style="s2">haven&#39;t managed it so so between 2 &amp; 4</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.570" end="01:35:11.330" style="s2">is crucial you want to help your child</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.739" end="01:35:13.730" style="s2">become the sort of person that other</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.330" end="01:35:15.170" style="s2">children want to play with and the</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.730" end="01:35:18.230" style="s2">reason you want to do that is because</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.170" end="01:35:21.050" style="s2">from 4 onward other children are the</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.230" end="01:35:22.849" style="s2">primary agents of socialization and so</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.050" end="01:35:23.770" style="s2">if your children are accepted by other</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.849" end="01:35:25.510" style="s2">children</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.770" end="01:35:27.010" style="s2">then they&#39;re on their way because other</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.510" end="01:35:28.420" style="s2">children will socialize them doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.010" end="01:35:31.120" style="s2">mean you&#39;re not important as a parent</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.420" end="01:35:33.010" style="s2">but it means they find their peers who</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.120" end="01:35:35.650" style="s2">are at the same developmental level as</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.010" end="01:35:37.480" style="s2">them and they start to reciprocally</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.650" end="01:35:39.880" style="s2">socialize one another and they do that</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.480" end="01:35:42.780" style="s2">through play and so if you&#39;ve prepared</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.880" end="01:35:45.280" style="s2">your child to be a great play companion</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.780" end="01:35:46.960" style="s2">then you can just stand back and let it</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.280" end="01:35:48.880" style="s2">happen and you have to be around when</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.960" end="01:35:50.200" style="s2">something breaks down when the system</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.880" end="01:35:52.090" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work properly you have to be</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.200" end="01:35:53.950" style="s2">there as a resource but basically you</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.090" end="01:35:55.870" style="s2">can sort of push them out onto the</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.950" end="01:35:59.190" style="s2">playground and say you know you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.870" end="01:36:01.450" style="s2">what to do go play and play is of</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.190" end="01:36:04.780" style="s2">absolutely crucial importance as</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.450" end="01:36:07.690" style="s2">documented by people like Jean Piaget so</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.780" end="01:36:09.760" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to make your child</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.690" end="01:36:11.710" style="s2">maximally attractive as a play partner</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.760" end="01:36:14.380" style="s2">and the ethic there is well the world is</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.710" end="01:36:17.530" style="s2">made out of a sequence of hierarchies</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.380" end="01:36:19.930" style="s2">that transform and so you want your</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.530" end="01:36:21.990" style="s2">child to be the sort of person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.930" end="01:36:26.380" style="s2">invited to participate in whatever</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.990" end="01:36:28.690" style="s2">hierarchy organizes itself and how and</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.380" end="01:36:32.380" style="s2">what should a child be like to do that</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.690" end="01:36:35.350" style="s2">well they have to be reciprocal take</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.380" end="01:36:37.690" style="s2">turns right you don&#39;t always get to pick</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.350" end="01:36:39.820" style="s2">the game you have to find out what other</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.690" end="01:36:41.380" style="s2">people want to do they have to want to</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.820" end="01:36:44.620" style="s2">play - like there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.380" end="01:36:46.330" style="s2">sophisticated ethical rules that go</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.620" end="01:36:47.800" style="s2">around play and you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.330" end="01:36:49.360" style="s2">playing with some of you have played</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.800" end="01:36:51.850" style="s2">with kids that aren&#39;t fun to play with</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.360" end="01:36:54.340" style="s2">well what are they like if something</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.850" end="01:36:55.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go their way what happens they</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.340" end="01:36:58.360" style="s2">have an emotional outburst so they</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.720" end="01:37:00.940" style="s2">revert to the behavior of a ill-prepared</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.360" end="01:37:03.340" style="s2">two-year-old they have a temper tantrum</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.940" end="01:37:06.910" style="s2">they burst into tears they thrash around</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.340" end="01:37:08.800" style="s2">on the floor it&#39;s not fun because when</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.910" end="01:37:11.440" style="s2">you play if you don&#39;t lose sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.800" end="01:37:12.760" style="s2">then no one else ever wins so who the</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.440" end="01:37:13.060" style="s2">hell is gonna play with someone like</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.760" end="01:37:17.680" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.060" end="01:37:20.320" style="s2">a downtrodden victim that&#39;s all it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.680" end="01:37:21.430" style="s2">no kid with any sense is gonna put up</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.320" end="01:37:24.220" style="s2">with that all they didn&#39;t this is</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.430" end="01:37:26.680" style="s2">exactly what kids are like if they find</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.220" end="01:37:29.140" style="s2">out that their potential play partner is</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.680" end="01:37:31.090" style="s2">a whiny two-year-old even though</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.140" end="01:37:33.400" style="s2">therefore they just stop playing and</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.090" end="01:37:35.620" style="s2">they go find another kid that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.400" end="01:37:37.360" style="s2">what happens and so if you want that for</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.620" end="01:37:37.659" style="s2">your kid then make sure that their whiny</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.360" end="01:37:39.489" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.659" end="01:37:41.110" style="s2">better every time they lose a good way</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.489" end="01:37:43.719" style="s2">to do that is to never let them lose it</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.110" end="01:37:45.820" style="s2">anything so they don&#39;t get any practice</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.719" end="01:37:49.209" style="s2">well I don&#39;t want my kid to lose it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.820" end="01:37:51.070" style="s2">like wrong you don&#39;t want to you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.209" end="01:37:53.889" style="s2">want your kid to lose in an</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.070" end="01:37:55.389" style="s2">unsophisticated manner that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.889" end="01:37:57.219" style="s2">same thing at all if you think the way</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.389" end="01:38:01.689" style="s2">you accomplish that is by never having</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.219" end="01:38:03.130" style="s2">your kid lose then well then well then</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.689" end="01:38:13.030" style="s2">we&#39;re back to the you shouldn&#39;t even own</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.130" end="01:38:15.909" style="s2">a dog problem all right so then you</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.030" end="01:38:18.400" style="s2">might take apart what does it mean to be</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.909" end="01:38:20.229" style="s2">a desirable play partner assuming you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.400" end="01:38:22.119" style="s2">gonna play reciprocal repeated games</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.229" end="01:38:24.610" style="s2">across all sorts of different contexts</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.119" end="01:38:27.099" style="s2">well there&#39;s a there&#39;s a whole ethic</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.610" end="01:38:29.469" style="s2">that emerges from that see Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.099" end="01:38:31.179" style="s2">back in the late 1800s he was the first</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.469" end="01:38:33.309" style="s2">person to kind of caught on to this sort</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.179" end="01:38:35.409" style="s2">of thing because until then people</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.309" end="01:38:38.050" style="s2">tended to think of morality as something</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.409" end="01:38:41.260" style="s2">that was invented rationally and then</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.050" end="01:38:43.929" style="s2">imposed from the top down but Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.260" end="01:38:45.699" style="s2">being a very intelligent observer noted</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.929" end="01:38:48.820" style="s2">that well that wasn&#39;t really the case</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.699" end="01:38:52.030" style="s2">there was a ethic already built into</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.820" end="01:38:54.159" style="s2">human interactions that we all acted out</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.030" end="01:38:56.110" style="s2">but that we didn&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.159" end="01:38:59.499" style="s2">very well so here&#39;s a way to think about</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.110" end="01:39:01.959" style="s2">that so imagine you&#39;re watching a wolf</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.499" end="01:39:05.439" style="s2">pack and wolves compete for dominance</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.959" end="01:39:07.389" style="s2">and so the way they do that is they</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.439" end="01:39:09.099" style="s2">basically have a play fight about it now</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.389" end="01:39:11.739" style="s2">it&#39;s this fairly serious play fight and</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.099" end="01:39:13.300" style="s2">so two wolves that are engaged in a</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.739" end="01:39:15.849" style="s2">dominus dispute will sort of sand</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.300" end="01:39:17.650" style="s2">sideways to each other you know how cats</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.849" end="01:39:20.829" style="s2">do that you ever watched two cats fight</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.650" end="01:39:22.539" style="s2">cats stand sideways think well why does</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.829" end="01:39:25.150" style="s2">a cat stand sideways when it&#39;s fighting</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.539" end="01:39:28.059" style="s2">it&#39;s because a sideways cat is a bigger</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.150" end="01:39:29.769" style="s2">cat than a head-on cat so the cats</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.059" end="01:39:32.110" style="s2">trying to intimidate the other cat so it</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.769" end="01:39:34.150" style="s2">stands sideways then it puffs itself up</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.110" end="01:39:35.590" style="s2">including its tail and the reason it</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.150" end="01:39:38.169" style="s2">does that is so that it looks bigger</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.590" end="01:39:40.539" style="s2">because one cat isn&#39;t there cats don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.169" end="01:39:43.479" style="s2">want to fight they want to threaten</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.539" end="01:39:45.070" style="s2">until one cat backs down and so they</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.479" end="01:39:46.959" style="s2">puff themselves up and they make</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.070" end="01:39:48.459" style="s2">horrible noises and they face off</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.959" end="01:39:50.709" style="s2">against each other but they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.459" end="01:39:51.610" style="s2">to fight because the two cats that are</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.709" end="01:39:53.260" style="s2">fighting might damage</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.610" end="01:39:56.050" style="s2">each other then a third cat comes in and</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.260" end="01:39:58.869" style="s2">like winds it&#39;s a stupid strategy so</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.050" end="01:39:59.980" style="s2">it&#39;s it is so most animals don&#39;t like to</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.869" end="01:40:02.020" style="s2">fight because they might damage</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.980" end="01:40:04.600" style="s2">themselves and then another interloper</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.020" end="01:40:05.889" style="s2">will just win it&#39;s a stupid strategy and</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.600" end="01:40:08.260" style="s2">human beings are quite a bit like that</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.889" end="01:40:09.940" style="s2">we do a lot of posturing and defensive</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.260" end="01:40:11.590" style="s2">display and aggressive display and all</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.940" end="01:40:13.420" style="s2">that but we don&#39;t fight very often for</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.590" end="01:40:15.010" style="s2">that for the same reasons and it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.420" end="01:40:24.310" style="s2">when those other mechanisms break down</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.010" end="01:40:26.770" style="s2">that we actually fight so what happens</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.310" end="01:40:31.420" style="s2">in a wolf dispute is this the Wolves</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.770" end="01:40:33.850" style="s2">square off and they amp up the threats</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.420" end="01:40:35.500" style="s2">in the hope that one of the wolves will</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.850" end="01:40:37.600" style="s2">back to hell down because what will</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.500" end="01:40:39.760" style="s2">happen is the wolf will chicken out one</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.600" end="01:40:44.199" style="s2">of them and then when it does it rolls</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.760" end="01:40:46.810" style="s2">over and shows its neck why well because</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.199" end="01:40:48.850" style="s2">when wolves hunt they go for the neck</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.810" end="01:40:50.260" style="s2">generally like wolves are quite cruel</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.850" end="01:40:53.530" style="s2">creatures in some sense and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.260" end="01:40:55.810" style="s2">actually eat moose standing up but</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.530" end="01:40:57.280" style="s2">generally speaking if they can manage it</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.810" end="01:40:59.290" style="s2">they go through for the throat and</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.280" end="01:41:02.219" style="s2">they&#39;ll bring the animal down and so</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.290" end="01:41:05.199" style="s2">what the wolf is basically saying is</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.219" end="01:41:08.199" style="s2">well you scared me half to death I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.199" end="01:41:10.389" style="s2">useful Moo I&#39;m a useless moose you might</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.199" end="01:41:13.360" style="s2">as well tear out my neck and the other</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.389" end="01:41:15.580" style="s2">wolf says yeah you&#39;re pretty detestable</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.360" end="01:41:17.920" style="s2">and you&#39;re kind of like a moose but I</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.580" end="01:41:20.199" style="s2">might need you to hunt tomorrow so I</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.920" end="01:41:20.590" style="s2">know I could tear out your neck but I</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.199" end="01:41:24.070" style="s2">won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.590" end="01:41:25.630" style="s2">and then the defeated wolf stands up and</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.070" end="01:41:27.369" style="s2">he&#39;s not very happy and he&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.630" end="01:41:30.610" style="s2">low status wolf but at least he&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.369" end="01:41:32.619" style="s2">got his neck and the victor wolf gets to</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.610" end="01:41:34.630" style="s2">be high status wolf and he gets to go</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.619" end="01:41:37.060" style="s2">hunting with his partner the next day</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.630" end="01:41:40.630" style="s2">and so you might think well wolves have</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.060" end="01:41:43.510" style="s2">a complex procedural morality and the</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.630" end="01:41:45.760" style="s2">morality is don&#39;t tear the neck out of</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.510" end="01:41:48.219" style="s2">your out of the purr of out of the</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.760" end="01:41:50.050" style="s2">creature you defeat that&#39;s wrong and</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.219" end="01:41:52.270" style="s2">then you might say well that&#39;s the rule</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.050" end="01:41:53.380" style="s2">that wolves follow but that&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.270" end="01:41:55.540" style="s2">because wolves don&#39;t follow rules</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.380" end="01:41:56.889" style="s2">because wolves don&#39;t have rules because</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.540" end="01:41:59.889" style="s2">they don&#39;t have language and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.889" end="01:42:02.920" style="s2">think not like us they act like they</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.889" end="01:42:05.160" style="s2">have rules they act so that if you watch</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.920" end="01:42:07.800" style="s2">them act you could label</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.160" end="01:42:11.190" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing with the rule that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.800" end="01:42:15.930" style="s2">how we got our rules that&#39;s how we got</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.190" end="01:42:18.630" style="s2">our rules we acted out an ethic and then</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.930" end="01:42:21.120" style="s2">we watched and then we coated it in</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.630" end="01:42:23.310" style="s2">stories that&#39;s what our religious</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.120" end="01:42:25.950" style="s2">stories are they&#39;re the consequence of</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.310" end="01:42:28.290" style="s2">us watching what it is that we do when</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.950" end="01:42:30.060" style="s2">we act ethically and then transforming</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.290" end="01:42:32.730" style="s2">that into a story and everyone&#39;s intent</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.060" end="01:42:34.620" style="s2">on that story it&#39;s absolutely intent on</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.730" end="01:42:36.510" style="s2">the story of good versus evil let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.620" end="01:42:37.920" style="s2">because that&#39;s the fundamental story and</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.510" end="01:42:39.570" style="s2">why do you want to watch that story</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.920" end="01:42:41.250" style="s2">because you want to know how to be the</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.570" end="01:42:43.470" style="s2">victor in the set of all possible games</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.250" end="01:42:45.300" style="s2">and that&#39;s what that story&#39;s about and</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.470" end="01:42:46.590" style="s2">that&#39;s what movies are about and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.300" end="01:42:48.510" style="s2">what books are about and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.590" end="01:42:50.370" style="s2">religious narratives are about that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.510" end="01:42:52.950" style="s2">what everything that grips us at a</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.370" end="01:42:55.080" style="s2">literary level is about and the reason</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.950" end="01:42:56.790" style="s2">that it grips us is because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.080" end="01:42:59.730" style="s2">the world is made of and that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.790" end="01:43:01.250" style="s2">need to know so then you might think so</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.730" end="01:43:04.650" style="s2">here&#39;s something to think about</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.250" end="01:43:06.630" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you a symbolic representation</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.650" end="01:43:09.480" style="s2">of this okay so there&#39;s this idea in</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.630" end="01:43:12.330" style="s2">Christianity and I&#39;m not talking about</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.480" end="01:43:13.740" style="s2">this from a religious perspective okay</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.330" end="01:43:16.020" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about this from an</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.740" end="01:43:21.510" style="s2">anthropological perspective or a</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.020" end="01:43:23.010" style="s2">biological perspective or a that&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.510" end="01:43:25.080" style="s2">an anthropological or a viola or</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.010" end="01:43:28.200" style="s2">psychological perspective so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.080" end="01:43:31.160" style="s2">this idea in Christianity that Christ is</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.200" end="01:43:34.560" style="s2">whatever Christ is is the king of kings</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.160" end="01:43:35.900" style="s2">okay so I&#39;m gonna take that apart so</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.560" end="01:43:38.310" style="s2">imagine that you have a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.900" end="01:43:41.100" style="s2">whatever it is and there&#39;s someone at</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.310" end="01:43:42.870" style="s2">the top of it and so that&#39;s person has</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.100" end="01:43:44.700" style="s2">the attributes necessary to be at the</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.870" end="01:43:46.110" style="s2">top of that hierarchy maybe it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.700" end="01:43:49.500" style="s2">hockey team and you go home and you tell</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.110" end="01:43:52.290" style="s2">a story about how the best hockey player</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.500" end="01:43:53.910" style="s2">on your team played while they were</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.290" end="01:43:55.950" style="s2">being the best hockey player it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.910" end="01:43:57.900" style="s2">little hero narrative it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.950" end="01:44:03.180" style="s2">fragment of a hero narrative and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.900" end="01:44:05.820" style="s2">it&#39;s hockey soccer plumbing law business</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.180" end="01:44:08.430" style="s2">art there&#39;s all these hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.820" end="01:44:11.070" style="s2">then there&#39;s the thing that&#39;s at the top</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.430" end="01:44:12.900" style="s2">of all of them and the thing that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.070" end="01:44:15.690" style="s2">that at the top of all of them has</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.900" end="01:44:17.580" style="s2">something in common that&#39;s whatever it</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.690" end="01:44:19.490" style="s2">is that&#39;s in common across all the</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.580" end="01:44:22.110" style="s2">things that are at the top</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.490" end="01:44:22.740" style="s2">so imagine this okay so you could think</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.110" end="01:44:25.590" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.740" end="01:44:27.870" style="s2">imagine that you&#39;re a novelist and you</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.590" end="01:44:29.760" style="s2">want to distill some characters and you</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.870" end="01:44:30.990" style="s2">want a good evil character because what</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.760" end="01:44:33.090" style="s2">the hell good is your book without a</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.990" end="01:44:35.010" style="s2">good evil character and you want a good</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.090" end="01:44:36.720" style="s2">good character because the same problem</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.010" end="01:44:40.620" style="s2">place you don&#39;t want to just tell a</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.720" end="01:44:44.160" style="s2">story about some guy&#39;s day right you</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.620" end="01:44:46.770" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say well John woke up at 6</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.160" end="01:44:48.990" style="s2">and then he smacked his lips four times</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.770" end="01:44:51.210" style="s2">and blinked 20 times and then he swung</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.990" end="01:44:53.070" style="s2">his feet over across the bed and walked</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.210" end="01:44:55.740" style="s2">into the bathroom because who cares</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.070" end="01:44:58.020" style="s2">about any of that you don&#39;t need to know</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.740" end="01:45:00.360" style="s2">that because you know how to move your</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.020" end="01:45:03.120" style="s2">mouth and COFF and walk to the bathroom</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.360" end="01:45:05.190" style="s2">it&#39;s not helpful you want a distillation</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.120" end="01:45:06.780" style="s2">you want the novelist who have watched a</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.190" end="01:45:09.540" style="s2">bunch of people and abstracted out</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.780" end="01:45:11.400" style="s2">someone who&#39;s good in a way that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.540" end="01:45:13.350" style="s2">across a bunch of people and you want</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.400" end="01:45:15.600" style="s2">them to have abstracted out someone</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.350" end="01:45:17.160" style="s2">who&#39;s evil that&#39;s abstract across a</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.600" end="01:45:18.660" style="s2">bunch of evil characters so you see that</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.160" end="01:45:20.610" style="s2">in Hamlet for example you see that</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.660" end="01:45:22.860" style="s2">Dostoyevsky where the where the</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.610" end="01:45:24.330" style="s2">characters are bigger than life and you</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.860" end="01:45:26.610" style="s2">want them bigger than life because you</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.330" end="01:45:28.530" style="s2">want it distilled so that you can learn</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.610" end="01:45:29.300" style="s2">from it and what you&#39;re learning is that</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.530" end="01:45:32.130" style="s2">ethic</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.300" end="01:45:33.810" style="s2">okay so then imagine that you have a</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.130" end="01:45:35.910" style="s2">hundred of hierarchies just mundane</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.810" end="01:45:38.040" style="s2">hierarchies then you take the people at</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.910" end="01:45:40.070" style="s2">the top of all those hierarchies say</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.040" end="01:45:42.620" style="s2">that you grouped them into groups of ten</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.070" end="01:45:44.550" style="s2">okay so you take ten admirable people</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.620" end="01:45:46.290" style="s2">and then you say well we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.550" end="01:45:48.480" style="s2">average across them and we&#39;re gonna come</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.290" end="01:45:51.300" style="s2">out with the most out with a composite</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.480" end="01:45:53.910" style="s2">admirable person made out of those ten</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.300" end="01:45:55.320" style="s2">you have a hundred to begin with so you</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.910" end="01:45:56.730" style="s2">let&#39;s say you have a thousand to begin</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.320" end="01:45:58.530" style="s2">with you distill them to a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.730" end="01:46:00.390" style="s2">admirable people then you take that</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.530" end="01:46:03.330" style="s2">hundred admirable people and you distill</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.390" end="01:46:05.070" style="s2">them into ten and then you take those</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.330" end="01:46:07.800" style="s2">ten admirable people and you distill</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.070" end="01:46:09.690" style="s2">them into one and what that one is is</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.800" end="01:46:12.960" style="s2">what&#39;s admirable across the entire set</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.690" end="01:46:15.930" style="s2">of admirable people that&#39;s a divine</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.960" end="01:46:18.420" style="s2">figure in a mythological story that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.930" end="01:46:20.760" style="s2">what it is and so the Christian idea is</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.420" end="01:46:22.710" style="s2">Christ is the king of kings and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.760" end="01:46:25.440" style="s2">what it means you go into a cathedral</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.710" end="01:46:27.780" style="s2">and the cathedral is a cross by the way</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.440" end="01:46:30.390" style="s2">and the cross is the place where</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.780" end="01:46:32.700" style="s2">suffering is accepted and the cross is a</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.390" end="01:46:34.800" style="s2">dome over it then that&#39;s the sky</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.700" end="01:46:36.990" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s an idea in the Cathedral</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.800" end="01:46:39.060" style="s2">and the idea is that the place of the</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.990" end="01:46:41.730" style="s2">Cross which is where suffering occurs is</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.060" end="01:46:43.350" style="s2">the center of the universe which is the</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.730" end="01:46:45.450" style="s2">dome and then you look up at the dome</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.350" end="01:46:45.870" style="s2">and you see this figure staring down at</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.450" end="01:46:48.720" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.870" end="01:46:51.810" style="s2">that&#39;s the king of kings and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.720" end="01:46:55.410" style="s2">to behave in the world that&#39;s what that</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.810" end="01:46:57.030" style="s2">image represents and you think well what</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.410" end="01:47:00.530" style="s2">does it mean well here&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.030" end="01:47:03.210" style="s2">unpacking it and this is associated with</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.530" end="01:47:05.340" style="s2">its associated with the idea of how to</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.210" end="01:47:08.700" style="s2">behave across the set of all possible</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.340" end="01:47:11.010" style="s2">hierarchies well what should you do well</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.700" end="01:47:13.190" style="s2">according to rule one you should stand</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.010" end="01:47:16.560" style="s2">up straight with your shoulders back</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.190" end="01:47:18.150" style="s2">okay now the people who&#39;ve been some of</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.560" end="01:47:20.040" style="s2">the people who&#39;ve been criticizing me</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.150" end="01:47:22.170" style="s2">say well because I point out that</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.040" end="01:47:24.780" style="s2">hierarchies exist I&#39;m justifying them</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.170" end="01:47:28.260" style="s2">it&#39;s like pointing out that something</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.780" end="01:47:30.510" style="s2">exists is not the same as justifying it</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.260" end="01:47:32.820" style="s2">it&#39;s just pointing out that it exists</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.510" end="01:47:34.980" style="s2">and pointing it out that it exists</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.820" end="01:47:37.710" style="s2">without justifying it is certainly not</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.980" end="01:47:40.530" style="s2">saying that the way to attain dominance</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.710" end="01:47:41.280" style="s2">in a hierarchy is through power which is</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.530" end="01:47:43.410" style="s2">the other thing that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.280" end="01:47:46.200" style="s2">criticized for which is not what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.410" end="01:47:48.000" style="s2">saying in fact I&#39;m not saying that no</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.200" end="01:47:50.370" style="s2">I&#39;m not even saying that a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.000" end="01:47:52.710" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly the opposite of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.370" end="01:47:54.480" style="s2">saying say well if you stand up straight</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.710" end="01:47:58.020" style="s2">with your shoulders back isn&#39;t that a</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.480" end="01:48:01.590" style="s2">powerful stance and the answer is well</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.020" end="01:48:04.170" style="s2">actually no a powerful stance is this</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.590" end="01:48:07.230" style="s2">right well not really because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.170" end="01:48:09.750" style="s2">very good at it but high if I knew what</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.230" end="01:48:11.580" style="s2">I was doing this would be it and I put</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.750" end="01:48:14.220" style="s2">myself sideways so I&#39;m ooh not much of a</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.580" end="01:48:17.280" style="s2">target and I&#39;m ready for attack okay</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.220" end="01:48:19.800" style="s2">that&#39;s not this stance this dance is</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.280" end="01:48:22.620" style="s2">different right and that isn&#39;t this</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.800" end="01:48:24.600" style="s2">stance either this is a defensive Crouch</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.620" end="01:48:28.230" style="s2">this is what happens if you&#39;re depressed</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.600" end="01:48:30.630" style="s2">and anxious right this dance is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.230" end="01:48:33.750" style="s2">willing to take what the world throws at</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.630" end="01:48:35.160" style="s2">me right and that might be the trials</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.750" end="01:48:37.260" style="s2">and tribulations that are associated</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.160" end="01:48:39.210" style="s2">with the hierarchy because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.260" end="01:48:41.100" style="s2">tough battle in and of itself but it</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.210" end="01:48:42.780" style="s2">also might be all the terrible unknown</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.100" end="01:48:45.900" style="s2">things that are going to come your way</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.780" end="01:48:46.500" style="s2">and what&#39;s the right attitude stand the</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.900" end="01:48:49.880" style="s2">hell up</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.500" end="01:48:52.530" style="s2">with some courage and take it right</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.880" end="01:48:54.420" style="s2">voluntarily with courage so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.530" end="01:48:57.740" style="s2">actually a stance of maximal</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.420" end="01:49:00.930" style="s2">vulnerability vulnerability adopted</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.740" end="01:49:03.360" style="s2">voluntarily that&#39;s what the crucifix</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.930" end="01:49:05.880" style="s2">represents just so you know it</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.360" end="01:49:07.710" style="s2">represents the willingness to take on</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.880" end="01:49:10.830" style="s2">the suffering of the world voluntarily</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.710" end="01:49:12.630" style="s2">the whole thing and that&#39;s associated</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.830" end="01:49:15.810" style="s2">with what&#39;s ever at the top of the</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.630" end="01:49:18.510" style="s2">hierarchy so the idea is the best</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.810" end="01:49:20.250" style="s2">possible strategy that you have to be</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.510" end="01:49:22.770" style="s2">successful across the set of all</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.250" end="01:49:24.690" style="s2">possible hierarchies is to maximally</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.770" end="01:49:27.360" style="s2">accept the fact that your vote that</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.690" end="01:49:30.030" style="s2">you&#39;re vulnerable to accept that as the</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.360" end="01:49:31.890" style="s2">price of being and that&#39;s the essential</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.030" end="01:49:33.930" style="s2">message it&#39;s not only the message of</p>

<p begin="01:49:33.930" end="01:49:39.000" style="s2">sort of idea expressed in all sorts of</p>

<p begin="01:49:48.660" end="01:49:53.570" style="s2">that place and the answer is with one</p>

<p begin="01:49:53.570" end="01:49:58.650" style="s2">that&#39;s the line down the middle</p>

<p begin="01:50:32.720" end="01:50:36.150" style="s2">associated with that is a certain</p>

<p begin="01:52:15.510" end="01:52:19.920" style="s2">that you&#39;re not everything you could be</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.750" end="01:52:22.500" style="s2">you know that because the people that</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.920" end="01:52:25.230" style="s2">you admire are people who manifest</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.500" end="01:52:27.240" style="s2">courage in the diarist of straights and</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.230" end="01:52:29.100" style="s2">you know that as well because when you</p>

<p begin="01:52:29.100" end="01:52:33.210" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.850" end="01:52:35.670" style="s2">they shame you that speaks to your</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.210" end="01:52:37.590" style="s2">deepest possible instinct you know what</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.670" end="01:52:39.870" style="s2">you could be and you know to that you</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.590" end="01:52:41.970" style="s2">see people contend with situations that</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.870" end="01:52:43.980" style="s2">are so difficult that it&#39;s truly a</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.970" end="01:52:46.140" style="s2">miracle that they can contend with them</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.980" end="01:52:47.610" style="s2">you know and I think of people well I</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.140" end="01:52:49.770" style="s2">think of people who work in funeral</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.610" end="01:52:53.550" style="s2">homes that&#39;s a good example that&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.770" end="01:52:55.650" style="s2">right that&#39;s death and grief every day</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.550" end="01:52:58.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s not something that you can</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.650" end="01:53:00.210" style="s2">avoid it&#39;s like it&#39;s right there it&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.200" end="01:53:03.720" style="s2">real as it can possibly be I&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.210" end="01:53:07.830" style="s2">a story about that tonight a client who</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.720" end="01:53:10.800" style="s2">was very afraid of being alive and she</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.830" end="01:53:12.210" style="s2">wanted to sleep all the time and she</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.800" end="01:53:14.039" style="s2">took sleeping pills and all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.210" end="01:53:17.789" style="s2">other things so that she could have</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.039" end="01:53:20.639" style="s2">the burden of being conscious and she</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.789" end="01:53:22.079" style="s2">was a very good dreamer and she she</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.639" end="01:53:26.159" style="s2">wasn&#39;t doing well in university and she</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.079" end="01:53:28.499" style="s2">had a dream one night that gypsy told</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.159" end="01:53:30.030" style="s2">her that she was actually lucid during</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.499" end="01:53:32.339" style="s2">her dreams by the way and she could ask</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.030" end="01:53:34.139" style="s2">her dream characters what they meant and</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.339" end="01:53:36.959" style="s2">they would tell her which was something</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.139" end="01:53:39.629" style="s2">I&#39;d never seen anyone else manage in any</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.959" end="01:53:41.219" style="s2">case she jumped of this gypsy that she</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.629" end="01:53:43.409" style="s2">met in the forest and the Gypsy told her</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.219" end="01:53:44.519" style="s2">that unless she learned to unless she</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.409" end="01:53:47.519" style="s2">could learn to work in a slaughterhouse</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.519" end="01:53:49.679" style="s2">she&#39;d never finished her degree and so</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.519" end="01:53:52.229" style="s2">she told me that story no no no if you</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.679" end="01:53:53.760" style="s2">know this but the classic treatment for</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.229" end="01:53:55.969" style="s2">people who are afraid of things is to</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.760" end="01:53:58.199" style="s2">expose them to what they&#39;re afraid of</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.969" end="01:54:00.569" style="s2">which is a good lesson if you have</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.199" end="01:54:02.280" style="s2">children because you want to expose your</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.569" end="01:54:04.079" style="s2">children to challenges because that</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.280" end="01:54:06.059" style="s2">makes them stronger it has to be done</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.079" end="01:54:07.859" style="s2">voluntarily but if you have</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.059" end="01:54:10.260" style="s2">post-traumatic stress disorder let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.859" end="01:54:12.689" style="s2">you&#39;re the victim of a vicious sexual</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.260" end="01:54:14.099" style="s2">assault by a stranger and two years</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.689" end="01:54:16.859" style="s2">later you have post-traumatic stress</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.099" end="01:54:18.989" style="s2">disorder the most effective treatment is</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.859" end="01:54:21.239" style="s2">to get you to relive the experience in</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.989" end="01:54:23.010" style="s2">as much vivid detail as you possibly can</p>
<p begin="01:54:21.239" end="01:54:25.349" style="s2">and experience all the emotions that</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.010" end="01:54:28.079" style="s2">occurred while it was happening and if</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.349" end="01:54:29.339" style="s2">if you do that the more upset you get</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.079" end="01:54:31.109" style="s2">when you do that if you do it</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.339" end="01:54:33.780" style="s2">voluntarily the faster you get better</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.109" end="01:54:35.039" style="s2">and the longer you stay better and so</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.780" end="01:54:37.289" style="s2">it&#39;s a general rule of thumb in</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.039" end="01:54:39.379" style="s2">psychotherapy is if someone&#39;s avoiding</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.289" end="01:54:42.569" style="s2">something find out what they&#39;re avoiding</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.379" end="01:54:44.639" style="s2">break it into manageable pieces and have</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.569" end="01:54:47.219" style="s2">them voluntarily expose themselves to it</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.639" end="01:54:49.519" style="s2">and they they will be cured and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.219" end="01:54:53.189" style="s2">the dragon fight in in clinical practice</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.519" end="01:54:54.780" style="s2">find what you most want to what you most</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.189" end="01:54:57.389" style="s2">need will be found where you least want</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.780" end="01:55:01.739" style="s2">to look right that&#39;s a hell of a</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.389" end="01:55:03.569" style="s2">statement so she told me this dream and</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.739" end="01:55:06.899" style="s2">I thought well I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.569" end="01:55:08.399" style="s2">arrange for you to work in a</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.899" end="01:55:10.709" style="s2">slaughterhouse that doesn&#39;t seem like</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.399" end="01:55:12.359" style="s2">very she wouldn&#39;t eat meat by the way</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.709" end="01:55:14.069" style="s2">she wouldn&#39;t go into a butcher store I</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.359" end="01:55:16.919" style="s2">took her into a butcher store once and</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.069" end="01:55:17.789" style="s2">she had a very catastrophic reaction she</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.919" end="01:55:22.019" style="s2">couldn&#39;t handle it</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.789" end="01:55:23.489" style="s2">anyways I said why we can&#39;t arrange the</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.019" end="01:55:26.129" style="s2">slaughterhouse thing why don&#39;t you go</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.489" end="01:55:27.629" style="s2">away and for a while and come back in a</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.129" end="01:55:27.900" style="s2">week and see if you can come up with a</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.629" end="01:55:31.199" style="s2">No</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.900" end="01:55:34.650" style="s2">turn ative so she came back and she said</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.199" end="01:55:37.380" style="s2">I want to see an embalming and I thought</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.650" end="01:55:39.900" style="s2">oh god okay how the hell am I gonna</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.380" end="01:55:41.400" style="s2">arrange that so I phoned a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.900" end="01:55:43.500" style="s2">funeral homes and I said look I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.400" end="01:55:47.250" style="s2">this person who&#39;s really afraid of death</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.500" end="01:55:49.890" style="s2">and she had this dream and I told them</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.250" end="01:55:53.310" style="s2">the story and they said no problem bring</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.890" end="01:55:57.300" style="s2">her in and so I wasn&#39;t looking forward</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.310" end="01:55:58.409" style="s2">to this by the way so we went and she</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.300" end="01:56:00.030" style="s2">was very very nervous</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.409" end="01:56:02.550" style="s2">because she certainly didn&#39;t think she</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.030" end="01:56:04.140" style="s2">could handle that and you know I as I</p>
<p begin="01:56:02.550" end="01:56:06.210" style="s2">said already I wasn&#39;t exactly thrilled</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.140" end="01:56:08.100" style="s2">about it either but in for a pound in</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.210" end="01:56:10.620" style="s2">for a penny in for a pound as they say</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.100" end="01:56:13.050" style="s2">so anyways we went to the funeral parlor</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.620" end="01:56:14.640" style="s2">and they showed us around and we asked a</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.050" end="01:56:16.500" style="s2">bunch of questions like how the hell did</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.640" end="01:56:18.540" style="s2">they cope with their jobs because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.500" end="01:56:20.070" style="s2">just a mystery to me and they said well</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.540" end="01:56:21.719" style="s2">it was actually really useful for them</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.070" end="01:56:24.120" style="s2">to guide people through the process of</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.719" end="01:56:25.380" style="s2">grief and that their experience was that</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.120" end="01:56:30.060" style="s2">that had given them a renewed</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.380" end="01:56:31.409" style="s2">appreciation for life which is well that</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.060" end="01:56:33.060" style="s2">would account for why they were able to</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.409" end="01:56:35.630" style="s2">do it because it seems like a very hard</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.060" end="01:56:40.050" style="s2">job and so we went into this room and</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.630" end="01:56:41.580" style="s2">watched this embalming and I was about 8</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.050" end="01:56:43.320" style="s2">feet away from this small room it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.580" end="01:56:46.320" style="s2">pretty gruesome operation as you might</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.320" end="01:56:48.120" style="s2">imagine and my client was sitting beside</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.320" end="01:56:50.190" style="s2">me and I was watching her and watching</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.120" end="01:56:52.489" style="s2">the embalming as well and for the first</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.190" end="01:56:55.530" style="s2">while she was just looking to the side</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.489" end="01:56:57.860" style="s2">which was I&#39;m not here and I certainly</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.530" end="01:57:01.170" style="s2">can&#39;t handle that and no bloody wonder</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.860" end="01:57:03.239" style="s2">literally and so but then she would take</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.170" end="01:57:06.120" style="s2">the odd glance say she&#39;d go like this</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.239" end="01:57:08.790" style="s2">and then look away and then as the</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.120" end="01:57:10.560" style="s2">minutes ticked by but fairly rapidly she</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.790" end="01:57:12.960" style="s2">was spending more time watching and less</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.560" end="01:57:15.540" style="s2">time looking away until she was finally</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.960" end="01:57:17.010" style="s2">doing nothing but watching and then at</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.540" end="01:57:18.810" style="s2">some point she asked if she could come</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.010" end="01:57:20.670" style="s2">in and and put her hand on the body and</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.810" end="01:57:22.590" style="s2">so they gave her a glove and she did</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.670" end="01:57:24.510" style="s2">that and then she went and sat down and</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.590" end="01:57:28.140" style="s2">she was quite quiet about all this and</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.510" end="01:57:30.570" style="s2">quite quiet afterwards and well so what</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.140" end="01:57:33.260" style="s2">did she discover well she didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.570" end="01:57:36.420" style="s2">discover the death was wasn&#39;t horrible</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.260" end="01:57:38.100" style="s2">she didn&#39;t discover that and she didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.420" end="01:57:41.100" style="s2">discover the death wasn&#39;t terrifying</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.100" end="01:57:41.760" style="s2">because it certainly was but what she</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.100" end="01:57:43.019" style="s2">did discover</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.760" end="01:57:46.199" style="s2">that she was a hell of a lot tougher</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.019" end="01:57:48.300" style="s2">than she thought and and much quicker</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.199" end="01:57:53.300" style="s2">than she would have believed and she</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.300" end="01:57:56.730" style="s2">went away thinking huh look at that I</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.300" end="01:58:00.750" style="s2">did the thing I was most afraid of doing</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.730" end="01:58:03.360" style="s2">and Here I am and not only am I not more</p>
<p begin="01:58:00.750" end="01:58:06.409" style="s2">damaged than I was I&#39;m actually better</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.360" end="01:58:09.090" style="s2">than I was and so from then on she had a</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.409" end="01:58:10.760" style="s2">reference point right which is an</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.090" end="01:58:13.469" style="s2">interesting thing I think this is why</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.760" end="01:58:14.940" style="s2">primordial people initiate there</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.469" end="01:58:16.500" style="s2">especially their young men because it</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.940" end="01:58:18.420" style="s2">sort of happens automatically with young</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.500" end="01:58:19.880" style="s2">women they expose their young men to</p>

<p begin="01:58:25.650" end="01:58:29.579" style="s2">terrifying and what&#39;s just sort of</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.510" end="01:58:31.769" style="s2">normal catastrophe because you really</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.579" end="01:58:33.750" style="s2">need to know that right because you need</p>

<p begin="01:58:35.219" end="01:58:41.760" style="s2">of that exposure was that she could</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.920" end="01:58:43.050" style="s2">prevail despite the realities of life of</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.760" end="01:58:46.260" style="s2">course that&#39;s what you want to teach</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.050" end="01:58:47.280" style="s2">your children mostly by example is that</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.260" end="01:58:50.250" style="s2">they can prevail</p>

<p begin="01:58:50.250" end="01:58:53.610" style="s2">that also means that you have to have</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.900" end="01:58:55.380" style="s2">admitted to what the realities of life</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.610" end="01:58:59.369" style="s2">are but the thing that&#39;s so interesting</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.380" end="01:59:00.900" style="s2">about that here&#39;s another story so you</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.369" end="01:59:04.559" style="s2">know the story of King Arthur and the</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.900" end="01:59:06.960" style="s2">Holy Grail the Holy Grail is the</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.559" end="01:59:09.539" style="s2">ultimate value that&#39;s it&#39;s a symbol of</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.960" end="01:59:11.340" style="s2">whatever the ultimate value is and King</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.539" end="01:59:13.199" style="s2">Arthur assembles his knights around the</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.340" end="01:59:15.989" style="s2">round table it&#39;s a round table because</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.199" end="01:59:18.300" style="s2">they&#39;re all equal despite the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.989" end="01:59:20.130" style="s2">they have a king they sit as equals at</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.300" end="01:59:22.099" style="s2">the round table and they all decide to</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.130" end="01:59:25.019" style="s2">go off to seek for the Holy Grail</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.099" end="01:59:26.550" style="s2">it&#39;s either the cup that Christ drank</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.019" end="01:59:28.199" style="s2">out about the Last Supper or the cup</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.550" end="01:59:29.610" style="s2">that held his blood on the cross it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.199" end="01:59:31.920" style="s2">one of those two things it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.610" end="01:59:34.050" style="s2">really matter it&#39;s a symbol of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.920" end="01:59:36.539" style="s2">redemptive that&#39;s what the Holy Grail is</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.050" end="01:59:39.449" style="s2">so it&#39;s a representation of the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.539" end="01:59:41.630" style="s2">value the question is where do you go to</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.449" end="01:59:44.849" style="s2">seek out what&#39;s of ultimate value an</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.630" end="01:59:46.590" style="s2">answer in in the tale of the of King</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.849" end="01:59:48.690" style="s2">Arthur and the Holy Grail is that each</p>

<p begin="01:59:48.690" end="01:59:55.079" style="s2">began their search at the place that</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.849" end="01:59:55.590" style="s2">looked darkest to them so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.079" end="01:59:58.260" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.590" end="02:00:00.420" style="s2">is that it&#39;s necessary if you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.260" end="02:00:04.380" style="s2">to stand up straight with your shoulders</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.420" end="02:00:07.380" style="s2">back to confront the darkness of the</p>

<p begin="02:00:16.890" end="02:00:21.750" style="s2">means it means it&#39;s your bloody problem</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.960" end="02:00:24.600" style="s2">and to confront Satan in the desert is</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.750" end="02:00:26.280" style="s2">the same idea is that not only do you</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.600" end="02:00:28.560" style="s2">have to take on the tragedy of the world</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.280" end="02:00:30.360" style="s2">as if it&#39;s your responsibility but you</p>

<p begin="02:01:52.820" end="02:01:57.760" style="s2">very impressive we went to the house</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.770" end="02:02:00.830" style="s2">today where Gorbachev and Reagan met in</p>

<p begin="02:02:25.159" end="02:02:29.330" style="s2">achievement so that&#39;s what I think I</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.770" end="02:02:33.920" style="s2">think that almost all the time when I</p>
<p begin="02:02:29.330" end="02:02:35.540" style="s2">come to a European country it&#39;s amazing</p>

<p begin="02:03:17.330" end="02:03:20.869" style="s2">explanations are there for this</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.340" end="02:03:24.809" style="s2">phenomenon</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.869" end="02:03:26.280" style="s2">well I think there&#39;s you know we could</p>
<p begin="02:03:24.809" end="02:03:36.150" style="s2">start with what I might be contributing</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.280" end="02:03:38.280" style="s2">to it you know one thing I&#39;ve had to</p>
<p begin="02:03:36.150" end="02:03:44.670" style="s2">learn I&#39;ve had some interactions with</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.280" end="02:03:46.679" style="s2">public exposure for probably it&#39;s 15</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.670" end="02:03:50.309" style="s2">years because I worked a little bit with</p>
<p begin="02:03:46.679" end="02:03:57.929" style="s2">a public television station in Ontario</p>
<p begin="02:03:50.309" end="02:03:59.730" style="s2">before all this blew up my producer who</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.929" end="02:04:01.820" style="s2">is someone who was very much on my side</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.730" end="02:04:05.699" style="s2">so I worked for a public affairs show</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.820" end="02:04:07.320" style="s2">first of all as a regular panelist and</p>
<p begin="02:04:05.699" end="02:04:13.909" style="s2">then as a columnist for a couple of</p>
<p begin="02:04:07.320" end="02:04:17.070" style="s2">years my producer was a level-headed guy</p>
<p begin="02:04:13.909" end="02:04:20.429" style="s2">well-versed in what worked well in panel</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.070" end="02:04:24.539" style="s2">discussions told me to be very careful</p>
<p begin="02:04:20.429" end="02:04:27.420" style="s2">about controlling my proclivity towards</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.539" end="02:04:33.030" style="s2">anger because it doesn&#39;t play very well</p>
<p begin="02:04:27.420" end="02:04:34.710" style="s2">publicly and so you know I kept trying</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.030" end="02:04:37.199" style="s2">to learn the doctrine of minimal</p>
<p begin="02:04:34.710" end="02:04:39.389" style="s2">necessary force I mean I think that</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.199" end="02:04:41.999" style="s2">aggression is a good thing if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.389" end="02:04:43.949" style="s2">controlled I think it&#39;s a good antidote</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.999" end="02:04:46.110" style="s2">to fear I think it&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.949" end="02:04:49.469" style="s2">that can help you maintain your ground</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.110" end="02:04:52.349" style="s2">in the face of resistance but it has to</p>
<p begin="02:04:49.469" end="02:04:54.869" style="s2">be applied very very judiciously and it</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.349" end="02:04:57.780" style="s2">isn&#39;t obvious that I always do that as</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.869" end="02:05:00.989" style="s2">well as I might and if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.780" end="02:05:03.239" style="s2">deal with difficult and dangerous and</p>
<p begin="02:05:00.989" end="02:05:06.349" style="s2">contentious issues then you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.239" end="02:05:12.179" style="s2">get punished for your failures and so</p>
<p begin="02:05:06.349" end="02:05:14.639" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to learn to detach myself and</p>
<p begin="02:05:12.179" end="02:05:17.969" style="s2">to not not in that not in and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.639" end="02:05:21.360" style="s2">care away you know but in a watchful way</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.969" end="02:05:23.010" style="s2">and to keep all of that under control as</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.360" end="02:05:25.889" style="s2">much as possible and to use minimal</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.010" end="02:05:29.099" style="s2">necessary force and it&#39;s hard to learn</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.889" end="02:05:32.969" style="s2">to do that well and so to the degree</p>
<p begin="02:05:29.099" end="02:05:34.270" style="s2">that I don&#39;t do that then I instigate</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.969" end="02:05:38.020" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="02:05:34.270" end="02:05:40.420" style="s2">then I might now I have a hard time with</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.020" end="02:05:43.570" style="s2">that to some degree because I do find</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.420" end="02:05:54.910" style="s2">some of what I have been let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="02:05:43.570" end="02:05:57.760" style="s2">opposing what would you say I&#39;m it makes</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.910" end="02:06:01.420" style="s2">me deeply it disturbs me deeply and</p>
<p begin="02:05:57.760" end="02:06:03.040" style="s2">makes me unhappy and ashamed that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.420" end="02:06:06.010" style="s2">particularly the case when I see what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="02:07:26.350" end="02:07:31.030" style="s2">types or at least lean in that direction</p>
<p begin="02:07:28.140" end="02:07:33.730" style="s2">cannot conceptualize anything that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.030" end="02:07:35.710" style="s2">political in their world there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:07:33.730" end="02:07:37.870" style="s2">anything that isn&#39;t political one of the</p>

<p begin="02:07:37.870" end="02:07:46.160" style="s2">example is you know I&#39;ve been perhaps</p>
<p begin="02:07:43.950" end="02:07:48.440" style="s2">represented as an</p>
<p begin="02:07:46.160" end="02:07:49.960" style="s2">as an advocate of free speech and of</p>
<p begin="02:07:48.440" end="02:07:54.290" style="s2">course there&#39;s a lot of debate about</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.960" end="02:07:56.030" style="s2">what free speech really is from the</p>
<p begin="02:07:54.290" end="02:07:57.500" style="s2">radical leftist types and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:56.030" end="02:08:01.670" style="s2">something that you have to understand</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.500" end="02:08:04.490" style="s2">from the collectivist perspective that</p>
<p begin="02:08:01.670" end="02:08:08.030" style="s2">dominates the radical left there is no</p>
<p begin="02:08:04.490" end="02:08:11.330" style="s2">such thing as free speech it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="02:08:08.030" end="02:08:14.210" style="s2">they oppose it it&#39;s that it isn&#39;t a move</p>
<p begin="02:08:11.330" end="02:08:17.170" style="s2">in their game it doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="02:08:14.210" end="02:08:20.020" style="s2">so if you stand up and say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:08:17.170" end="02:08:24.680" style="s2">manifesting my opinion as an individual</p>
<p begin="02:08:20.020" end="02:08:28.670" style="s2">then that&#39;s not a acceptable move</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.680" end="02:08:32.170" style="s2">because you aren&#39;t an individual you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:08:28.670" end="02:08:35.420" style="s2">an avatar of your dominant group and</p>
<p begin="02:08:32.170" end="02:08:37.910" style="s2">whatever you utter regardless of why you</p>
<p begin="02:08:35.420" end="02:08:39.370" style="s2">think you&#39;re uttering it or regardless</p>
<p begin="02:08:37.910" end="02:08:41.900" style="s2">of whether you think it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.370" end="02:08:45.260" style="s2">individual opinion is nothing but a</p>
<p begin="02:08:41.900" end="02:08:47.480" style="s2">power move in your dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.260" end="02:08:49.310" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not like they oppose free</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.480" end="02:08:52.190" style="s2">speech it&#39;s that it doesn&#39;t exist in</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.310" end="02:08:54.920" style="s2">their conceptual framework and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:52.190" end="02:08:58.160" style="s2">one of the things that drives and they</p>
<p begin="02:08:54.920" end="02:09:00.890" style="s2">hit pieces because mmm I do believe in</p>
<p begin="02:08:58.160" end="02:09:02.750" style="s2">the individual and I do believe in free</p>
<p begin="02:09:00.890" end="02:09:05.600" style="s2">speech and I do believe in a world</p>
<p begin="02:09:02.750" end="02:09:08.660" style="s2">outside the conceptual realm all sorts</p>
<p begin="02:09:05.600" end="02:09:10.640" style="s2">of propositions that aren&#39;t part and</p>
<p begin="02:09:08.660" end="02:09:13.820" style="s2">parcel of the postmodernist /</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.640" end="02:09:16.880" style="s2">neo-marxist game and they&#39;re not very</p>
<p begin="02:09:13.820" end="02:09:20.120" style="s2">happy with that it&#39;s I&#39;m not playing by</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.880" end="02:09:22.400" style="s2">the rules and so they don&#39;t know what to</p>
<p begin="02:09:20.120" end="02:09:25.070" style="s2">do about that the simplest thing to do</p>
<p begin="02:09:22.400" end="02:09:28.160" style="s2">is to call me far-right or all right</p>
<p begin="02:09:25.070" end="02:09:29.720" style="s2">because then they can first of all</p>
<p begin="02:09:28.160" end="02:09:31.280" style="s2">that&#39;s an evil category and that</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.720" end="02:09:33.410" style="s2">dispenses with that but it also means</p>
<p begin="02:09:31.280" end="02:09:36.460" style="s2">they don&#39;t have to contend with any of</p>
<p begin="02:09:33.410" end="02:09:40.030" style="s2">my arguments and that&#39;s convenient so</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.460" end="02:09:44.420" style="s2">it&#39;s easier to demonize than it is to</p>
<p begin="02:09:40.030" end="02:09:47.270" style="s2">contend so it doesn&#39;t seem to help them</p>
<p begin="02:09:44.420" end="02:09:49.370" style="s2">because the more they scream the more</p>
<p begin="02:09:47.270" end="02:09:50.840" style="s2">people that actually listen to you hear</p>
<p begin="02:09:49.370" end="02:09:52.760" style="s2">that you&#39;re not far right</p>
<p begin="02:09:50.840" end="02:09:55.460" style="s2">you&#39;re not alright and they stop</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.760" end="02:09:56.930" style="s2">believing them well that&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="02:09:55.460" end="02:09:59.510" style="s2">thing like I&#39;ve talked with my wife</p>
<p begin="02:09:56.930" end="02:10:00.020" style="s2">about this because it&#39;s been in been its</p>
<p begin="02:09:59.510" end="02:10:02.810" style="s2">produced</p>
<p begin="02:10:00.020" end="02:10:05.420" style="s2">lot of tension are in our family because</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.810" end="02:10:06.770" style="s2">it&#39;s very stressful I mean for all sorts</p>
<p begin="02:10:05.420" end="02:10:08.810" style="s2">of reasons but that&#39;s certainly one of</p>
<p begin="02:10:06.770" end="02:10:11.200" style="s2">them you know I mean it&#39;s certainly not</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.810" end="02:10:14.900" style="s2">the case that when I read a head piece</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.200" end="02:10:17.300" style="s2">that I&#39;m very pleased about it and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:10:14.900" end="02:10:18.950" style="s2">often quite worried about it like the</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.300" end="02:10:22.880" style="s2">New York Times piece for example is a</p>
<p begin="02:10:18.950" end="02:10:24.370" style="s2">good example and it&#39;s idiot what would</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.880" end="02:10:28.420" style="s2">you call it</p>
<p begin="02:10:24.370" end="02:10:32.090" style="s2">insistence that I was promoting you know</p>
<p begin="02:10:28.420" end="02:10:34.760" style="s2">monogamy with the weapons of the state</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.090" end="02:10:38.300" style="s2">of all the insane ideas I mean who the</p>
<p begin="02:10:34.760" end="02:10:41.300" style="s2">hell believes that it&#39;s like some Isis</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.300" end="02:10:44.150" style="s2">guys that&#39;s about it so so it&#39;s an it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:41.300" end="02:10:46.370" style="s2">a completely absurd accusation and and</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.150" end="02:10:49.160" style="s2">it certainly bore no resemblance to</p>
<p begin="02:10:46.370" end="02:10:52.550" style="s2">anything that I meant but you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:49.160" end="02:10:54.290" style="s2">a powerful media organization and lots</p>
<p begin="02:10:52.550" end="02:10:55.880" style="s2">of people warn me in the immediate</p>
<p begin="02:10:54.290" end="02:10:59.270" style="s2">aftermath of that that it would be my</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.880" end="02:11:02.060" style="s2">downfall including people who were less</p>
<p begin="02:10:59.270" end="02:11:05.330" style="s2">they weren&#39;t fearful people and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:02.060" end="02:11:06.890" style="s2">very stressful so one question is well</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.330" end="02:11:08.150" style="s2">should I be doing interviews like that</p>
<p begin="02:11:06.890" end="02:11:10.640" style="s2">at all because one of the things I</p>
<p begin="02:11:08.150" end="02:11:14.300" style="s2">thought is no written interviews only</p>
<p begin="02:11:10.640" end="02:11:16.820" style="s2">live interviews only the whole thing so</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.300" end="02:11:20.120" style="s2">the one today you had is the last one</p>
<p begin="02:11:16.820" end="02:11:21.650" style="s2">well see I don&#39;t know because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:20.120" end="02:11:24.920" style="s2">another side of it which is the side you</p>
<p begin="02:11:21.650" end="02:11:27.200" style="s2">laid out it&#39;s like this happened with</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.920" end="02:11:30.910" style="s2">the some of you have seen the Channel 4</p>
<p begin="02:11:27.200" end="02:11:30.910" style="s2">interview that I did with Kathy Newman</p>
<p begin="02:11:37.060" end="02:11:42.860" style="s2">you know and that was I would say that</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.800" end="02:11:44.600" style="s2">was a stressful interview and I would</p>
<p begin="02:11:42.860" end="02:11:46.340" style="s2">say that the two weeks after the</p>
<p begin="02:11:44.600" end="02:11:49.909" style="s2">interview were also very stressful</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.340" end="02:11:51.110" style="s2">because you know first of all there was</p>
<p begin="02:11:49.909" end="02:11:53.449" style="s2">the interview and I thought they just</p>
<p begin="02:11:51.110" end="02:11:54.580" style="s2">cut it to seven minutes and pillory me</p>
<p begin="02:11:53.449" end="02:11:57.440" style="s2">and leave it at that</p>
<p begin="02:11:54.580" end="02:11:59.360" style="s2">but they cut it to seven minutes and</p>
<p begin="02:11:57.440" end="02:12:01.040" style="s2">pilloried me and then they posted the</p>
<p begin="02:11:59.360" end="02:12:04.190" style="s2">whole interview which just shocked me</p>
<p begin="02:12:01.040" end="02:12:06.260" style="s2">but here&#39;s the shocking thing the people</p>
<p begin="02:12:04.190" end="02:12:10.580" style="s2">who posted that interview thought it</p>
<p begin="02:12:06.260" end="02:12:11.870" style="s2">went well that&#39;s why they posted it they</p>
<p begin="02:12:10.580" end="02:12:13.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t think oh my god this is</p>
<p begin="02:12:11.870" end="02:12:15.080" style="s2">contentious we better put it out believe</p>
<p begin="02:12:13.520" end="02:12:16.340" style="s2">me they didn&#39;t think that that is not</p>
<p begin="02:12:15.080" end="02:12:18.110" style="s2">what they thought they thought it went</p>
<p begin="02:12:16.340" end="02:12:19.940" style="s2">fine and so then there was this</p>
<p begin="02:12:18.110" end="02:12:22.100" style="s2">overwhelming response to it</p>
<p begin="02:12:19.940" end="02:12:25.909" style="s2">and that was completely unexpected and</p>
<p begin="02:12:22.100" end="02:12:28.280" style="s2">then the counter response was Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:12:25.909" end="02:12:32.030" style="s2">army of alt-right trolls is victimizing</p>
<p begin="02:12:28.280" end="02:12:33.890" style="s2">Kathy Newman and that was that that was</p>
<p begin="02:12:32.030" end="02:12:35.390" style="s2">the response of her employers the</p>
<p begin="02:12:33.890" end="02:12:36.650" style="s2">technical response because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="02:12:35.390" end="02:12:38.960" style="s2">they published they said we had to call</p>
<p begin="02:12:36.650" end="02:12:42.650" style="s2">in police to evaluate the threat it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:12:38.960" end="02:12:45.020" style="s2">like well so what anybody can call in</p>
<p begin="02:12:42.650" end="02:12:46.730" style="s2">police to evaluate a threat it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:12:45.020" end="02:12:48.679" style="s2">mean that the threat justified police</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.730" end="02:12:50.449" style="s2">intervention or that there was a threat</p>
<p begin="02:12:48.679" end="02:12:52.190" style="s2">it just meant that that&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="02:12:50.449" end="02:12:54.530" style="s2">responded to it and then they spun a</p>
<p begin="02:12:52.190" end="02:12:57.199" style="s2">victim narrative for Kathy which was I</p>
<p begin="02:12:54.530" end="02:12:59.989" style="s2">think reprehensible given that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:12:57.199" end="02:13:01.969" style="s2">know what Kathy Newman is exactly but</p>
<p begin="02:12:59.989" end="02:13:03.890" style="s2">she&#39;s not a bloody victim she&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:13:01.969" end="02:13:06.020" style="s2">powerless she&#39;s one of the most powerful</p>
<p begin="02:13:03.890" end="02:13:07.550" style="s2">women in the United Kingdom and she has</p>
<p begin="02:13:06.020" end="02:13:09.560" style="s2">a salary that&#39;s commensurate with that</p>
<p begin="02:13:07.550" end="02:13:11.390" style="s2">and good good for her that&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="02:13:09.560" end="02:13:13.820" style="s2">fine but you don&#39;t get to have that and</p>
<p begin="02:13:11.390" end="02:13:16.250" style="s2">also be a victim it&#39;s not the right way</p>
<p begin="02:13:13.820" end="02:13:19.550" style="s2">to play the game and so then a whole</p>
<p begin="02:13:16.250" end="02:13:22.550" style="s2">bunch of newspapers laid out the story</p>
<p begin="02:13:19.550" end="02:13:26.540" style="s2">that poor Kathy was being trolled by my</p>
<p begin="02:13:22.550" end="02:13:28.880" style="s2">my legion of all right angry people but</p>
<p begin="02:13:26.540" end="02:13:30.949" style="s2">then the numbers started to mount you</p>
<p begin="02:13:28.880" end="02:13:33.739" style="s2">know and after it was like four million</p>
<p begin="02:13:30.949" end="02:13:35.570" style="s2">people it got the whole troll argument</p>
<p begin="02:13:33.739" end="02:13:37.880" style="s2">got hard to sustain unless you think</p>
<p begin="02:13:35.570" end="02:13:39.260" style="s2">they were like well now it&#39;s perhaps</p>
<p begin="02:13:37.880" end="02:13:41.570" style="s2">thirty million people have watched</p>
<p begin="02:13:39.260" end="02:13:42.980" style="s2">either the whole thing or major clips</p>
<p begin="02:13:41.570" end="02:13:45.320" style="s2">from it maybe it&#39;s more than that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:13:42.980" end="02:13:47.570" style="s2">hard to sustain the old troll argument</p>
<p begin="02:13:45.320" end="02:13:48.230" style="s2">when it&#39;s thirty million people but it</p>
<p begin="02:13:47.570" end="02:13:49.670" style="s2">was very</p>
<p begin="02:13:48.230" end="02:13:51.830" style="s2">I thought that narrative was going to</p>
<p begin="02:13:49.670" end="02:13:54.020" style="s2">prevail for a while that you know oh she</p>
<p begin="02:13:51.830" end="02:13:55.790" style="s2">got victimized and it was all these</p>
<p begin="02:13:54.020" end="02:13:57.890" style="s2">terrible people that went after her but</p>
<p begin="02:13:55.790" end="02:14:01.730" style="s2">that collapsed but it&#39;s very stressful</p>
<p begin="02:13:57.890" end="02:14:03.860" style="s2">but and this is something that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:14:01.730" end="02:14:06.170" style="s2">learned so I&#39;ve been obsessing about</p>
<p begin="02:14:03.860" end="02:14:07.760" style="s2">another statement in the New Testament</p>
<p begin="02:14:06.170" end="02:14:09.110" style="s2">for about two years I&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="02:14:07.760" end="02:14:10.489" style="s2">figure it out and it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:14:09.110" end="02:14:13.420" style="s2">statement that you should turn the other</p>
<p begin="02:14:10.489" end="02:14:15.980" style="s2">cheek and that&#39;s a tough one man because</p>
<p begin="02:14:13.420" end="02:14:18.350" style="s2">well because first of all who wants to</p>
<p begin="02:14:15.980" end="02:14:19.880" style="s2">do that because you want to explode in</p>
<p begin="02:14:18.350" end="02:14:21.590" style="s2">righteous anger at least you want to</p>
<p begin="02:14:19.880" end="02:14:24.170" style="s2">defend yourself you want to do one of</p>
<p begin="02:14:21.590" end="02:14:24.920" style="s2">those things so what the hell does that</p>
<p begin="02:14:24.170" end="02:14:31.970" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="02:14:24.920" end="02:14:36.410" style="s2">and partly what it means is if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:14:31.970" end="02:14:37.970" style="s2">attacked and you&#39;re innocent and look</p>
<p begin="02:14:36.410" end="02:14:40.820" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m like globally</p>
<p begin="02:14:37.970" end="02:14:43.790" style="s2">innocent or anything like that but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:14:40.820" end="02:14:46.820" style="s2">not guilty of the accusations that are</p>
<p begin="02:14:43.790" end="02:14:49.970" style="s2">levied at me or at least I&#39;m not guilty</p>
<p begin="02:14:46.820" end="02:14:53.630" style="s2">in the manner that the accusations would</p>
<p begin="02:14:49.970" end="02:14:56.210" style="s2">indicate if you&#39;re being attacked and</p>
<p begin="02:14:53.630" end="02:15:00.920" style="s2">you&#39;re not guilty of the accusations</p>
<p begin="02:14:56.210" end="02:15:04.989" style="s2">then the attacks say more about the</p>
<p begin="02:15:00.920" end="02:15:07.580" style="s2">attacker than their intended target and</p>
<p begin="02:15:04.989" end="02:15:10.880" style="s2">so so far I&#39;ve been able to withstand</p>
<p begin="02:15:07.580" end="02:15:13.130" style="s2">the attacks and the consequence of that</p>
<p begin="02:15:10.880" end="02:15:16.130" style="s2">is that it said more about the attackers</p>
<p begin="02:15:13.130" end="02:15:18.739" style="s2">than about me and then the question is</p>
<p begin="02:15:16.130" end="02:15:24.950" style="s2">can I tolerate that because it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="02:15:18.739" end="02:15:27.200" style="s2">very stressful and I very a waver on</p>
<p begin="02:15:24.950" end="02:15:30.170" style="s2">that back and forth and then of course</p>
<p begin="02:15:27.200" end="02:15:32.090" style="s2">the other issue is is that some people</p>
<p begin="02:15:30.170" end="02:15:34.460" style="s2">in the media have pilloried me but many</p>
<p begin="02:15:32.090" end="02:15:35.950" style="s2">haven&#39;t you know there&#39;s been very many</p>
<p begin="02:15:34.460" end="02:15:38.270" style="s2">thoughtful people that have written</p>
<p begin="02:15:35.950" end="02:15:40.420" style="s2">thoughtful pieces about me there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:15:38.270" end="02:15:43.820" style="s2">Canadian consortium of 200 newspapers</p>
<p begin="02:15:40.420" end="02:15:46.040" style="s2">the post media group and they came out</p>
<p begin="02:15:43.820" end="02:15:48.980" style="s2">the entire group came out in favor of my</p>
<p begin="02:15:46.040" end="02:15:52.610" style="s2">stance in relationship to Bill c16 in</p>
<p begin="02:15:48.980" end="02:15:59.480" style="s2">Canada which was a concern that</p>
<p begin="02:15:52.610" end="02:16:02.780" style="s2">compelled speech and so well so</p>
<p begin="02:15:59.480" end="02:16:04.610" style="s2">so far in same with the protests when</p>
<p begin="02:16:02.780" end="02:16:05.960" style="s2">people come out to protest against me</p>
<p begin="02:16:04.610" end="02:16:08.630" style="s2">well the first video that really went</p>
<p begin="02:16:05.960" end="02:16:09.320" style="s2">viral was a protest at the University of</p>
<p begin="02:16:08.630" end="02:16:12.830" style="s2">Toronto</p>
<p begin="02:16:09.320" end="02:16:15.230" style="s2">and after the protest was over that the</p>
<p begin="02:16:12.830" end="02:16:18.230" style="s2">the pro the the anti free speech people</p>
<p begin="02:16:15.230" end="02:16:20.630" style="s2">at the protests took the microphone away</p>
<p begin="02:16:18.230" end="02:16:22.429" style="s2">and and blasted white noise made it</p>
<p begin="02:16:20.630" end="02:16:26.540" style="s2">impossible for anyone to speak even</p>
<p begin="02:16:22.429" end="02:16:29.270" style="s2">though it was an open mic event so that</p>
<p begin="02:16:26.540" end="02:16:31.610" style="s2">got broadcast and then about two hours</p>
<p begin="02:16:29.270" end="02:16:33.500" style="s2">after the event I went down to talk to</p>
<p begin="02:16:31.610" end="02:16:35.510" style="s2">the cops to see if anybody had been hurt</p>
<p begin="02:16:33.500" end="02:16:37.099" style="s2">or anything like that and then on the</p>
<p begin="02:16:35.510" end="02:16:41.030" style="s2">way back into the university I got</p>
<p begin="02:16:37.099" end="02:16:43.400" style="s2">accosted by half a dozen like radical</p>
<p begin="02:16:41.030" end="02:16:45.620" style="s2">types and about thirty of their</p>
<p begin="02:16:43.400" end="02:16:47.290" style="s2">hangers-on and then there&#39;s a crowd of</p>
<p begin="02:16:45.620" end="02:16:49.610" style="s2">people that I would say we&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="02:16:47.290" end="02:16:52.219" style="s2">supporting me that that gathered around</p>
<p begin="02:16:49.610" end="02:16:55.880" style="s2">me and they went after me and videotaped</p>
<p begin="02:16:52.219" end="02:16:58.219" style="s2">all of it on their cell phones and then</p>
<p begin="02:16:55.880" end="02:17:00.740" style="s2">they posted that and the idea was that</p>
<p begin="02:16:58.219" end="02:17:02.510" style="s2">that was going to do me in but what</p>
<p begin="02:17:00.740" end="02:17:05.990" style="s2">happened was the comments were a hundred</p>
<p begin="02:17:02.510" end="02:17:07.729" style="s2">to one in favor of what I was saying so</p>
<p begin="02:17:05.990" end="02:17:10.880" style="s2">that was another example where the</p>
<p begin="02:17:07.729" end="02:17:12.710" style="s2">protests were more damaging to the</p>
<p begin="02:17:10.880" end="02:17:16.030" style="s2">protesters than they were to me and</p>
<p begin="02:17:12.710" end="02:17:18.889" style="s2">that&#39;s been luckily fortunately</p>
<p begin="02:17:16.030" end="02:17:22.700" style="s2">miraculously all of that a recurrent</p>
<p begin="02:17:18.889" end="02:17:25.790" style="s2">pattern and so the question is whether</p>
<p begin="02:17:22.700" end="02:17:28.939" style="s2">or not I can tolerate it and whether my</p>
<p begin="02:17:25.790" end="02:17:30.429" style="s2">family can tolerate it and so far look</p>
<p begin="02:17:28.939" end="02:17:33.500" style="s2">if you&#39;re trying to do something</p>
<p begin="02:17:30.429" end="02:17:37.160" style="s2">difficult let&#39;s say the right amount of</p>
<p begin="02:17:33.500" end="02:17:39.139" style="s2">controversy isn&#39;t zero the question is</p>
<p begin="02:17:37.160" end="02:17:41.240" style="s2">how much controversy can you handle and</p>
<p begin="02:17:39.139" end="02:17:43.580" style="s2">how much of the mud that&#39;s thrown will</p>
<p begin="02:17:41.240" end="02:17:45.349" style="s2">stick and then how much of it deserves</p>
<p begin="02:17:43.580" end="02:17:46.790" style="s2">to stick all of those things you go to</p>
<p begin="02:17:45.349" end="02:17:52.969" style="s2">scour your conscience under those</p>
<p begin="02:17:46.790" end="02:17:57.019" style="s2">circumstances but so far I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="02:17:52.969" end="02:17:59.540" style="s2">fortunate it seems like you&#39;ve taken on</p>
<p begin="02:17:57.019" end="02:18:01.280" style="s2">this track and voluntarily it seems like</p>
<p begin="02:17:59.540" end="02:18:05.179" style="s2">from the beginning you&#39;ve known that</p>
<p begin="02:18:01.280" end="02:18:09.139" style="s2">this for example when you spoke up</p>
<p begin="02:18:05.179" end="02:18:12.091" style="s2">against Bill c16 in Canada you knew that</p>
<p begin="02:18:09.139" end="02:18:15.060" style="s2">this might become tough</p>
<p begin="02:18:12.091" end="02:18:17.640" style="s2">well a guide taught people to negotiate</p>
<p begin="02:18:15.060" end="02:18:19.950" style="s2">in my clinical practice for a long time</p>
<p begin="02:18:17.640" end="02:18:24.060" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve had lots of clients many</p>
<p begin="02:18:19.950" end="02:18:27.211" style="s2">of those clients were female and the the</p>
<p begin="02:18:24.060" end="02:18:29.131" style="s2">goal in my consulting with them was to</p>
<p begin="02:18:27.211" end="02:18:32.820" style="s2">double or triple their salary within</p>
<p begin="02:18:29.131" end="02:18:34.650" style="s2">five years and so that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:18:32.820" end="02:18:36.120" style="s2">necessarily the only goal we discussed</p>
<p begin="02:18:34.650" end="02:18:38.881" style="s2">all sorts of goals but that was often</p>
<p begin="02:18:36.120" end="02:18:41.490" style="s2">one and so I was very accustomed to</p>
<p begin="02:18:38.881" end="02:18:42.961" style="s2">organizing people to negotiate and</p>
<p begin="02:18:41.490" end="02:18:45.541" style="s2">there&#39;s if you want to negotiate there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:18:42.961" end="02:18:49.890" style="s2">a couple of rules the first rule is you</p>
<p begin="02:18:45.541" end="02:18:52.740" style="s2">have to be able to say no and what no</p>
<p begin="02:18:49.890" end="02:18:55.320" style="s2">means is there isn&#39;t anything you can do</p>
<p begin="02:18:52.740" end="02:18:57.570" style="s2">to me to get me to do that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="02:18:55.320" end="02:18:59.370" style="s2">no means no like you can be you can have</p>
<p begin="02:18:57.570" end="02:19:01.200" style="s2">different degrees of seriousness about</p>
<p begin="02:18:59.370" end="02:19:05.400" style="s2">no but if you&#39;re gonna negotiate with</p>
<p begin="02:19:01.200" end="02:19:07.501" style="s2">your boss say for a substantial raise no</p>
<p begin="02:19:05.400" end="02:19:09.631" style="s2">means if I don&#39;t get it then I will</p>
<p begin="02:19:07.501" end="02:19:11.671" style="s2">leave that&#39;s fundamentally and that</p>
<p begin="02:19:09.631" end="02:19:14.220" style="s2">leaving will cost you more than it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:19:11.671" end="02:19:16.501" style="s2">a threat right it has to be the</p>
<p begin="02:19:14.220" end="02:19:20.070" style="s2">observation that me leaving will cost</p>
<p begin="02:19:16.501" end="02:19:21.690" style="s2">you substantially more than giving me</p>
<p begin="02:19:20.070" end="02:19:24.091" style="s2">the raise you have to be in a position</p>
<p begin="02:19:21.690" end="02:19:26.251" style="s2">to make that case or you don&#39;t win the</p>
<p begin="02:19:24.091" end="02:19:28.470" style="s2">negotiation and so I always put my</p>
<p begin="02:19:26.251" end="02:19:30.480" style="s2">clients in a position where if they went</p>
<p begin="02:19:28.470" end="02:19:32.280" style="s2">and asked for something they were in a</p>
<p begin="02:19:30.480" end="02:19:35.251" style="s2">position to win because we didn&#39;t go and</p>
<p begin="02:19:32.280" end="02:19:38.760" style="s2">ask before that so when I made the video</p>
<p begin="02:19:35.251" end="02:19:40.080" style="s2">criticizing Bill c16 I thought I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="02:19:38.760" end="02:19:42.600" style="s2">abiding by this damn piece of</p>
<p begin="02:19:40.080" end="02:19:46.310" style="s2">legislation and then I thought well what</p>
<p begin="02:19:42.600" end="02:19:49.200" style="s2">does it mean that I&#39;m not and I thought</p>
<p begin="02:19:46.310" end="02:19:51.301" style="s2">well I had multiple sources of income so</p>
<p begin="02:19:49.200" end="02:19:53.521" style="s2">I was read I was really the bleep</p>
<p begin="02:19:51.301" end="02:19:55.921" style="s2">addition to tolerate a fair bit of</p>
<p begin="02:19:53.521" end="02:19:57.990" style="s2">pushback I mean I could have got wiped</p>
<p begin="02:19:55.921" end="02:19:59.431" style="s2">out have things gone sideways but it</p>
<p begin="02:19:57.990" end="02:20:04.261" style="s2">would have been difficult to take me out</p>
<p begin="02:19:59.431" end="02:20:06.301" style="s2">completely and I thought there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="02:20:04.261" end="02:20:08.881" style="s2">I&#39;m biding by this piece of legislation</p>
<p begin="02:20:06.301" end="02:20:10.080" style="s2">I was willing I thought through the</p>
<p begin="02:20:08.881" end="02:20:12.751" style="s2">negative consequences</p>
<p begin="02:20:10.080" end="02:20:14.370" style="s2">now I didn&#39;t of course think that any of</p>
<p begin="02:20:12.751" end="02:20:16.440" style="s2">this would happen because this is just</p>
<p begin="02:20:14.370" end="02:20:19.801" style="s2">completely preposterous and no one could</p>
<p begin="02:20:16.440" end="02:20:22.440" style="s2">have possibly foreseen it but so I would</p>
<p begin="02:20:19.801" end="02:20:25.300" style="s2">say there were certain things I faced in</p>
<p begin="02:20:22.440" end="02:20:28.540" style="s2">doing that but I couldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="02:20:25.300" end="02:20:30.939" style="s2">seen the absolutely explosive</p>
<p begin="02:20:28.540" end="02:20:33.340" style="s2">consequences I&#39;m not unhappy that I did</p>
<p begin="02:20:30.939" end="02:20:40.479" style="s2">it I would do it again I am still doing</p>
<p begin="02:20:33.340" end="02:20:52.540" style="s2">it I suppose so which of your 12 rules</p>
<p begin="02:20:40.479" end="02:20:55.840" style="s2">do you break most often I could probably</p>
<p begin="02:20:52.540" end="02:20:59.560" style="s2">still be better at listening to people I</p>
<p begin="02:20:55.840" end="02:21:01.330" style="s2">like I have these I do interviews with</p>
<p begin="02:20:59.560" end="02:21:03.670" style="s2">people I call them discussions because</p>
<p begin="02:21:01.330" end="02:21:05.050" style="s2">they&#39;re not really interviews probably</p>
<p begin="02:21:03.670" end="02:21:07.540" style="s2">they&#39;re not interviews because I talk</p>
<p begin="02:21:05.050" end="02:21:09.670" style="s2">too much so I had to call them</p>
<p begin="02:21:07.540" end="02:21:12.100" style="s2">discussions but I would say the most</p>
<p begin="02:21:09.670" end="02:21:15.340" style="s2">common criticism of those discussions is</p>
<p begin="02:21:12.100" end="02:21:18.939" style="s2">that I interrupt the people that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:21:15.340" end="02:21:20.920" style="s2">discussing things with and and tilt the</p>
<p begin="02:21:18.939" end="02:21:24.100" style="s2">conversation probably a little bit more</p>
<p begin="02:21:20.920" end="02:21:26.050" style="s2">towards me my thinking than theirs now</p>
<p begin="02:21:24.100" end="02:21:29.080" style="s2">part of that I think is my natural</p>
<p begin="02:21:26.050" end="02:21:33.210" style="s2">tendency towards like I&#39;ve always talked</p>
<p begin="02:21:29.080" end="02:21:34.359" style="s2">a lot ever since I was like three like</p>
<p begin="02:21:33.210" end="02:21:37.030" style="s2">continually</p>
<p begin="02:21:34.359" end="02:21:39.160" style="s2">so it&#39;s I&#39;m there I&#39;m verbally fluent</p>
<p begin="02:21:37.030" end="02:21:44.470" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s part of my nature and</p>
<p begin="02:21:39.160" end="02:21:47.470" style="s2">extroverted but you can always get</p>
<p begin="02:21:44.470" end="02:21:50.140" style="s2">better at listening you know and so I</p>
<p begin="02:21:47.470" end="02:21:51.609" style="s2">can listen and and I practiced that</p>
<p begin="02:21:50.140" end="02:21:53.109" style="s2">because I&#39;m a therapist but I would say</p>
<p begin="02:21:51.609" end="02:21:54.760" style="s2">that&#39;s probably the rule I break that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:21:53.109" end="02:21:55.960" style="s2">rule 9 like assume that the person</p>
<p begin="02:21:54.760" end="02:21:59.530" style="s2">you&#39;re listening to know something you</p>
<p begin="02:21:55.960" end="02:22:01.990" style="s2">don&#39;t it&#39;s like I&#39;m not as good at that</p>
<p begin="02:21:59.530" end="02:22:05.200" style="s2">yet as I could be because I wouldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="02:22:01.990" end="02:22:06.670" style="s2">that criticism if I was like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:22:05.200" end="02:22:09.100" style="s2">every comment or anything it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="02:22:06.670" end="02:22:11.229" style="s2">like every xx comment or every xxx</p>
<p begin="02:22:09.100" end="02:22:13.090" style="s2">comment but it&#39;s but it&#39;s still it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:22:11.229" end="02:22:14.470" style="s2">consistent and so every time I have an</p>
<p begin="02:22:13.090" end="02:22:17.260" style="s2">interview I think ok I&#39;m gonna try to</p>
<p begin="02:22:14.470" end="02:22:19.720" style="s2">shut up a little bit more but then I get</p>
<p begin="02:22:17.260" end="02:22:24.060" style="s2">excited about what&#39;s happening and you</p>
<p begin="02:22:19.720" end="02:22:24.060" style="s2">know and talk too much</p>
<p begin="02:22:26.760" end="02:22:34.780" style="s2">one thing related to that sometimes you</p>
<p begin="02:22:31.930" end="02:22:38.021" style="s2">seem to go off on a tangent when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:22:34.780" end="02:22:40.721" style="s2">discussing something you go into</p>
<p begin="02:22:38.021" end="02:22:43.181" style="s2">you know something related to it then</p>
<p begin="02:22:40.721" end="02:22:46.540" style="s2">you come back to a greater structure of</p>
<p begin="02:22:43.181" end="02:22:50.921" style="s2">things do you have you laid all this out</p>
<p begin="02:22:46.540" end="02:22:53.261" style="s2">before you say it or do you just go from</p>
<p begin="02:22:50.921" end="02:22:56.681" style="s2">one topic to another and they somehow</p>
<p begin="02:22:53.261" end="02:23:01.751" style="s2">relate together and become whole and</p>
<p begin="02:22:56.681" end="02:23:03.700" style="s2">both yeah but so before I do a talk like</p>
<p begin="02:23:01.751" end="02:23:05.561" style="s2">I have to sit I think about the talk all</p>
<p begin="02:23:03.700" end="02:23:07.751" style="s2">day before I do it like not a hundred</p>
<p begin="02:23:05.561" end="02:23:10.001" style="s2">percent of the time but it&#39;s it&#39;s in my</p>
<p begin="02:23:07.751" end="02:23:12.341" style="s2">mind all the time and what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="02:23:10.001" end="02:23:13.540" style="s2">get is the basic narrative and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:23:12.341" end="02:23:15.341" style="s2">something like you can only use a</p>
<p begin="02:23:13.540" end="02:23:18.700" style="s2">metaphor to really describe it&#39;s imagine</p>
<p begin="02:23:15.341" end="02:23:21.311" style="s2">you wanted to cross a swamp and there</p>
<p begin="02:23:18.700" end="02:23:22.811" style="s2">were stones under the surface you need</p>
<p begin="02:23:21.311" end="02:23:24.400" style="s2">to know where the stones are to get from</p>
<p begin="02:23:22.811" end="02:23:25.841" style="s2">one side of the swamp to the other and</p>
<p begin="02:23:24.400" end="02:23:27.490" style="s2">so then that&#39;s what I do in my</p>
<p begin="02:23:25.841" end="02:23:30.601" style="s2">imagination I think okay well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:23:27.490" end="02:23:33.461" style="s2">this area I have to traverse and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:23:30.601" end="02:23:36.011" style="s2">stepping stones along the way I need to</p>
<p begin="02:23:33.461" end="02:23:38.320" style="s2">know where they&#39;re located and so that</p>
<p begin="02:23:36.011" end="02:23:41.200" style="s2">might be like 12 points or something</p>
<p begin="02:23:38.320" end="02:23:45.400" style="s2">like that that&#39;s the rough path and then</p>
<p begin="02:23:41.200" end="02:23:48.881" style="s2">I have a whole corpus of stories that</p>
<p begin="02:23:45.400" end="02:23:50.410" style="s2">fit each of those points and then I can</p>
<p begin="02:23:48.881" end="02:23:52.751" style="s2">choose how I&#39;m going to weave those</p>
<p begin="02:23:50.410" end="02:23:55.811" style="s2">together but I have to remember where</p>
<p begin="02:23:52.751" end="02:23:57.700" style="s2">I&#39;m going and if I&#39;m well like if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:23:55.811" end="02:24:00.251" style="s2">healthy and functioning properly then I</p>
<p begin="02:23:57.700" end="02:24:03.040" style="s2">can go way out on a tangent and I can</p>
<p begin="02:24:00.251" end="02:24:05.021" style="s2">still remember oh yes I have to tie that</p>
<p begin="02:24:03.040" end="02:24:08.021" style="s2">back to this point and move to the next</p>
<p begin="02:24:05.021" end="02:24:10.271" style="s2">step so it&#39;s I like I think it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:24:08.021" end="02:24:12.580" style="s2">jazz improvisation essentially you know</p>
<p begin="02:24:10.271" end="02:24:15.221" style="s2">you have the melody and it has to</p>
<p begin="02:24:12.580" end="02:24:17.320" style="s2">organize the melody has to organize all</p>
<p begin="02:24:15.221" end="02:24:21.221" style="s2">the improvisation and then I have all</p>
<p begin="02:24:17.320" end="02:24:24.521" style="s2">these stories that I know but I every</p>
<p begin="02:24:21.221" end="02:24:26.171" style="s2">time I tell this story I try to vary it</p>
<p begin="02:24:24.521" end="02:24:27.790" style="s2">so that it brings in something I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:24:26.171" end="02:24:30.070" style="s2">brought in before integrate something</p>
<p begin="02:24:27.790" end="02:24:32.021" style="s2">you know like what are the things I was</p>
<p begin="02:24:30.070" end="02:24:33.431" style="s2">trying to do tonight I&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="02:24:32.021" end="02:24:36.820" style="s2">figure out for a long time is how to</p>
<p begin="02:24:33.431" end="02:24:39.790" style="s2">integrate the idea of the good player of</p>
<p begin="02:24:36.820" end="02:24:42.610" style="s2">games with the idea of voluntarily</p>
<p begin="02:24:39.790" end="02:24:45.580" style="s2">shouldering your the catastrophe of life</p>
<p begin="02:24:42.610" end="02:24:48.580" style="s2">I know those are the same thing but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:24:45.580" end="02:24:51.101" style="s2">not obvious why and I&#39;m still not</p>
<p begin="02:24:48.580" end="02:24:51.880" style="s2">completely obvious to me but I know that</p>
<p begin="02:24:51.101" end="02:24:54.460" style="s2">the connection</p>
<p begin="02:24:51.880" end="02:24:56.890" style="s2">and I got a fair bit a fair ways tonight</p>
<p begin="02:24:54.460" end="02:24:58.990" style="s2">farther than I had it stacking those</p>
<p begin="02:24:56.890" end="02:25:00.520" style="s2">concepts on top of each other so the</p>
<p begin="02:24:58.990" end="02:25:03.700" style="s2">other thing I&#39;m always trying to do is</p>
<p begin="02:25:00.520" end="02:25:07.120" style="s2">to take each of these sets of ideas and</p>
<p begin="02:25:03.700" end="02:25:09.520" style="s2">to wave them together more tightly but</p>
<p begin="02:25:07.120" end="02:25:12.430" style="s2">also to push them further in their</p>
<p begin="02:25:09.520" end="02:25:14.880" style="s2">development so and you&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="02:25:12.430" end="02:25:18.130" style="s2">that on this tour have you been</p>
<p begin="02:25:14.880" end="02:25:20.830" style="s2">developing your ideas oh absolutely</p>
<p begin="02:25:18.130" end="02:25:26.410" style="s2">absolutely there&#39;s you can&#39;t give an</p>
<p begin="02:25:20.830" end="02:25:29.830" style="s2">effective lecture without so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:25:26.410" end="02:25:33.040" style="s2">deliver a talk to an audience first of</p>
<p begin="02:25:29.830" end="02:25:36.100" style="s2">all it&#39;s not apt talk second you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:25:33.040" end="02:25:40.120" style="s2">deliver it third it isn&#39;t an audience</p>
<p begin="02:25:36.100" end="02:25:42.640" style="s2">like all of that&#39;s wrong you talk to</p>
<p begin="02:25:40.120" end="02:25:45.430" style="s2">individuals in the audience one at a</p>
<p begin="02:25:42.640" end="02:25:46.990" style="s2">time and they&#39;re representative of the</p>
<p begin="02:25:45.430" end="02:25:48.340" style="s2">whole but you&#39;re not talking to the</p>
<p begin="02:25:46.990" end="02:25:49.810" style="s2">audience if you&#39;re afraid of public</p>
<p begin="02:25:48.340" end="02:25:51.490" style="s2">speaking it&#39;s because you&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="02:25:49.810" end="02:25:53.200" style="s2">the audience it&#39;s like forget about that</p>
<p begin="02:25:51.490" end="02:25:57.670" style="s2">you just talk to people you know how to</p>
<p begin="02:25:53.200" end="02:26:00.939" style="s2">do that and then you&#39;re not delivering a</p>
<p begin="02:25:57.670" end="02:26:02.950" style="s2">talk because then it&#39;s a canned product</p>
<p begin="02:26:00.939" end="02:26:05.140" style="s2">you must have just hand people pieces of</p>
<p begin="02:26:02.950" end="02:26:08.439" style="s2">paper that they could read it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="02:26:05.140" end="02:26:13.360" style="s2">efficient why not do that what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:26:08.439" end="02:26:16.320" style="s2">doing if you address people properly is</p>
<p begin="02:26:13.360" end="02:26:19.330" style="s2">that you involve them in the process of</p>
<p begin="02:26:16.320" end="02:26:21.729" style="s2">furthering exploration of important</p>
<p begin="02:26:19.330" end="02:26:22.930" style="s2">concepts and you think well how can you</p>
<p begin="02:26:21.729" end="02:26:25.390" style="s2">do that because they&#39;re sitting there</p>
<p begin="02:26:22.930" end="02:26:29.439" style="s2">passively it&#39;s like well you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:26:25.390" end="02:26:32.290" style="s2">passive you&#39;re not verbal but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:26:29.439" end="02:26:33.520" style="s2">passive like I listen I listen to</p>
<p begin="02:26:32.290" end="02:26:36.189" style="s2">whether or not everyone&#39;s rustling</p>
<p begin="02:26:33.520" end="02:26:38.950" style="s2">around if you&#39;re rustling around then</p>
<p begin="02:26:36.189" end="02:26:43.090" style="s2">I&#39;m not balancing chaos and order</p>

<p begin="02:26:43.090" end="02:26:47.590" style="s2">I can hear noise in the audience it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:26:44.860" end="02:26:49.060" style="s2">not right I watch people one by one and</p>
<p begin="02:26:47.590" end="02:26:50.920" style="s2">I see sometimes they&#39;re shaking their</p>
<p begin="02:26:49.060" end="02:26:54.160" style="s2">head like this sometimes they&#39;re nodding</p>
<p begin="02:26:50.920" end="02:26:55.660" style="s2">sometimes they look confused if if</p>

<p begin="02:26:58.810" end="02:27:02.170" style="s2">understanding they&#39;re following along</p>
<p begin="02:27:00.310" end="02:27:03.850" style="s2">and that indication that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:27:02.170" end="02:27:05.471" style="s2">following along helps me figure out if</p>
<p begin="02:27:03.850" end="02:27:07.330" style="s2">I&#39;m in the right place and so</p>
<p begin="02:27:05.471" end="02:27:10.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a dynamic that goes along with</p>
<p begin="02:27:07.330" end="02:27:12.551" style="s2">it and so all of that and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="02:27:10.750" end="02:27:14.530" style="s2">you&#39;re doing if you engage the audience</p>
<p begin="02:27:12.551" end="02:27:15.940" style="s2">properly is you shouldn&#39;t be talking</p>
<p begin="02:27:14.530" end="02:27:17.860" style="s2">about things you don&#39;t know enough about</p>
<p begin="02:27:15.940" end="02:27:19.931" style="s2">to talk about so if you have to read</p>
<p begin="02:27:17.860" end="02:27:21.521" style="s2">your notes it&#39;s like sorry you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:27:19.931" end="02:27:23.530" style="s2">know enough to talk about that because</p>
<p begin="02:27:21.521" end="02:27:24.910" style="s2">you need notes now maybe when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:27:23.530" end="02:27:27.910" style="s2">first starting to talk about something</p>
<p begin="02:27:24.910" end="02:27:29.650" style="s2">you need notes but if you need notes you</p>
<p begin="02:27:27.910" end="02:27:31.811" style="s2">haven&#39;t prepared enough you should know</p>
<p begin="02:27:29.650" end="02:27:33.750" style="s2">like ten times as much about the topic</p>
<p begin="02:27:31.811" end="02:27:36.790" style="s2">then you&#39;re gonna talk about in the talk</p>
<p begin="02:27:33.750" end="02:27:38.471" style="s2">otherwise who the hell are you and so</p>
<p begin="02:27:36.790" end="02:27:40.330" style="s2">well right I mean you&#39;re supposed to be</p>
<p begin="02:27:38.471" end="02:27:44.891" style="s2">the authority so you need to know these</p>
<p begin="02:27:40.330" end="02:27:47.011" style="s2">things and so and then knowing these</p>
<p begin="02:27:44.891" end="02:27:50.171" style="s2">things you want to stretch them further</p>
<p begin="02:27:47.011" end="02:27:55.181" style="s2">because when you&#39;re this is a theater</p>
<p begin="02:27:50.171" end="02:27:57.070" style="s2">and lecture theater theater is drama so</p>
<p begin="02:27:55.181" end="02:28:01.110" style="s2">why is it a lecture theater because</p>
<p begin="02:27:57.070" end="02:28:05.320" style="s2">lecture is drama what&#39;s the drama drama</p>
<p begin="02:28:01.110" end="02:28:08.200" style="s2">delivering a talk no there&#39;s no drama in</p>
<p begin="02:28:05.320" end="02:28:10.811" style="s2">that a tape recorder can do that the</p>
<p begin="02:28:08.200" end="02:28:14.171" style="s2">drama is to engage with the ideas</p>
<p begin="02:28:10.811" end="02:28:16.391" style="s2">actively in real time and to discover</p>
<p begin="02:28:14.171" end="02:28:19.330" style="s2">with the audience what the consequence</p>
<p begin="02:28:16.391" end="02:28:21.131" style="s2">is and that&#39;s what makes a novel great</p>
<p begin="02:28:19.330" end="02:28:22.960" style="s2">for example the reason that Dostoyevsky</p>
<p begin="02:28:21.131" end="02:28:24.431" style="s2">novel is great is because Dostoyevsky</p>
<p begin="02:28:22.960" end="02:28:27.250" style="s2">did not know where he was going when he</p>
<p begin="02:28:24.431" end="02:28:28.660" style="s2">started he had problems you know like</p>
<p begin="02:28:27.250" end="02:28:30.160" style="s2">Crime and Punishment is a great example</p>
<p begin="02:28:28.660" end="02:28:31.811" style="s2">he wanted to explore the relationship</p>
<p begin="02:28:30.160" end="02:28:34.480" style="s2">between crime and punishment</p>
<p begin="02:28:31.811" end="02:28:36.311" style="s2">he didn&#39;t think well I&#39;m a postmodern</p>
<p begin="02:28:34.480" end="02:28:37.960" style="s2">neo-marxist and I have a solution to the</p>
<p begin="02:28:36.311" end="02:28:40.450" style="s2">problem of crime and punishment and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:28:37.960" end="02:28:42.641" style="s2">gonna write a novel describing what the</p>
<p begin="02:28:40.450" end="02:28:44.801" style="s2">right solution is he thought here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:28:42.641" end="02:28:46.990" style="s2">problem man this is a major problem I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:28:44.801" end="02:28:49.811" style="s2">gonna divide myself into ten characters</p>
<p begin="02:28:46.990" end="02:28:52.721" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna have a war and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="02:28:49.811" end="02:28:54.700" style="s2">see what prevails and he takes you along</p>
<p begin="02:28:52.721" end="02:28:56.950" style="s2">on that voyage and it&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="02:28:54.700" end="02:28:59.950" style="s2">makes Dostoyevsky different than a rant</p>
<p begin="02:28:56.950" end="02:29:01.870" style="s2">for example cuz ain&#39;t Rand already knew</p>
<p begin="02:28:59.950" end="02:29:04.000" style="s2">who the good guys and the bad guys were</p>
<p begin="02:29:01.870" end="02:29:07.061" style="s2">and maybe she was right and maybe she</p>
<p begin="02:29:04.000" end="02:29:09.101" style="s2">wasn&#39;t doesn&#39;t matter what matters is</p>
<p begin="02:29:07.061" end="02:29:11.740" style="s2">that what she did wasn&#39;t literature it</p>
<p begin="02:29:09.101" end="02:29:14.471" style="s2">was just sophisticated propaganda you</p>
<p begin="02:29:11.740" end="02:29:17.381" style="s2">know like it it taps into literature</p>
<p begin="02:29:14.471" end="02:29:18.641" style="s2">upon occasion but but she knew where she</p>
<p begin="02:29:17.381" end="02:29:19.181" style="s2">was going whereas Dorsky</p>
<p begin="02:29:18.641" end="02:29:21.641" style="s2">dosed</p>
<p begin="02:29:19.181" end="02:29:23.980" style="s2">skee he discovered it along the way and</p>
<p begin="02:29:21.641" end="02:29:26.561" style="s2">so he takes you along on the journey and</p>
<p begin="02:29:23.980" end="02:29:28.271" style="s2">that&#39;s any great artist does that takes</p>
<p begin="02:29:26.561" end="02:29:30.610" style="s2">you along in the journey that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:29:28.271" end="02:29:32.620" style="s2">so revivifying to encounter anything</p>
<p begin="02:29:30.610" end="02:29:35.591" style="s2">that&#39;s genuinely artistic is because</p>
<p begin="02:29:32.620" end="02:29:37.721" style="s2">you&#39;re along for the conflict between</p>
<p begin="02:29:35.591" end="02:29:40.721" style="s2">chaos and order and that&#39;s way more</p>
<p begin="02:29:37.721" end="02:29:43.120" style="s2">interesting than having a talk delivered</p>
<p begin="02:29:40.721" end="02:29:46.000" style="s2">to you is it possible that that journey</p>
<p begin="02:29:43.120" end="02:29:48.370" style="s2">might lead to a bad place in some cases</p>
<p begin="02:29:46.000" end="02:29:49.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve spoken of Hitler when he was</p>
<p begin="02:29:48.370" end="02:29:51.940" style="s2">speaking to audiences and he was</p>
<p begin="02:29:49.960" end="02:29:55.750" style="s2">listening to the audiences and that and</p>
<p begin="02:29:51.940" end="02:29:59.980" style="s2">he started to find what really engaged</p>
<p begin="02:29:55.750" end="02:30:01.960" style="s2">them and made them yeah excited yeah</p>
<p begin="02:29:59.980" end="02:30:03.960" style="s2">what he was saying yeah is it possible</p>
<p begin="02:30:01.960" end="02:30:08.200" style="s2">that you might get it wrong</p>
<p begin="02:30:03.960" end="02:30:13.061" style="s2">oh definitely and it&#39;s a terrible threat</p>
<p begin="02:30:08.200" end="02:30:14.920" style="s2">to get it wrong because you know in rule</p>
<p begin="02:30:13.061" end="02:30:17.650" style="s2">three it&#39;s make friends with the people</p>
<p begin="02:30:14.920" end="02:30:19.061" style="s2">who want the best for you there are</p>
<p begin="02:30:17.650" end="02:30:21.700" style="s2">other rules that were associated with</p>
<p begin="02:30:19.061" end="02:30:24.940" style="s2">that that I didn&#39;t write about like make</p>
<p begin="02:30:21.700" end="02:30:27.910" style="s2">friends with people with oh no let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="02:30:24.940" end="02:30:31.120" style="s2">be very careful with who be very careful</p>
<p begin="02:30:27.910" end="02:30:33.370" style="s2">about who you shared good news with that</p>
<p begin="02:30:31.120" end="02:30:35.891" style="s2">was one rule and another rule was be</p>
<p begin="02:30:33.370" end="02:30:38.681" style="s2">very careful about whom you share bad</p>
<p begin="02:30:35.891" end="02:30:40.511" style="s2">news with and those are sort of</p>
<p begin="02:30:38.681" end="02:30:42.280" style="s2">hallmarks of friendship if you have</p>
<p begin="02:30:40.511" end="02:30:43.721" style="s2">friends you can tell good news too you</p>
<p begin="02:30:42.280" end="02:30:44.830" style="s2">know what it&#39;s like to tell good news to</p>
<p begin="02:30:43.721" end="02:30:47.860" style="s2">someone that you shouldn&#39;t tell good</p>
<p begin="02:30:44.830" end="02:30:49.960" style="s2">news to it&#39;s like they&#39;re not happy</p>

<p begin="02:30:51.881" end="02:30:54.910" style="s2">way maybe they&#39;ll trump your good news</p>
<p begin="02:30:53.561" end="02:30:57.190" style="s2">or they won&#39;t listen or they&#39;ll bring up</p>
<p begin="02:30:54.910" end="02:30:59.591" style="s2">another topic or they&#39;re secretly angry</p>
<p begin="02:30:57.190" end="02:31:00.910" style="s2">or whatever you walk away from sharing</p>
<p begin="02:30:59.591" end="02:31:03.101" style="s2">the good news thinking you should have</p>

<p begin="02:31:05.771" end="02:31:08.920" style="s2">you can tell good news too and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:31:07.030" end="02:31:11.261" style="s2">be happy because they have enough sense</p>
<p begin="02:31:08.920" end="02:31:12.641" style="s2">to know that life stick catastrophe and</p>

<p begin="02:31:18.851" end="02:31:23.440" style="s2">tell bad news to someone they need to</p>
<p begin="02:31:20.801" end="02:31:25.091" style="s2">let you suffer right they shouldn&#39;t make</p>

<p begin="02:31:32.740" end="02:31:37.480" style="s2">I forgot what the hell the question was</p>
<p begin="02:31:34.240" end="02:31:42.851" style="s2">here I&#39;m getting tired so I&#39;m losing my</p>
<p begin="02:31:37.480" end="02:31:44.530" style="s2">ability to go back where you may get it</p>
<p begin="02:31:42.851" end="02:31:50.830" style="s2">wrong when you&#39;re interacting with the</p>
<p begin="02:31:44.530" end="02:31:54.010" style="s2">audience yes look what Hitler did was</p>
<p begin="02:31:50.830" end="02:31:55.870" style="s2">this far as I can tell I&#39;ve talked to</p>
<p begin="02:31:54.010" end="02:31:57.550" style="s2">politicians who&#39;ve built grassroots</p>
<p begin="02:31:55.870" end="02:32:02.380" style="s2">political parties about how they did it</p>
<p begin="02:31:57.550" end="02:32:04.750" style="s2">too so the audience talks to you when</p>
<p begin="02:32:02.380" end="02:32:08.050" style="s2">you when you deliver when you when you</p>

<p begin="02:32:08.050" end="02:32:14.021" style="s2">with their emotional reactions and then</p>
<p begin="02:32:10.931" end="02:32:17.650" style="s2">you can learn how to say what produces a</p>

<p begin="02:32:17.650" end="02:32:21.130" style="s2">that&#39;s what you want if you want say</p>

<p begin="02:32:59.110" end="02:33:02.380" style="s2">in that manner and you watch for the</p>
<p begin="02:33:00.550" end="02:33:03.610" style="s2">emotional response and when you get the</p>
<p begin="02:33:02.380" end="02:33:06.090" style="s2">anger that you&#39;re after</p>
<p begin="02:33:03.610" end="02:33:08.650" style="s2">you facilitate it and you let your</p>
<p begin="02:33:06.090" end="02:33:11.320" style="s2">imagination dwell on that and you become</p>
<p begin="02:33:08.650" end="02:33:13.570" style="s2">a master of that and that&#39;s what Hitler</p>
<p begin="02:33:11.320" end="02:33:15.570" style="s2">did and it wasn&#39;t like the Germans</p>
<p begin="02:33:13.570" end="02:33:20.200" style="s2">weren&#39;t angry and they had their reasons</p>
<p begin="02:33:15.570" end="02:33:22.000" style="s2">World War one was brutal they lost the</p>
<p begin="02:33:20.200" end="02:33:25.870" style="s2">Versailles Treaty was a catastrophe in</p>
<p begin="02:33:22.000" end="02:33:29.021" style="s2">the 1920s every decent hard-working</p>
<p begin="02:33:25.870" end="02:33:31.240" style="s2">German lost all of their savings in</p>

<p begin="02:33:31.240" end="02:33:36.490" style="s2">was threatened by a radical leftist</p>
<p begin="02:33:33.250" end="02:33:38.050" style="s2">revolution it was rough and people were</p>
<p begin="02:33:36.490" end="02:33:40.750" style="s2">not happy and many of them had been</p>
<p begin="02:33:38.050" end="02:33:42.340" style="s2">terribly brutalized by World War one so</p>
<p begin="02:33:40.750" end="02:33:44.771" style="s2">there was no shortage of anger to</p>
<p begin="02:33:42.340" end="02:33:46.630" style="s2">capitalize on and Hitler was just the</p>
<p begin="02:33:44.771" end="02:33:48.700" style="s2">guy annoyed as he was</p>
<p begin="02:33:46.630" end="02:33:50.860" style="s2">example that he was rejected from art</p>
<p begin="02:33:48.700" end="02:33:53.410" style="s2">school three times despite it despite</p>
<p begin="02:33:50.860" end="02:33:56.320" style="s2">having a fair bit of artistic talent he</p>
<p begin="02:33:53.410" end="02:33:59.770" style="s2">had his reasons for resentment and and</p>
<p begin="02:33:56.320" end="02:34:01.780" style="s2">and hatred and that&#39;s just a tiny part</p>
<p begin="02:33:59.770" end="02:34:02.590" style="s2">of it yes these things can go terribly</p>
<p begin="02:34:01.780" end="02:34:05.020" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="02:34:02.590" end="02:34:07.240" style="s2">it depends at least in part on what</p>
<p begin="02:34:05.020" end="02:34:10.240" style="s2">you&#39;re aiming at people ask me what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:34:07.240" end="02:34:12.250" style="s2">aiming at and I would say I mean who</p>
<p begin="02:34:10.240" end="02:34:14.350" style="s2">knows right because you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:34:12.250" end="02:34:18.520" style="s2">yourself and I don&#39;t know myself not to</p>
<p begin="02:34:14.350" end="02:34:23.080" style="s2">the final depths but I think what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:34:18.520" end="02:34:25.060" style="s2">aiming at I&#39;m hoping is exactly what I</p>
<p begin="02:34:23.080" end="02:34:31.740" style="s2">say I&#39;m aiming out I hope that what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:34:25.060" end="02:34:34.300" style="s2">aiming at is to tell people stories and</p>
<p begin="02:34:31.740" end="02:34:37.720" style="s2">provide them with clinical intervention</p>
<p begin="02:34:34.300" end="02:34:40.720" style="s2">information that&#39;s derived from the best</p>
<p begin="02:34:37.720" end="02:34:43.510" style="s2">literature and science that I know so</p>
<p begin="02:34:40.720" end="02:34:45.760" style="s2">that they can be fortified in their</p>
<p begin="02:34:43.510" end="02:34:47.950" style="s2">ability to contend with tragedy and</p>
<p begin="02:34:45.760" end="02:34:50.140" style="s2">malevolence and the reason that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:34:47.950" end="02:34:51.820" style="s2">doing that as far as I&#39;m concerned is</p>
<p begin="02:34:50.140" end="02:34:54.430" style="s2">because when I wrote my first book which</p>
<p begin="02:34:51.820" end="02:34:56.260" style="s2">was maps of meaning the audio version of</p>
<p begin="02:34:54.430" end="02:34:58.620" style="s2">which is out next week by the way I</p>
<p begin="02:34:56.260" end="02:35:01.300" style="s2">think it&#39;ll be easier to understand</p>
<p begin="02:34:58.620" end="02:35:05.610" style="s2">because it&#39;s read and the intonation is</p>
<p begin="02:35:01.300" end="02:35:07.930" style="s2">all there I concluded after studying the</p>
<p begin="02:35:05.610" end="02:35:13.740" style="s2">psychological dynamics of the Cold War</p>
<p begin="02:35:07.930" end="02:35:16.689" style="s2">that the only proper medication to</p>
<p begin="02:35:13.740" end="02:35:18.850" style="s2">tyrannical collectivism was the</p>
<p begin="02:35:16.689" end="02:35:20.500" style="s2">sovereignty of the individual and that</p>
<p begin="02:35:18.850" end="02:35:22.510" style="s2">as a consequence that the sovereign</p>
<p begin="02:35:20.500" end="02:35:24.880" style="s2">individual needed to be strengthened</p>
<p begin="02:35:22.510" end="02:35:28.060" style="s2">that that was the path forward with</p>
<p begin="02:35:24.880" end="02:35:30.640" style="s2">least harm and most potential good and I</p>
<p begin="02:35:28.060" end="02:35:32.830" style="s2">think that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing my evidence</p>
<p begin="02:35:30.640" end="02:35:35.979" style="s2">for that is that I&#39;ve been doing it for</p>
<p begin="02:35:32.830" end="02:35:38.080" style="s2">thirty years I taught courses based on</p>
<p begin="02:35:35.979" end="02:35:41.800" style="s2">that at Harvard and at the University of</p>
<p begin="02:35:38.080" end="02:35:43.510" style="s2">Toronto consistently the lectures were</p>
<p begin="02:35:41.800" end="02:35:46.600" style="s2">made into a television program in</p>
<p begin="02:35:43.510" end="02:35:48.850" style="s2">Toronto that was popular the lectures</p>
<p begin="02:35:46.600" end="02:35:51.610" style="s2">became explosively popular online</p>
<p begin="02:35:48.850" end="02:35:54.520" style="s2">everybody can see what I&#39;m saying as far</p>
<p begin="02:35:51.610" end="02:35:56.920" style="s2">as I can tell and apart from the hip</p>
<p begin="02:35:54.520" end="02:36:00.370" style="s2">pieces which are perhaps valid</p>
<p begin="02:35:56.920" end="02:36:03.221" style="s2">criticisms although I don&#39;t believe so</p>
<p begin="02:36:00.370" end="02:36:04.931" style="s2">the overwhelming evidence as far as I</p>
<p begin="02:36:03.221" end="02:36:07.900" style="s2">can tell is that it&#39;s having a positive</p>
<p begin="02:36:04.931" end="02:36:10.330" style="s2">consequence so and I&#39;m hoping and I have</p>
<p begin="02:36:07.900" end="02:36:11.921" style="s2">people watching me and criticizing me</p>
<p begin="02:36:10.330" end="02:36:13.721" style="s2">like friends of mine and my family</p>
<p begin="02:36:11.921" end="02:36:18.181" style="s2">trying to make sure that this all works</p>
<p begin="02:36:13.721" end="02:36:33.160" style="s2">and so hopefully I&#39;m not doing something</p>
<p begin="02:36:18.181" end="02:36:36.461" style="s2">that isn&#39;t good we&#39;ll see but yes so the</p>
<p begin="02:36:33.160" end="02:36:43.541" style="s2">last last question what did you think of</p>
<p begin="02:36:36.461" end="02:36:45.551" style="s2">the last Star Wars movie I&#39;ve gone I</p>
<p begin="02:36:43.541" end="02:36:48.971" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I saw the last Star Wars</p>
<p begin="02:36:45.551" end="02:36:50.740" style="s2">movie but I saw one of the last I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:36:48.971" end="02:36:53.230" style="s2">probably seen three of the last and five</p>
<p begin="02:36:50.740" end="02:36:54.881" style="s2">Star Wars movies I would say and I</p>
<p begin="02:36:53.230" end="02:36:59.471" style="s2">thought they were all the same movie as</p>
<p begin="02:36:54.881" end="02:37:02.291" style="s2">the first Star Wars movie so so I</p>
<p begin="02:36:59.471" end="02:37:06.700" style="s2">haven&#39;t they haven&#39;t been my cup of tea</p>
<p begin="02:37:02.291" end="02:37:09.341" style="s2">let&#39;s say having said that it&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="02:37:06.700" end="02:37:11.440" style="s2">that you know the superhero movies the</p>
<p begin="02:37:09.341" end="02:37:14.080" style="s2">Star Wars movies the Star Trek movies</p>
<p begin="02:37:11.440" end="02:37:16.410" style="s2">the fantastic success that Marvel in</p>
<p begin="02:37:14.080" end="02:37:18.341" style="s2">particular has had with their superhero</p>
<p begin="02:37:16.410" end="02:37:20.171" style="s2">Pantheon like those are the most</p>
<p begin="02:37:18.341" end="02:37:21.551" style="s2">expensive artifacts that people make a</p>
<p begin="02:37:20.171" end="02:37:23.291" style="s2">those movies that&#39;s something to really</p>
<p begin="02:37:21.551" end="02:37:24.610" style="s2">think about you know people put 200</p>
<p begin="02:37:23.291" end="02:37:26.261" style="s2">million dollars into the movie like that</p>
<p begin="02:37:24.610" end="02:37:28.061" style="s2">it&#39;s not the most expensive thing we</p>
<p begin="02:37:26.261" end="02:37:30.101" style="s2">make but it&#39;s bloody well up there I can</p>
<p begin="02:37:28.061" end="02:37:33.251" style="s2">tell you and it&#39;s pretty interesting to</p>
<p begin="02:37:30.101" end="02:37:35.681" style="s2">realize as well that making the special</p>
<p begin="02:37:33.251" end="02:37:37.421" style="s2">effects for those movies which is which</p>
<p begin="02:37:35.681" end="02:37:38.791" style="s2">is a form of artificial reality let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:37:37.421" end="02:37:40.990" style="s2">say is part of what&#39;s driving</p>
<p begin="02:37:38.791" end="02:37:43.421" style="s2">computational sophistication forward</p>
<p begin="02:37:40.990" end="02:37:45.700" style="s2">because the big processors are being</p>
<p begin="02:37:43.421" end="02:37:48.461" style="s2">used most intensively to render reality</p>
<p begin="02:37:45.700" end="02:37:51.580" style="s2">and so whatever&#39;s happening in those</p>
<p begin="02:37:48.461" end="02:37:53.711" style="s2">movies is something far more significant</p>
<p begin="02:37:51.580" end="02:37:57.521" style="s2">than you might think I think it all</p>
<p begin="02:37:53.711" end="02:37:59.921" style="s2">speaks to the unquenchable power of</p>
<p begin="02:37:57.521" end="02:38:03.190" style="s2">mythology and its proclivity to manifest</p>
<p begin="02:37:59.921" end="02:38:06.940" style="s2">itself in a multitude of forms and and</p>
<p begin="02:38:03.190" end="02:38:10.391" style="s2">and to be internally compelling to</p>
<p begin="02:38:06.940" end="02:38:12.730" style="s2">people and so generally that seems to be</p>
<p begin="02:38:10.391" end="02:38:14.230" style="s2">a really good thing to me so I mean</p>
<p begin="02:38:12.730" end="02:38:15.700" style="s2">they&#39;re a Harry Potter series</p>
<p begin="02:38:14.230" end="02:38:17.700" style="s2">I think is a better example than the</p>
<p begin="02:38:15.700" end="02:38:22.211" style="s2">Star Wars series because I think that I</p>
<p begin="02:38:17.700" end="02:38:25.690" style="s2">think that the Star Wars series is a bit</p>
<p begin="02:38:22.211" end="02:38:29.200" style="s2">too consciously contrived whereas the</p>
<p begin="02:38:25.690" end="02:38:31.150" style="s2">Harry Potter series is genuinely to my</p>
<p begin="02:38:29.200" end="02:38:35.141" style="s2">way of thinking anyways is a genuine</p>
<p begin="02:38:31.150" end="02:38:37.150" style="s2">intuitive production and rolling got her</p>
<p begin="02:38:35.141" end="02:38:38.980" style="s2">mythology she&#39;s so good at that I just</p>
<p begin="02:38:37.150" end="02:38:39.910" style="s2">can&#39;t believe it it&#39;s just absolutely</p>
<p begin="02:38:38.980" end="02:38:41.711" style="s2">unbelievable</p>
<p begin="02:38:39.910" end="02:38:44.410" style="s2">and you think of the consequences of</p>
<p begin="02:38:41.711" end="02:38:47.440" style="s2">that she wrote with seven books about</p>
<p begin="02:38:44.410" end="02:38:49.811" style="s2">wizards like teenage wizards and child</p>
<p begin="02:38:47.440" end="02:38:52.690" style="s2">wizards in magical castle threatened by</p>
<p begin="02:38:49.811" end="02:38:54.551" style="s2">giant snakes and portrayed the battle</p>
<p begin="02:38:52.690" end="02:38:56.921" style="s2">between good and evil on a landscape of</p>
<p begin="02:38:54.551" end="02:38:58.721" style="s2">chaos and order and you know sold I</p>
<p begin="02:38:56.921" end="02:39:02.471" style="s2">don&#39;t know what&#39;s her empire worth in</p>
<p begin="02:38:58.721" end="02:39:05.471" style="s2">terms of total financial consequences it</p>
<p begin="02:39:02.471" end="02:39:07.780" style="s2">would be it&#39;s in the tens of billions of</p>
<p begin="02:39:05.471" end="02:39:10.240" style="s2">dollars certainly she got all these kids</p>
<p begin="02:39:07.780" end="02:39:11.740" style="s2">to read 600 page books they produced all</p>
<p begin="02:39:10.240" end="02:39:14.261" style="s2">these movies that were fantastically</p>
<p begin="02:39:11.740" end="02:39:15.940" style="s2">expensive everybody read them and went</p>
<p begin="02:39:14.261" end="02:39:17.801" style="s2">and watched them it&#39;s like and what do</p>
<p begin="02:39:15.940" end="02:39:19.511" style="s2">you see there it&#39;s a dying and</p>
<p begin="02:39:17.801" end="02:39:22.360" style="s2">resurrecting hero fights a satanic</p>
<p begin="02:39:19.511" end="02:39:25.391" style="s2">figure and attains final victory through</p>
<p begin="02:39:22.360" end="02:39:27.160" style="s2">death and resurrection it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="02:39:25.391" end="02:39:33.370" style="s2">know and it wasn&#39;t contrived that came</p>
<p begin="02:39:27.160" end="02:39:35.711" style="s2">out of the story and so the mythology</p>
<p begin="02:39:33.370" end="02:39:37.421" style="s2">seeps in no matter what and it&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="02:39:35.711" end="02:39:39.551" style="s2">and this is something I learned from you</p>
<p begin="02:39:37.421" end="02:39:42.490" style="s2">is that it&#39;s time for us to understand</p>
<p begin="02:39:39.551" end="02:39:44.891" style="s2">it it&#39;s we can&#39;t just live by it</p>
<p begin="02:39:42.490" end="02:39:47.080" style="s2">unconsciously anymore we have to</p>
<p begin="02:39:44.891" end="02:39:50.171" style="s2">understand it as well as living by it</p>
<p begin="02:39:47.080" end="02:39:53.561" style="s2">and that&#39;s the task of the 21st century</p>
<p begin="02:39:50.171" end="02:39:55.360" style="s2">that&#39;s what it looks like to me so if we</p>
<p begin="02:39:53.561" end="02:39:58.360" style="s2">understand it then maybe we can fortify</p>
<p begin="02:39:55.360" end="02:40:00.790" style="s2">ourselves against collectivist ideology</p>
