<p begin="00:00:11.550" end="00:00:15.809" style="s2">want to talk about the difference</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.500" end="00:00:18.210" style="s2">between capitalism and communism and how</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.809" end="00:00:22.650" style="s2">you find purpose in that</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.210" end="00:00:24.960" style="s2">so in capitalism you choose it you have</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.650" end="00:00:26.369" style="s2">to pay for your own education and you</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.960" end="00:00:27.660" style="s2">need to make the trade you need to make</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.369" end="00:00:29.400" style="s2">your own decisions and the trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.660" end="00:00:31.920" style="s2">between you don&#39;t want to pick something</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.400" end="00:00:35.489" style="s2">I make money at or do I want to pick</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.920" end="00:00:37.620" style="s2">something that calls to me and for some</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.489" end="00:00:39.360" style="s2">lucky people those are the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.620" end="00:00:42.750" style="s2">but for many people they have to make</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.360" end="00:00:44.730" style="s2">that trade-off and so some people</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.750" end="00:00:46.050" style="s2">thrives under capitalism they&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.730" end="00:00:50.579" style="s2">find that they&#39;re able to find purpose</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.050" end="00:00:52.680" style="s2">and profit and other people are added</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.579" end="00:00:55.320" style="s2">aren&#39;t happy but are making lots of</p>

<p begin="00:00:57.300" end="00:00:59.750" style="s2">lots of money or at the opposite this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.190" end="00:01:03.600" style="s2">the trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.750" end="00:01:06.390" style="s2">there&#39;s also competition in under</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.600" end="00:01:08.909" style="s2">capitalism so you succeeding is somebody</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.390" end="00:01:11.369" style="s2">else failing where there&#39;s only one job</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.909" end="00:01:12.659" style="s2">that we&#39;re all competing for or a set</p>

<p begin="00:01:21.710" end="00:01:27.930" style="s2">you have to pay that price you need to</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.049" end="00:01:31.520" style="s2">if you want quality employees you have</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.930" end="00:01:34.950" style="s2">to pay a higher price under communism</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.520" end="00:01:39.450" style="s2">the government decides who what you do</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.950" end="00:01:42.810" style="s2">so based on the society&#39;s needs and your</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.450" end="00:01:44.729" style="s2">talents they assign you a job and that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:01:46.649" end="00:01:50.189" style="s2">making the same amount of money at it so</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.060" end="00:01:53.040" style="s2">the happiness money trade-off doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.189" end="00:01:55.649" style="s2">exist but you&#39;re also not tapping into</p>

<p begin="00:01:55.649" end="00:02:00.450" style="s2">neither really so that&#39;s not a great a</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.719" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">great trade-off a system that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.450" end="00:02:07.439" style="s2">possible is to honor both the individual</p>

<p begin="00:02:42.330" end="00:02:48.120" style="s2">love doing what calls to them and not a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.910" end="00:02:52.110" style="s2">job description that&#39;s possibly 50/50 or</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.120" end="00:02:56.460" style="s2">worse than a 90/10 split and it&#39;s 90</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.110" end="00:02:59.220" style="s2">plus I&#39;m saying here in groups in that</p>

<p begin="00:04:02.790" end="00:04:08.550" style="s2">it&#39;s not about having a job description</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.300" end="00:04:10.710" style="s2">to fit in it&#39;s about fitting in who you</p>

<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:22.560" style="s2">personalities are compatible so everyone</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.730" end="00:04:23.070" style="s2">can find a space that works for them and</p>

<p begin="00:04:42.150" end="00:04:46.560" style="s2">from not having to have that trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.890" end="00:04:48.090" style="s2">between money and happiness where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:49.530" style="s2">meeting all of our needs with other</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.090" end="00:04:52.500" style="s2">tools that we talked about other videos</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.530" end="00:04:55.860" style="s2">and at the same time we have a human</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.500" end="00:04:57.270" style="s2">need to contribute so if you&#39;re given</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.860" end="00:05:00.570" style="s2">the tools to be able to contribute at</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.270" end="00:05:03.420" style="s2">your level and your interests people</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.570" end="00:05:04.710" style="s2">want to contribute and especially if</p>

<p begin="00:05:07.290" end="00:05:11.400" style="s2">and help finding the group and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.670" end="00:05:13.830" style="s2">maintaining the group so that is a bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.400" end="00:05:15.630" style="s2">of what how someone would find their</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.830" end="00:05:22.620" style="s2">Colleen or how we can help each other in</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.630" end="00:05:26.390" style="s2">the world and yeah again just tapping in</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.620" end="00:05:29.580" style="s2">to the full potential of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.390" end="00:05:33.600" style="s2">helping them be happy helping them find</p>

<p begin="00:05:33.600" end="00:05:36.720" style="s2">them to do that we&#39;re not in competition</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.700" end="00:05:38.550" style="s2">with each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.720" end="00:05:40.140" style="s2">everyone&#39;s succeeding in helps us</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.550" end="00:05:41.790" style="s2">succeed because now we have their</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.140" end="00:05:44.250" style="s2">amazing ideas to work with and their</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.790" end="00:05:47.280" style="s2">amazing ideas because no one can be you</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.250" end="00:05:48.720" style="s2">and so any project made up of those</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.280" end="00:05:52.050" style="s2">specific individuals is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.720" end="00:05:53.850" style="s2">unique in a world where we&#39;ve tapped</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.050" end="00:05:58.740" style="s2">into that and we&#39;ve created the groups</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.850" end="00:06:00.720" style="s2">that harness that we can solve every</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.740" end="00:06:04.260" style="s2">single human problem every single</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.720" end="00:06:06.840" style="s2">economic environmental rather easily and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.260" end="00:06:10.920" style="s2">rather quickly because what I can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.840" end="00:06:13.410" style="s2">other people can and we work better when</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.920" end="00:06:15.840" style="s2">we have that hive mind so it&#39;s a little</p>
