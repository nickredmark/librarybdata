<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:06.660" style="s2">so let&#39;s start with deficiency nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.909" end="00:00:09.260" style="s2">and just to clarify when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.660" end="00:00:12.240" style="s2">about deficiency we&#39;re talking about not</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.260" end="00:00:14.730" style="s2">clinical deficiency meaning you know if</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.240" end="00:00:16.740" style="s2">someone has low enough levels of vitamin</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.730" end="00:00:18.119" style="s2">D they have rickets or if they have low</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.740" end="00:00:18.750" style="s2">enough levels of vitamin C they have</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.119" end="00:00:21.900" style="s2">scurvy</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.750" end="00:00:24.119" style="s2">but between optimum levels and a full-on</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.900" end="00:00:26.460" style="s2">disease state is a pretty big room for</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.119" end="00:00:30.150" style="s2">sub-optimal and so we want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.460" end="00:00:31.710" style="s2">what our optimal ranges for various</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.150" end="00:00:33.360" style="s2">nutrients that are needed for not just</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.710" end="00:00:36.899" style="s2">health in general but specifically</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.360" end="00:00:38.219" style="s2">cognitive and psychological so if if</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.899" end="00:00:41.370" style="s2">people are kind of new coming to this</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.219" end="00:00:43.950" style="s2">what are the foundations of nutrition</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.370" end="00:00:47.550" style="s2">that are relevant for brain health and</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.950" end="00:00:50.489" style="s2">chemistry well I think it would be best</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.550" end="00:00:53.760" style="s2">to kind of start off by clarifying you</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.489" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">know deficiencies and excesses some some</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:00:58.620" style="s2">of the nutrients have a very narrow</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:01:00.899" style="s2">spectrum of deficiency in excess so that</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.620" end="00:01:06.689" style="s2">they&#39;re very narrowly focused into a</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.899" end="00:01:08.510" style="s2">range of optimal but the Bruce Ames did</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.689" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">a really good job of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.510" end="00:01:13.860" style="s2">micronutrients and his triage theory of</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:15.540" style="s2">them and and I think it applies well</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.860" end="00:01:20.670" style="s2">from what I&#39;ve seen in clinical practice</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.540" end="00:01:23.400" style="s2">where the body has has two different</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.670" end="00:01:26.090" style="s2">mechanisms at work you have the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.400" end="00:01:29.189" style="s2">everyday function the survival function</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.090" end="00:01:31.920" style="s2">where it&#39;s using certain nutrients and</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.189" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">and there they&#39;re allocated to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.920" end="00:01:35.790" style="s2">everyday survival but then in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:39.780" style="s2">background of that we also have long</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.790" end="00:01:41.880" style="s2">term survival and long term aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.780" end="00:01:44.490" style="s2">like DNA repair and monitoring and</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.880" end="00:01:46.950" style="s2">things like that but when we when we get</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.490" end="00:01:50.189" style="s2">deficient we may not have overt signs of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.950" end="00:01:51.810" style="s2">deficiency because it&#39;s being triaged so</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.189" end="00:01:53.820" style="s2">they&#39;re taking the limited amount of</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.810" end="00:01:56.040" style="s2">nutrient that we have the body does this</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.820" end="00:01:59.460" style="s2">and and allocates it to the things that</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.040" end="00:02:01.950" style="s2">we need for daily survival and so we may</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:04.860" style="s2">not be aware of this ongoing deficiency</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.950" end="00:02:08.459" style="s2">of some micronutrients or a macro</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.860" end="00:02:12.930" style="s2">nutrient even that could be impairing</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.459" end="00:02:13.890" style="s2">long-term survival benefits and so you</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.930" end="00:02:15.630" style="s2">know looking at</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:19.650" style="s2">at it from a symptomatology standpoint</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.630" end="00:02:22.380" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s kind of vague</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.650" end="00:02:25.080" style="s2">when we go with symptoms so what we want</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.380" end="00:02:28.470" style="s2">to look at is what are the items that</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.080" end="00:02:30.330" style="s2">are are really significant that we need</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.470" end="00:02:32.850" style="s2">to get in everyday to maintain not only</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.330" end="00:02:35.730" style="s2">that that daily aspect but also that</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.850" end="00:02:39.090" style="s2">long-term survival piece yep long-term</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.730" end="00:02:41.370" style="s2">survival and optimization obviously go</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.090" end="00:02:42.840" style="s2">together right because if we&#39;re if we</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.370" end="00:02:44.550" style="s2">have enough calcium in the blood for all</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.840" end="00:02:46.260" style="s2">the critical calcium ion channel stuff</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.550" end="00:02:48.930" style="s2">that has to happen daily but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.260" end="00:02:50.760" style="s2">moving slowly into osteopenia where some</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.930" end="00:02:52.920" style="s2">of the reserves are decreasing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.760" end="00:02:55.700" style="s2">also moving into sub optimal function</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.920" end="00:02:58.500" style="s2">even though we&#39;re still asymptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.700" end="00:03:00.209" style="s2">yeah and we have I mean we have systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.500" end="00:03:01.890" style="s2">in place the body is capable of making</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.209" end="00:03:03.989" style="s2">many things but we also have some</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.890" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">essential nutrients and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.989" end="00:03:07.350" style="s2">what we call conditionally essential</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:10.470" style="s2">nutrients which are nutrients that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.350" end="00:03:12.989" style="s2">body can make but under under stressors</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.470" end="00:03:14.550" style="s2">or increased demand the body can&#39;t keep</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.989" end="00:03:18.870" style="s2">up with needs so we need to get those</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.550" end="00:03:20.459" style="s2">into our diet in some way so do you</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.870" end="00:03:23.430" style="s2">think amino acids are a good place to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.459" end="00:03:26.880" style="s2">start for brand new yeah that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.430" end="00:03:29.700" style="s2">place to start I mean you know we we</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.880" end="00:03:31.620" style="s2">deal with with amino acids the buddies</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.700" end="00:03:34.130" style="s2">body&#39;s capable of making most of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.620" end="00:03:36.630" style="s2">amino acids but we also have the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.130" end="00:03:39.530" style="s2">essential amino acids which the body</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.630" end="00:03:42.150" style="s2">can&#39;t make you know we&#39;re there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.530" end="00:03:45.510" style="s2">we&#39;re one of the few organisms on this</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.150" end="00:03:47.489" style="s2">planet that has two that can&#39;t make all</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.510" end="00:03:51.209" style="s2">of the proteins that we need in our body</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.489" end="00:03:54.450" style="s2">we we have to have certain amino acids</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.209" end="00:03:56.519" style="s2">that are going to be able to be taken in</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.450" end="00:03:58.350" style="s2">in the diet that we&#39;re not capable of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.519" end="00:04:02.250" style="s2">making but we need to survive you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.350" end="00:04:05.880" style="s2">in so having a good balance of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.250" end="00:04:08.250" style="s2">intake of protein is essential and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.880" end="00:04:10.440" style="s2">proteins have different biologic values</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.250" end="00:04:13.049" style="s2">when it comes to the amount of essential</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.440" end="00:04:16.140" style="s2">amino acids that are present in them we</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.049" end="00:04:20.010" style="s2">see a lot of issues with people who have</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.140" end="00:04:23.760" style="s2">low protein intake that are vegetarian</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.010" end="00:04:25.860" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not that the vegetarian</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.760" end="00:04:26.880" style="s2">aspect is in any way negative but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.860" end="00:04:30.210" style="s2">something that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.880" end="00:04:32.370" style="s2">pay attention to because you will need</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.210" end="00:04:34.470" style="s2">to supplement certain things to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.370" end="00:04:38.280" style="s2">adequate nutrition especially a</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.470" end="00:04:41.460" style="s2">cognitive function in that situation so</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.280" end="00:04:44.960" style="s2">for the those who don&#39;t know what is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.460" end="00:04:47.430" style="s2">role of amino acids in neuro chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.960" end="00:04:51.810" style="s2">well the amino acids are the building</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.430" end="00:04:55.350" style="s2">blocks of all proteins and there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.810" end="00:04:59.420" style="s2">proteins can take the form of of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.350" end="00:04:59.420" style="s2">receptors they can take the form of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.720" end="00:05:05.910" style="s2">neuromodulators there&#39;s they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.660" end="00:05:08.100" style="s2">building blocks of what we require in</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.910" end="00:05:10.290" style="s2">order to function in an optimal state</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.100" end="00:05:12.210" style="s2">and when we don&#39;t have that ability to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.290" end="00:05:16.130" style="s2">build those it&#39;s like having like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.210" end="00:05:18.750" style="s2">building a house and you have all of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.130" end="00:05:21.390" style="s2">essential pieces to build that house but</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.750" end="00:05:23.730" style="s2">the nails are missing so you can have</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.390" end="00:05:25.980" style="s2">all of the additional wood and you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.730" end="00:05:27.270" style="s2">have excess of bricks and everything</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.980" end="00:05:30.120" style="s2">like that but if you&#39;re missing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.270" end="00:05:31.830" style="s2">nails or the mortar then you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.120" end="00:05:33.690" style="s2">going to have a solid structure and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.830" end="00:05:36.030" style="s2">goes the same with neuro chemistry if</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.690" end="00:05:39.150" style="s2">you don&#39;t have all of these nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.030" end="00:05:40.680" style="s2">that are there to balance out and make</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.150" end="00:05:43.890" style="s2">everything that&#39;s needed you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.680" end="00:05:48.030" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna end up with deficiencies so</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.890" end="00:05:51.330" style="s2">I think a specific simple interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.030" end="00:05:53.930" style="s2">point for people is that brain has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.330" end="00:05:57.090" style="s2">of different kind of signaling chemicals</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.930" end="00:05:59.160" style="s2">peptides and endorphins and neural</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.090" end="00:06:01.370" style="s2">hormones and the neurotransmitters that</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.160" end="00:06:04.260" style="s2">many of us are used to hearing of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.370" end="00:06:07.440" style="s2">dopamine and serotonin are the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.260" end="00:06:09.780" style="s2">commonly heard of happiness related kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.440" end="00:06:12.480" style="s2">of psychiatric hormones I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.780" end="00:06:17.310" style="s2">transmitters are both made directly from</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.480" end="00:06:19.800" style="s2">key amino acids so tryptophan converts</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.310" end="00:06:22.380" style="s2">into serotonin and then melatonin to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.800" end="00:06:24.300" style="s2">sleep and dopamine or tyrosine</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.380" end="00:06:28.890" style="s2">I mean dopamine from tyrosine or phenyl</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.300" end="00:06:31.650" style="s2">alanine so this means if someone is not</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.890" end="00:06:32.730" style="s2">either getting enough dietary amino</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.650" end="00:06:34.320" style="s2">acids so they&#39;re not getting enough</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.730" end="00:06:36.120" style="s2">protein or they&#39;re not breaking it down</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.320" end="00:06:37.620" style="s2">or absorbing or assimilating it they</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.120" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">literally don&#39;t have the building blocks</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.620" end="00:06:42.220" style="s2">necessary for keener</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.520" end="00:06:43.990" style="s2">Trane&#39;s hunters right and I mean you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.220" end="00:06:46.240" style="s2">got to look at it from a total system</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.990" end="00:06:48.610" style="s2">standpoint to I mean you know do they</p>

<p begin="00:06:48.610" end="00:06:53.800" style="s2">utilize those amino acids as well so</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.250" end="00:06:55.389" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to not only have that that</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.800" end="00:06:57.099" style="s2">precursor piece but you&#39;ve got to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.389" end="00:07:00.819" style="s2">the steps in between to get to that</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.099" end="00:07:03.400" style="s2">final output and you know we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.819" end="00:07:06.240" style="s2">some issues with that with with some of</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.400" end="00:07:08.650" style="s2">the tyrosine hydroxylase</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.240" end="00:07:10.030" style="s2">deficiencies where you can get adequate</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.650" end="00:07:13.659" style="s2">amino acids but you&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.030" end="00:07:17.729" style="s2">converting it into the dopamine right in</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.659" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">the end result so what are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.729" end="00:07:20.889" style="s2">will kind of move from amino acids for a</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:22.900" style="s2">minute what are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.889" end="00:07:24.909" style="s2">micronutrients that are necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.900" end="00:07:28.030" style="s2">convert amino acids and ten</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.909" end="00:07:29.949" style="s2">neurotransmitters well and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.030" end="00:07:31.750" style="s2">important too to really define the</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.949" end="00:07:36.039" style="s2">micronutrients the micronutrients are</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.750" end="00:07:38.860" style="s2">the sort of the vitamins and minerals</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.039" end="00:07:41.080" style="s2">that are required in and most of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.860" end="00:07:43.360" style="s2">time these are required as cofactors so</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.080" end="00:07:45.520" style="s2">they&#39;re required in those steps that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.360" end="00:07:47.380" style="s2">was talking about if going from you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.520" end="00:07:49.030" style="s2">the tyrosine to the dopamine you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.380" end="00:07:51.909" style="s2">what are you going to need in there what</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.030" end="00:07:55.810" style="s2">what pieces might be deficient that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.909" end="00:07:57.460" style="s2">could impair that v6 and is a common</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.810" end="00:08:00.550" style="s2">micronutrient is a common deficiency</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.460" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">that would that we see and it can be a</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.550" end="00:08:04.990" style="s2">rate limiting step in the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:08.409" style="s2">neurotransmitters in the brain when we</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.990" end="00:08:09.130" style="s2">have deficiencies vitamin D also another</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.409" end="00:08:14.560" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.130" end="00:08:17.370" style="s2">b12 another one magnesium copper zinc I</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.560" end="00:08:20.919" style="s2">mean these are all micronutrients that</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.370" end="00:08:23.889" style="s2">are fairly common as far as deficiencies</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.919" end="00:08:25.750" style="s2">are concerned in the in the American</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.889" end="00:08:27.729" style="s2">diet I mean we talked about how balanced</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.750" end="00:08:29.830" style="s2">are our diets are and everything but our</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.729" end="00:08:33.219" style="s2">food chain has become very deficient in</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.830" end="00:08:35.050" style="s2">these micronutrients and you know we do</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.219" end="00:08:36.969" style="s2">a lot of people will say well I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.050" end="00:08:39.339" style="s2">get all my micro nutrients from food and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.969" end="00:08:41.169" style="s2">unfortunately when you look at the micro</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.339" end="00:08:43.750" style="s2">nutrient content of the food that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.169" end="00:08:46.779" style="s2">eating today relative to 50 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.750" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s significant deficiencies</p>
