<p begin="00:00:21.210" end="00:00:25.500" style="s2">develop with you the right side of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.489" end="00:00:28.230" style="s2">plausibility argument I&#39;m making and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.500" end="00:00:30.629" style="s2">tried to give an account of central</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.230" end="00:00:33.059" style="s2">features of human spirituality and to</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.629" end="00:00:38.100" style="s2">try not use that term therefore in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.059" end="00:00:40.140" style="s2">vague indefinite way and and I made an</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.100" end="00:00:43.410" style="s2">argument for how relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.140" end="00:00:45.870" style="s2">can explain many of the facets that are</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.410" end="00:00:50.510" style="s2">found within the normal attribution of</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.870" end="00:00:56.300" style="s2">human spirituality and I proposed a term</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.510" end="00:00:58.710" style="s2">religio to cover all of those aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.300" end="00:01:03.019" style="s2">spirituality that can be explained by</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.710" end="00:01:05.610" style="s2">the machinery of relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.019" end="00:01:07.259" style="s2">there was of course an important</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.610" end="00:01:10.380" style="s2">lacunae there was something that was</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.259" end="00:01:13.950" style="s2">still missing from that account and this</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.380" end="00:01:16.140" style="s2">was the account of the sacred and then I</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.950" end="00:01:19.109" style="s2">propose to you in order to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.140" end="00:01:21.179" style="s2">confusion especially post Schirrmacher</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.109" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">that we should make a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.179" end="00:01:28.289" style="s2">between the metaphysical proposal of the</p>

<p begin="00:01:28.289" end="00:01:33.299" style="s2">sacredness we&#39;re clear markers</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.090" end="00:01:36.810" style="s2">emphasizing the experience and then for</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.299" end="00:01:40.289" style="s2">reasons of the way my argument has</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.810" end="00:01:43.649" style="s2">unfolded since I&#39;m talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.289" end="00:01:45.090" style="s2">psycho existential machinery of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.649" end="00:01:47.130" style="s2">sacredness as opposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.090" end="00:01:50.369" style="s2">metaphysical proposal at least initially</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.130" end="00:01:55.700" style="s2">that is where I should begin so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.369" end="00:01:59.609" style="s2">talking now we began to speak about a</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.700" end="00:02:03.299" style="s2">way of using the theoretical machinery</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.609" end="00:02:06.270" style="s2">we have developed here in order to talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.299" end="00:02:08.940" style="s2">about sacredness and we began by going</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.270" end="00:02:11.340" style="s2">to the work that we&#39;d already talked</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.940" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">about about Dom aside back to the work</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.340" end="00:02:16.500" style="s2">of Gerrits and we talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:18.750" style="s2">sacredness one of the ways it functions</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.500" end="00:02:21.900" style="s2">one of the ways we can experience it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.750" end="00:02:23.370" style="s2">that it functions is a meta meaning</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.900" end="00:02:24.250" style="s2">system that affords a worldview</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.370" end="00:02:29.620" style="s2">attunement</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.250" end="00:02:31.480" style="s2">and thereby homes us against horror but</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.620" end="00:02:33.910" style="s2">then I noted that of course in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.480" end="00:02:37.870" style="s2">Hellenistic domicile there was not only</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.910" end="00:02:40.660" style="s2">the machinery that attempted to rehome</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.870" end="00:02:42.850" style="s2">us like the syncretic religions and one</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.660" end="00:02:44.530" style="s2">could probably argue also stoicism as</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.850" end="00:02:47.410" style="s2">I&#39;ve already argued but there was also</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.530" end="00:02:50.920" style="s2">there was an alternative response which</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.410" end="00:02:55.540" style="s2">was the transgressive response of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.920" end="00:03:00.820" style="s2">Gnostics ultimately and I then said that</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.540" end="00:03:02.950" style="s2">gives us an opening into another aspect</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.820" end="00:03:06.430" style="s2">of sacredness and this is the work of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.950" end="00:03:09.850" style="s2">Otto and his book that as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.430" end="00:03:12.280" style="s2">was typically entitled the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.850" end="00:03:14.080" style="s2">holy and I said a better translation</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.280" end="00:03:17.620" style="s2">would perhaps be the experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.080" end="00:03:20.970" style="s2">numinous and what Ottawa&#39;s proposing is</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.620" end="00:03:23.980" style="s2">that before we had a moral</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.970" end="00:03:29.200" style="s2">interpretation of holiness there was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.980" end="00:03:32.440" style="s2">pre moral view of what I&#39;m calling</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.200" end="00:03:34.450" style="s2">sacredness and this or at least an</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.440" end="00:03:38.830" style="s2">aspect of the sacred of sacredness I</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.450" end="00:03:40.269" style="s2">should say and what Otto was pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.830" end="00:03:43.690" style="s2">was the experience of the numinous which</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.269" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">is closely related to the adjective that</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.690" end="00:03:48.430" style="s2">is most applied to God for example in</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.480" end="00:03:51.640" style="s2">the Old Testament which is glorious God</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.430" end="00:03:54.370" style="s2">is shining and overwhelming and powerful</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.640" end="00:04:00.370" style="s2">but glory does not carry with it any</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.370" end="00:04:02.170" style="s2">moral sense in fact one way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.370" end="00:04:04.630" style="s2">interpreting what&#39;s going on in the book</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.170" end="00:04:06.700" style="s2">of Job is a contrast between some of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.630" end="00:04:10.030" style="s2">job&#39;s moral arguments about his</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.700" end="00:04:14.049" style="s2">suffering and God&#39;s response is to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.030" end="00:04:15.459" style="s2">present his glory and how numinous he is</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.049" end="00:04:18.190" style="s2">and so you&#39;re seeing it sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.459" end="00:04:20.890" style="s2">conflict between these different aspects</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.190" end="00:04:22.120" style="s2">of holiness in job of course that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.890" end="00:04:23.919" style="s2">all that&#39;s happening in the book of Job</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.120" end="00:04:26.470" style="s2">and perhaps when I speak of Jung we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.919" end="00:04:29.790" style="s2">get back to that but right now what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.470" end="00:04:35.600" style="s2">want to pick up on is this insight by</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.790" end="00:04:40.610" style="s2">Auto that a part of sacredness seems to</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.600" end="00:04:43.850" style="s2">the experience of the numinous and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.610" end="00:04:47.120" style="s2">numinous seems to be transgressive an</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.850" end="00:04:48.800" style="s2">important way it seems to be in fact it</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.120" end="00:04:50.990" style="s2">seems to be taking us into the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.800" end="00:04:53.450" style="s2">the very thing that the gear see and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.990" end="00:04:55.850" style="s2">model of sacredness was supposed to home</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.450" end="00:05:03.280" style="s2">us against which is experiences that</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.850" end="00:05:05.810" style="s2">border on horror now Otto describes this</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.280" end="00:05:10.630" style="s2">experience of the numinous as having</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.810" end="00:05:13.970" style="s2">three central aspects to it it is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.630" end="00:05:17.270" style="s2">mystery very much</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.970" end="00:05:19.100" style="s2">in the way I argued last time the rather</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.270" end="00:05:22.280" style="s2">sense that we got from Marcel of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.100" end="00:05:24.380" style="s2">something that right brings about</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.280" end="00:05:29.000" style="s2">sensibility transcendence that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.380" end="00:05:32.390" style="s2">trajectory of trance framing and then it</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.000" end="00:05:34.850" style="s2">has two opposing poles in it which make</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.390" end="00:05:37.760" style="s2">a lot of sense so I think given what</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.850" end="00:05:41.300" style="s2">we&#39;ve what we&#39;ve built together one is</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.760" end="00:05:44.780" style="s2">is that it is deeply fascinating it</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.300" end="00:05:47.090" style="s2">compels so a good way of I think a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.780" end="00:05:49.750" style="s2">plausible way of understanding is this</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.090" end="00:05:53.120" style="s2">is super salient to you it is really</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.750" end="00:05:56.060" style="s2">grabbing your attention involving you</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.120" end="00:05:59.960" style="s2">you can&#39;t pull away so it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.060" end="00:06:03.160" style="s2">salient and then the other is he said</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.960" end="00:06:06.440" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.160" end="00:06:10.280" style="s2">it&#39;s horrifying it there&#39;s an aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.440" end="00:06:13.340" style="s2">horror to this now I got to stop for a</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.280" end="00:06:17.660" style="s2">minute and he&#39;ll I don&#39;t want to use the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.340" end="00:06:19.640" style="s2">word terror I to his original term but</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.660" end="00:06:21.890" style="s2">the promo terror is of course it has</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.640" end="00:06:24.860" style="s2">become deeply enmeshed with us with</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.890" end="00:06:28.880" style="s2">notions of terrorism and I want to put</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.860" end="00:06:30.740" style="s2">that aside that I&#39;m going to use the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.880" end="00:06:34.670" style="s2">word horror because it doesn&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.740" end="00:06:37.640" style="s2">that kind of Association but I had to</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.670" end="00:06:40.700" style="s2">know distance how I want to use this</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.640" end="00:06:42.710" style="s2">word from how it&#39;s become typically used</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.700" end="00:06:45.560" style="s2">by us</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.710" end="00:06:47.890" style="s2">so I much mentioned to you that most</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.560" end="00:06:49.490" style="s2">mystery novels and mystery movies aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.890" end="00:06:51.080" style="s2">mysterious at all that</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.490" end="00:06:52.639" style="s2">they don&#39;t have you confront mystery</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.080" end="00:06:54.940" style="s2">they give you just a difficult problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.639" end="00:06:57.259" style="s2">to solve and in that sense they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.940" end="00:06:59.660" style="s2">instances of a kind of important modal</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.259" end="00:07:02.780" style="s2">confusion that is pervasive in our</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.660" end="00:07:05.270" style="s2">culture the same thing with many horror</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.780" end="00:07:08.509" style="s2">movies you know many horror movies do</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.270" end="00:07:12.130" style="s2">not actually expose you to horror many</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.509" end="00:07:16.550" style="s2">horror movies actually expose you to</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.130" end="00:07:20.060" style="s2">being deeply startled with fear okay so</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.550" end="00:07:21.979" style="s2">deeply startled with fear so so much</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.060" end="00:07:26.080" style="s2">much of what passes for horror movies</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.979" end="00:07:30.320" style="s2">are movies that prey on our sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.080" end="00:07:34.039" style="s2">ancestral fear of predation so that</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.320" end="00:07:35.720" style="s2">where there&#39;s some monster that although</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.039" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">the monster points towards something and</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.720" end="00:07:41.870" style="s2">I&#39;ll come back to that and this is work</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:44.810" style="s2">of course made by good work done by</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.870" end="00:07:46.460" style="s2">Jonathan pazzo on how we should think</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.810" end="00:07:51.229" style="s2">about Washington monsters we&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.460" end="00:07:53.539" style="s2">back to that and the monster is</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.229" end="00:07:56.659" style="s2">basically hidden in some way or unknown</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.539" end="00:07:59.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s preying upon people and most of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.659" end="00:08:01.729" style="s2">the what&#39;s called horror is how that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.840" end="00:08:04.639" style="s2">surprising way in which the monster will</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.729" end="00:08:06.080" style="s2">suddenly appear and prey upon its its</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.639" end="00:08:09.979" style="s2">victims and then they get ripped apart</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.080" end="00:08:11.719" style="s2">so you were startled oh no oh right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.979" end="00:08:14.630" style="s2">and then and that and most of that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.719" end="00:08:17.020" style="s2">not horror I mean I imagine it has I</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.630" end="00:08:20.840" style="s2">find those movies boring actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.020" end="00:08:22.340" style="s2">the inder stand why some people it that</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.840" end="00:08:24.469" style="s2">this is just a statement of taste I</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.340" end="00:08:26.210" style="s2">don&#39;t find them very interesting the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.469" end="00:08:29.330" style="s2">sort of startled and puncture movies</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.210" end="00:08:30.979" style="s2">don&#39;t don&#39;t appeal to me they&#39;re often</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.330" end="00:08:33.229" style="s2">in mashed also with sort of crypto</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.979" end="00:08:36.289" style="s2">messages about sexuality and things like</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.229" end="00:08:39.289" style="s2">that that need to be challenged putting</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.289" end="00:08:41.930" style="s2">all of that aside alright so when I say</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.289" end="00:08:44.420" style="s2">horror you have to there&#39;s a few movies</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.930" end="00:08:45.709" style="s2">that capture it because horror has to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.420" end="00:08:50.779" style="s2">with what we talked about with respect</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.709" end="00:08:55.700" style="s2">to gears horror is when your sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.779" end="00:08:59.360" style="s2">contact with reality is being challenged</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.700" end="00:09:02.150" style="s2">undermined where you feel you have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.360" end="00:09:05.290" style="s2">grasp on things and then it&#39;s slipping</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.150" end="00:09:08.960" style="s2">so horror therefore is often</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.290" end="00:09:10.940" style="s2">prototypically not associated with fear</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.960" end="00:09:13.100" style="s2">or directly with fear its associated</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.940" end="00:09:15.700" style="s2">with insanity or madness and of course</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.100" end="00:09:21.800" style="s2">there is the primordial fear of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.700" end="00:09:24.470" style="s2">insane right now the monster points to</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.800" end="00:09:27.400" style="s2">something very very interesting and this</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.470" end="00:09:33.590" style="s2">goes back to the work of Mary Douglas</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.400" end="00:09:37.810" style="s2">right that we often find creatures that</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.590" end="00:09:41.110" style="s2">are inter categorical for us monstrous</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.810" end="00:09:43.730" style="s2">because that&#39;s on a continuum with</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.110" end="00:09:45.380" style="s2">another important feature of things</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.730" end="00:09:47.780" style="s2">being into categorical so what is meant</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.380" end="00:09:50.270" style="s2">by inter categorical inter categorical</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.780" end="00:09:53.060" style="s2">are things that don&#39;t fall into our</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.270" end="00:09:57.110" style="s2">ready-made categories and therefore we</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.060" end="00:09:59.510" style="s2">typically regard them as weird she talks</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.110" end="00:10:02.810" style="s2">about how they&#39;re unclean she does an</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.510" end="00:10:04.340" style="s2">interesting discussion about and in in</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.810" end="00:10:05.540" style="s2">the Bible the Book of Leviticus all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.340" end="00:10:07.400" style="s2">animals that are unclean they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.540" end="00:10:08.900" style="s2">weird it&#39;s a very weird collection have</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.400" end="00:10:11.660" style="s2">you tried to find some sort of essence</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.900" end="00:10:13.970" style="s2">like well Wyles are unclean and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.660" end="00:10:16.250" style="s2">crocodiles are unclean and whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.970" end="00:10:19.550" style="s2">certain birds are unclean and certain it</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.250" end="00:10:22.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make any sense and then she goes</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.550" end="00:10:23.990" style="s2">in and argues well no what happens is is</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.010" end="00:10:26.030" style="s2">there&#39;s various ways which categorizing</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.990" end="00:10:28.610" style="s2">the there&#39;s ways in which people have</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.030" end="00:10:32.210" style="s2">categorized things and those categories</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.610" end="00:10:34.180" style="s2">right have a certain pattern and when</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.210" end="00:10:38.930" style="s2">that when that pattern is being broken</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.180" end="00:10:42.770" style="s2">then these things these things challenge</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.930" end="00:10:46.250" style="s2">our grip on the world they challenge our</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.770" end="00:10:49.540" style="s2">grip on the world so let&#39;s for example</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.250" end="00:10:53.060" style="s2">like there&#39;s there&#39;s an idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.540" end="00:10:56.660" style="s2">Douglas argues that you should have an</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.060" end="00:11:00.950" style="s2">interconnection between a creatures sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.660" end="00:11:04.910" style="s2">of shape its morphology its means of</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.950" end="00:11:09.950" style="s2">locomotion and its location like where</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.910" end="00:11:13.190" style="s2">it lives so if it lives in the sea</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.950" end="00:11:15.590" style="s2">should swim and therefore it should have</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.190" end="00:11:16.880" style="s2">a fish shape so you have things that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.590" end="00:11:19.130" style="s2">in the sea that don&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.880" end="00:11:21.410" style="s2">swimming like the Crawleys shellfish and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.130" end="00:11:23.990" style="s2">therefore they&#39;re kind of weird and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.410" end="00:11:27.650" style="s2">turn out to be unclean and right and</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.990" end="00:11:29.810" style="s2">then you also have this same she argues</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.650" end="00:11:32.390" style="s2">this same schema is applied now we we</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.810" end="00:11:35.030" style="s2">think all those archaic ancient people</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.390" end="00:11:38.000" style="s2">know but remember don&#39;t don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.030" end="00:11:41.500" style="s2">because we talked about how we also have</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.000" end="00:11:45.800" style="s2">purity codes we find things unclean that</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.500" end="00:11:49.310" style="s2">wort our system of categorization so</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.800" end="00:11:51.530" style="s2">right remember if I take this and spit</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.310" end="00:11:53.450" style="s2">into it repeatedly and then swirl it</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.530" end="00:11:56.150" style="s2">around and drink it back you&#39;re grossed</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.450" end="00:11:58.130" style="s2">out that&#39;s unclean to you because I have</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.150" end="00:11:59.530" style="s2">this whole structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.130" end="00:12:02.480" style="s2">organization of a way of categorizing</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.530" end="00:12:04.400" style="s2">myself and my selfs relationship to my</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:06.080" style="s2">body and how that&#39;s other than the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.400" end="00:12:07.880" style="s2">environment and then there&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.080" end="00:12:10.280" style="s2">boundaries that shouldn&#39;t be shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.880" end="00:12:12.590" style="s2">be crossed and when the spit comes out</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.280" end="00:12:15.590" style="s2">of me it becomes inter categorical it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.590" end="00:12:17.810" style="s2">it&#39;s me but it&#39;s not me because it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.810" end="00:12:20.960" style="s2">somehow it was produced and on its</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.400" end="00:12:26.330" style="s2">intricate Agoura call it&#39;s yucky and get</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.960" end="00:12:30.350" style="s2">rid of it right so this is not a feature</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.330" end="00:12:33.170" style="s2">of ancient thought this is a way in</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.350" end="00:12:37.220" style="s2">which we respond to things that violate</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.170" end="00:12:40.340" style="s2">our core categorical ways of making</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.220" end="00:12:42.620" style="s2">sense of the world now some of those</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.340" end="00:12:47.150" style="s2">things we just regard as yucky or gross</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.620" end="00:12:50.060" style="s2">or unclean but if the the inter</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.150" end="00:12:53.660" style="s2">categorical thing is inter categorical</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.060" end="00:12:56.780" style="s2">between really really central categories</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.660" end="00:13:00.380" style="s2">and it is represented as threatening to</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.780" end="00:13:05.120" style="s2">us then it can it is what it originally</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.380" end="00:13:07.040" style="s2">invoked horror for us so if you take a</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.120" end="00:13:10.100" style="s2">look at many horror creatures there</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.040" end="00:13:12.590" style="s2">prototypically into categorical right</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.100" end="00:13:15.950" style="s2">the Wolfman is inter categorical between</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.590" end="00:13:17.810" style="s2">the beastial and the personal right</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.950" end="00:13:19.460" style="s2">the ghost is inter categorical between</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.810" end="00:13:21.200" style="s2">the living and the dead the vampire is</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.460" end="00:13:21.670" style="s2">also in two categorical between the</p>

<p begin="00:13:21.670" end="00:13:27.340" style="s2">and also between right being a being</p>

<p begin="00:14:04.240" end="00:14:09.520" style="s2">get that into detail so the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.820" end="00:14:11.860" style="s2">the monster is inter categorical points</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.520" end="00:14:12.970" style="s2">right and that and that and that inter</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.860" end="00:14:14.470" style="s2">categorical and this can be on a</p>

<p begin="00:14:47.380" end="00:14:52.480" style="s2">can create pretty significant horror</p>

<p begin="00:15:01.960" end="00:15:06.490" style="s2">an experience of horror that had nothing</p>

<p begin="00:15:38.999" end="00:15:42.689" style="s2">movies been around for a long time so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.379" end="00:15:44.519" style="s2">I think it&#39;s fair game I was watching</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.689" end="00:15:47.399" style="s2">this movies I was watching this movie</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.519" end="00:15:49.259" style="s2">and I&#39;m you know I&#39;m watching this</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.399" end="00:15:51.959" style="s2">character and he seems to be going mad</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.259" end="00:15:53.579" style="s2">the Jack Nicholson character and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.959" end="00:15:55.589" style="s2">that inner of itself is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.579" end="00:15:58.589" style="s2">and of course evocative of all of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.589" end="00:16:01.649" style="s2">and then I&#39;m getting all right Stephen</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.589" end="00:16:05.970" style="s2">King right all right has some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.649" end="00:16:08.970" style="s2">deep criticisms of alcoholism and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.970" end="00:16:10.980" style="s2">this is a very extended metaphor for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.970" end="00:16:14.939" style="s2">descent through alcoholism into madness</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.980" end="00:16:17.399" style="s2">and and and then I sort of I was patting</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.939" end="00:16:19.170" style="s2">myself on my back I get this movie this</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.399" end="00:16:21.509" style="s2">movies all it&#39;s just a symbolic way of</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.170" end="00:16:23.339" style="s2">talking about alcoholism and everything</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.509" end="00:16:25.800" style="s2">and he&#39;s hearing voices in his head or</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.339" end="00:16:28.319" style="s2">that&#39;s clear sense of madness and I had</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.800" end="00:16:31.470" style="s2">it all well structured well in hand as</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.319" end="00:16:34.050" style="s2">we say and then there&#39;s a scene where he</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.470" end="00:16:36.300" style="s2">gets his wife actually traps Jack</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.050" end="00:16:38.970" style="s2">Nicholson inside some sort of pantry and</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.300" end="00:16:40.709" style="s2">locks it from the outside and then I</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.970" end="00:16:42.389" style="s2">remember sort of coming to sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.709" end="00:16:44.879" style="s2">full stop and what&#39;s gonna happen now</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.389" end="00:16:47.160" style="s2">she&#39;s trapped him he&#39;s locked in that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.879" end="00:16:49.199" style="s2">it and the voices are talking to him in</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.160" end="00:16:50.430" style="s2">his head and I&#39;m sort of dismissing that</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.199" end="00:16:52.500" style="s2">because yeah yeah he&#39;s mad he&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.430" end="00:16:53.970" style="s2">talk to the voices but so what and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.500" end="00:16:56.189" style="s2">voices are sort of in his head are sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.970" end="00:16:57.509" style="s2">of chiding him and you know what do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.189" end="00:16:59.759" style="s2">do how did you let it get to this and</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.509" end="00:17:01.800" style="s2">I&#39;m glad and you&#39;re gonna spiral into</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.759" end="00:17:04.289" style="s2">insanity great great and everything and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.800" end="00:17:05.939" style="s2">then the voices say okay it&#39;s time to go</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.289" end="00:17:08.130" style="s2">and then the voices say now we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.939" end="00:17:13.079" style="s2">let you out and then they opened the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.130" end="00:17:15.299" style="s2">door from the outside the voices in his</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.079" end="00:17:18.539" style="s2">head and a chill go went down my spine</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.299" end="00:17:20.459" style="s2">because I realized oh I&#39;m in a much</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.539" end="00:17:24.329" style="s2">different world than I thought I was in</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.459" end="00:17:27.179" style="s2">I thought I had this completely down and</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.329" end="00:17:29.909" style="s2">no no these voices have an independent</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.179" end="00:17:30.419" style="s2">reality and there&#39;s something else going</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.909" end="00:17:32.940" style="s2">on here</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.419" end="00:17:34.260" style="s2">now nothing nothing startling was</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.940" end="00:17:38.280" style="s2">happening all they were doing was</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.260" end="00:17:40.590" style="s2">opening the door so he could get out but</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.280" end="00:17:42.090" style="s2">it was an absolute shell of horror going</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.590" end="00:17:43.770" style="s2">through me because</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.090" end="00:17:45.570" style="s2">and that&#39;s the most profound experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.770" end="00:17:48.690" style="s2">of horror I&#39;ve ever had in a movie</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.570" end="00:17:52.560" style="s2">precisely because what had happened</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.690" end="00:17:55.350" style="s2">there was I went from being out here</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.560" end="00:17:57.620" style="s2">looking at all of this - I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.350" end="00:18:01.980" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and I was suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.620" end="00:18:03.540" style="s2">participating in his madness because I</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.980" end="00:18:04.950" style="s2">didn&#39;t know what was going on and I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.540" end="00:18:06.900" style="s2">losing a grip on this situation and</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.950" end="00:18:09.950" style="s2">there was forces at work here that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.900" end="00:18:12.080" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.950" end="00:18:18.450" style="s2">that&#39;s horror</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.080" end="00:18:19.770" style="s2">okay that&#39;s horror and I met I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.450" end="00:18:23.850" style="s2">think there&#39;s situations that bring</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.770" end="00:18:26.930" style="s2">people into genuine horror but I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.850" end="00:18:28.160" style="s2">it&#39;s much rarer than we realize all</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.930" end="00:18:31.320" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.160" end="00:18:34.050" style="s2">so given that and like I said we will</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.320" end="00:18:36.510" style="s2">return to talk about this later given</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.050" end="00:18:38.730" style="s2">the sense of horror as being you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.510" end="00:18:42.090" style="s2">the polar extreme of this continuum of</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.730" end="00:18:44.790" style="s2">the the weirdness the eeriness the</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.090" end="00:18:47.480" style="s2">yuckiness of the inter categorical that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.790" end="00:18:52.230" style="s2">the spaces in our grip on reality</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.480" end="00:18:54.930" style="s2">through which things can slip right we</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.230" end="00:18:58.020" style="s2">can return to this so the numinous is</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.930" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">super salient if there&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.020" end="00:19:04.560" style="s2">something like a flow state in that</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:09.360" style="s2">we&#39;re being drawn into it but it also</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.560" end="00:19:13.200" style="s2">has with it aspects of horror it shakes</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.360" end="00:19:15.810" style="s2">at the structure of our worldview now</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.200" end="00:19:16.050" style="s2">you say whoa like what&#39;s an example of</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.810" end="00:19:18.870" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.050" end="00:19:20.100" style="s2">okay so here&#39;s an example of or I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.870" end="00:19:22.920" style="s2">where people brush up against the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.100" end="00:19:24.720" style="s2">numinous and it&#39;s fairly widespread so</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.920" end="00:19:31.410" style="s2">many of you will have encountered it</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.720" end="00:19:33.360" style="s2">it&#39;s one that I find I guess annoying</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.410" end="00:19:36.030" style="s2">because I find it dangerous so this</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.360" end="00:19:39.300" style="s2">happens you&#39;re driving home and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.030" end="00:19:41.100" style="s2">been an accident on the highway and</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.300" end="00:19:42.570" style="s2">people are slowing down it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.100" end="00:19:43.700" style="s2">dangerous to slow down everybody knows</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.570" end="00:19:45.810" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t slow down like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.700" end="00:19:47.580" style="s2">because it&#39;s dangerous to slow down</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.810" end="00:19:49.020" style="s2">because the chances are you going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.580" end="00:19:50.880" style="s2">cause another accidents what does in</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.020" end="00:19:55.090" style="s2">fact frequently happen but nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.880" end="00:20:01.680" style="s2">people feel compelled to slow down they</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.090" end="00:20:07.120" style="s2">are fascinated by this because they hope</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.680" end="00:20:08.950" style="s2">to see something horrifying I&#39;m not just</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.120" end="00:20:14.520" style="s2">disgusting they&#39;re hoping that they will</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.950" end="00:20:19.660" style="s2">see death that they&#39;ll though somehow</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.520" end="00:20:20.980" style="s2">get a confrontation with this and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.660" end="00:20:23.290" style="s2">of course is horrifying</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.980" end="00:20:25.150" style="s2">because death has the capacity to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.290" end="00:20:26.770" style="s2">confrontation with the threat of death</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.150" end="00:20:29.680" style="s2">the presence of death has the</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.770" end="00:20:34.050" style="s2">possibility to completely sever your</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.680" end="00:20:38.650" style="s2">grip on reality literally in fact right</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.050" end="00:20:40.510" style="s2">but they can&#39;t look away but if they see</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.650" end="00:20:44.170" style="s2">something they they have the potential</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.510" end="00:20:45.700" style="s2">of being very unpleasantly horrified but</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.170" end="00:20:47.860" style="s2">of course there&#39;s something also missing</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.700" end="00:20:54.790" style="s2">this because they can&#39;t actually see</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.860" end="00:20:58.660" style="s2">death right they can see the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.790" end="00:21:02.410" style="s2">death in the sense of the result of some</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.660" end="00:21:04.210" style="s2">thing or someone dying but that won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.410" end="00:21:05.980" style="s2">actually put them into something we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.210" end="00:21:09.580" style="s2">already discussed that won&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.980" end="00:21:12.610" style="s2">get them give them what they want a grip</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.580" end="00:21:15.430" style="s2">on the mystery of death the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.610" end="00:21:18.160" style="s2">phenomenological mystery of death and</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.430" end="00:21:21.430" style="s2">that tells you something right Wonder</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.160" end="00:21:25.570" style="s2">and awe have us open up to mystery but</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.430" end="00:21:29.700" style="s2">if the mystery becomes overwhelming if</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.570" end="00:21:32.770" style="s2">it causes us to lose any potential sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.700" end="00:21:37.150" style="s2">sorry or yes any sense of our potential</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.770" end="00:21:40.000" style="s2">ability to get right an insight or an</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.150" end="00:21:45.280" style="s2">understanding that typically comes with</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:48.790" style="s2">wonder right ah sort of liminal but with</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.280" end="00:21:51.430" style="s2">horror it&#39;s like I&#39;m ooh it&#39;s um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.790" end="00:21:54.130" style="s2">expanding so fast and oh I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.430" end="00:21:55.900" style="s2">overwhelmed so fast I&#39;m being forced to</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.130" end="00:21:58.600" style="s2">accommodate so fastest it&#39;s like the all</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.900" end="00:22:01.470" style="s2">absolute worst culture shock and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.600" end="00:22:01.470" style="s2">experiencing horror</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.220" end="00:22:15.810" style="s2">so we can think of horror is when notice</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.860" end="00:22:21.810" style="s2">what you&#39;ve got here you&#39;ve got all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.810" end="00:22:23.520" style="s2">indications of flow right or something</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.810" end="00:22:25.320" style="s2">like flow at least the beginning of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.520" end="00:22:28.050" style="s2">right were you you&#39;re getting drawn in</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.320" end="00:22:32.340" style="s2">in this accelerating loop something like</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.050" end="00:22:36.420" style="s2">it at least right it&#39;s super salient to</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.340" end="00:22:37.650" style="s2">you but it&#39;s it&#39;s super salient and this</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.420" end="00:22:39.390" style="s2">is why I&#39;m hesitating to just call it</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.650" end="00:22:41.190" style="s2">straight-out flow it&#39;s super salient but</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.390" end="00:22:42.990" style="s2">not in the fact that you&#39;re deeply</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.190" end="00:22:45.660" style="s2">coupled it&#39;s super salient in the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.990" end="00:22:47.910" style="s2">that you&#39;re seeking to be deeply coupled</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.660" end="00:22:49.680" style="s2">and you&#39;re you know the machinery is</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.910" end="00:22:54.330" style="s2">going faster and faster but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.680" end="00:22:56.370" style="s2">actually getting a purchase because</p>

<p begin="00:22:56.370" end="00:23:05.130" style="s2">horrified by a mystery now it&#39;s like wow</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.310" end="00:23:07.670" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s an experience of the</p>

<p begin="00:23:09.910" end="00:23:15.910" style="s2">and if you read parts of the Bible or</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.930" end="00:23:17.920" style="s2">you could meet other literature - but</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.910" end="00:23:20.890" style="s2">the Bible of course is prototypical for</p>

<p begin="00:23:20.890" end="00:23:27.100" style="s2">like Otto like there&#39;s passages in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.770" end="00:23:31.440" style="s2">Old Testament in which God is like this</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.100" end="00:23:37.330" style="s2">right just weird and strange and</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.440" end="00:23:39.400" style="s2">horrifying aspects of God fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.330" end="00:23:42.280" style="s2">super salient and you&#39;re drawn in and</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.400" end="00:23:43.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like like I said I want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.280" end="00:23:44.710" style="s2">auntie Flo because auntie Flo is</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.360" end="00:23:46.450" style="s2">depression but it&#39;s like that it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:23:49.120" end="00:23:54.790" style="s2">all the machinery of coupling is</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.470" end="00:24:02.070" style="s2">speeding up to try and get what it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.790" end="00:24:07.150" style="s2">get which is a stable relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.070" end="00:24:09.880" style="s2">so wonder that you don&#39;t get wonder you</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.150" end="00:24:18.300" style="s2">might not even get aw if it&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.880" end="00:24:18.300" style="s2">it can pass into horror so</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.720" end="00:24:25.820" style="s2">it&#39;s plausible that this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.750" end="00:24:27.559" style="s2">ways of interpreting certain even</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.820" end="00:24:29.179" style="s2">commands in the Bible like that you know</p>

<p begin="00:24:32.029" end="00:24:39.470" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make any any any sense for a lot</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.200" end="00:24:41.389" style="s2">of reasons because God is prototypically</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.470" end="00:24:44.090" style="s2">not the object that you can run away</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.389" end="00:24:46.220" style="s2">from or fight or like what your field</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.090" end="00:24:48.649" style="s2">would be absurd it doesn&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.220" end="00:24:51.909" style="s2">sense but I think a better account of</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.649" end="00:24:55.789" style="s2">this is right you&#39;re supposed to have aw</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.909" end="00:24:57.679" style="s2">for God and notice how this is the basis</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.789" end="00:25:00.950" style="s2">of this word awesome but it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.679" end="00:25:06.669" style="s2">basis of this word awful right because</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.950" end="00:25:09.529" style="s2">it borders our borders on horror so</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.669" end="00:25:12.019" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.529" end="00:25:14.840" style="s2">sacredness that is supposed to take us</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.019" end="00:25:17.840" style="s2">to the very horizon of our</p>

<p begin="00:25:17.840" end="00:25:23.720" style="s2">of our ability to make sense and make</p>

<p begin="00:25:23.720" end="00:25:27.950" style="s2">take us I would say right it&#39;s supposed</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.149" end="00:25:30.470" style="s2">to draw us in and the hope is not to</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.950" end="00:25:33.350" style="s2">just throw us into horror but to take us</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.470" end="00:25:36.679" style="s2">towards horror until we experience right</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.350" end="00:25:39.889" style="s2">that sort of boundary between AA and</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.679" end="00:25:43.820" style="s2">horror where we are forced into a</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.889" end="00:25:48.919" style="s2">situation of confrontation with a demand</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.820" end="00:25:52.940" style="s2">to change the demand to change who and</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.919" end="00:25:54.740" style="s2">what we are and in that sense this will</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.940" end="00:25:57.200" style="s2">overlap with the higher states of</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.740" end="00:26:00.259" style="s2">consciousness in that this carries with</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.200" end="00:26:02.750" style="s2">it a sense of being terrifically real</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.259" end="00:26:06.950" style="s2">and I mean that terrifically real and</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.750" end="00:26:10.549" style="s2">that right it is putting a demand on us</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.950" end="00:26:14.360" style="s2">to accommodate to expand our capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.549" end="00:26:20.450" style="s2">framing for framing that it is pushing</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.360" end="00:26:24.620" style="s2">us to our very very very limits and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.450" end="00:26:27.230" style="s2">aspect of horror is the sense stronger</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.620" end="00:26:31.400" style="s2">words needed here the realization that</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.230" end="00:26:34.820" style="s2">we are need finally ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.400" end="00:26:37.570" style="s2">limited that no matter how much we grow</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.820" end="00:26:41.480" style="s2">we can&#39;t grow enough to encompass the</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.570" end="00:26:43.910" style="s2">mysteries that we are confronting so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.480" end="00:26:46.970" style="s2">point of the horror I think is to get us</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.910" end="00:26:49.040" style="s2">not only to grow but to remember that</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.970" end="00:26:53.570" style="s2">our growth will always be the growth of</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.040" end="00:26:56.570" style="s2">a mortal limited being a being there is</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.570" end="00:27:02.900" style="s2">always caught up in relevance</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.570" end="00:27:04.880" style="s2">realization so notice how I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.900" end="00:27:07.030" style="s2">pushing how much this is taking you to</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.880" end="00:27:09.620" style="s2">sort of that deepest powerful</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.030" end="00:27:10.400" style="s2">accommodation the deepest opening up</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.620" end="00:27:13.340" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.400" end="00:27:17.960" style="s2">forcing tremendous change on you varying</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.340" end="00:27:20.990" style="s2">who you are this is also an aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.960" end="00:27:23.660" style="s2">the sacred now think about how you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.990" end="00:27:26.390" style="s2">relate this on the continuum that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.660" end="00:27:28.280" style="s2">been talking about this is the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.390" end="00:27:31.070" style="s2">frame breaking but this isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.280" end="00:27:33.680" style="s2">breaking any frame this is you know this</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.070" end="00:27:35.630" style="s2">is trans frame breaking this is breaking</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.680" end="00:27:38.060" style="s2">your capacity for framing or at least</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.630" end="00:27:40.520" style="s2">taking it to the very as I said the very</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.060" end="00:27:42.590" style="s2">limits where you are forced into a</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.520" end="00:27:44.710" style="s2">trajectory of trans framing that is also</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.590" end="00:27:47.780" style="s2">acknowledging that you are ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.710" end="00:27:51.220" style="s2">insufficient it&#39;s supposed to in this</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.780" end="00:27:55.160" style="s2">and I&#39;m using this in a technical sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.220" end="00:27:58.280" style="s2">it is supposed to humiliate you the</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.160" end="00:28:01.370" style="s2">problem for us humiliate is that we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.280" end="00:28:05.990" style="s2">only hear this negatively but of course</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.370" end="00:28:09.740" style="s2">humility a deep deep appreciation of</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.990" end="00:28:13.490" style="s2">one&#39;s inescapable limitations is part of</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.740" end="00:28:16.600" style="s2">I&#39;ve argued the function of horror it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.490" end="00:28:19.490" style="s2">to bring you to that state of</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.600" end="00:28:21.890" style="s2">accommodation while maximal</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.490" end="00:28:26.840" style="s2">accommodation while also deeply</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.890" end="00:28:31.580" style="s2">reminding you sati that you can never</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.840" end="00:28:34.940" style="s2">become right anything beyond a finite</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.580" end="00:28:39.590" style="s2">being it&#39;s to prevent inflation it is to</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.940" end="00:28:43.730" style="s2">vent you ever assuming that you are more</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.590" end="00:28:47.000" style="s2">than you can ultimately be so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.730" end="00:28:49.190" style="s2">deep kind of reminding that&#39;s put at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.000" end="00:28:51.080" style="s2">heart of this power look if I if I could</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.190" end="00:28:52.460" style="s2">just sort of accommodate and wondering</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.080" end="00:29:03.980" style="s2">ah there&#39;s a temptation that I would</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.460" end="00:29:08.120" style="s2">have inflate and think I am right now</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.980" end="00:29:13.810" style="s2">this puts you the numinous and</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.120" end="00:29:16.940" style="s2">right therefore puts you into contact</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.810" end="00:29:22.490" style="s2">confrontation with something that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.940" end="00:29:24.440" style="s2">much greater than yourself and also that</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.490" end="00:29:26.390" style="s2">has an existence by definition</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.440" end="00:29:32.270" style="s2">independent of you precisely because of</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.390" end="00:29:34.040" style="s2">the way you can threaten you so notice</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.270" end="00:29:37.550" style="s2">what we&#39;ve got here we&#39;ve got over here</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.040" end="00:29:39.610" style="s2">we&#39;ve got right worldview we&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.550" end="00:29:43.520" style="s2">sacred doing these two things sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.610" end="00:29:45.440" style="s2">sorry I keep slipping on that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.520" end="00:29:46.790" style="s2">the way language drives you eh I fear</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.440" end="00:29:47.780" style="s2">we&#39;re not getting rid of God because we</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.790" end="00:29:54.410" style="s2">still believe in grammar</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.780" end="00:30:02.450" style="s2">okay so sacredness over here we have</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.410" end="00:30:05.810" style="s2">worldview attunement and it&#39;s very clear</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.450" end="00:30:11.000" style="s2">right why that would be regarded as</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.810" end="00:30:13.160" style="s2">sacred this homes us against horror but</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.000" end="00:30:16.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve of this other notion of sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.160" end="00:30:18.410" style="s2">which is the numinous which is designed</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.400" end="00:30:25.640" style="s2">to do the opposite it&#39;s designed to</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.410" end="00:30:27.880" style="s2">expose us fascinate us horror with</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.640" end="00:30:27.880" style="s2">horror</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.680" end="00:30:37.460" style="s2">so over here we had right</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.140" end="00:30:40.250" style="s2">basically what I&#39;m gonna argue is meta</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.460" end="00:30:42.680" style="s2">assimilation we have that meta mean a</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.250" end="00:30:45.470" style="s2">that is designed to get everything to</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.680" end="00:30:48.830" style="s2">fit together to belong together the</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.470" end="00:30:53.030" style="s2">agent in the arena fit together but then</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.830" end="00:30:55.400" style="s2">you have the opponent process the</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.030" end="00:30:57.050" style="s2">opponent process and this is as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.400" end="00:31:07.190" style="s2">already argued this is meta</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.050" end="00:31:09.500" style="s2">accommodation sacredness is doing a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.190" end="00:31:12.140" style="s2">powerful at not at the level of your</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.500" end="00:31:14.390" style="s2">even of your individual projects or</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.140" end="00:31:17.840" style="s2">problems this is doing it at the level</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.390" end="00:31:21.920" style="s2">of your existential being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.840" end="00:31:25.160" style="s2">it is doing higher order relevance</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.920" end="00:31:28.160" style="s2">realization it is pushing the machinery</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.160" end="00:31:29.900" style="s2">of relevance realization again down</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.160" end="00:31:32.840" style="s2">through all of the levels of your</p>

<p begin="00:31:32.840" end="00:31:38.180" style="s2">the depths the primordial depths of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.710" end="00:31:42.100" style="s2">agent arena relationship and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.180" end="00:31:45.040" style="s2">blowing it apart setting it in motion</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.100" end="00:31:49.520" style="s2">with opponent processing that&#39;s doing</p>

<p begin="00:35:43.600" end="00:35:50.680" style="s2">seriously playing with the higher order</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.880" end="00:35:59.620" style="s2">relevance realization machinery of</p>

<p begin="00:36:02.670" end="00:36:09.820" style="s2">now invoking how we can use something</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.350" end="00:36:11.740" style="s2">that&#39;s and we got up we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.820" end="00:36:17.110" style="s2">work on this something that&#39;s symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.740" end="00:36:20.410" style="s2">like music in order to like play in</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.110" end="00:36:23.500" style="s2">order to activate accentuate and play</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.410" end="00:36:25.510" style="s2">with this machinery and a powerfully</p>

<p begin="00:36:25.510" end="00:36:31.630" style="s2">right religions which are right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.140" end="00:36:35.830" style="s2">which have these aspects to them also</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.630" end="00:36:37.930" style="s2">are rich with the symbolic machinery</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.830" end="00:36:40.420" style="s2">that it&#39;s designed to activate and</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.930" end="00:36:42.820" style="s2">seriously play with this so what I want</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.420" end="00:36:48.070" style="s2">to talk about the relationship or the</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.820" end="00:36:51.210" style="s2">role that symbols have in in our</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.070" end="00:36:51.210" style="s2">experience of sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.750" end="00:37:06.090" style="s2">so the important thing is how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.320" end="00:37:07.860" style="s2">going to use this word and symbol then</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.090" end="00:37:15.440" style="s2">meet originally means to put two things</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.860" end="00:37:19.260" style="s2">together and I want to I want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.440" end="00:37:21.090" style="s2">distinguish this the the talk that I did</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.260" end="00:37:23.310" style="s2">with Chris that you&#39;ll see one of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.090" end="00:37:24.870" style="s2">talks also distinguishes between a</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.310" end="00:37:29.220" style="s2">symbol and a sign so I&#39;m not going into</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.870" end="00:37:31.470" style="s2">great detail here this is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.220" end="00:37:33.360" style="s2">central in stomach semiotic because we</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.470" end="00:37:36.420" style="s2">use this term in multiple ways like we</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.360" end="00:37:38.630" style="s2">talk about abstract symbolic thought but</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.420" end="00:37:41.820" style="s2">when we talk about you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.630" end="00:37:43.920" style="s2">cross as a as an important religious</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.820" end="00:37:52.410" style="s2">symbol and we can get very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.920" end="00:37:55.440" style="s2">confused and so a sign refers right so</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.410" end="00:37:57.510" style="s2">it it by looking at it we can look</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.440" end="00:38:03.210" style="s2">through it to look at something else so</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.510" end="00:38:05.490" style="s2">I can use this as a as a sign for love</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.210" end="00:38:07.380" style="s2">because when you see this it helps you</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.490" end="00:38:12.390" style="s2">to think of love but this doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.380" end="00:38:15.660" style="s2">actually exemplify symbols refer right</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.390" end="00:38:18.720" style="s2">but more importantly they exemplify in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.660" end="00:38:21.270" style="s2">particular way they exemplify by getting</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.720" end="00:38:24.150" style="s2">you to participate in that to which they</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.270" end="00:38:26.130" style="s2">refer they&#39;re going to invoke of course</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.150" end="00:38:28.260" style="s2">participatory knowing because they have</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.130" end="00:38:30.710" style="s2">to do ultimately with getting down to</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.260" end="00:38:35.520" style="s2">the machinery of the agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.710" end="00:38:39.210" style="s2">participatory relationship so compare</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.520" end="00:38:40.710" style="s2">this as a sign for love and this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.210" end="00:38:43.260" style="s2">something as I said that Chris and I did</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.710" end="00:38:45.060" style="s2">to kissing someone because kissing</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.260" end="00:38:46.740" style="s2">someone doesn&#39;t just make you think of</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.060" end="00:38:49.890" style="s2">love it actually you gets you to</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.740" end="00:38:52.860" style="s2">participate it activates and gets the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.890" end="00:38:57.330" style="s2">map machinery kissing is and I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.860" end="00:38:59.700" style="s2">carefully is a serious play with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.330" end="00:39:03.210" style="s2">machinery of the agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.700" end="00:39:07.020" style="s2">relationship so that we can participate</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.210" end="00:39:09.600" style="s2">in a reciprocal relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.020" end="00:39:11.400" style="s2">another human being where we are right</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.600" end="00:39:12.380" style="s2">where there&#39;s reciprocal realization</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.400" end="00:39:15.680" style="s2">occurring</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.380" end="00:39:20.420" style="s2">between us we can together remember the</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.680" end="00:39:23.510" style="s2">being mode etc so there&#39;s a difference</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.420" end="00:39:27.250" style="s2">there now I want to try and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.510" end="00:39:27.250" style="s2">and unpack this a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.150" end="00:39:34.849" style="s2">symbols do this do this sort of double</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.820" end="00:39:41.480" style="s2">job and they do this by having at their</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.849" end="00:39:43.190" style="s2">core a metaphor and we got it slow down</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.480" end="00:39:45.230" style="s2">here because this is also something that</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.190" end="00:39:48.080" style="s2">needs to be understood understood a</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.230" end="00:39:50.000" style="s2">little bit more carefully and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.080" end="00:39:51.800" style="s2">talked about this before about the word</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.000" end="00:39:54.230" style="s2">metaphors itself a metaphor it means to</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.800" end="00:39:56.359" style="s2">carry over or carry across what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.230" end="00:39:59.030" style="s2">doing in a metaphor is I have two</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.359" end="00:40:02.210" style="s2">different domains and I want to see this</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.030" end="00:40:04.099" style="s2">domain differently so I basically look</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.210" end="00:40:07.040" style="s2">through this was at least the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.099" end="00:40:09.680" style="s2">block I look through this thing to look</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.040" end="00:40:12.050" style="s2">at this so I&#39;m saying that Sam is a pig</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.680" end="00:40:14.480" style="s2">here&#39;s Sam here&#39;s a pig I put on sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.050" end="00:40:17.390" style="s2">pig glasses sorry for that and then I</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.480" end="00:40:19.670" style="s2">look at Sam differently and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.390" end="00:40:21.680" style="s2">the salience typography of Sam is</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.670" end="00:40:23.500" style="s2">altered or Toni talks about this in</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.680" end="00:40:25.700" style="s2">salience imbalance and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.500" end="00:40:28.099" style="s2">reconfiguration of what I find salient</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.700" end="00:40:31.760" style="s2">in Sam allows me to see Sam differently</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.099" end="00:40:34.160" style="s2">I get an insight into Sam and of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:36.800" style="s2">I&#39;m not actually claiming that Sam is a</p>

<p begin="00:40:36.800" end="00:40:42.349" style="s2">saying Sam is like a pig I&#39;m doing this</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.869" end="00:40:44.630" style="s2">act of looking through and seeing this</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.349" end="00:40:50.530" style="s2">and thereby getting an insight into it</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.630" end="00:40:52.960" style="s2">in an important way that&#39;s fine okay now</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.530" end="00:40:58.040" style="s2">we have to understand first of all how</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.960" end="00:41:00.440" style="s2">pervasive and profound metaphor is</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.040" end="00:41:03.770" style="s2">because we have a tendency to think of</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.440" end="00:41:07.160" style="s2">it again as largely ornamental our</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.770" end="00:41:09.619" style="s2">culture is so beset comprehensively by</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.160" end="00:41:11.000" style="s2">patterns of trivialization again and</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.619" end="00:41:15.339" style="s2">again again you hear me say we have</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.000" end="00:41:15.339" style="s2">trivialize this we have trivialized that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.820" end="00:41:22.650" style="s2">okay we&#39;ve talked about this but I want</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.820" end="00:41:25.620" style="s2">to bring it back and develop it a little</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.650" end="00:41:27.480" style="s2">bit how much of our thinking and this</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.620" end="00:41:31.160" style="s2">goes to the work of Lake often Johnson</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.480" end="00:41:33.000" style="s2">but I&#39;ll criticize it in a minute and</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.160" end="00:41:35.900" style="s2">also somebody who I&#39;m going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.000" end="00:41:41.580" style="s2">about later Barfield</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.900" end="00:41:44.730" style="s2">all right that we don&#39;t realize how much</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.580" end="00:41:47.190" style="s2">of our cognition our ways of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.730" end="00:41:53.640" style="s2">and interacting with the world are being</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.190" end="00:41:56.550" style="s2">structured by metaphor so right to use</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.640" end="00:41:58.830" style="s2">an example on halfway through this</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.550" end="00:42:03.390" style="s2">lecture as if I was moving through a</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.830" end="00:42:09.300" style="s2">space but I hope you get my point</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.390" end="00:42:10.920" style="s2">or at least see what I&#39;m saying but you</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.300" end="00:42:12.840" style="s2">might not be able to because what some</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.920" end="00:42:15.900" style="s2">of the stuff I&#39;m saying is really hard</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.840" end="00:42:22.020" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard it&#39;s really hard to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.900" end="00:42:23.760" style="s2">my point but I hope you understand me it</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.020" end="00:42:25.470" style="s2">used to be understand by the way stand</p>

<p begin="00:42:29.850" end="00:42:35.400" style="s2">right even words that you don&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.520" end="00:42:38.550" style="s2">are metaphorical have a metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.400" end="00:42:45.840" style="s2">origin like interest remember this inter</p>

<p begin="00:42:45.840" end="00:42:52.910" style="s2">there we&#39;re often see we&#39;re much more</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.080" end="00:42:52.910" style="s2">naturally poetic than we realize</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.020" end="00:43:06.820" style="s2">we are we are constantly trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.320" end="00:43:12.130" style="s2">this use one thing look through one</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.820" end="00:43:14.200" style="s2">thing at another now I have some</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.130" end="00:43:19.780" style="s2">criticisms of Lake often Johnson because</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.200" end="00:43:26.560" style="s2">they argue that what it is is I have</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.780" end="00:43:31.690" style="s2">some embodied practice and then that</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.560" end="00:43:33.960" style="s2">just gets projected up into abstract</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.690" end="00:43:33.960" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.140" end="00:43:41.300" style="s2">and so one of their prototypical</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.810" end="00:43:44.510" style="s2">examples is I&#39;ll say things like he</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.300" end="00:43:47.330" style="s2">attacked my argument right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.510" end="00:43:49.390" style="s2">supposed to be from the hallmark of you</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.330" end="00:43:51.650" style="s2">know abstract thought that&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.390" end="00:43:53.930" style="s2">argumentation where we&#39;re at our most</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.650" end="00:43:57.770" style="s2">rational but we&#39;re actually using this</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.930" end="00:44:03.020" style="s2">word attacked right which goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.770" end="00:44:06.470" style="s2">you know physical assault and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.020" end="00:44:10.130" style="s2">is we take what we have here and we</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.470" end="00:44:13.600" style="s2">project it onto here well I think this</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.130" end="00:44:16.820" style="s2">notion of projection is too simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.600" end="00:44:19.760" style="s2">okay but this is the basic idea all</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.820" end="00:44:21.740" style="s2">right I know what this is because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.760" end="00:44:23.630" style="s2">embodied physical interaction it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.740" end="00:44:25.820" style="s2">participatory right I know what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.630" end="00:44:28.340" style="s2">attack somebody and then I use that</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.820" end="00:44:30.530" style="s2">right I sort of just project that on to</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.340" end="00:44:33.130" style="s2">the abstract conceptual domain and</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.530" end="00:44:35.660" style="s2">that&#39;s how I get he attacked my argument</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.130" end="00:44:37.310" style="s2">this this reminds me of a point in</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.660" end="00:44:41.060" style="s2">Barfield Barfield says you know you read</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.310" end="00:44:46.270" style="s2">you read in the old text and they&#39;ll use</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.060" end="00:44:46.270" style="s2">words like newman ah NUMA sorry</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.170" end="00:44:53.660" style="s2">right which stands either for wind or</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.750" end="00:44:56.540" style="s2">spirit and we can only hear it one way</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.660" end="00:44:59.840" style="s2">or the other and that&#39;s why we break it</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.540" end="00:45:01.640" style="s2">into two words I sort of get what</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.840" end="00:45:04.490" style="s2">Barfield saying here but the point is we</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.640" end="00:45:06.740" style="s2">have that we use this word right and we</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.490" end="00:45:08.870" style="s2">and we move between these without</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.740" end="00:45:11.210" style="s2">realizing it like we attacked the castle</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.870" end="00:45:14.270" style="s2">he attacked my argument and those aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.210" end="00:45:17.930" style="s2">the same but we may actually not notice</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.270" end="00:45:20.510" style="s2">that we&#39;re using them differently</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.930" end="00:45:23.000" style="s2">now why do I say that well this has work</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.510" end="00:45:25.730" style="s2">that I published a couple of articles</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.000" end="00:45:27.830" style="s2">with John Kennedy where we said this</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.730" end="00:45:31.220" style="s2">simple model of just projecting doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.830" end="00:45:33.560" style="s2">seem quite right because this for</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.220" end="00:45:35.690" style="s2">example carries with it I can say I</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.560" end="00:45:38.980" style="s2">attack the castle or I assaulted the</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.690" end="00:45:38.980" style="s2">castle right</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.960" end="00:45:45.160" style="s2">but if I say I assaulted his argument</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.569" end="00:45:49.780" style="s2">it&#39;s like what what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.160" end="00:45:52.089" style="s2">that&#39;s weird the the the the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.780" end="00:45:54.099" style="s2">near synonym doesn&#39;t transfer and notice</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.089" end="00:45:56.589" style="s2">the reverse abstract thought and say</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.099" end="00:45:59.109" style="s2">instead of saying I attacked his</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.589" end="00:46:01.450" style="s2">argument I can say I criticized his</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.109" end="00:46:03.520" style="s2">argument but if I say ah</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.450" end="00:46:06.400" style="s2">let&#39;s criticize the castle you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.520" end="00:46:08.650" style="s2">what what that sounds like a weird Monty</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.400" end="00:46:11.109" style="s2">Python routine see what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.650" end="00:46:13.119" style="s2">show you is it we didn&#39;t there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.109" end="00:46:15.160" style="s2">simple sort of identity relation we</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.119" end="00:46:18.430" style="s2">didn&#39;t just project this and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.160" end="00:46:21.099" style="s2">that right we&#39;re just sort of trapped</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.430" end="00:46:25.630" style="s2">between two meanings we&#39;ve seen two</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.099" end="00:46:29.740" style="s2">clearly have a sense of this that points</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.630" end="00:46:32.200" style="s2">downward towards the physical assault</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.740" end="00:46:35.500" style="s2">and then points upwards if you&#39;ll allow</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.200" end="00:46:38.520" style="s2">me these metaphors towards the</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.500" end="00:46:41.079" style="s2">conceptual notice also something else</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.520" end="00:46:45.010" style="s2">notice the three things I used earlier I</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.079" end="00:46:49.470" style="s2">use did you see my point do you grasp</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.010" end="00:46:52.530" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying do you understand it</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.470" end="00:46:56.799" style="s2">alright do you get it</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.530" end="00:46:59.650" style="s2">these are very different interactions</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.799" end="00:47:00.130" style="s2">these are very different things they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.650" end="00:47:03.069" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.130" end="00:47:06.609" style="s2">there&#39;s understanding there&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.069" end="00:47:13.770" style="s2">and there&#39;s grasping and yeah all of</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.609" end="00:47:16.510" style="s2">those independently converge towards</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.770" end="00:47:18.940" style="s2">making something intelligible right the</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.510" end="00:47:22.089" style="s2">act of making something until what</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.940" end="00:47:25.930" style="s2">select what selected these four very</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.089" end="00:47:30.400" style="s2">different things and drew them up to</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.930" end="00:47:31.780" style="s2">their common converged meaning see what</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.400" end="00:47:33.790" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to show you is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.780" end="00:47:36.640" style="s2">simply that this gets projected up</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.790" end="00:47:39.880" style="s2">there&#39;s also something up here that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.640" end="00:47:42.730" style="s2">constraining and acting downward helping</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.880" end="00:47:48.520" style="s2">us select which of all of our embodied</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.730" end="00:47:53.280" style="s2">existence we are going to use for our</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.520" end="00:47:53.280" style="s2">more abstract conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.890" end="00:48:01.670" style="s2">topics all right</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.859" end="00:48:04.609" style="s2">so why is that important because I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.670" end="00:48:07.459" style="s2">that points towards a different way of</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.609" end="00:48:10.729" style="s2">understanding what the metaphor is doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.459" end="00:48:12.619" style="s2">so there of course is an element of</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.729" end="00:48:14.779" style="s2">projecting and projecting means to throw</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.619" end="00:48:17.119" style="s2">but I think there&#39;s something much more</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.779" end="00:48:20.449" style="s2">complicated and interesting going on in</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.119" end="00:48:24.999" style="s2">a metaphor that isn&#39;t simply projection</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.449" end="00:48:24.999" style="s2">which is of course itself a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.930" end="00:48:40.900" style="s2">okay so I think that symbols are going</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.839" end="00:48:42.400" style="s2">to tap into these deeper kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.900" end="00:48:44.500" style="s2">metaphors not just the metaphors that</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.400" end="00:48:46.660" style="s2">are the ornamentations of language these</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.500" end="00:48:48.400" style="s2">are the metaphors these more profound</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.660" end="00:48:50.380" style="s2">metaphors that are structuring our</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.400" end="00:48:51.849" style="s2">cognition and they and I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.380" end="00:48:54.309" style="s2">point out to you that they have no not</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.849" end="00:48:56.950" style="s2">only bottom-up emergence they have a</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.309" end="00:49:00.750" style="s2">top-down emanation going on in them</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.950" end="00:49:03.099" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which both sides are</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.750" end="00:49:05.890" style="s2">interacting in a powerful way we mean we</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.099" end="00:49:07.720" style="s2">need a much more dynamic account of</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.890" end="00:49:11.490" style="s2">what&#39;s that work in metaphor so let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:49:22.270" end="00:49:28.630" style="s2">but are structuring the way we are</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.150" end="00:49:32.950" style="s2">making sense making meaning of the world</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.630" end="00:49:34.750" style="s2">now one important point of these kinds</p>

<p begin="00:49:34.750" end="00:49:39.460" style="s2">participation gets into the profundity</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.430" end="00:49:41.859" style="s2">but doing something with it is one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.460" end="00:49:49.470" style="s2">the jobs of these metaphors right is to</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.859" end="00:49:55.359" style="s2">hold in mind okay so let me give you</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.470" end="00:49:59.500" style="s2">right an example of this we care about</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.359" end="00:50:00.520" style="s2">justice we really do it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.500" end="00:50:02.230" style="s2">us our culture of fact is really</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.520" end="00:50:04.510" style="s2">wrestling with what does justice mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.230" end="00:50:09.819" style="s2">and how do we best serve it how do we</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.510" end="00:50:11.440" style="s2">best realize it but that means you need</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.819" end="00:50:13.029" style="s2">to be able to reflect on justice you</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.440" end="00:50:16.690" style="s2">need to me to be able to contemplate it</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.029" end="00:50:19.440" style="s2">to think about it if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.690" end="00:50:21.670" style="s2">think about it and not just emote or</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.440" end="00:50:24.309" style="s2">assert about it if you&#39;re going to think</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.670" end="00:50:26.079" style="s2">about it you need to hold it in mind but</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.309" end="00:50:27.400" style="s2">how do you hold it in mind if I were to</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.079" end="00:50:30.520" style="s2">ask you without repeating the word</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.400" end="00:50:33.730" style="s2">justice hold the justice in mind do it</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.520" end="00:50:35.079" style="s2">hope what are you doing even right you</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.730" end="00:50:37.630" style="s2">might be holding sort of a prototypical</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.079" end="00:50:38.950" style="s2">instance but when I do this and I do</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.630" end="00:50:40.900" style="s2">this repeatedly with my class what</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.950" end="00:50:43.510" style="s2">people tell me is well when they want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.900" end="00:50:45.940" style="s2">sort of contemplate justice - so they</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.510" end="00:50:48.250" style="s2">can reflect on it and get clearer about</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.940" end="00:50:50.710" style="s2">what it means to them they often invoke</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.250" end="00:50:52.810" style="s2">a symbol they invoke the symbol of the</p>

<p begin="00:50:52.810" end="00:50:58.200" style="s2">carrying right the holding the scales so</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.130" end="00:51:04.930" style="s2">one of the things you notice is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.810" end="00:51:06.790" style="s2">this of course is is a profound metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.930" end="00:51:10.510" style="s2">we use the notions of balance all</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.790" end="00:51:13.990" style="s2">throughout our talk about justice we</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.510" end="00:51:18.700" style="s2">also use sword as deciding cutting right</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.990" end="00:51:22.390" style="s2">but let&#39;s stick with the balance this</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.700" end="00:51:26.650" style="s2">allows us to hold justice in mind that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.390" end="00:51:28.210" style="s2">it&#39;s like stop pause if that&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.650" end="00:51:30.010" style="s2">symbol was doing that in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.210" end="00:51:33.610" style="s2">is such a valuable thing we need to</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.010" end="00:51:36.700" style="s2">pause and appreciate if I can&#39;t relate</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.610" end="00:51:38.800" style="s2">to justice in a participatory fashion</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.700" end="00:51:41.470" style="s2">where I can engage in it and I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.800" end="00:51:43.390" style="s2">to internalize it and I&#39;m trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.470" end="00:51:46.030" style="s2">clearer about it I can&#39;t do any of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.390" end="00:51:51.040" style="s2">unless I can activate it and hold it in</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.030" end="00:51:52.510" style="s2">mind and I need a symbol to do that now</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.040" end="00:51:58.090" style="s2">the symbol is metaphorical justice isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.510" end="00:52:01.600" style="s2">literally a scale a balance what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.090" end="00:52:02.800" style="s2">on here and what&#39;s right and how does it</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.600" end="00:52:04.030" style="s2">plug in to where I&#39;m trying to argue</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.800" end="00:52:07.360" style="s2">there&#39;s something more than just</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.030" end="00:52:09.730" style="s2">projection going on and this gets me to</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.360" end="00:52:14.220" style="s2">a notion that I&#39;ve mentioned to you</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.730" end="00:52:14.220" style="s2">before exaptation</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.080" end="00:52:20.370" style="s2">that&#39;s really like really important work</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.660" end="00:52:25.470" style="s2">you gotta read his book by Michael</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.370" end="00:52:27.590" style="s2">Anderson on this this is the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.470" end="00:52:31.620" style="s2">your brain right is in a</p>

<p begin="00:52:36.120" end="00:52:42.390" style="s2">its own development so to remember the</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.510" end="00:52:44.340" style="s2">example my tongue has been exacted for</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.390" end="00:52:46.590" style="s2">speech it has a structural functional</p>

<p begin="00:52:46.590" end="00:52:51.600" style="s2">of tasks but of course it has remember</p>

<p begin="00:52:51.600" end="00:52:57.060" style="s2">of side effects and those side effects</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.310" end="00:52:59.880" style="s2">are a ongoing reservoir of sets of</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.060" end="00:53:02.160" style="s2">capacities that I can tap into and make</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.880" end="00:53:04.200" style="s2">a new structural functional organization</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.160" end="00:53:05.730" style="s2">to do a new thing which is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.200" end="00:53:08.220" style="s2">doing right now I&#39;m speaking so the</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.730" end="00:53:11.490" style="s2">tongue has been exacted for speech and</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.220" end="00:53:13.590" style="s2">what he&#39;s arguing is that a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.490" end="00:53:15.330" style="s2">we see in our cognition is what he calls</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.590" end="00:53:20.070" style="s2">circuitry use circuits that have been</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.330" end="00:53:22.140" style="s2">used for one thing get reused could he</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.070" end="00:53:24.060" style="s2">get exact &#39;add in the way I&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.140" end="00:53:26.130" style="s2">described by reconfiguring their</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.060" end="00:53:28.260" style="s2">structural functional organization right</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.130" end="00:53:31.770" style="s2">so that side effects become central</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.260" end="00:53:35.970" style="s2">effects right and and what you do is you</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.770" end="00:53:41.850" style="s2">get a new machine a new capacity created</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.970" end="00:53:47.220" style="s2">that way so let&#39;s try and think about</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.850" end="00:53:50.820" style="s2">this right we&#39;ve got a clear example in</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.220" end="00:53:53.610" style="s2">the cerebellum right the cerebellum</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.820" end="00:53:59.070" style="s2">originally evolved for helping you to</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.610" end="00:54:00.870" style="s2">keep your physical balance right and</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.070" end="00:54:02.790" style="s2">what it does is it takes information</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.870" end="00:54:05.010" style="s2">from many different sense modalities and</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.790" end="00:54:07.620" style="s2">is constantly looking for how to find</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.010" end="00:54:09.090" style="s2">patterns of contingency patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.620" end="00:54:10.470" style="s2">relationship between what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.090" end="00:54:13.260" style="s2">my vision what&#39;s happening in my body</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.470" end="00:54:15.780" style="s2">and it&#39;s really helping to do all this</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.260" end="00:54:18.030" style="s2">sophisticated coordination and smoothing</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.780" end="00:54:19.500" style="s2">out so that they start to coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.030" end="00:54:22.620" style="s2">together much better</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.500" end="00:54:24.030" style="s2">that&#39;s your cerebellum it&#39;s centrally</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.620" end="00:54:26.730" style="s2">involved in your balance but you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.030" end="00:54:29.050" style="s2">what you&#39;ve done we&#39;ve the cerebellum</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.730" end="00:54:31.720" style="s2">has been exacted</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.050" end="00:54:36.690" style="s2">to repeat it&#39;s been it&#39;s used not only</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.720" end="00:54:41.440" style="s2">for finding balance between like my</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.690" end="00:54:43.960" style="s2">seeing and my moving it&#39;s been exempted</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.440" end="00:54:47.320" style="s2">to find write deeper coordination</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.960" end="00:54:51.430" style="s2">between any different areas of domain in</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.320" end="00:54:53.619" style="s2">your brain the cerebellum also allows</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.430" end="00:54:55.780" style="s2">you to integrate your vision with your</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.619" end="00:54:59.740" style="s2">working memory so that you can do visual</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.780" end="00:55:03.630" style="s2">imagery let&#39;s put this together</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.740" end="00:55:06.730" style="s2">carefully you&#39;ve got this right</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.630" end="00:55:09.460" style="s2">machinery of exaptation you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.730" end="00:55:15.220" style="s2">balance and then what you&#39;re doing when</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.460" end="00:55:16.600" style="s2">you call up the balance idea is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.220" end="00:55:18.610" style="s2">actually right</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.600" end="00:55:22.570" style="s2">notice your cerebellum has been exacted</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.610" end="00:55:24.640" style="s2">up to helping to you manage massively</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.570" end="00:55:25.810" style="s2">complex contingencies between variables</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.640" end="00:55:27.640" style="s2">you know what you have to do to be a</p>

<p begin="00:55:27.640" end="00:55:32.380" style="s2">balance you have to optimize the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.430" end="00:55:34.840" style="s2">relationship between you have to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.380" end="00:55:37.420" style="s2">on and coordinate and smooth out the</p>

<p begin="00:55:39.100" end="00:55:43.300" style="s2">you can do if you invoke balance and</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.500" end="00:55:46.480" style="s2">don&#39;t just talk about it but try and</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.300" end="00:55:48.730" style="s2">participate in it you can actually do</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.480" end="00:55:53.320" style="s2">the reverse of this you can go back</p>
