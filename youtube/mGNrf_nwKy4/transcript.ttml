<p begin="00:02:58.620" end="00:03:01.920" style="s2">introduction of yourself and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.209" end="00:03:03.270" style="s2">doing I work on a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:04.890" style="s2">different kinds of projects and I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.270" end="00:03:07.100" style="s2">this is going to become increasingly the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.890" end="00:03:09.810" style="s2">case I have skill sets in things like</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.100" end="00:03:11.370" style="s2">strategy ranging across the board this</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.810" end="00:03:13.590" style="s2">is a strategy military strategy</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.370" end="00:03:16.769" style="s2">technology strategy etc I have skill</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.590" end="00:03:18.239" style="s2">sets in different kinds of science and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.769" end="00:03:20.010" style="s2">particularly the edge of where science</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.239" end="00:03:22.160" style="s2">hits technology and where technology</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.010" end="00:03:24.540" style="s2">hits human society so the way that</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.160" end="00:03:28.170" style="s2">technologies change cultural evolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.540" end="00:03:29.910" style="s2">and I actually spent a good 15 years in</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.170" end="00:03:31.650" style="s2">the kind of pragmatic world with</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.910" end="00:03:34.830" style="s2">building technology companies so I also</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.650" end="00:03:36.239" style="s2">have expertise in pragmatics and when</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.830" end="00:03:37.920" style="s2">you where the rubber hits the road where</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.239" end="00:03:40.739" style="s2">people can and can&#39;t do things and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.920" end="00:03:42.660" style="s2">those skill sets then link up into kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.739" end="00:03:45.660" style="s2">of the roles that I play in different</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.660" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">projects but my essential rule is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.660" end="00:03:50.100" style="s2">in a situation that is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:52.290" style="s2">challenging it&#39;s for all the marbles</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.100" end="00:03:53.970" style="s2">it&#39;s happening much more rapidly than we</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.290" end="00:03:57.239" style="s2">have any ability to really deal with and</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.970" end="00:03:59.430" style="s2">so everybody has to be as fully deployed</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.239" end="00:04:01.170" style="s2">as they can be and so of course feeding</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.430" end="00:04:03.750" style="s2">my dog food I&#39;m is fully deployed as I</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.170" end="00:04:06.060" style="s2">can be and so I touched as many projects</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.750" end="00:04:08.580" style="s2">as are necessary and effective for me to</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.060" end="00:04:10.230" style="s2">be involved in using and giving those</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.580" end="00:04:11.670" style="s2">skill sets to the degree which I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.230" end="00:04:14.569" style="s2">I&#39;m currently spending a substantial</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.670" end="00:04:16.789" style="s2">amount of time in the third wave of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.569" end="00:04:18.019" style="s2">watching which is showing up as directly</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.789" end="00:04:19.850" style="s2">addressed in the problems of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.019" end="00:04:22.400" style="s2">decentralized governance which will</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.850" end="00:04:25.190" style="s2">probably expand on I&#39;m spending a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.400" end="00:04:27.740" style="s2">time in meta strategic formulations of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.190" end="00:04:28.940" style="s2">what are the different paths of where</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.740" end="00:04:30.830" style="s2">the world is going to go and what are</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.940" end="00:04:32.180" style="s2">the risks that need to be taken into</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.830" end="00:04:34.070" style="s2">account and addressed in the immediate</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.180" end="00:04:36.139" style="s2">term and the midterm in the long term</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.070" end="00:04:38.509" style="s2">and in try to work with people to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.139" end="00:04:40.729" style="s2">formulate what are the viable paths that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.509" end="00:04:42.800" style="s2">we can take so think of that as a kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.729" end="00:04:44.630" style="s2">of very high theoretical level but then</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.800" end="00:04:46.699" style="s2">what I bring is what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.630" end="00:04:47.389" style="s2">practically doable given the theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.699" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">requirements</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.389" end="00:04:50.120" style="s2">you could categorize that is something</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:51.380" style="s2">called deep code there&#39;s a whole group</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.120" end="00:04:53.389" style="s2">of people who are arranged around the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.380" end="00:04:54.889" style="s2">deep code problems most recently I just</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.389" end="00:04:58.340" style="s2">got pulled into a project to try to</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.889" end="00:05:01.550" style="s2">figure out how to actually actualize the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.340" end="00:05:03.139" style="s2">notion of wisdom in our emerging society</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.550" end="00:05:04.729" style="s2">because a lot of the problems that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.139" end="00:05:07.729" style="s2">dealing with there problems of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.729" end="00:05:09.139" style="s2">gigantic wisdom deficit that exists in</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.729" end="00:05:10.820" style="s2">our contemporary civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.139" end="00:05:12.650" style="s2">learning how to actually take wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.820" end="00:05:14.539" style="s2">from being something that we gesture at</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.650" end="00:05:16.160" style="s2">to be solutions actually practically</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.539" end="00:05:17.599" style="s2">applied in our daily lives continuously</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.160" end="00:05:19.759" style="s2">is a project that I&#39;m just getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.599" end="00:05:21.490" style="s2">involved in I can go on forever by the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.759" end="00:05:24.409" style="s2">way the list is probably several hundred</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.490" end="00:05:26.659" style="s2">interesting so if you look into the next</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.409" end="00:05:27.830" style="s2">five to ten years what do you think are</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.659" end="00:05:30.139" style="s2">some of the biggest problems that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.830" end="00:05:32.419" style="s2">facing as a species on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.139" end="00:05:35.690" style="s2">okay so I&#39;ll actually categorize it in</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.419" end="00:05:40.220" style="s2">three distinct buckets the first bucket</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.690" end="00:05:43.400" style="s2">is the fact that we are we&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.220" end="00:05:45.020" style="s2">powerful as a species and not discipline</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.400" end="00:05:46.820" style="s2">that we&#39;re careful enough and so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.020" end="00:05:49.039" style="s2">consequences of our actions can no</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.820" end="00:05:51.650" style="s2">longer be ignored as those consequences</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.039" end="00:05:54.050" style="s2">are coming back to get us so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.650" end="00:05:56.539" style="s2">be looking at all of the many many many</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.050" end="00:05:59.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not one or two it&#39;s hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.539" end="00:06:01.310" style="s2">thousands of distinct consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.240" end="00:06:03.469" style="s2">say for example the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.310" end="00:06:05.030" style="s2">concentrated chemistry hormones and</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.469" end="00:06:07.190" style="s2">heavy metals that we introduce into our</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.030" end="00:06:08.990" style="s2">ecosystem the impact that has on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.190" end="00:06:11.210" style="s2">broader ecosystem than impact it has</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.990" end="00:06:14.270" style="s2">back on us the impact we have on our</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.210" end="00:06:15.650" style="s2">ontological environment by shifting the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.270" end="00:06:17.270" style="s2">amount of time that we spend indoors</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.650" end="00:06:19.370" style="s2">versus outdoors the effect that it has</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.270" end="00:06:21.050" style="s2">on us obviously the various effects we</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.370" end="00:06:23.090" style="s2">have on the constitution of our</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.050" end="00:06:24.650" style="s2">atmosphere the impacts we have on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.090" end="00:06:25.669" style="s2">constitution of our oceans the attacks</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.650" end="00:06:27.529" style="s2">that we have in the Constitution of our</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.669" end="00:06:28.100" style="s2">soil are those are all one gigantic</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.529" end="00:06:30.500" style="s2">bucket</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.100" end="00:06:32.570" style="s2">and the point is we have too much power</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.500" end="00:06:34.400" style="s2">we have too little wisdom and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.570" end="00:06:36.500" style="s2">asymmetry is going to start in an</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.400" end="00:06:37.070" style="s2">accelerating fashion it&#39;s biting us in</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.500" end="00:06:38.720" style="s2">the ass</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.070" end="00:06:43.040" style="s2">second has to do with our relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.720" end="00:06:46.160" style="s2">to ourselves as humans so again for all</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.040" end="00:06:48.620" style="s2">of human history up until the 1940s we</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.160" end="00:06:51.770" style="s2">could kind of get away with being dicks</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.620" end="00:06:53.630" style="s2">and being pretty poor managing ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.770" end="00:06:56.420" style="s2">on each other and that&#39;s no longer the</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.630" end="00:06:58.370" style="s2">case that the the whole set of human</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.420" end="00:07:00.920" style="s2">management techniques the forms of</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.370" end="00:07:03.470" style="s2">government and peacemaking that we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.920" end="00:07:04.820" style="s2">had are inadequate to the challenge and</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.470" end="00:07:07.550" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have to get extremely</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.820" end="00:07:10.610" style="s2">good it should be quickly at actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.550" end="00:07:12.440" style="s2">resolving conflict really truly deeply</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.610" end="00:07:15.140" style="s2">healing the underlying theme that causes</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.440" end="00:07:17.270" style="s2">the conflict and getting every discrete</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.140" end="00:07:18.830" style="s2">human being into a position of what we</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.270" end="00:07:20.480" style="s2">call sovereignty which I can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.830" end="00:07:23.060" style="s2">if you&#39;d like but basically learning how</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.480" end="00:07:25.790" style="s2">to relate to humanity and then the third</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.060" end="00:07:27.620" style="s2">category is our relationship to our own</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.790" end="00:07:29.540" style="s2">tools and technologies and of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.620" end="00:07:30.260" style="s2">that third category impacts the first</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.540" end="00:07:31.670" style="s2">two as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.260" end="00:07:33.370" style="s2">but whether this has to do with a say</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.670" end="00:07:36.410" style="s2">for example the notion of how we empower</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.370" end="00:07:38.540" style="s2">machines like Facebook to then come back</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.410" end="00:07:40.250" style="s2">and manipulate our limbic system which</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.540" end="00:07:43.370" style="s2">then makes us incapable of actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.250" end="00:07:46.730" style="s2">behaving well in the world or we empower</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.370" end="00:07:49.190" style="s2">things like say energy systems like</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.730" end="00:07:50.210" style="s2">nuclear reactors which generate risks</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.190" end="00:07:52.640" style="s2">that we don&#39;t really understand how to</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.210" end="00:07:55.250" style="s2">contemplate or you know continue on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.640" end="00:07:57.470" style="s2">on the blank phones that have dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.250" end="00:07:58.520" style="s2">jacking systems that decrease our</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.470" end="00:08:00.730" style="s2">capacity to be adapted to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.520" end="00:08:02.720" style="s2">environment all three of those are</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.730" end="00:08:04.190" style="s2">linked but they&#39;re all three distinct</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.720" end="00:08:06.110" style="s2">and the point is that they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.190" end="00:08:08.930" style="s2">Union the connection between them</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.110" end="00:08:10.370" style="s2">generates the tone threshold that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.930" end="00:08:12.200" style="s2">have to get through if we can&#39;t handle</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.370" end="00:08:14.990" style="s2">the total complexity of all three of</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.200" end="00:08:17.600" style="s2">those simultaneously then it literally</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.990" end="00:08:20.150" style="s2">does lead to a collapse event so you</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.600" end="00:08:22.490" style="s2">talked a lot about sense making and how</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.150" end="00:08:24.290" style="s2">the complexity in the world is</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.490" end="00:08:27.050" style="s2">increasing faster than we can cope with</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.290" end="00:08:29.630" style="s2">it how can we mitigate that what can we</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.050" end="00:08:32.090" style="s2">do about it okay so this is actually an</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.630" end="00:08:33.890" style="s2">extremely hard question so I&#39;m gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.090" end="00:08:36.410" style="s2">ahead and just throw it right down the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.890" end="00:08:38.360" style="s2">middle the way that we had adapt to</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.410" end="00:08:39.779" style="s2">respond to our world actually goes</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.360" end="00:08:42.749" style="s2">through phases of punctuated</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.779" end="00:08:44.550" style="s2">equilibrium and so at some point in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.749" end="00:08:46.709" style="s2">past I don&#39;t know when but let&#39;s call it</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.550" end="00:08:48.480" style="s2">at least 500 years ago and probably</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.709" end="00:08:51.029" style="s2">longer probably even as late as the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.480" end="00:08:53.579" style="s2">beginning of the Iron Age human beings</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.029" end="00:08:55.980" style="s2">began to develop a neuro cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.579" end="00:08:59.399" style="s2">psychological framework for responding</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.980" end="00:09:01.559" style="s2">to reality a reality to changed at a</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.399" end="00:09:04.649" style="s2">certain pace I&#39;m going to call this the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.559" end="00:09:07.620" style="s2">paradigmatic mind so the paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.649" end="00:09:10.439" style="s2">mind is in mind that creates a model of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.620" end="00:09:11.309" style="s2">reality creates identities creates</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.439" end="00:09:13.769" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.309" end="00:09:16.920" style="s2">it creates heuristics and it uses that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.769" end="00:09:19.470" style="s2">to be able to have high-quality models</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.920" end="00:09:21.180" style="s2">for how to respond to reality under most</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.470" end="00:09:23.189" style="s2">circumstances so your job as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.180" end="00:09:25.920" style="s2">developing human under the paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.189" end="00:09:27.779" style="s2">mind is to build a paradigm learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.920" end="00:09:31.439" style="s2">run that paradigm and then as you become</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.779" end="00:09:33.809" style="s2">an adult run it and when the world is</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.439" end="00:09:36.149" style="s2">changing at a slow enough pace this</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.809" end="00:09:38.009" style="s2">works pretty well you know how to farm</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.149" end="00:09:40.470" style="s2">you have a bunch of rituals on how to</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.009" end="00:09:43.110" style="s2">relate to society into the world there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.470" end="00:09:45.120" style="s2">a bunch of basic social contracts that</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.110" end="00:09:46.709" style="s2">everybody implicitly accepts and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.120" end="00:09:48.120" style="s2">socially constructed set of paradigms is</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.709" end="00:09:49.769" style="s2">adequate to the problems you&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.120" end="00:09:52.110" style="s2">and then what ends up happening is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.769" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">on some periodic basis maybe once or</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.110" end="00:09:56.819" style="s2">twice during your life or two or three</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:09:59.519" style="s2">times during a century there might be a</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.819" end="00:10:01.680" style="s2">major paradigm shift where a big chunk</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.519" end="00:10:03.480" style="s2">of the paradigm system doesn&#39;t work it</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.680" end="00:10:05.670" style="s2">collapses it feels like a big social</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.480" end="00:10:07.259" style="s2">crisis the society kind of Rico here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.670" end="00:10:08.430" style="s2">around some new model and then you glue</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.259" end="00:10:10.709" style="s2">that on to the paradigm that you move</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.430" end="00:10:12.959" style="s2">forward and over the past thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.709" end="00:10:15.480" style="s2">or so civilization is preceded by a</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.959" end="00:10:18.029" style="s2">process of building and modifying</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.480" end="00:10:20.250" style="s2">paradigms through this crisis Rico here</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.029" end="00:10:23.309" style="s2">it&#39;s approach and that&#39;s been an</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.250" end="00:10:24.750" style="s2">adaptive enough capacity to enable us to</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.309" end="00:10:26.639" style="s2">get where we are which is pretty pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.750" end="00:10:29.639" style="s2">impressive the problem is is that when</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.639" end="00:10:31.740" style="s2">the pace of change is faster than the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.639" end="00:10:34.829" style="s2">ability of our paradigm mind</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.740" end="00:10:37.920" style="s2">to adapt paradigms you&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.829" end="00:10:39.899" style="s2">paradigm collapses too frequently to</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.920" end="00:10:42.509" style="s2">ever cohere and you actually end up in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.899" end="00:10:43.860" style="s2">situation of complete confusion you</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.509" end="00:10:45.420" style="s2">literally can&#39;t make sense of your</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.860" end="00:10:47.819" style="s2">environment anymore because the thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.420" end="00:10:49.379" style="s2">that you use to make sense is know you</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.819" end="00:10:51.300" style="s2">can&#39;t trust it because you expect that</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.379" end="00:10:53.640" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be breaking or collapsing in</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.300" end="00:10:55.410" style="s2">unpredictable ways to often and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.640" end="00:10:56.580" style="s2">it that&#39;s actually a pretty good affair</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.410" end="00:10:58.970" style="s2">Matthew what&#39;s going on in the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.580" end="00:11:02.880" style="s2">right now so many things are happening</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.970" end="00:11:04.529" style="s2">appear to be surprises that and this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.880" end="00:11:07.050" style="s2">because the environment is changing</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.529" end="00:11:09.570" style="s2">faster than the entire architecture of</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.050" end="00:11:12.630" style="s2">the paradigmatic mind can adapt to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.570" end="00:11:13.920" style="s2">environment so what that means is we</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.630" end="00:11:16.350" style="s2">actually have to build an entirely</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.920" end="00:11:18.839" style="s2">different model of ecology entire</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.350" end="00:11:21.420" style="s2">different model of modeling reality and</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.839" end="00:11:22.769" style="s2">which is just a new mind now this new</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.420" end="00:11:24.810" style="s2">mind is going to have a very different</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.769" end="00:11:26.640" style="s2">relationship to other humans or other</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.810" end="00:11:28.500" style="s2">sentience and a very different</p>

<p begin="00:11:28.500" end="00:11:32.850" style="s2">lot of us certainly love the younger</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.839" end="00:11:34.940" style="s2">generations I think intuitively get a</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.850" end="00:11:36.930" style="s2">sense for it because it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.940" end="00:11:39.779" style="s2">intrinsically collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.930" end="00:11:42.149" style="s2">and by that I mean there won&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.779" end="00:11:44.010" style="s2">strong sense of individuals having any</p>

<p begin="00:11:45.750" end="00:11:50.370" style="s2">there won&#39;t be an idea that I as an</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.519" end="00:11:52.200" style="s2">individual really ever even try to</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.370" end="00:11:55.050" style="s2">believe that I understand the world very</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.200" end="00:11:58.200" style="s2">much my responsibility is to maintain a</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.050" end="00:12:01.290" style="s2">really high-quality sense of how clearly</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.200" end="00:12:02.820" style="s2">I am proceeding reality so this has to</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.290" end="00:12:05.820" style="s2">do with this concept of sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.820" end="00:12:07.050" style="s2">which I&#39;ll explicate in a moment I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.820" end="00:12:09.990" style="s2">it&#39;ll be important to this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.050" end="00:12:12.450" style="s2">and then how effectively I can share</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.990" end="00:12:15.029" style="s2">that perspective with truth and clarity</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.450" end="00:12:17.760" style="s2">out into some kind of collective space</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.029" end="00:12:19.410" style="s2">and some shared space of insight and</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.760" end="00:12:22.950" style="s2">then will end up happening is is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.410" end="00:12:25.140" style="s2">we&#39;ll be constantly coherent groups of</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.950" end="00:12:27.390" style="s2">sentience and by sentence I mean both</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.140" end="00:12:31.050" style="s2">humans and increasingly capable machines</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.390" end="00:12:33.510" style="s2">when and as if needed around particular</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.050" end="00:12:35.940" style="s2">problem domains sharing our distinct</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.510" end="00:12:37.199" style="s2">perspectives beginning to form an actual</p>

<p begin="00:12:39.240" end="00:12:42.839" style="s2">intelligence is adequate to the scope of</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.070" end="00:12:45.750" style="s2">the real space whatever it might be and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.839" end="00:12:47.279" style="s2">then once that is resolved we will then</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.750" end="00:12:49.740" style="s2">artifact that as effectively as possible</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.279" end="00:12:51.810" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll decohere so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.740" end="00:12:54.149" style="s2">three of us might gather will then</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.810" end="00:12:55.680" style="s2">figure out how to come into coherence by</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.149" end="00:12:58.019" style="s2">establishing various protocols for</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.680" end="00:13:00.510" style="s2">communication and understanding how each</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.019" end="00:13:01.860" style="s2">of us shares our perspective until we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.510" end="00:13:03.870" style="s2">got enough clarity that then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.860" end="00:13:05.340" style="s2">really effectively have coherent to</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.870" end="00:13:06.930" style="s2">collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.340" end="00:13:08.490" style="s2">and then that thing has a certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.930" end="00:13:10.080" style="s2">capacity which is vastly more than any</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.490" end="00:13:11.370" style="s2">of the three of us as individuals but</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.080" end="00:13:13.050" style="s2">then what will happen is is that will</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.370" end="00:13:15.060" style="s2">decohere I&#39;ll go away I&#39;ll go do</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.050" end="00:13:18.030" style="s2">something else and getting extremely</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.060" end="00:13:20.760" style="s2">good at flowing between these coherences</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.030" end="00:13:22.680" style="s2">and D coherences at orienting yourself</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.760" end="00:13:24.990" style="s2">towards the place where your energy and</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.680" end="00:13:27.900" style="s2">perspective is the most needful now and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.990" end="00:13:30.030" style="s2">in entering into coherence quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.900" end="00:13:32.520" style="s2">fluidly with potentially extremely</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.030" end="00:13:34.050" style="s2">heterogeneous sentience is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.520" end="00:13:34.950" style="s2">in nature with this new mind looks like</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.050" end="00:13:36.630" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.950" end="00:13:39.270" style="s2">so would you like me to go further on</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.630" end="00:13:41.250" style="s2">that or do more on sovereignty yeah I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.270" end="00:13:42.690" style="s2">love to hear more on that but I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.250" end="00:13:43.980" style="s2">to know if you have any examples of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.690" end="00:13:46.320" style="s2">groups of people that are already</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.980" end="00:13:49.200" style="s2">succeeding and doing this well okay so</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.320" end="00:13:50.970" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna give you a very pragmatic and</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.200" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2">prosaic example and then we&#39;ll dive</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.970" end="00:13:53.540" style="s2">harder because it actually happens all</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.540" end="00:13:56.820" style="s2">pragmatically and prosaically and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:13:58.500" style="s2">the challenge is having you put a whole</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.820" end="00:13:59.790" style="s2">society on this principle and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.500" end="00:14:01.050" style="s2">why I&#39;m gonna start it is because it</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.790" end="00:14:01.980" style="s2">gives us a little bit of hope because it</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.050" end="00:14:04.200" style="s2">tells us that&#39;s a part of the basic</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.980" end="00:14:07.020" style="s2">human toolkit so the good news is is</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.200" end="00:14:09.630" style="s2">that human beings are obligate tribal</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.020" end="00:14:12.150" style="s2">meaning that we&#39;re already evolved to</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.630" end="00:14:13.770" style="s2">think in groups then in fact my friend</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.150" end="00:14:15.810" style="s2">Brett Weinstein has proposed that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.770" end="00:14:17.450" style="s2">only truly conscious in groups that</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.810" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2">consciousness exists for the purposes of</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.450" end="00:14:25.080" style="s2">mediating groups so when you take a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:27.900" style="s2">high-quality musical band or a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.080" end="00:14:29.940" style="s2">high-quality sports team or say military</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.900" end="00:14:32.400" style="s2">like a SEAL team these groups are</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.940" end="00:14:33.810" style="s2">operating exactly this fashion and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.400" end="00:14:36.360" style="s2">know it makes sense like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.810" end="00:14:37.620" style="s2">imagine a single individual often being</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.360" end="00:14:39.840" style="s2">able to create the thing that a whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.620" end="00:14:43.230" style="s2">musical band can create it&#39;s just beyond</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.840" end="00:14:44.610" style="s2">their imaginal and active scope so</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.230" end="00:14:45.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the simple example and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.610" end="00:14:47.790" style="s2">prosaic because most of us experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.960" end="00:14:50.040" style="s2">something like that entering into a</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.790" end="00:14:51.180" style="s2">communion and a flow with a group of</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.040" end="00:14:54.660" style="s2">people that is very collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.180" end="00:14:56.310" style="s2">creative so the real challenge is how do</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.660" end="00:14:58.560" style="s2">we scale that up and how do we make it</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.310" end="00:15:01.650" style="s2">vastly more fluid because typically it</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.560" end="00:15:03.330" style="s2">might take years of deep deep deep</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.650" end="00:15:05.040" style="s2">collaboration to enter into that level</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.330" end="00:15:08.160" style="s2">of communion it slow but honest that</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.040" end="00:15:09.870" style="s2">doesn&#39;t scale so now I&#39;ll move to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.160" end="00:15:11.580" style="s2">group that I know pretty well that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.870" end="00:15:15.630" style="s2">almost there so this group is called the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.580" end="00:15:17.340" style="s2">Santa Fe Institute and they to my</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.630" end="00:15:19.110" style="s2">knowledge for the first group of people</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.340" end="00:15:22.410" style="s2">to be very very aware</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.110" end="00:15:24.089" style="s2">of this kind of problem and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.410" end="00:15:25.769" style="s2">figure out how to address it so back in</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.089" end="00:15:28.110" style="s2">the late 80s this isn&#39;t it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.769" end="00:15:29.820" style="s2">scientific group so these are all very</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.110" end="00:15:32.910" style="s2">well established scientists environed</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.820" end="00:15:34.890" style="s2">Ivor&#39;s domains and they began to</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.910" end="00:15:37.350" style="s2">recognize that there was a need for some</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.890" end="00:15:40.560" style="s2">approach to science that was new or</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.350" end="00:15:41.910" style="s2">different to what they don&#39;t learned and</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.560" end="00:15:43.829" style="s2">mastered in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.910" end="00:15:47.730" style="s2">so the twenty essentially developed at</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.829" end="00:15:49.560" style="s2">the very finest level of perfection they</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.730" end="00:15:52.320" style="s2">call disciplinary science so I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.560" end="00:15:54.450" style="s2">physicist I&#39;m a chemist I&#39;m a biologist</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.320" end="00:15:58.019" style="s2">and within that there is you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.450" end="00:15:59.940" style="s2">increasingly refined disciplinary edges</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.019" end="00:16:01.470" style="s2">that I&#39;m part of and then there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.940" end="00:16:03.149" style="s2">that we can glue those disciplines back</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.470" end="00:16:05.610" style="s2">together what the Santa Fe Institute</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.149" end="00:16:09.660" style="s2">discovered was the possibility for and</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.610" end="00:16:11.279" style="s2">the need for transdisciplinary science</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.660" end="00:16:12.829" style="s2">and the word trans there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.279" end="00:16:14.820" style="s2">important suffix it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.829" end="00:16:15.930" style="s2">multidisciplinary right I think a whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.820" end="00:16:17.490" style="s2">bunch of disciplines and glue them</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.930" end="00:16:18.950" style="s2">together and they try to collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.490" end="00:16:20.790" style="s2">that&#39;s multidisciplinary</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.950" end="00:16:22.980" style="s2">transdisciplinary is actually trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.790" end="00:16:24.839" style="s2">figure out how people who come from</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.980" end="00:16:27.209" style="s2">different worlds different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.839" end="00:16:30.240" style="s2">different paradigms and models can get</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.209" end="00:16:31.890" style="s2">together dispense with the totality of</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.240" end="00:16:34.890" style="s2">the artifacts of where they come from</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.890" end="00:16:37.170" style="s2">and actually address reality directly</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.890" end="00:16:38.699" style="s2">and if fashion was completely decoupled</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.170" end="00:16:41.880" style="s2">from the notions of discipline and</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.699" end="00:16:43.529" style="s2">altogether and so they named the problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.880" end="00:16:45.480" style="s2">and then began trying to explore it</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.529" end="00:16:46.620" style="s2">starting in the late 80s and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.480" end="00:16:48.269" style="s2">very good at it but they&#39;re a heck of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.620" end="00:16:50.190" style="s2">lot better than most people and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.269" end="00:16:51.990" style="s2">yielded enormous positive results</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.190" end="00:16:55.620" style="s2">because it turns out there&#39;s just these</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.990" end="00:16:56.880" style="s2">gigantic problems that if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.620" end="00:16:58.709" style="s2">them from the point of view of a given</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.880" end="00:17:01.350" style="s2">discipline like let&#39;s say you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.709" end="00:17:02.970" style="s2">economics and physics physics can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.350" end="00:17:04.679" style="s2">the problem economics can&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.970" end="00:17:06.329" style="s2">problem even though the problem spans</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.679" end="00:17:07.350" style="s2">both economics and physics because the</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.329" end="00:17:09.839" style="s2">disciplines don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.350" end="00:17:11.579" style="s2">epistemological capacity to perceive it</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.839" end="00:17:14.059" style="s2">but to get an economist and a physicist</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.579" end="00:17:16.260" style="s2">together they go through a process of</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.059" end="00:17:19.230" style="s2">deconstructing their disciplinary</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.260" end="00:17:20.610" style="s2">assumptions still being able to hold the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.230" end="00:17:21.870" style="s2">tools that they know how to use but now</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.610" end="00:17:24.480" style="s2">they&#39;re holding the tools more lightly</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.870" end="00:17:26.429" style="s2">and then go back all the way to base of</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.480" end="00:17:29.040" style="s2">responding simply to physical reality</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.429" end="00:17:31.230" style="s2">and querying reality with their tools</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.040" end="00:17:32.040" style="s2">but now in a collaborative framework</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.230" end="00:17:34.200" style="s2">where each of</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.040" end="00:17:36.240" style="s2">bringing their point of view to bear and</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.200" end="00:17:38.190" style="s2">using the parallax of their diverse</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.240" end="00:17:40.470" style="s2">perspectives to begin highlighting</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.190" end="00:17:42.780" style="s2">something that exists in reality but</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.470" end="00:17:45.330" style="s2">isn&#39;t that not obviously embodied in any</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.780" end="00:17:48.000" style="s2">given particular domain as we understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.330" end="00:17:49.200" style="s2">it and so the saint of things to choose</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.000" end="00:17:51.210" style="s2">is an example of something that I might</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:54.030" style="s2">call a part of a transitionary framework</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.210" end="00:17:55.620" style="s2">where it&#39;s at scale there&#39;s thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.030" end="00:17:57.480" style="s2">scientists who were roughly part of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.620" end="00:17:58.980" style="s2">community and they&#39;ve been for the past</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.480" end="00:18:00.660" style="s2">several decades trying to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.980" end="00:18:02.190" style="s2">to do this sort of thing but you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.660" end="00:18:04.800" style="s2">almost all of the people who are part of</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.190" end="00:18:08.400" style="s2">that are folks who were developed they</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.800" end="00:18:10.710" style="s2">grew up in the 20th century and so their</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.400" end="00:18:13.320" style="s2">minds are still very much paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.710" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">minds and even their the farthest edges</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.320" end="00:18:17.310" style="s2">of that it was just very difficult to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:19.170" style="s2">this sort of thing reverse engineering I</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.310" end="00:18:20.690" style="s2">switch all the way to the other side and</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.170" end="00:18:22.710" style="s2">I take a look at the the youngest</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.690" end="00:18:24.150" style="s2">effective generation I call them</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.710" end="00:18:25.710" style="s2">generation of mega because I think they</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.150" end="00:18:27.630" style="s2">are in fact the last human generation</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.710" end="00:18:30.570" style="s2">but many people might refer to them to</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.630" end="00:18:35.760" style="s2">Generation Z so the the kids who are</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.570" end="00:18:37.590" style="s2">born probably about 1999-2000 and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.760" end="00:18:41.190" style="s2">up until recently so there&#39;s gonna be 18</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.590" end="00:18:42.600" style="s2">years or so and younger when I actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.190" end="00:18:44.430" style="s2">watched them in particular when I</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.600" end="00:18:47.910" style="s2">watched them coordinated something like</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.430" end="00:18:50.060" style="s2">Minecraft I see the stuff that I that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.910" end="00:18:52.110" style="s2">observed at the Santa Fe Institute</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.060" end="00:18:54.210" style="s2">happening at a cognitive level it</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.110" end="00:18:56.820" style="s2">deliberately I see it actually happening</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.210" end="00:18:58.850" style="s2">intrinsically so something about the way</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.820" end="00:19:01.830" style="s2">the generation of mega has simply</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.850" end="00:19:04.610" style="s2">developed facultative has always lived</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.830" end="00:19:07.560" style="s2">in a world where it was possible and</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.610" end="00:19:09.240" style="s2">useful to communicate with the people</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.560" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">you wanted to communicate with in real</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.240" end="00:19:14.070" style="s2">time always on always connected can you</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:15.840" style="s2">give it a little bit more of an example</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.070" end="00:19:18.420" style="s2">of how they&#39;re communicating when</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.840" end="00:19:20.370" style="s2">they&#39;re playing that game yeah so my my</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.420" end="00:19:23.610" style="s2">eldest daughter who now is well still be</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.370" end="00:19:23.850" style="s2">15 and a week where she was in sixth</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.610" end="00:19:26.040" style="s2">grade</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.850" end="00:19:28.380" style="s2">we agreed that she would work on a</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.040" end="00:19:30.330" style="s2">project of creating something in</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.380" end="00:19:32.250" style="s2">Minecraft and so I was thinking very</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.330" end="00:19:34.350" style="s2">much a 20th century ideas so I had the</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.250" end="00:19:36.660" style="s2">ocean of a project plan a series of</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.350" end="00:19:38.340" style="s2">phases where people would design and</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.660" end="00:19:39.390" style="s2">then they would create projects and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.340" end="00:19:40.800" style="s2">they would collaborate that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.390" end="00:19:42.870" style="s2">thing we&#39;re in a very 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.800" end="00:19:45.940" style="s2">post-world war ii operational management</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.870" end="00:19:47.259" style="s2">mindset but I know that the tourism your</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.940" end="00:19:48.789" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna create it&#39;s kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.259" end="00:19:50.919" style="s2">object here&#39;s your design requirements</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.789" end="00:19:52.059" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna have this amount of stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.919" end="00:19:53.350" style="s2">it&#39;s going to have at least seven people</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.059" end="00:19:55.480" style="s2">contributing and you&#39;re gonna get it</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.350" end="00:19:58.240" style="s2">done by this date and what I noticed was</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.480" end="00:20:00.419" style="s2">that within 48 hours she had already</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.240" end="00:20:03.669" style="s2">brought seven people into it so first</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.419" end="00:20:05.590" style="s2">the intuitive muscle of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.669" end="00:20:07.960" style="s2">reach out communicate with and cohere</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.590" end="00:20:08.980" style="s2">group of people was the first I didn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.960" end="00:20:10.120" style="s2">don&#39;t think she even had to spend a</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.980" end="00:20:13.059" style="s2">moment thinking about it she was just</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.120" end="00:20:14.559" style="s2">able to invoke a cohort of people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.059" end="00:20:16.929" style="s2">are willing to come together and play in</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.559" end="00:20:18.340" style="s2">this space almost instantly and this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.929" end="00:20:21.009" style="s2">like a three month project they had</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.340" end="00:20:22.389" style="s2">plenty of time to work on it so for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.009" end="00:20:24.039" style="s2">better part of three months they just</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.389" end="00:20:25.690" style="s2">played you know they just did things</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.039" end="00:20:27.580" style="s2">that collaborative in have any structure</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.690" end="00:20:29.259" style="s2">no sort of planning around what they</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.580" end="00:20:30.789" style="s2">were gonna do and as I was just watching</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.259" end="00:20:32.529" style="s2">as I was three interested to see how</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.789" end="00:20:33.850" style="s2">this played out my expectation was that</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.529" end="00:20:35.200" style="s2">worst-case scenario be so different</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.850" end="00:20:36.669" style="s2">learning experience and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.200" end="00:20:38.379" style="s2">debrief about what worked and what</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.669" end="00:20:40.480" style="s2">didn&#39;t work so coming down to the last</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.379" end="00:20:42.100" style="s2">couple of weeks I said hey you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.480" end="00:20:43.659" style="s2">you&#39;re almost at the end of your your</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.100" end="00:20:45.129" style="s2">timeline here it doesn&#39;t seem like</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.659" end="00:20:46.600" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually created anything do you</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.129" end="00:20:47.799" style="s2">have a notion of how you get to go do it</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.600" end="00:20:50.470" style="s2">and she just looked at me for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.799" end="00:20:52.720" style="s2">that she said oh yeah and so over a</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.470" end="00:20:54.460" style="s2">period of a week she just sent out a</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.720" end="00:20:56.470" style="s2">signal to them said hey can we do this</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.460" end="00:20:58.779" style="s2">they all showed up they had a</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.470" end="00:20:59.919" style="s2">conversation and then honestly I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.779" end="00:21:01.450" style="s2">this point where I can&#39;t actually tell</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.919" end="00:21:02.830" style="s2">you what happened because it&#39;s outside</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.450" end="00:21:04.899" style="s2">of my lived experience I was just</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.830" end="00:21:06.909" style="s2">watching something that I don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.899" end="00:21:09.279" style="s2">get but I can tell you what happened an</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.909" end="00:21:12.210" style="s2">absolutely astounding level of</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.279" end="00:21:15.250" style="s2">creativity and this process we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.210" end="00:21:17.169" style="s2">talking about a sixth grade kid she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.250" end="00:21:19.960" style="s2">sitting at her computer she has like</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.169" end="00:21:22.330" style="s2">seven windows open simultaneously she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.960" end="00:21:24.070" style="s2">typing in all the different windows she</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.330" end="00:21:26.200" style="s2">actually has voice command she&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.070" end="00:21:27.940" style="s2">to different people and from a four</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.200" end="00:21:30.519" style="s2">hours straight four or five days in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.940" end="00:21:33.309" style="s2">row this was going on and I was actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.519" end="00:21:36.070" style="s2">watching gigantic structures emerging</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.309" end="00:21:37.720" style="s2">people being given or taking</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.070" end="00:21:38.740" style="s2">responsibility for different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.720" end="00:21:40.360" style="s2">things like one person took</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.740" end="00:21:42.190" style="s2">responsibility for doing programming and</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.360" end="00:21:43.809" style="s2">creating various kinds of activities and</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.190" end="00:21:45.759" style="s2">the blocks did to do stuff somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.809" end="00:21:47.169" style="s2">again just kind of holding and outlining</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.759" end="00:21:49.149" style="s2">the framework of what the space would</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.169" end="00:21:50.169" style="s2">look like somebody else just decided</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.149" end="00:21:52.960" style="s2">they were going to be doing narrative</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.169" end="00:21:55.779" style="s2">and telling a story and they had some</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.960" end="00:21:58.269" style="s2">capacity to simultaneously allow every</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.779" end="00:21:59.530" style="s2">individual to take a particular piece</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.269" end="00:22:00.970" style="s2">and run with it</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.530" end="00:22:03.190" style="s2">while maintaining the coherence of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.970" end="00:22:05.410" style="s2">whole who without any notion of like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.190" end="00:22:07.030" style="s2">top-down leader or any notion of</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.410" end="00:22:09.400" style="s2">everybody getting together instead of</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.030" end="00:22:11.470" style="s2">deliberating on it in consensus and yet</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.400" end="00:22:13.180" style="s2">it happened and so at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.470" end="00:22:14.650" style="s2">period they created something that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.180" end="00:22:16.750" style="s2">absolutely astounding I mean it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.650" end="00:22:19.390" style="s2">physically gorgeous there&#39;s layers and</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.750" end="00:22:22.420" style="s2">layers of richness there was multimodal</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.390" end="00:22:24.130" style="s2">like it wasn&#39;t just architectural there</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.420" end="00:22:26.380" style="s2">was also really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.130" end="00:22:29.710" style="s2">interactivity there was storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.380" end="00:22:31.240" style="s2">there was actually different agents</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.710" end="00:22:33.460" style="s2">different play different pieces in it</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.240" end="00:22:35.260" style="s2">and so you know when I look at at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.460" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">end it&#39;s not clear to me that I could</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.260" end="00:22:39.190" style="s2">have figured out anyway and you know I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:23:49.330" end="00:23:53.500" style="s2">sounds like some sort of swarm</p>

<p begin="00:24:00.820" end="00:24:04.240" style="s2">because even though it&#39;s an easy</p>

<p begin="00:24:04.240" end="00:24:07.450" style="s2">out it&#39;s actually wrong in a very</p>

<p begin="00:24:08.980" end="00:24:12.490" style="s2">frameworks it&#39;s actually something that</p>

<p begin="00:24:13.120" end="00:24:17.470" style="s2">metaphorically it is similar to the way</p>

<p begin="00:24:17.470" end="00:24:22.650" style="s2">actually is operating in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.120" end="00:24:25.150" style="s2">transcendental modality which means that</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.650" end="00:24:27.370" style="s2">it&#39;s doing something categorically</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.150" end="00:24:28.930" style="s2">different than any kind of existing</p>

<p begin="00:24:31.030" end="00:24:34.870" style="s2">it&#39;s well alright you ready</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.950" end="00:24:36.310" style="s2">this is gonna be a tough one let me see</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.870" end="00:24:38.200" style="s2">if I could do this right this is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.310" end="00:24:42.670" style="s2">really really hard concept if we can do</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.200" end="00:24:44.260" style="s2">it it&#39;s extremely powerful ok so there</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.670" end="00:24:46.750" style="s2">guess at all familiar with the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.260" end="00:24:47.710" style="s2">of calculus in Western civilization not</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.750" end="00:24:49.570" style="s2">quite nope</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.710" end="00:24:51.550" style="s2">I think I might be able to do it quickly</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.570" end="00:24:54.850" style="s2">enough that it is useful the key insight</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.550" end="00:24:58.090" style="s2">is that these two extraordinary geniuses</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.850" end="00:25:00.160" style="s2">Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz both</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.090" end="00:25:02.020" style="s2">developed calculus almost at the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.160" end="00:25:03.250" style="s2">time they&#39;re they&#39;re both alive at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.020" end="00:25:05.140" style="s2">same time they&#39;re both working on</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.250" end="00:25:06.820" style="s2">similar problems and so they both will</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.140" end="00:25:09.010" style="s2">recognize the necessity of solving the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.820" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">problem but the approach they took were</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.010" end="00:25:12.070" style="s2">very very different Newton&#39;s approach to</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:13.570" style="s2">calculus and Leibniz approaches to talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.070" end="00:25:15.610" style="s2">to us if you were intimately familiar</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.570" end="00:25:17.680" style="s2">they would seem very different and so we</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.610" end="00:25:20.710" style="s2">might say is that there&#39;s an abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.680" end="00:25:23.350" style="s2">called calculus and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.710" end="00:25:24.670" style="s2">instantiations of calculus the Newtonian</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.350" end="00:25:27.850" style="s2">version in the Latin it C inversion</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.670" end="00:25:30.070" style="s2">which are both instantiations of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.850" end="00:25:32.170" style="s2">abstraction the abstraction lives in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.070" end="00:25:33.760" style="s2">realm of pure abstraction meaning I</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.170" end="00:25:37.150" style="s2">could come up with an instantiation of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.760" end="00:25:38.860" style="s2">calculus and as long as it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.150" end="00:25:40.630" style="s2">an authentic instantiation of calculus</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.860" end="00:25:41.050" style="s2">it would be compatible with what Newton</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.630" end="00:25:43.510" style="s2">Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.050" end="00:25:45.310" style="s2">I started Newton and Leibniz did but it</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.510" end="00:25:47.920" style="s2">might be very different and so this this</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.310" end="00:25:50.260" style="s2">concept of an absolute abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.920" end="00:25:53.110" style="s2">something that is non mediated but</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.260" end="00:25:55.510" style="s2">nonetheless is real and then the ability</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.110" end="00:25:57.880" style="s2">to instantiate that in some medium in</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.510" end="00:26:00.070" style="s2">Leibniz case instantiate it in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.880" end="00:26:01.600" style="s2">format that he did in Newton&#39;s case</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.070" end="00:26:04.240" style="s2">instantiating Diplomat that he did</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.600" end="00:26:05.650" style="s2">that&#39;s a very deep fundamental concept</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.240" end="00:26:08.770" style="s2">the ability to recognize that there are</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.650" end="00:26:12.610" style="s2">objects in reality that are pre-mediated</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.770" end="00:26:15.370" style="s2">trans mediated but real and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.610" end="00:26:18.220" style="s2">a mechanism by which human beings by</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.370" end="00:26:20.500" style="s2">hypothesis any sentient can perceive</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.220" end="00:26:23.050" style="s2">those abstraction and then allow them to</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.500" end="00:26:24.720" style="s2">be mediated into some kind of actuality</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.050" end="00:26:26.050" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.720" end="00:26:29.140" style="s2">multi-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.050" end="00:26:31.090" style="s2">that were were somehow tapping into yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.140" end="00:26:32.500" style="s2">that&#39;s a that is actually true because</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.090" end="00:26:34.480" style="s2">there&#39;s certain kinds of if I describe</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.500" end="00:26:36.550" style="s2">something like a hypercube yeah which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.480" end="00:26:38.440" style="s2">just a cube in higher dimensions the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.550" end="00:26:40.840" style="s2">beauty of that is that I can say the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.440" end="00:26:43.300" style="s2">phrase hypercube and you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.840" end="00:26:45.070" style="s2">conceive of it because we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.300" end="00:26:47.350" style="s2">have mechanisms for perceiving or</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.070" end="00:26:49.480" style="s2">conceiving of things in say a 10</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.350" end="00:26:51.700" style="s2">dimensional hyper cube I can say the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.480" end="00:26:53.920" style="s2">words and if you understand math right</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.700" end="00:26:55.240" style="s2">you can do things with it but the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.920" end="00:26:57.070" style="s2">of it is you can&#39;t pretend that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.240" end="00:26:58.780" style="s2">actually are thinking about it whereas</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.070" end="00:27:01.660" style="s2">if I say something like the generator</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.780" end="00:27:03.730" style="s2">function from which stick orgy emerges</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.660" end="00:27:05.350" style="s2">you might think you know what that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.730" end="00:27:06.610" style="s2">but the key is as long as you hold it</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.350" end="00:27:08.290" style="s2">like you would hold a 10 dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.610" end="00:27:10.690" style="s2">hyper cube then you&#39;re in the right</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.290" end="00:27:13.420" style="s2">space so now what I can say is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.690" end="00:27:18.610" style="s2">generator function there&#39;s some trans</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.420" end="00:27:21.550" style="s2">media object from which stigma G which</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.610" end="00:27:24.370" style="s2">is to say the mechanism by which swarms</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.550" end="00:27:25.900" style="s2">coordinate themselves emerges and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.370" end="00:27:28.210" style="s2">thing that I&#39;m talking about the thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.900" end="00:27:29.260" style="s2">that is now emergent in the contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.210" end="00:27:31.720" style="s2">environment the thing that these kids</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.260" end="00:27:34.060" style="s2">were doing is coming from the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.720" end="00:27:36.640" style="s2">generator function but it&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.060" end="00:27:39.100" style="s2">as Sigma G because it&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.640" end="00:27:41.170" style="s2">dealing with a mediation layer ie human</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.100" end="00:27:42.640" style="s2">beings and human technology which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.170" end="00:27:44.380" style="s2">vastly vastly different than what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.640" end="00:27:45.070" style="s2">available to bees and termites does that</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.380" end="00:27:47.890" style="s2">make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.070" end="00:27:49.450" style="s2">totally yes absolutely awesome that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.890" end="00:27:50.410" style="s2">fabulous that that happened</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.450" end="00:27:53.260" style="s2">now some we took we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.410" end="00:27:54.190" style="s2">sovereignty ready right now already I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.260" end="00:27:56.260" style="s2">going to have to make sure we have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.190" end="00:27:59.020" style="s2">caveat because the word sovereignty has</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.260" end="00:28:00.640" style="s2">all kinds of weird loading and if people</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.020" end="00:28:02.770" style="s2">are listening to this and they feel like</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.640" end="00:28:04.990" style="s2">I think they know what that means I</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.770" end="00:28:06.910" style="s2">apologize in advance because in some</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.990" end="00:28:08.680" style="s2">sense we&#39;re trying to just redefine it</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.910" end="00:28:10.390" style="s2">but it&#39;s the closest word that we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.680" end="00:28:14.140" style="s2">to the thing we&#39;re trying to describe so</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.390" end="00:28:16.200" style="s2">an individual agent a sentient agents</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.140" end="00:28:18.910" style="s2">relationship to the world there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.200" end="00:28:20.350" style="s2">three distinct functions we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.910" end="00:28:21.940" style="s2">map to for if we want but I&#39;m gonna map</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.350" end="00:28:24.310" style="s2">it to three three distinct functions</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.940" end="00:28:25.750" style="s2">that describe the capacity of a sentient</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.310" end="00:28:28.930" style="s2">agents ability to respond to the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.750" end="00:28:31.560" style="s2">the first piece is the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.930" end="00:28:35.890" style="s2">that sensing agent is able to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.560" end="00:28:38.080" style="s2">reality is we might call that the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.890" end="00:28:39.620" style="s2">perceptive modality and so perception</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:41.480" style="s2">here includes everything from</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.620" end="00:28:43.700" style="s2">say like your senses your ability to see</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.480" end="00:28:46.160" style="s2">that if I lack eyesight I can&#39;t perceive</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.700" end="00:28:47.840" style="s2">electromagnetic radiation if I lack oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.160" end="00:28:50.000" style="s2">faction I can&#39;t perceive chemical</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.840" end="00:28:52.010" style="s2">molecules right if I lack hearing I</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.000" end="00:28:53.960" style="s2">can&#39;t perceive sound waves so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.010" end="00:28:55.970" style="s2">modality and then it also the bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.960" end="00:28:57.530" style="s2">so for example if I had vision but I</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.970" end="00:28:59.540" style="s2">can&#39;t perceive ultraviolet I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.530" end="00:29:01.130" style="s2">perceive ultraviolet and similarly if I</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.540" end="00:29:03.200" style="s2">have vision but I&#39;m looking at the Sun</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.130" end="00:29:05.630" style="s2">I&#39;ll be overwhelmed I&#39;ll have too much</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.200" end="00:29:07.970" style="s2">input to be able to process it so the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.630" end="00:29:12.470" style="s2">first portion of sovereignty is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.970" end="00:29:15.980" style="s2">total capacity to perceive reality the</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.470" end="00:29:18.170" style="s2">second portion combines sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.980" end="00:29:21.020" style="s2">choice making which is we might call</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.170" end="00:29:24.830" style="s2">meaning your capacity to take perception</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.020" end="00:29:27.080" style="s2">and move that through into making good</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.830" end="00:29:30.230" style="s2">choices about what to do in the world so</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.080" end="00:29:32.360" style="s2">if I&#39;m like a camera that I can see in</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.230" end="00:29:34.790" style="s2">the sense that light can come in and it</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.360" end="00:29:36.290" style="s2">can be converted into something but if</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.790" end="00:29:38.150" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing else than just a camera</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.290" end="00:29:40.790" style="s2">there&#39;s no sense making there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.150" end="00:29:42.350" style="s2">meaning making happening at all and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.790" end="00:29:44.240" style="s2">degree to which I have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.350" end="00:29:45.740" style="s2">make meaning as many ways the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.240" end="00:29:47.660" style="s2">which I have the potential to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.740" end="00:29:49.429" style="s2">agency there&#39;s lots of variables there</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.660" end="00:29:51.140" style="s2">again there&#39;s questions have overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.429" end="00:29:53.179" style="s2">like a for example to say I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.140" end="00:29:55.190" style="s2">situation where somebody&#39;s coming at me</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.179" end="00:29:57.800" style="s2">and physically with a large threat of</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.190" end="00:29:59.450" style="s2">violence I&#39;m perceiving it but now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.800" end="00:30:00.320" style="s2">trying to make meaning out of it which</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.450" end="00:30:02.300" style="s2">is to say what do I do</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.320" end="00:30:04.220" style="s2">how do I respond to this if I get</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.300" end="00:30:06.200" style="s2">fight-or-flight if my adrenal system</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.220" end="00:30:09.230" style="s2">kicks off and it actually kicks me into</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.200" end="00:30:11.870" style="s2">overwhelm then I&#39;m actually decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.230" end="00:30:13.190" style="s2">my capacity to make good choices because</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.870" end="00:30:16.130" style="s2">the fight-or-flight response shifts me</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.190" end="00:30:17.840" style="s2">into a very narrow band of action or</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.130" end="00:30:19.220" style="s2">maybe I just have bad heuristics there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.840" end="00:30:20.390" style="s2">just you know I&#39;m perceiving some</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.220" end="00:30:22.460" style="s2">pattern in the world but I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.390" end="00:30:24.440" style="s2">how to make sense of that pattern so the</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.460" end="00:30:25.970" style="s2">signal is out there but I just can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.440" end="00:30:28.340" style="s2">anything with it and then the third</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.970" end="00:30:30.440" style="s2">dimension is your capacity to actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.340" end="00:30:32.510" style="s2">make effective action in the world so</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.440" end="00:30:35.540" style="s2">perhaps I have perceived the pattern I</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.510" end="00:30:37.340" style="s2">see that carbon dioxide and methane in</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.540" end="00:30:39.290" style="s2">the atmosphere is generated feedback</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.340" end="00:30:41.179" style="s2">instead of raising the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.290" end="00:30:43.370" style="s2">temperature and the acidification of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.179" end="00:30:45.440" style="s2">oceans and I perceive that that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.370" end="00:30:48.140" style="s2">to lead to catastrophic collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.440" end="00:30:49.940" style="s2">coral reefs but I don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.140" end="00:30:52.070" style="s2">capacity to respond to it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.940" end="00:30:52.890" style="s2">agency the problem is just too complex</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.070" end="00:30:55.410" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.890" end="00:30:57.690" style="s2">effective action is too limited or my</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.410" end="00:30:58.650" style="s2">ability you my power is too limited or</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.690" end="00:30:59.850" style="s2">my ability to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.650" end="00:31:02.640" style="s2">consequences of my actions is too</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.850" end="00:31:04.950" style="s2">limited the rate-limiting on action has</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.640" end="00:31:07.050" style="s2">to do with the scope of the problem in</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.950" end="00:31:09.060" style="s2">relationship to your power bang for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.050" end="00:31:10.560" style="s2">buck which is to say the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.060" end="00:31:12.920" style="s2">energy that it takes for you to deliver</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.560" end="00:31:15.840" style="s2">on some degree of effectiveness and</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.920" end="00:31:18.660" style="s2">unintended consequences the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.840" end="00:31:20.340" style="s2">which what you&#39;re doing generates more</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.660" end="00:31:22.860" style="s2">change in the world than your intended</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.340" end="00:31:24.210" style="s2">you know so if I think about like a pond</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.860" end="00:31:25.800" style="s2">I think many of us have run into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.210" end="00:31:27.600" style="s2">situation as a kid there&#39;s like a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.800" end="00:31:29.400" style="s2">very smooth pond then I can see through</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.600" end="00:31:31.230" style="s2">it it&#39;s perfectly clear and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.400" end="00:31:32.730" style="s2">grab something at the bottom of the pond</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.230" end="00:31:34.230" style="s2">but as I put my fingers into the water</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.730" end="00:31:35.280" style="s2">it creates ripples and makes it</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.230" end="00:31:36.990" style="s2">impossible for me to see</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.280" end="00:31:40.110" style="s2">so because I&#39;m interfering with my own</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.990" end="00:31:41.220" style="s2">environment my agency is preventing my</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.110" end="00:31:43.230" style="s2">ability to be effective so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.220" end="00:31:45.630" style="s2">consequences my inability to relate to</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.230" end="00:31:47.400" style="s2">the world and when it actually respond</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.630" end="00:31:49.500" style="s2">to the consequences of my own actions so</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.400" end="00:31:50.970" style="s2">every discreet sentient agent is going</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.500" end="00:31:52.860" style="s2">to have an envelope that takes all</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.970" end="00:31:54.420" style="s2">through these aspects into consideration</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.860" end="00:31:56.550" style="s2">and we&#39;ll call that envelope sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.420" end="00:31:59.100" style="s2">and so the more sovereign you are it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.550" end="00:32:02.460" style="s2">like a sphere the more capacity you have</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.100" end="00:32:04.680" style="s2">to perceive make meaning in and respond</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.460" end="00:32:06.690" style="s2">to the reality that you&#39;re living in and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.680" end="00:32:08.670" style="s2">a failure in any one of these three</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.690" end="00:32:11.070" style="s2">modalities will tend to disrupt your</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.670" end="00:32:12.450" style="s2">sovereignty or limit it in your</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.070" end="00:32:13.890" style="s2">environment and so what ends up</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.450" end="00:32:16.110" style="s2">happening is this thing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.890" end="00:32:17.630" style="s2">talking about this new frame of mind</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.110" end="00:32:21.810" style="s2">this new kind of collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.630" end="00:32:24.120" style="s2">is extremely sensitive to the actual</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.810" end="00:32:25.740" style="s2">sovereignty of the individual agents</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.120" end="00:32:27.870" style="s2">that compose it so then using this</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.740" end="00:32:29.550" style="s2">concept of sovereignty imagine right now</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.870" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">the three of us are attempting to enter</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.550" end="00:32:32.610" style="s2">into a form of communion meaning we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.440" end="00:32:34.950" style="s2">try to form a collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.610" end="00:32:37.410" style="s2">and that collective intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.950" end="00:32:39.690" style="s2">going to be bound by the sovereignty of</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.410" end="00:32:42.240" style="s2">each one of us meaning for example if</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.690" end="00:32:43.500" style="s2">the two of you have a private language</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.240" end="00:32:45.390" style="s2">which you probably do right you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.500" end="00:32:47.280" style="s2">deep relationship you&#39;re aware of each</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.390" end="00:32:49.560" style="s2">other&#39;s facial expressions body language</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.280" end="00:32:50.610" style="s2">tone of voice there&#39;s a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.560" end="00:32:52.860" style="s2">that are going to happen at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.610" end="00:32:55.140" style="s2">perception that I might not be able to</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.860" end="00:32:56.370" style="s2">perceive so you&#39;ll have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.140" end="00:32:57.990" style="s2">what&#39;s happening that I won&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.370" end="00:32:59.940" style="s2">access to because it&#39;s outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.990" end="00:33:01.860" style="s2">sphere of my sovereignty but let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.940" end="00:33:03.540" style="s2">for example I&#39;ve done a lot of work in</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.860" end="00:33:05.789" style="s2">practice and so I have a high degree of</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.540" end="00:33:07.679" style="s2">discernment around those kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.789" end="00:33:09.119" style="s2">I could just watch and listen even</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.679" end="00:33:11.340" style="s2">though I won&#39;t quite people to make</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.119" end="00:33:13.289" style="s2">sense of it I&#39;ll be able to build a</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.340" end="00:33:14.820" style="s2">vastly better sense of it than if I was</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.289" end="00:33:15.419" style="s2">you know I&#39;m a lower level of</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.820" end="00:33:17.549" style="s2">discernment</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.419" end="00:33:19.289" style="s2">well that&#39;s flip it around the say for</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.549" end="00:33:22.440" style="s2">example that we&#39;re engaging in something</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.289" end="00:33:24.330" style="s2">and I say something that triggers you</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.440" end="00:33:25.769" style="s2">emotionally meaning that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.330" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">something that happens in the verbal</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.769" end="00:33:30.570" style="s2">domain that a series of sounds that come</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:33.029" style="s2">out of my mouth you hear a process that</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.570" end="00:33:35.489" style="s2">simultaneously the way that you process</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.029" end="00:33:38.190" style="s2">things generates response in your body</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.489" end="00:33:40.049" style="s2">which is highly emotional and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.190" end="00:33:41.940" style="s2">emotional response actually pushes you</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.049" end="00:33:44.129" style="s2">to the point where you&#39;ve got an adrenal</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.940" end="00:33:46.739" style="s2">response and 1/4 of our response which</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.129" end="00:33:49.289" style="s2">then reduces your sovereignty so now</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.739" end="00:33:50.779" style="s2">we&#39;ve got two issues one issue is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.289" end="00:33:52.710" style="s2">level of sovereignty that you had</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.779" end="00:33:54.599" style="s2">initially wasn&#39;t adequate to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.710" end="00:33:56.220" style="s2">expression that I made meaning that it</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.599" end="00:33:58.320" style="s2">pushed you out of sovereignty and now</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.220" end="00:33:59.309" style="s2">secondarily your sovereignty is reduced</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.320" end="00:34:01.529" style="s2">by the state that you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.309" end="00:34:04.200" style="s2">so then what ends up happening is easy</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.529" end="00:34:06.029" style="s2">and I would then ideally have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.200" end="00:34:08.819" style="s2">perception to recognize that happened</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.029" end="00:34:11.669" style="s2">have a set of heuristics and actions to</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.819" end="00:34:13.319" style="s2">be able to hold and either help you</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.669" end="00:34:15.270" style="s2">process through that and get you back</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.319" end="00:34:17.190" style="s2">into sovereignty so our communion has</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.270" end="00:34:18.510" style="s2">integrity or recognize that that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.190" end="00:34:19.980" style="s2">not going to happen so we would just</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.510" end="00:34:21.629" style="s2">sort of step back and wait until you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.980" end="00:34:23.639" style="s2">kind of come back into integrity as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.629" end="00:34:24.210" style="s2">group and that&#39;s that&#39;s it I guess how</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.639" end="00:34:27.270" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.210" end="00:34:30.359" style="s2">is each discrete individual has to go</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.270" end="00:34:32.819" style="s2">through a process of really deep work on</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.359" end="00:34:34.889" style="s2">their own individual capacities show up</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.819" end="00:34:38.369" style="s2">in every dimension cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.889" end="00:34:40.230" style="s2">emotionally perceptually and exploring</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.369" end="00:34:41.819" style="s2">possible modalities of reality that our</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.230" end="00:34:43.470" style="s2">conventional models of reality don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.819" end="00:34:45.839" style="s2">give we don&#39;t have really good names for</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.470" end="00:34:48.329" style="s2">or we don&#39;t even think exist because we</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:50.669" style="s2">don&#39;t know and then secondarily learning</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.329" end="00:34:54.059" style="s2">then how to use that individual capacity</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.669" end="00:34:57.000" style="s2">to increasingly come into faster deeper</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.059" end="00:34:58.559" style="s2">and more coherent communion in groups</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.000" end="00:35:00.230" style="s2">and I should mention by the way that in</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.559" end="00:35:02.940" style="s2">the practices that we&#39;ve done so far</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.230" end="00:35:03.450" style="s2">every geometry is qualitatively</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.940" end="00:35:05.640" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.450" end="00:35:07.140" style="s2">so dyads are different than triads and</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.640" end="00:35:09.750" style="s2">triads of different than spores</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.140" end="00:35:12.150" style="s2">etc interesting yeah very interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.750" end="00:35:14.190" style="s2">wanted to rewind a little bit to what</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.150" end="00:35:16.290" style="s2">you said at the beginning can you talk a</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.190" end="00:35:17.730" style="s2">bit more about the global collapse that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.290" end="00:35:19.300" style="s2">we&#39;re going through right now and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.730" end="00:35:21.880" style="s2">war that you mentioned earlier</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.300" end="00:35:25.020" style="s2">sure so we put into a framework first</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.880" end="00:35:28.330" style="s2">and then talk about the pragmatics so</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.020" end="00:35:30.340" style="s2">the framework looks like this I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.330" end="00:35:33.070" style="s2">everybody alive who has any degree of</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.340" end="00:35:34.840" style="s2">self-awareness notices that you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.070" end="00:35:36.460" style="s2">sometimes they&#39;re at the top of their</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.840" end="00:35:39.280" style="s2">game and sometimes they&#39;re not you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.460" end="00:35:41.530" style="s2">if you&#39;ve been driving all night you had</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.280" end="00:35:43.390" style="s2">a bad choice for dinner you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.530" end="00:35:45.040" style="s2">slept you drink too much coffee your</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.390" end="00:35:46.750" style="s2">likelihood of doing things that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.040" end="00:35:48.190" style="s2">don&#39;t think are wise later is much</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.750" end="00:35:50.560" style="s2">higher than if you&#39;re well resourced</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.190" end="00:35:52.270" style="s2">right so of course that fact that that</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.560" end="00:35:54.370" style="s2">sort of metaphor is happening broadly</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.270" end="00:35:56.110" style="s2">all over the world every minute of every</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.370" end="00:35:58.590" style="s2">day and everybody&#39;s interactions with</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.110" end="00:36:01.120" style="s2">each other and with the world is</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.590" end="00:36:02.710" style="s2">increasingly pushing us into states</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.120" end="00:36:04.540" style="s2">where we&#39;re making worse and worse</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.710" end="00:36:06.640" style="s2">choices you know for example I have</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.540" end="00:36:09.400" style="s2">recently fully unplugged from social</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.640" end="00:36:12.100" style="s2">media because social media is almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.400" end="00:36:13.960" style="s2">completely toxic which is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.100" end="00:36:16.810" style="s2">when I go into any social media</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.960" end="00:36:18.700" style="s2">environment I find myself decreasing lis</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.810" end="00:36:20.590" style="s2">capable of making good choices and</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.700" end="00:36:24.070" style="s2">increasingly willing to make bad choices</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.590" end="00:36:25.750" style="s2">because it&#39;s as that effect now this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.070" end="00:36:27.340" style="s2">an interesting problem because we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.750" end="00:36:28.990" style="s2">billions of people who are now connected</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.340" end="00:36:30.460" style="s2">on social media and by the way don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.990" end="00:36:32.770" style="s2">just meet socially do you think also</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.460" end="00:36:34.660" style="s2">broadcast media you know if I read an</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.770" end="00:36:36.730" style="s2">article in The New York Times there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.660" end="00:36:38.560" style="s2">99% chance that I&#39;m worse off rather</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.730" end="00:36:39.850" style="s2">than better off books particularly old</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.560" end="00:36:41.590" style="s2">books by the way there&#39;s things that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.850" end="00:36:43.990" style="s2">can still rely on because they take so</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.590" end="00:36:46.210" style="s2">long to write and to read they have this</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.990" end="00:36:48.040" style="s2">cool concept called oh gosh what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.210" end="00:36:51.010" style="s2">word just my mind but the term has to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.040" end="00:36:53.260" style="s2">with a differential time element so</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.010" end="00:36:55.270" style="s2">books are slower than other things and</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.260" end="00:36:56.800" style="s2">so they&#39;ll actually present a different</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.270" end="00:36:59.110" style="s2">framework for sense making them things</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.800" end="00:37:00.580" style="s2">that happen in real time this is by the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.110" end="00:37:03.040" style="s2">way that&#39;s a good mechanism if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.580" end="00:37:04.720" style="s2">feeling really really demoralized unplug</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.040" end="00:37:07.780" style="s2">from real time information and plug into</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.720" end="00:37:09.580" style="s2">a great book from say the 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.780" end="00:37:11.980" style="s2">and that will actually help you build</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.580" end="00:37:13.180" style="s2">back up capacity all right so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.980" end="00:37:15.100" style="s2">so what&#39;s happening is this the</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.180" end="00:37:16.420" style="s2">mechanism by which we collaborate right</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.100" end="00:37:18.040" style="s2">now the tools and techniques by which</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.420" end="00:37:20.560" style="s2">our information flows our sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.040" end="00:37:24.340" style="s2">frameworks are really up and</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.560" end="00:37:26.050" style="s2">they&#39;re making us emotionally less</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.340" end="00:37:27.190" style="s2">capable of responding to reality and</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.050" end="00:37:29.470" style="s2">they&#39;re actually breaking down our</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.190" end="00:37:30.730" style="s2">cognitive capacity as well you just look</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.470" end="00:37:31.250" style="s2">at the choice making decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.730" end="00:37:34.520" style="s2">it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.250" end="00:37:36.560" style="s2">you guys are not in the u.s. so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.520" end="00:37:38.030" style="s2">know what&#39;s going on where you are no</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.560" end="00:37:39.890" style="s2">but I can tell you the United States is</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.030" end="00:37:41.240" style="s2">in the process of going insane in every</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.890" end="00:37:43.880" style="s2">direction I mean insane almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.240" end="00:37:45.590" style="s2">technical term meaning increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.880" end="00:37:47.720" style="s2">incapable to actually proceed and</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.590" end="00:37:50.450" style="s2">responded to reality and drop it in to</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.720" end="00:37:52.880" style="s2">lower and lower levels of pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.450" end="00:37:54.260" style="s2">sovereignty and just like in a family</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.880" end="00:37:55.970" style="s2">where everybody&#39;s getting tired and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.260" end="00:37:58.340" style="s2">cranky people start itching for a fight</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.970" end="00:37:59.690" style="s2">and when somebody starts pushing because</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.340" end="00:38:01.790" style="s2">they&#39;re just itching for a fight that</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.690" end="00:38:04.430" style="s2">just pushes other people and so which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.790" end="00:38:07.280" style="s2">kind of eating the seed corn of civility</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.430" end="00:38:08.870" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s one side other side reality</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.280" end="00:38:12.470" style="s2">is getting harder to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.870" end="00:38:14.480" style="s2">global financial system is now full</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.470" end="00:38:16.850" style="s2">decade into a completely delusional</p>

<p begin="00:38:21.050" end="00:38:25.550" style="s2">are now we&#39;re now deeply into the</p>

<p begin="00:38:36.230" end="00:38:39.170" style="s2">it but if you actually see what the</p>

<p begin="00:38:39.170" end="00:38:43.790" style="s2">Syria last year you can see the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.750" end="00:38:45.100" style="s2">immediate consequences of those effects</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.790" end="00:38:48.530" style="s2">and then that has a cascade effect</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.100" end="00:38:51.080" style="s2">tapping into the fact that all the most</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.530" end="00:38:52.790" style="s2">fragile nation-states the ones that have</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.080" end="00:38:55.520" style="s2">the highest degree of fragility and</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.790" end="00:38:58.520" style="s2">tension and lowest reserves are now</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.520" end="00:39:00.260" style="s2">beginning to fail and they externalize</p>

<p begin="00:39:02.020" end="00:39:05.840" style="s2">increasing in tension on the other</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.250" end="00:39:08.630" style="s2">environment so for example the flow of</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.840" end="00:39:10.520" style="s2">refugees out of Syria are now impacting</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.630" end="00:39:12.590" style="s2">say France and Italy which are</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.520" end="00:39:14.740" style="s2">themselves already going through like</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.590" end="00:39:17.990" style="s2">three different levels of challenge</p>

<p begin="00:39:26.960" end="00:39:31.130" style="s2">basically to district&#39; forces that are</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.120" end="00:39:34.250" style="s2">happening simultaneously on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.130" end="00:39:36.200" style="s2">our individual collective capacities to</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.250" end="00:39:38.150" style="s2">make good choices in the world are</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.200" end="00:39:39.860" style="s2">decreasing because the tools that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.150" end="00:39:41.570" style="s2">have are actually pushing us in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.860" end="00:39:44.090" style="s2">negative direction and on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.570" end="00:39:45.140" style="s2">the stuff we have to deal with is</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.090" end="00:39:48.049" style="s2">getting more</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.140" end="00:39:51.440" style="s2">more present and more and more urgent</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.049" end="00:39:53.299" style="s2">and more and more intense so this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.440" end="00:39:55.640" style="s2">going to lead us into a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.299" end="00:39:58.010" style="s2">we&#39;re going to make extremely bad</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.640" end="00:40:00.829" style="s2">choices because we&#39;re using bad jurist</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.010" end="00:40:01.910" style="s2">excel give you a concrete example by the</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.829" end="00:40:03.680" style="s2">way this is not just a purely</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.910" end="00:40:05.779" style="s2">theoretical example the United States</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.680" end="00:40:09.829" style="s2">right now is in a classic scenario where</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.779" end="00:40:11.539" style="s2">good strategies from the past thousand</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.829" end="00:40:15.079" style="s2">years would say that we&#39;re facing a</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.539" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">choice between significant civil unrest</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.079" end="00:40:18.920" style="s2">which in principle could very easily</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.880" end="00:40:20.210" style="s2">transition to some kind of civil war</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.920" end="00:40:21.740" style="s2">although we don&#39;t know exactly what that</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.210" end="00:40:23.210" style="s2">would look like you know things don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.740" end="00:40:25.880" style="s2">ever look the same over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.210" end="00:40:28.250" style="s2">but very significant civil unrest which</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.880" end="00:40:30.109" style="s2">traditionally the Machiavellian response</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.250" end="00:40:33.410" style="s2">to that is pick some sort of other</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.109" end="00:40:35.150" style="s2">outside of adequate threat pick a fight</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.410" end="00:40:36.890" style="s2">with them so as to generate coherence</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.150" end="00:40:40.130" style="s2">internally we&#39;re all familiar with that</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.890" end="00:40:41.839" style="s2">basic approach right so if I&#39;m sitting</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.130" end="00:40:43.789" style="s2">in charge of maintaining the integrity</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.839" end="00:40:46.940" style="s2">of the United States and I watch it</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.789" end="00:40:49.190" style="s2">begins to fall apart into civil unrest</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.940" end="00:40:50.720" style="s2">and increasing the acceleration towards</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.190" end="00:40:53.779" style="s2">something which smacks a lot like civil</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.720" end="00:40:55.519" style="s2">war I might choose to say okay I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.779" end="00:40:56.839" style="s2">pick a fight with somebody and adequate</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.519" end="00:40:58.490" style="s2">threat I don&#39;t think North Korea is</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.839" end="00:41:00.890" style="s2">enough that would cause the people</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.490" end="00:41:02.690" style="s2">inside to say oh boy this is a real</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.890" end="00:41:05.690" style="s2">we have to put our differences to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.690" end="00:41:06.859" style="s2">side and rally around the flag so as to</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.690" end="00:41:08.690" style="s2">protect ourselves from the external</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.859" end="00:41:11.599" style="s2">threat or at least give me the ability</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.690" end="00:41:13.910" style="s2">to impose the level of internal</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.599" end="00:41:16.970" style="s2">discipline sometimes there&#39;s martial law</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.910" end="00:41:18.650" style="s2">to just quash civils dissent internally</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.970" end="00:41:20.539" style="s2">now that playbook has been played from</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.650" end="00:41:21.650" style="s2">for thousands of years I&#39;m not making</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.539" end="00:41:22.609" style="s2">that up and it&#39;s not magic</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.650" end="00:41:24.049" style="s2">lots of a lots and lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.609" end="00:41:26.359" style="s2">understand that but intuitively and</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.049" end="00:41:30.140" style="s2">consciously so one the fact that that</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.359" end="00:41:32.180" style="s2">tells us that it&#39;s likely to occur - I</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.140" end="00:41:34.130" style="s2">happen to know that that come of those</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.180" end="00:41:35.869" style="s2">conversations are being had but then</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.130" end="00:41:38.150" style="s2">three excuse to sneaky part that</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.869" end="00:41:40.339" style="s2">playbook is no longer valid the set of</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.150" end="00:41:42.470" style="s2">tools that worked even all the way up</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.339" end="00:41:44.059" style="s2">into the late 20th century no longer</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.470" end="00:41:45.289" style="s2">apply in our contemporary environment so</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.059" end="00:41:46.730" style="s2">this loops us all the way back to the</p>

<p begin="00:41:48.470" end="00:41:52.640" style="s2">nation-states I&#39;ve got a sense making</p>

<p begin="00:41:52.640" end="00:41:55.700" style="s2">I just mentioned that unfortunately are</p>

<p begin="00:42:05.320" end="00:42:09.680" style="s2">increasingly bad choices and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.820" end="00:42:11.690" style="s2">becoming increasingly confused as to why</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:14.450" style="s2">they&#39;re bad choices which means then I</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.690" end="00:42:16.400" style="s2">have a choice either I double down I</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.450" end="00:42:18.170" style="s2">commit myself to my sense-making model</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.400" end="00:42:21.440" style="s2">and assume that my confusion is bad</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.170" end="00:42:23.540" style="s2">signal or I accept the fact that I don&#39;t</p>
