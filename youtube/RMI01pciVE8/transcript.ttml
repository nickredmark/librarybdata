<p begin="00:00:44.489" end="00:00:50.399" style="s2">been on my mind this morning is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.180" end="00:00:52.530" style="s2">the interface between subjective and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.399" end="00:00:54.930" style="s2">objective in terms of contemplating</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.530" end="00:00:56.430" style="s2">beauty what&#39;s the role of projection in</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.930" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">there because when we make a mental</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.430" end="00:01:02.070" style="s2">image of the philosopher or practitioner</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.520" end="00:01:04.530" style="s2">contemplating the beautiful and all of</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.070" end="00:01:07.740" style="s2">the positive effects that might have on</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.530" end="00:01:11.310" style="s2">a person we tend to think of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.740" end="00:01:13.920" style="s2">contemplate ER and the beautiful right</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.310" end="00:01:15.659" style="s2">but a lot of its got to be like a jet</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.920" end="00:01:17.189" style="s2">fighter pilot that the targeting</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.659" end="00:01:21.150" style="s2">indicators are on the screen of his</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.189" end="00:01:23.460" style="s2">Medic so I agree is the beauty something</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.150" end="00:01:26.880" style="s2">that we&#39;re sending around and putting on</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.460" end="00:01:29.430" style="s2">top of the perceptual target and to what</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.880" end="00:01:31.470" style="s2">degree is it&#39;s better or even more</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.430" end="00:01:34.710" style="s2">practical to think of it as being out</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.470" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">there mmm okay that&#39;s really really good</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.710" end="00:01:43.710" style="s2">question I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen any</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:45.780" style="s2">logos I had with their new Sweeney Oh</p>

<p begin="00:01:49.890" end="00:02:00.960" style="s2">that but we just haven&#39;t got it set up</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.420" end="00:02:02.700" style="s2">yet okay and so because it&#39;s I it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.960" end="00:02:05.399" style="s2">and more at the core of the whole deal</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.700" end="00:02:09.020" style="s2">logos dialectic project because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.399" end="00:02:12.050" style="s2">something about the unification of logos</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.020" end="00:02:14.030" style="s2">and and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.050" end="00:02:16.970" style="s2">and the beautification of a way of life</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.030" end="00:02:20.330" style="s2">there in that is central to dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.970" end="00:02:25.180" style="s2">practice and so yeah this has been a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.330" end="00:02:28.880" style="s2">really important concern for me so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.180" end="00:02:32.180" style="s2">wanna I wanna I want to maybe let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.880" end="00:02:36.860" style="s2">a couple steps initial steps and</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.180" end="00:02:39.680" style="s2">thinking about this question and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.860" end="00:02:41.540" style="s2">move to people that have recently had a</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.680" end="00:02:44.750" style="s2">huge influence on my thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.540" end="00:02:46.220" style="s2">beauty are Ellen&#39;s Gary&#39;s book beauty</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.750" end="00:02:52.790" style="s2">and Wyatt prepares us for truth and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.220" end="00:02:55.580" style="s2">justice and and then the work by Han his</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.790" end="00:02:59.050" style="s2">book saving Beauty let&#39;s start with mine</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.580" end="00:03:01.400" style="s2">because that to me that was really</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.050" end="00:03:03.740" style="s2">interesting because it resonated with</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.400" end="00:03:07.850" style="s2">his work on time and his work on arrows</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.740" end="00:03:13.940" style="s2">also being for tronic themes that really</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.850" end="00:03:17.270" style="s2">really really really talking to so he</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.940" end="00:03:18.800" style="s2">talked about he talked about the how and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.270" end="00:03:20.870" style="s2">we why do you think let&#39;s put it this</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.800" end="00:03:23.540" style="s2">why do we need to save you he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.870" end="00:03:25.100" style="s2">beauty is being Ross which already means</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.540" end="00:03:27.950" style="s2">he&#39;s thinking he&#39;s thinking there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.100" end="00:03:30.100" style="s2">something objective to beauty right</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.950" end="00:03:33.230" style="s2">there he thinks the beauty of being lost</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.100" end="00:03:37.090" style="s2">because we are reducing it when he calls</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.230" end="00:03:40.580" style="s2">the aesthetics of the smooth that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.090" end="00:03:42.830" style="s2">we&#39;re assimilating beauty to what is you</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.580" end="00:03:45.290" style="s2">know what is smooth and he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.830" end="00:03:47.330" style="s2">all these works of art now I think he</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.290" end="00:03:49.700" style="s2">gets a little bit too extreme but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.330" end="00:03:51.440" style="s2">that&#39;s he&#39;s wantin his style because I</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.700" end="00:03:54.800" style="s2">do think there&#39;s an element of genuine</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.440" end="00:03:56.420" style="s2">aesthetics to smooth things when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.800" end="00:03:59.900" style="s2">doing the form I want the form to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.420" end="00:04:02.870" style="s2">smooth that&#39;s okay but I take his point</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.900" end="00:04:05.300" style="s2">to be this what he dislikes about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.870" end="00:04:08.630" style="s2">aesthetics of the smooth is it removes</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.300" end="00:04:10.970" style="s2">what he seems to what he argues is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.630" end="00:04:13.250" style="s2">central feature of beauty which points</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.970" end="00:04:14.780" style="s2">directly to your question which and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.250" end="00:04:17.359" style="s2">that&#39;s it the central feature of beauty</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.780" end="00:04:19.160" style="s2">that he is pointing to is degree to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.359" end="00:04:21.229" style="s2">which it transcend our capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.160" end="00:04:24.620" style="s2">assimilation the degree to which we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.229" end="00:04:25.639" style="s2">struck by beauty as we used to say a</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.620" end="00:04:27.949" style="s2">while ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.639" end="00:04:33.379" style="s2">and he brings out that connects up with</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.949" end="00:04:35.419" style="s2">his idea that genuine arrows is right is</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.379" end="00:04:38.060" style="s2">to confront something other than oneself</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.419" end="00:04:40.159" style="s2">to be drawn to and if you&#39;re only if</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.060" end="00:04:43.610" style="s2">you&#39;re only doing a roast in an</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.159" end="00:04:46.310" style="s2">assimilation fashion you&#39;ve reduced</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.610" end="00:04:49.430" style="s2">Airrosti consumption and you know Plato</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.310" end="00:04:52.639" style="s2">talks about the correct response to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.430" end="00:04:54.979" style="s2">beauty is generative not consumptive you</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.639" end="00:04:57.740" style="s2">want to as twit Plato says you want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.979" end="00:04:59.900" style="s2">in the symposium you want to generate</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.740" end="00:05:02.569" style="s2">beautiful things in beauty like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.900" end="00:05:06.740" style="s2">response to beauty is you want to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.569" end="00:05:08.900" style="s2">any he directly you know analogizes it</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.740" end="00:05:10.610" style="s2">to sexual reproduction you want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.900" end="00:05:11.900" style="s2">reproduce beauty you want to gyp you</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.610" end="00:05:14.210" style="s2">want to be this generative thing you</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.900" end="00:05:16.819" style="s2">want I am pregnant by it you want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.210" end="00:05:19.819" style="s2">conceive and give birth to it and so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.819" end="00:05:23.539" style="s2">think that that&#39;s one thing I want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.819" end="00:05:26.659" style="s2">throw out there that that there that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.539" end="00:05:31.279" style="s2">might be able to look not in the content</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.659" end="00:05:35.060" style="s2">of beauty for the objective but degree</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.279" end="00:05:40.250" style="s2">to which we are struck by what we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.060" end="00:05:42.889" style="s2">assimilate and that therefore beauty</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.250" end="00:05:45.979" style="s2">would be on a continuum with Wonder and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.889" end="00:05:48.830" style="s2">awe but also before and when and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.979" end="00:05:51.979" style="s2">might want to explore the strange family</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.830" end="00:05:55.189" style="s2">relationship between horror and beauty</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.979" end="00:05:57.319" style="s2">and why there&#39;s an aesthetic of work for</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.189" end="00:06:00.080" style="s2">people that&#39;s which has always been</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.319" end="00:06:02.419" style="s2">deeply perplexing to me sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.080" end="00:06:04.819" style="s2">philosophically so that&#39;s one and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.419" end="00:06:07.279" style="s2">this I find very convergent also</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.819" end="00:06:13.430" style="s2">platonically with Ellen scary argument</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.279" end="00:06:14.899" style="s2">that what pewdie does for us if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.430" end="00:06:16.789" style="s2">allow me I&#39;ll use a little bit of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.899" end="00:06:20.389" style="s2">language I&#39;ve been trying to coined a</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.789" end="00:06:22.729" style="s2">phenomenological language but I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.389" end="00:06:24.529" style="s2">this is very consonant with Sochi that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.729" end="00:06:26.870" style="s2">about when you see if you see a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.529" end="00:06:29.360" style="s2">beautiful cheese and your example right</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.870" end="00:06:31.399" style="s2">and you&#39;re struck by it first of all she</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.360" end="00:06:34.190" style="s2">has what on is talk to you but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.399" end="00:06:35.690" style="s2">struck by it and then she points out two</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.190" end="00:06:37.550" style="s2">things which are really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.690" end="00:06:39.020" style="s2">there&#39;s what I would call there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.550" end="00:06:42.710" style="s2">experience of the morning</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.020" end="00:06:44.900" style="s2">that&#39;s the part I didn&#39;t know please</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.710" end="00:06:48.440" style="s2">could be like this right there&#39;s the ah</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.900" end="00:06:52.040" style="s2">right so there&#39;s the mortise and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.440" end="00:06:55.250" style="s2">but there&#39;s also there&#39;s the unique</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.040" end="00:06:58.550" style="s2">unrepeatable &#39;ti about this three like</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.250" end="00:07:01.310" style="s2">you get how it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s unlike all</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.550" end="00:07:02.900" style="s2">the other bits right it will show you</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.310" end="00:07:05.090" style="s2">what any tree could be but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.900" end="00:07:07.250" style="s2">unlike any tree you&#39;ve seen before it</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.090" end="00:07:11.270" style="s2">has its own particular specialist it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.250" end="00:07:16.670" style="s2">non categorical unique presencing and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.270" end="00:07:19.430" style="s2">right and she she argues that beauty</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.670" end="00:07:21.080" style="s2">therefore is training and she needs if i</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.430" end="00:07:24.290" style="s2">think it&#39;s a deep sense like the dojo</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.080" end="00:07:26.810" style="s2">askesis spiritual practices is training</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.290" end="00:07:29.210" style="s2">for truth because if we can&#39;t if we</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.810" end="00:07:34.100" style="s2">don&#39;t have a capacity to be struck by</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.210" end="00:07:36.740" style="s2">what is more right there the mystery of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.100" end="00:07:38.450" style="s2">participation and also yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.740" end="00:07:39.730" style="s2">that sensibility transcendence speaking</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.450" end="00:07:42.980" style="s2">up on what is unique and unrepeatable</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.730" end="00:07:44.780" style="s2">here now right which is this would be I</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.980" end="00:07:48.380" style="s2">would argue disappear and then from</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.780" end="00:07:50.840" style="s2">ESA&#39;s parts of wisdom right she argues</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.380" end="00:07:54.620" style="s2">that we can&#39;t genuinely preserve pursue</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.840" end="00:07:57.500" style="s2">either truth as an epistemic value or</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.620" end="00:08:00.290" style="s2">justice as a social value because she</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.500" end="00:08:02.600" style="s2">seems truth as that which is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.290" end="00:08:04.880" style="s2">take us in for the more but also bring</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.600" end="00:08:06.980" style="s2">it into what is contextually most</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.880" end="00:08:09.500" style="s2">relevant now and I think that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.980" end="00:08:12.440" style="s2">important and she&#39;s just this is always</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.500" end="00:08:15.350" style="s2">trying to there&#39;s much more to humanity</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.440" end="00:08:17.960" style="s2">but there&#39;s also something special and</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.350" end="00:08:20.420" style="s2">unique about this person right here</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.960" end="00:08:23.360" style="s2">right now so she argues that beauty</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.420" end="00:08:25.580" style="s2">prepares us for truth adjusted so what</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.360" end="00:08:28.550" style="s2">I&#39;m arguing for I guess I guess I make</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.580" end="00:08:32.230" style="s2">the argument is that I think there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.550" end="00:08:34.670" style="s2">something I don&#39;t know it&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.230" end="00:08:37.700" style="s2">object it but at least ran detective</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.670" end="00:08:41.060" style="s2">because I think she&#39;s arguing that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.700" end="00:08:43.520" style="s2">beauty the degree to which we pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.060" end="00:08:44.300" style="s2">what Han talked about about its Cressida</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.520" end="00:08:48.200" style="s2">striker</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.300" end="00:08:50.690" style="s2">Beauty is an affordance a nasties that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.200" end="00:08:52.730" style="s2">the training affordance for truth and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.690" end="00:08:54.470" style="s2">justice so that&#39;s my line</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.730" end="00:08:57.080" style="s2">that&#39;s how I&#39;m thinking of you need a</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.470" end="00:08:58.850" style="s2">lot these days so there&#39;s a lot to give</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.080" end="00:09:02.210" style="s2">you but I know you&#39;ll do a lot with it</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.850" end="00:09:06.230" style="s2">sure I mean I agree very much with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.210" end="00:09:09.560" style="s2">sort of the need to think beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.230" end="00:09:11.630" style="s2">having an excessive dimension yeah both</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.560" end="00:09:13.460" style="s2">in its positive in its negative sense I</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.630" end="00:09:15.470" style="s2">think the idea of dark beauty is an</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.460" end="00:09:18.590" style="s2">interesting one and the beauty or pick</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.470" end="00:09:21.290" style="s2">up on and it also reminds me of just the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.590" end="00:09:23.780" style="s2">uncanny beautiful in general yeah what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.290" end="00:09:26.120" style="s2">that quote from Andre Breton and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.780" end="00:09:27.830" style="s2">surrealist that I think Breton</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.120" end="00:09:30.620" style="s2">said quoting someone else that Beauty</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.830" end="00:09:32.330" style="s2">had to be like the chance meeting of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.620" end="00:09:36.800" style="s2">sewing machine and an umbrella on a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.330" end="00:09:38.420" style="s2">dissecting table uncanny juxtaposition</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.800" end="00:09:40.910" style="s2">to give it the vividness they&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.420" end="00:09:45.170" style="s2">for to get the sense of hyper conscious</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.910" end="00:09:48.050" style="s2">beauty yeah so that element of excess</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.170" end="00:09:50.900" style="s2">vividness with it I think is important</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.050" end="00:09:54.080" style="s2">and I think we&#39;ve traditionally used the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.900" end="00:09:56.180" style="s2">idea that it&#39;s out there beyond us too</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.080" end="00:10:00.560" style="s2">as a way of conceptualizing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.180" end="00:10:02.780" style="s2">mourneth yes but I think we can probably</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.560" end="00:10:04.850" style="s2">get that more nests by looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.780" end="00:10:06.290" style="s2">way our parts come together to create</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.850" end="00:10:09.800" style="s2">something that&#39;s greater than our</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.290" end="00:10:13.040" style="s2">current homeostatic self experience sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.800" end="00:10:16.100" style="s2">right like if I let&#39;s imagine I have all</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:18.080" style="s2">these subjective intelligence systems</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.100" end="00:10:21.050" style="s2">that make me up and if enough of them</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.080" end="00:10:23.900" style="s2">were to come together and be reflected</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.050" end="00:10:26.330" style="s2">back to me it would be more than my</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.900" end="00:10:28.580" style="s2">current self awareness and self image</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.330" end="00:10:30.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t produce it from</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.580" end="00:10:33.110" style="s2">the inside there put it on the screen</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.320" end="00:10:35.090" style="s2">now we could still imagine that it&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.110" end="00:10:38.060" style="s2">there may have extreme heuristic value</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.090" end="00:10:40.520" style="s2">to imagine that it&#39;s beyond us and there</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.060" end="00:10:43.370" style="s2">may be I think a number of things in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.520" end="00:10:45.200" style="s2">you know ontology of the computations</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.370" end="00:10:47.510" style="s2">that make up reality that predispose</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.200" end="00:10:51.080" style="s2">certain things to being easier to</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.510" end="00:10:54.170" style="s2">project beauty upon but I I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.080" end="00:10:57.080" style="s2">that we lose the more nests and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.170" end="00:10:59.540" style="s2">sacred other nests</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.080" end="00:11:02.090" style="s2">that we get from Beauty by imagining</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.540" end="00:11:04.700" style="s2">that a lot of the mechanism is</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.090" end="00:11:06.259" style="s2">generative from within us by creating a</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.700" end="00:11:09.529" style="s2">more than the sum of the parts</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.259" end="00:11:12.889" style="s2">effect of the systems that we have okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.529" end="00:11:14.839" style="s2">so I like that it sounds neat and if</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.889" end="00:11:17.389" style="s2">this is wrong interject that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.839" end="00:11:20.540" style="s2">proposing no dynamical complexification</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.389" end="00:11:23.389" style="s2">that produces an emergent function so</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.540" end="00:11:25.249" style="s2">then I respond to that would be again</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.389" end="00:11:27.709" style="s2">that sounds transactive rather than</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.249" end="00:11:29.949" style="s2">subjective to me because a function only</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.709" end="00:11:32.209" style="s2">exists in so far as it can function</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.949" end="00:11:35.449" style="s2">right so it has to couple to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.209" end="00:11:36.769" style="s2">environment in some way right and</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.449" end="00:11:40.759" style="s2">because if it doesn&#39;t couple to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.769" end="00:11:42.439" style="s2">environment it may not function or in</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.759" end="00:11:47.029" style="s2">fact I don&#39;t know what what it would</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.439" end="00:11:49.339" style="s2">mean to say that it&#39;s a function so let</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.029" end="00:11:52.850" style="s2">me let me make sure that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.339" end="00:11:56.239" style="s2">understanding you you don&#39;t want to sit</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.850" end="00:12:01.999" style="s2">like so I&#39;ve been playing with this term</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.239" end="00:12:04.069" style="s2">a lot Kerri has invested in the B but he</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.999" end="00:12:05.720" style="s2">calls the inventio of the inner self</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.069" end="00:12:08.089" style="s2">because the Latin word means both</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.720" end="00:12:09.350" style="s2">discovery and adventure which which</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.089" end="00:12:11.689" style="s2">relief works</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.350" end="00:12:16.249" style="s2">the dichotomy we&#39;re addressing here</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.689" end="00:12:18.769" style="s2">right now so I tend to think and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.249" end="00:12:22.249" style="s2">come up in the discussion of beauty as</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.769" end="00:12:24.350" style="s2">an event here right that it&#39;s both in</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.249" end="00:12:27.230" style="s2">the sense it&#39;s something that our</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.350" end="00:12:30.949" style="s2">psyches are inventing but then that</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.230" end="00:12:32.869" style="s2">invention genuine discloses something</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.949" end="00:12:35.779" style="s2">real about the world to us it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.869" end="00:12:38.059" style="s2">discovery that&#39;s what I get in inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.779" end="00:12:39.259" style="s2">that there must be something we like</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.059" end="00:12:42.230" style="s2">there must be something in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.259" end="00:12:44.839" style="s2">functioning that is disclosing something</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.230" end="00:12:48.429" style="s2">now about the world such that it makes</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.839" end="00:12:51.230" style="s2">the training for truth and justice a</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.429" end="00:12:54.169" style="s2">real training a real functionality</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.230" end="00:12:57.109" style="s2">that&#39;s what I said yeah I would assume</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.169" end="00:12:58.730" style="s2">that like if we imagine a situation in</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.109" end="00:13:01.249" style="s2">which the majority of this effect is</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.730" end="00:13:03.919" style="s2">produced from in US but it&#39;s produced in</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.249" end="00:13:06.559" style="s2">relationship to the actual patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.919" end="00:13:08.329" style="s2">the actual universe some of which make</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.559" end="00:13:11.059" style="s2">that more available to us than others</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.329" end="00:13:12.799" style="s2">that we&#39;ve developed this capacity</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.059" end="00:13:14.869" style="s2">because it&#39;s a very general capacity</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.799" end="00:13:16.850" style="s2">right it&#39;s one way of saying that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.869" end="00:13:19.159" style="s2">that it trains us for the other values</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.850" end="00:13:19.850" style="s2">yeah yeah no we can say it&#39;s among the</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.159" end="00:13:21.500" style="s2">other value</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.850" end="00:13:24.440" style="s2">we could say it&#39;s at the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.500" end="00:13:26.540" style="s2">cognition itself because like in some of</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.440" end="00:13:29.389" style="s2">the eastern trainings just to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.540" end="00:13:31.819" style="s2">anything has an element of perfection to</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.389" end="00:13:34.639" style="s2">it yes so it&#39;s an extremely general</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.819" end="00:13:36.319" style="s2">capacity that we&#39;ve evolved and if we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.639" end="00:13:39.500" style="s2">evolved that we&#39;ve evolved it in an</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.319" end="00:13:41.420" style="s2">adaptive fashion to environments so that</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.500" end="00:13:44.449" style="s2">it&#39;s one thing to think about what our</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.420" end="00:13:47.269" style="s2">role is in creating the effect the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.449" end="00:13:50.300" style="s2">aesthetic effect through a coordination</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.269" end="00:13:53.019" style="s2">of stimulations that feedback to us but</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.300" end="00:13:54.980" style="s2">that process is embedded within a</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.019" end="00:13:57.079" style="s2">relationship to the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.980" end="00:13:59.870" style="s2">universe&#39;s patterns as well and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.079" end="00:14:02.209" style="s2">been predisposed to it over billions of</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.870" end="00:14:04.420" style="s2">years of training to be able to take</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.209" end="00:14:08.000" style="s2">advantage of that mechanism because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.420" end="00:14:09.829" style="s2">adaptive an ongoing fashion so that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.000" end="00:14:14.560" style="s2">think that&#39;s yeah I think that&#39;s right I</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.829" end="00:14:16.910" style="s2">think that some more speculatively now</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.560" end="00:14:21.290" style="s2">we&#39;re already being speculative but even</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.910" end="00:14:23.089" style="s2">more so you know I think beauty is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.290" end="00:14:26.899" style="s2">way in which we train relevance</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.089" end="00:14:30.199" style="s2">realization better holding in on what is</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.899" end="00:14:32.000" style="s2">just or what is good or what is true</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.199" end="00:14:35.209" style="s2">it&#39;s I think it&#39;s how we get it more</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:37.639" style="s2">normatively oriented at frame and so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.209" end="00:14:40.720" style="s2">think it has I think it&#39;s exactly doubt</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.639" end="00:14:43.189" style="s2">of our capacity for all the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.720" end="00:14:44.899" style="s2">sensory motor and cognitive optimal</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.189" end="00:14:47.720" style="s2">gripping that we&#39;re always doing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.899" end="00:14:49.759" style="s2">why me generally will talk about dogs as</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.720" end="00:14:52.250" style="s2">opposed to cocker spaniels or mammals</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.759" end="00:14:54.649" style="s2">right because that&#39;s sort of an optimal</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.250" end="00:14:57.019" style="s2">grip for interacting with those animals</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.649" end="00:14:58.670" style="s2">given our general context it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.019" end="00:15:00.380" style="s2">enough differences we&#39;ve got enough of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.670" end="00:15:03.410" style="s2">the relevant differences enough of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.380" end="00:15:08.029" style="s2">relevant similarities right and and so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.410" end="00:15:09.709" style="s2">think of beauty as a realization very</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.029" end="00:15:11.949" style="s2">much like insight that&#39;s why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.709" end="00:15:14.269" style="s2">struck by beauty I think of it as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.949" end="00:15:17.839" style="s2">restructuring and realization of</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.269" end="00:15:19.880" style="s2">precognition of optimal gripping so that</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.839" end="00:15:23.660" style="s2">it&#39;s oh wait I&#39;m optimally gripping</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.880" end="00:15:26.509" style="s2">better than I was before the world and</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.660" end="00:15:30.680" style="s2">so when so when I&#39;m thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.509" end="00:15:33.379" style="s2">more in cognitive sciences that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.680" end="00:15:35.389" style="s2">like that&#39;s how I see it</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.379" end="00:15:39.099" style="s2">and that&#39;s of course it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.389" end="00:15:41.419" style="s2">tremendously adaptive and valuable to us</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.099" end="00:15:45.019" style="s2">does that resonate with what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.419" end="00:15:50.199" style="s2">saying it does and it leads me to a kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.019" end="00:15:52.789" style="s2">of question about what is the utility or</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.199" end="00:15:56.509" style="s2">significance of practices that lead</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.789" end="00:15:59.839" style="s2">people to have a very diverse experience</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.509" end="00:16:02.949" style="s2">of optimal gripping in a basic sense and</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.839" end="00:16:05.989" style="s2">what I mean by that is suppose I</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.949" end="00:16:08.359" style="s2">underwent a quasi Buddhist training</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.989" end="00:16:11.829" style="s2">which allowed me to get better and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.359" end="00:16:13.999" style="s2">better at seeing the beauty in any</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.829" end="00:16:16.639" style="s2">perceptual moment in any act of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.999" end="00:16:19.639" style="s2">cognition I&#39;m observing and reflecting</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.639" end="00:16:22.669" style="s2">upon the fact that any cognitive moment</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.639" end="00:16:25.149" style="s2">is successful I&#39;m accomplishing optimal</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.669" end="00:16:29.779" style="s2">gripping just by seeing something yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.149" end="00:16:31.789" style="s2">so now am i I&#39;ve made it super normative</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.779" end="00:16:33.649" style="s2">my experience of optimal gripping</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.789" end="00:16:37.579" style="s2">because I&#39;m doing it on everything</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.649" end="00:16:40.220" style="s2">that&#39;s coming up is this a superior</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.579" end="00:16:42.379" style="s2">state in which I&#39;m super adapted to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.220" end="00:16:45.079" style="s2">able to perform this function or have I</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.379" end="00:16:47.029" style="s2">settled for the least possible value</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.079" end="00:16:50.589" style="s2">have I become hooked on the most basic</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.029" end="00:16:52.999" style="s2">form and I&#39;ve gone into a cul-de-sac</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.589" end="00:16:55.399" style="s2">well it doesn&#39;t it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.999" end="00:16:58.970" style="s2">that&#39;s a bifurcation point in</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.399" end="00:17:00.619" style="s2">development because I could see and</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.970" end="00:17:02.929" style="s2">because the Buddha definitely warns</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.619" end="00:17:04.240" style="s2">about the second he warns you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.929" end="00:17:06.289" style="s2">sort of the contentedness</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.240" end="00:17:11.110" style="s2">something like the contentedness of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.289" end="00:17:14.209" style="s2">cabbage right it&#39;s not a sense of oh no</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.110" end="00:17:18.439" style="s2">so but I think other traditions have</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.209" end="00:17:21.259" style="s2">recognized the possibility but so but</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.439" end="00:17:23.389" style="s2">there&#39;s also the opposite affordances</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.259" end="00:17:26.569" style="s2">there because I can see the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.389" end="00:17:29.210" style="s2">deep learning I can see by running like</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.569" end="00:17:32.210" style="s2">really intensifying all the variations</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.210" end="00:17:34.610" style="s2">of the optimal gripping diversify that</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.210" end="00:17:37.669" style="s2">differentiated right that by</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.610" end="00:17:39.620" style="s2">differentiating it in this and this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.669" end="00:17:42.379" style="s2">not a contradiction in a very integrated</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.620" end="00:17:44.269" style="s2">practice could afford the opposite where</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.379" end="00:17:46.610" style="s2">I get you know a very comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.269" end="00:17:48.799" style="s2">install and I grasp</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.610" end="00:17:51.080" style="s2">deeper invariant principles that</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.799" end="00:17:52.730" style="s2">generalize much more powerfully this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.080" end="00:17:54.230" style="s2">what you do in deep learning right you</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.730" end="00:17:55.700" style="s2">run the variations and they give you the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.230" end="00:17:58.490" style="s2">compression and you read the variation</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.700" end="00:18:01.730" style="s2">right then I can see that affording a</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.490" end="00:18:04.940" style="s2">deep learning that again we colonizes</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.730" end="00:18:07.250" style="s2">does a that provides like just an</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.940" end="00:18:10.040" style="s2">insight about this flower or this cable</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.250" end="00:18:13.010" style="s2">but an insight into being by the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.040" end="00:18:14.600" style="s2">systemic incited to be optimal optimal</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.010" end="00:18:17.450" style="s2">grip and why I think that&#39;s relevant is</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.600" end="00:18:21.980" style="s2">because I&#39;ve argued in the series that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.450" end="00:18:24.140" style="s2">think one of the features of these hires</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.980" end="00:18:26.600" style="s2">needs of consciousness our people are</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.140" end="00:18:29.090" style="s2">getting into a kind of flow state with</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.600" end="00:18:30.770" style="s2">this sort of meta optimal gripping but</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.090" end="00:18:32.990" style="s2">optimal grip on this and this much</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.770" end="00:18:34.340" style="s2">optimal grip in per se you&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.990" end="00:18:36.860" style="s2">that&#39;s what because they get this</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.340" end="00:18:39.980" style="s2">intense and if this is where this is AG</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.860" end="00:18:42.049" style="s2">and we&#39;re sorry comes in the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.980" end="00:18:46.429" style="s2">leads into it an intense sense of</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.049" end="00:18:48.500" style="s2">realness at the same time and and so for</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.429" end="00:18:50.390" style="s2">me the way I&#39;ve tried to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.500" end="00:18:52.070" style="s2">is okay you can&#39;t understand it in terms</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.390" end="00:18:53.419" style="s2">of the content they produce the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.070" end="00:18:54.679" style="s2">propositions because they&#39;re all over</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.419" end="00:18:59.000" style="s2">the place and they contradict each other</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.679" end="00:19:01.220" style="s2">so I think that where that normative</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.000" end="00:19:03.940" style="s2">judgment of the beautiful realness is</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.220" end="00:19:06.679" style="s2">coming from is something like you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.940" end="00:19:09.350" style="s2">enhanced meta optimal grip so I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.679" end="00:19:12.620" style="s2">that what you propose could be training</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.350" end="00:19:14.150" style="s2">that affords that kind of Satori but it</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.620" end="00:19:16.100" style="s2">could also be abused</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.150" end="00:19:18.200" style="s2">why not everything can be abused that</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.100" end="00:19:21.020" style="s2">could be abused for a kind of like you</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.200" end="00:19:26.780" style="s2">said a called the sack a kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.020" end="00:19:29.110" style="s2">just the general contentedness with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.780" end="00:19:32.690" style="s2">obvious Ness of everyday experience</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.110" end="00:19:38.210" style="s2">which is sometimes I think mistaken for</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.690" end="00:19:40.840" style="s2">an interpretation of them well you were</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.210" end="00:19:43.850" style="s2">saying that I thought about because</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.840" end="00:19:46.070" style="s2">outside of the cul de sac interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.850" end="00:19:48.140" style="s2">there is this sense that a a higher more</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.070" end="00:19:50.470" style="s2">abstracted more generalized version of</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.140" end="00:19:53.000" style="s2">what the optimal grip move is is</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.470" end="00:19:56.020" style="s2">experienced by people who practice that</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.000" end="00:20:00.050" style="s2">as being a superior level of development</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.020" end="00:20:02.470" style="s2">yep right so then put me in mind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.050" end="00:20:04.910" style="s2">you know pre and trans and superior and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.470" end="00:20:07.780" style="s2">enter your modes of development because</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.910" end="00:20:10.490" style="s2">one of the things you could say about</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.780" end="00:20:12.860" style="s2">people who undertake risky or</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.490" end="00:20:18.380" style="s2">self-destructive behavior is that they</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.860" end="00:20:20.690" style="s2">might be seeking a dark beauty effect</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.380" end="00:20:23.600" style="s2">because they aren&#39;t succeeding at</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.690" end="00:20:27.170" style="s2">getting a higher optimal grip on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:29.150" style="s2">Gnostic you died down into the reflected</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.170" end="00:20:32.000" style="s2">image of the depths right because you</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.150" end="00:20:35.510" style="s2">mistaking it for the the the light from</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.000" end="00:20:37.910" style="s2">above sure have you seen there&#39;s movie</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.510" end="00:20:40.040" style="s2">300 then there&#39;s a sequel to it about</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.910" end="00:20:42.200" style="s2">the Athenians versus the Persians</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.040" end="00:20:43.700" style="s2">yeah the Athenians go to the Spartans</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.200" end="00:20:45.950" style="s2">and try to enlist their aid</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.700" end="00:20:47.660" style="s2">the Spartans turn them down and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.950" end="00:20:49.430" style="s2">general goes back to his men and they</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.660" end="00:20:50.930" style="s2">say you know are the Spartans with us he</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.430" end="00:20:52.490" style="s2">says no the Persians offered them</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.930" end="00:20:56.630" style="s2">something they couldn&#39;t refuse</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.490" end="00:21:00.830" style="s2">what&#39;s that he says a beautiful death so</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.630" end="00:21:02.830" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna a regressive Beauty was</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.830" end="00:21:04.880" style="s2">the best thing they could hope for</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.830" end="00:21:06.980" style="s2">presumably because they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.880" end="00:21:11.110" style="s2">confident in their ability to access a</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.980" end="00:21:16.610" style="s2">more complicated beauty yeah again I</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.110" end="00:21:21.380" style="s2">think you&#39;re speaking towards something</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.610" end="00:21:23.500" style="s2">that I&#39;ve seen discuss mentioned in</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.380" end="00:21:27.730" style="s2">multiple wisdom traditions</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.500" end="00:21:29.960" style="s2">so obviously the gnostic tradition very</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.730" end="00:21:32.270" style="s2">talked about that i just reference that</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.960" end="00:21:36.080" style="s2">that platonist talked about it because</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.270" end="00:21:38.390" style="s2">of a riff on narcissus and his version</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.080" end="00:21:40.730" style="s2">of that is persistence falls in love</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.390" end="00:21:42.920" style="s2">with the reflection rather of beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.730" end="00:21:47.060" style="s2">then falls to ISM into the water and</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.920" end="00:21:51.410" style="s2">drowns right and so yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.060" end="00:21:52.520" style="s2">a very real possibility so that&#39;s I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.410" end="00:21:54.290" style="s2">sort of two things and they feel like</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.520" end="00:21:56.090" style="s2">they want to come together because your</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.290" end="00:21:58.700" style="s2">your your have your heads up display</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.090" end="00:22:02.060" style="s2">metaphor keeps coming back because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.700" end="00:22:04.430" style="s2">also got this third idea of and I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.060" end="00:22:06.350" style="s2">it connects to this I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.430" end="00:22:08.120" style="s2">asking for your help right I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.350" end="00:22:10.610" style="s2">when we connect them it will also be an</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.120" end="00:22:13.410" style="s2">answer or to the question you posed or</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.610" end="00:22:16.500" style="s2">the problem you posed so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.410" end="00:22:19.380" style="s2">my information bears out because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.500" end="00:22:21.690" style="s2">also thinking of beauty as right and</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.380" end="00:22:23.640" style="s2">this because you know we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.690" end="00:22:27.660" style="s2">the often it&#39;s associated with more</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.640" end="00:22:30.390" style="s2">realness right like what&#39;s called what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.660" end="00:22:32.580" style="s2">nowadays both amplified reality you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.390" end="00:22:35.330" style="s2">and when you when you actually projected</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.580" end="00:22:38.520" style="s2">image or project a virtual image on to</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.330" end="00:22:39.960" style="s2">the real image in order to actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.520" end="00:22:42.330" style="s2">disclose things that are otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.960" end="00:22:43.890" style="s2">visible you know you do this immediately</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.330" end="00:22:45.840" style="s2">but you also do it in real science so</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.890" end="00:22:46.640" style="s2">the scientists you think the Rovers on</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.840" end="00:22:49.560" style="s2">Mars</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.640" end="00:22:51.750" style="s2">you know the completely of</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.560" end="00:22:54.390" style="s2">verisimilitude images that veridical</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.750" end="00:22:55.800" style="s2">images are kind of useless they when</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.390" end="00:22:57.270" style="s2">they do is they mark them all off and</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.800" end="00:22:58.890" style="s2">they color them and they put lines on</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.270" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">them and they do all this stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.890" end="00:23:02.790" style="s2">manipulate their salience and then what</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:04.980" style="s2">happens is they go five they get a</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.790" end="00:23:06.600" style="s2">pop-out experience ago all right this</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.980" end="00:23:09.420" style="s2">and then they get the topography right</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.600" end="00:23:11.130" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what I mean by an ant so</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.420" end="00:23:13.380" style="s2">there&#39;s a sensor which is projection</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.130" end="00:23:15.000" style="s2">because they&#39;re they&#39;re doing what you</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.380" end="00:23:15.990" style="s2">said they&#39;re getting all their faculty</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.000" end="00:23:18.210" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of triggering their own</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.990" end="00:23:19.380" style="s2">cognition but what it does is in fact it</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.210" end="00:23:21.510" style="s2">actually does blow there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.380" end="00:23:22.770" style="s2">that was otherwise invisible to them and</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.510" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">that&#39;s of course what a heads-up display</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.770" end="00:23:26.550" style="s2">is doing to right for the pilot because</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.960" end="00:23:28.350" style="s2">it&#39;s projecting everything on to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.550" end="00:23:30.150" style="s2">windshield but it&#39;s allowing them to</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.350" end="00:23:32.340" style="s2">track and see things that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.150" end="00:23:35.940" style="s2">unaided vision can&#39;t trap is that okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.340" end="00:23:41.120" style="s2">if I misappropriated your metaphor so</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.940" end="00:23:43.710" style="s2">far so good okay so is it possible that</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.120" end="00:23:45.990" style="s2">what we are being taught that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.710" end="00:23:47.850" style="s2">metaphors the myth you know you know I</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.990" end="00:23:51.110" style="s2">mean use that term positively not</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.850" end="00:23:55.080" style="s2">pejoratively right is that people are</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.110" end="00:23:56.160" style="s2">treating the images okay clean right</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.080" end="00:23:58.680" style="s2">yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.160" end="00:24:00.570" style="s2">they&#39;re looking at them rather than</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.680" end="00:24:03.870" style="s2">looking through them and that&#39;s how they</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.570" end="00:24:06.240" style="s2">make the fundamental miss taken right</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.870" end="00:24:12.630" style="s2">you see what I&#39;m trying to suggest to</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.240" end="00:24:15.300" style="s2">you that I used to use to use mauryans</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.630" end="00:24:17.760" style="s2">term they they treat it as an idle</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.300" end="00:24:19.830" style="s2">rather than an icon and that picks up</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.760" end="00:24:21.480" style="s2">certainly on narcissus because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.830" end="00:24:24.690" style="s2">what the finest seems to be indicating</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.480" end="00:24:27.030" style="s2">so there&#39;s my first attempt at an answer</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.690" end="00:24:30.630" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s interesting and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.030" end="00:24:32.790" style="s2">it&#39;s a good approach because when we try</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.630" end="00:24:35.970" style="s2">to think the pattern of the encounter</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.790" end="00:24:38.250" style="s2">with the beautiful the positive version</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.970" end="00:24:41.010" style="s2">of that is so close to the negative</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.250" end="00:24:43.560" style="s2">version of yes that&#39;s I mean the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.010" end="00:24:45.510" style="s2">a window with a pattern on it right and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.560" end="00:24:47.400" style="s2">so it&#39;s the same window on the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.510" end="00:24:50.010" style="s2">pattern but you either see through it or</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.400" end="00:24:53.220" style="s2">just see it I mean if you were to look</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.010" end="00:24:56.310" style="s2">at it rather than through it then you</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.220" end="00:24:59.460" style="s2">are kind of trapped in a smaller loop of</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.310" end="00:25:02.310" style="s2">cognition yes revolve around the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.460" end="00:25:04.440" style="s2">attractor state of a lower level of</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.310" end="00:25:08.060" style="s2">beautiful cognition rather than allowing</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.440" end="00:25:08.060" style="s2">you out into a higher level right</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.250" end="00:25:14.100" style="s2">reciprocal narrow way rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.570" end="00:25:16.380" style="s2">reciprocal opening and it would tend</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.100" end="00:25:19.710" style="s2">through that you know comport you</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.380" end="00:25:22.440" style="s2">towards more addictive ways of being and</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.710" end="00:25:25.020" style="s2">seeing and cognition rather than you</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.440" end="00:25:27.390" style="s2">know growth and transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.020" end="00:25:30.210" style="s2">transcending forms of seeing and being</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.390" end="00:25:33.360" style="s2">so that seems to me like you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.210" end="00:25:35.400" style="s2">like I feel like we&#39;re up to you as far</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.360" end="00:25:37.050" style="s2">as soon like we&#39;re beautifying our</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.400" end="00:25:38.730" style="s2">speech so that we&#39;re on the track of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.050" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">truth that&#39;s what that&#39;s what it feels</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.730" end="00:25:45.030" style="s2">like to me yeah it&#39;s uh it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:47.300" style="s2">it&#39;s a more demanding function to get</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.030" end="00:25:50.100" style="s2">that transparency that opaqueness</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.300" end="00:25:52.530" style="s2">because it&#39;s a bit like stereoscopic</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.100" end="00:25:54.810" style="s2">vision right yeah two things at the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.530" end="00:25:57.570" style="s2">time which is a more cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.810" end="00:26:01.860" style="s2">demanding task and therefore more likely</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.570" end="00:26:05.400" style="s2">to fail for a lot of people that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.860" end="00:26:07.080" style="s2">that but the demand so it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.400" end="00:26:09.240" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.080" end="00:26:10.380" style="s2">a lot of cognitive inertia because of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.240" end="00:26:13.020" style="s2">the cognitive miser</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.380" end="00:26:14.610" style="s2">that is going to resist that and</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.020" end="00:26:16.020" style="s2">presumably there has to be something I</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.610" end="00:26:17.580" style="s2">think you liked about something like</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.020" end="00:26:20.190" style="s2">this before there has to be something</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.580" end="00:26:22.830" style="s2">like a certain degree of arousal as</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.190" end="00:26:25.560" style="s2">activation energy that will afford the</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.830" end="00:26:27.510" style="s2">complexification to start taking place</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.560" end="00:26:29.100" style="s2">because there&#39;s not a vision is a kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.510" end="00:26:30.630" style="s2">of cognitive complexity patient</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.100" end="00:26:32.160" style="s2">they&#39;re stopping vision is actually an</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.630" end="00:26:33.630" style="s2">even better thing for what applies</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.160" end="00:26:36.990" style="s2">because you notice how it brings</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.630" end="00:26:39.150" style="s2">together your earlier idea because</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.990" end="00:26:39.570" style="s2">you&#39;re actually complexified to inner</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.150" end="00:26:41.940" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.570" end="00:26:43.979" style="s2">right but it actually discloses</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.940" end="00:26:45.840" style="s2">something about reality that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.979" end="00:26:47.700" style="s2">disclosed which is the dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.840" end="00:26:50.340" style="s2">depth I think that&#39;s very very good</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.700" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">so it&#39;s something like the image we want</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.340" end="00:26:55.769" style="s2">is right somehow would integrate</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:58.950" style="s2">stereoscopic vision and then looking</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.769" end="00:27:01.139" style="s2">through the painted window rather than</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.950" end="00:27:04.019" style="s2">just looking at the painted window or</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.139" end="00:27:09.299" style="s2">something like that we combine those</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.019" end="00:27:11.279" style="s2">together yeah for me partly because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.299" end="00:27:13.349" style="s2">first in a lot of these theories about</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.279" end="00:27:15.989" style="s2">levels of layers of developmental</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.349" end="00:27:18.809" style="s2">complexity that I start thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.989" end="00:27:21.570" style="s2">each more comprehensive and folding</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.809" end="00:27:23.099" style="s2">level as needing to synchronize the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.570" end="00:27:24.059" style="s2">functions of a lot of different pieces</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.099" end="00:27:25.679" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.059" end="00:27:27.330" style="s2">seeing a thing and seeing through a</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.679" end="00:27:29.399" style="s2">thing those are two functions that have</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.330" end="00:27:31.710" style="s2">to be really well synchronized and a</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.399" end="00:27:33.749" style="s2">host of other ones right arousal in</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.710" end="00:27:36.479" style="s2">terms of energy production which means</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.749" end="00:27:38.309" style="s2">your lifestyle and your physiology all</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.479" end="00:27:40.710" style="s2">these things have to be on board to</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.309" end="00:27:42.720" style="s2">sustain that higher level and if it</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.710" end="00:27:44.999" style="s2">starts to break down it breaks down in</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.720" end="00:27:46.710" style="s2">the form of those functions some of them</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.999" end="00:27:49.099" style="s2">coming offline or maybe they stop</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.710" end="00:27:51.809" style="s2">synchronizing which leads me to think</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.099" end="00:27:53.159" style="s2">sociologically because you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.809" end="00:27:55.619" style="s2">the things if you just stand back and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.159" end="00:27:58.340" style="s2">look at the you know trash fire that</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.619" end="00:28:01.229" style="s2">appears to be the United States lately</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.340" end="00:28:04.349" style="s2">one of the things you see there arguably</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.229" end="00:28:07.529" style="s2">is the functions of modernity not</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.349" end="00:28:09.539" style="s2">synchronizing you see right the modern</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.529" end="00:28:11.239" style="s2">police force running up against the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.539" end="00:28:13.859" style="s2">freedom of the individual you see</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.239" end="00:28:16.109" style="s2">corporate freedoms running up against</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.859" end="00:28:18.749" style="s2">freedoms of the press you see all these</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.109" end="00:28:21.059" style="s2">different functions interfering with</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.749" end="00:28:24.419" style="s2">each other rather than synchronizing or</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.059" end="00:28:26.899" style="s2">or also synchronizing and like we talked</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.419" end="00:28:29.669" style="s2">about the sort of parasitic processing</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.899" end="00:28:31.559" style="s2">where because everything has side</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.669" end="00:28:34.169" style="s2">effects try other than the intended</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.559" end="00:28:35.940" style="s2">effects and so a lot of the side effects</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.169" end="00:28:39.119" style="s2">I think we&#39;re also starting to reinforce</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.940" end="00:28:41.970" style="s2">each other in negative patterns if an</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.119" end="00:28:43.649" style="s2">orchestra started to fail right you</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.970" end="00:28:50.220" style="s2">still might get the drummer and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.649" end="00:28:52.859" style="s2">flautist circling each other so I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.220" end="00:28:53.630" style="s2">if this leads back to the aesthetics of</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.859" end="00:28:57.870" style="s2">poor</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.630" end="00:28:59.970" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering if part of the attraction</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.870" end="00:29:01.980" style="s2">I think that&#39;s the right word what are</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.970" end="00:29:07.230" style="s2">the attraction to the aesthetics of</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.980" end="00:29:09.270" style="s2">horror is because I mean it split poor</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.230" end="00:29:17.040" style="s2">puts you into a high level of arousal</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.270" end="00:29:19.410" style="s2">for sure and horror also is really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.040" end="00:29:21.030" style="s2">really it really challenges your sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.410" end="00:29:24.180" style="s2">that you actually have an optimal grip</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.030" end="00:29:26.850" style="s2">it has a real potential to threaten you</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.180" end="00:29:29.340" style="s2">out of just looking at and say no no</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.850" end="00:29:31.230" style="s2">you&#39;re not seeing you&#39;re not seeing it</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.340" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">until you bet he&#39;s challenging you to</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.230" end="00:29:36.120" style="s2">like that&#39;s why it&#39;s pretty close to aw</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:38.309" style="s2">because I is like you&#39;re all I am not</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.120" end="00:29:40.710" style="s2">seeing it but I might actually see it</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.309" end="00:29:42.510" style="s2">like we&#39;re Horrors I&#39;m not seeing if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.710" end="00:29:45.690" style="s2">not gonna see it and that&#39;s really great</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.510" end="00:29:48.330" style="s2">but I&#39;m sorry that other than suggestion</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.690" end="00:29:50.040" style="s2">that may be part of why because it would</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.330" end="00:29:51.870" style="s2">help to alleviate the paradox because</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.040" end="00:29:54.480" style="s2">the content of horror should be deeply</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.870" end="00:29:57.830" style="s2">aversive to us right stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.480" end="00:30:02.160" style="s2">threatening us right</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.830" end="00:30:07.500" style="s2">but maybe part of the attraction and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.160" end="00:30:09.809" style="s2">that right is when we get a sense like I</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.500" end="00:30:13.110" style="s2">said of a combination of two things that</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.809" end="00:30:15.510" style="s2">could potentially be beneficial if they</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.110" end="00:30:17.940" style="s2">were appropriately coordinated which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.510" end="00:30:20.520" style="s2">a high level of arousal and a deep sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.940" end="00:30:22.710" style="s2">that we haven&#39;t got a appropriate grip</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.520" end="00:30:26.790" style="s2">on things and we need to see more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.710" end="00:30:28.740" style="s2">than we&#39;re currently seeing that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.790" end="00:30:32.910" style="s2">suggestion yeah there&#39;s an element there</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.740" end="00:30:35.429" style="s2">of somebody who&#39;s lost and wants to go</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.910" end="00:30:37.980" style="s2">back to the crossroads right go back to</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.429" end="00:30:39.510" style="s2">the bifurcation points because then the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.980" end="00:30:41.670" style="s2">bifurcation point could go either way</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.510" end="00:30:44.160" style="s2">it&#39;s like what&#39;s the attraction to</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.670" end="00:30:46.559" style="s2">standing at the edge of a cliff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.160" end="00:30:48.059" style="s2">really hot right some people it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.559" end="00:30:49.830" style="s2">to give them a little extra thrill and</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.059" end="00:30:52.470" style="s2">remind them that they want to live and</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.830" end="00:30:54.240" style="s2">for other people it&#39;s risky because the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.470" end="00:30:59.240" style="s2">idea that you might throw yourself off</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.240" end="00:31:04.070" style="s2">is gaining ground in your mind exactly</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.240" end="00:31:06.340" style="s2">so I wondered so I wonder then if I</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.070" end="00:31:08.919" style="s2">wonder if ah is more</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.340" end="00:31:10.600" style="s2">where&#39;s that sweet point I mean I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.919" end="00:31:12.190" style="s2">discussion with Brian Houston man we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.600" end="00:31:14.260" style="s2">running must opponent was running funny</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.190" end="00:31:16.150" style="s2">like he&#39;s running experiments I put it</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.260" end="00:31:18.520" style="s2">on off and also with Jennifer stellar</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.150" end="00:31:23.020" style="s2">and Jensen camp and Michele Ferrari</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.520" end="00:31:25.210" style="s2">we&#39;re running experiments on aw and it</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.020" end="00:31:28.150" style="s2">is interesting what seems to do in</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.210" end="00:31:32.500" style="s2">contrast to just the just experiences of</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.150" end="00:31:34.600" style="s2">beauty because odd generally has a huge</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.500" end="00:31:36.159" style="s2">impact on meaning in life so people feel</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.600" end="00:31:39.220" style="s2">really connected to something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.159" end="00:31:42.010" style="s2">real that&#39;s that realness that they</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.220" end="00:31:44.169" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily have with these our</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.010" end="00:31:47.230" style="s2">cultural understanding the movie so that</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.169" end="00:31:49.200" style="s2">contrast is clearly coming out they</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.230" end="00:31:52.690" style="s2">don&#39;t get an enhanced sense of purpose</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.200" end="00:31:54.250" style="s2">so it&#39;s not telling at all all right so</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.690" end="00:31:56.500" style="s2">contrary to meaning they&#39;re just having</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.250" end="00:32:00.399" style="s2">the purpose no it&#39;s not Offshore&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.500" end="00:32:01.779" style="s2">not no no no no what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.399" end="00:32:04.179" style="s2">interesting it goes towards what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.779" end="00:32:05.860" style="s2">talking about here is you get you get an</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.179" end="00:32:08.740" style="s2">appreciable increase in people&#39;s ability</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.860" end="00:32:10.270" style="s2">to pick up on patterns deeper more</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.740" end="00:32:15.820" style="s2">complex patterns that they couldn&#39;t pick</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.270" end="00:32:18.399" style="s2">up off the floor there might be a way in</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.820" end="00:32:21.279" style="s2">which the meaningfulness of odd does</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.399" end="00:32:24.850" style="s2">have a tell it component okay that it</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.279" end="00:32:27.130" style="s2">makes you super aware of your capacity</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.850" end="00:32:30.130" style="s2">to produce that experience from out of</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.130" end="00:32:32.799" style="s2">your own machinery case you&#39;re reminded</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.130" end="00:32:36.039" style="s2">of that&#39;s the purpose of life and it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.799" end="00:32:40.630" style="s2">possible for me to do this I can see</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.039" end="00:32:43.600" style="s2">that I can see that I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.630" end="00:32:45.580" style="s2">interesting that the way you did that</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.600" end="00:32:46.720" style="s2">because that reminds me again of what we</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.580" end="00:32:50.470" style="s2">were talking about I mentioned both</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.720" end="00:32:52.390" style="s2">Plato that what happens is you get a</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.470" end="00:32:55.270" style="s2">generative response that&#39;s what you just</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.390" end="00:32:57.520" style="s2">did your responses oh I want to generate</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.270" end="00:32:59.740" style="s2">I want to generate right I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.520" end="00:33:01.299" style="s2">able to generate more and more of this</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.740" end="00:33:04.510" style="s2">and there&#39;s a sense in which you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.299" end="00:33:06.760" style="s2">a form a reality for lack of a better</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.510" end="00:33:09.070" style="s2">word the world to be more generative in</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.760" end="00:33:10.630" style="s2">what it could disclose to people in</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.070" end="00:33:12.850" style="s2">terms of its potential for</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.630" end="00:33:15.760" style="s2">intelligibility so I agree with that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.850" end="00:33:18.760" style="s2">think that&#39;s right and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.760" end="00:33:20.160" style="s2">that&#39;s pilot or that tarantella I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.760" end="00:33:23.070" style="s2">know if you&#39;re stating a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.160" end="00:33:25.470" style="s2">as opposed to an ideal it sounds more I</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.070" end="00:33:28.320" style="s2">burnt young to be an adjective all but</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.470" end="00:33:30.630" style="s2">that could be equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.320" end="00:33:32.550" style="s2">it&#39;s a different kind of a purpose it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.630" end="00:33:35.310" style="s2">an herb purpose or a mat a purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.550" end="00:33:36.930" style="s2">some kind because it doesn&#39;t super</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.310" end="00:33:39.240" style="s2">meaningful experience and odd doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.930" end="00:33:41.250" style="s2">necessarily come along with or doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.240" end="00:33:43.320" style="s2">have to come along with some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.250" end="00:33:47.400" style="s2">cognitive content about what the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.320" end="00:33:50.310" style="s2">might be yeah if we think of self-aware</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.400" end="00:33:52.650" style="s2">content about purposes as secondary to</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.310" end="00:33:54.420" style="s2">what purpose really is then we could</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.650" end="00:33:56.970" style="s2">argue that it&#39;s a purpose right like no</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.420" end="00:34:01.260" style="s2">if most purposes are animating rather</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.970" end="00:34:02.880" style="s2">than self-aware yeah that&#39;s fine so why</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.260" end="00:34:05.130" style="s2">that won&#39;t show up on the standard</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.880" end="00:34:07.650" style="s2">measures because the standard measuring</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.130" end="00:34:10.620" style="s2">the purpose understand purpose as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.650" end="00:34:13.650" style="s2">future state of affair so a purpose is</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.620" end="00:34:17.520" style="s2">kind of a is your most important goal</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.650" end="00:34:19.050" style="s2">that you&#39;re working towards and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.520" end="00:34:20.790" style="s2">you&#39;re not working towards a particular</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.050" end="00:34:22.380" style="s2">future state of affairs of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.790" end="00:34:25.169" style="s2">talking about here you&#39;re working more</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.380" end="00:34:27.690" style="s2">for an on an ongoing constraint or</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.169" end="00:34:31.100" style="s2">virtue for your for your all of your</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.690" end="00:34:34.350" style="s2">existence you&#39;re working for a</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.100" end="00:34:38.840" style="s2">qualitative subset of affairs to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.350" end="00:34:38.840" style="s2">privileged in your future outcomes yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.429" end="00:34:47.340" style="s2">between goals and ideals along just that</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.000" end="00:34:49.830" style="s2">line for an ideal is like the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.340" end="00:34:52.440" style="s2">honesty is just like you said you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.830" end="00:34:55.410" style="s2">in many different possible future States</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.440" end="00:34:58.230" style="s2">I want to act in this manner as opposed</p>

<p begin="00:34:58.230" end="00:35:03.390" style="s2">a future state that I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.120" end="00:35:04.950" style="s2">definitively arrived at that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.390" end="00:35:06.450" style="s2">interesting in terms of what we were</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.950" end="00:35:09.920" style="s2">previously discussing about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.450" end="00:35:12.540" style="s2">possibility of expansive or regressive</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.920" end="00:35:14.250" style="s2">winners of this phenomenon because you</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.540" end="00:35:16.290" style="s2">might say I&#39;ve got a lot of things going</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.250" end="00:35:19.290" style="s2">on I&#39;ve got a lot of purposes not just</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.290" end="00:35:21.960" style="s2">one but a bunch and at some point there</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.290" end="00:35:23.010" style="s2">they converge at a principle a virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.960" end="00:35:25.500" style="s2">some kind that I&#39;m working towards</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.010" end="00:35:28.470" style="s2">however they might also converge to a</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.500" end="00:35:31.200" style="s2">lower set of those virtues right so the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.470" end="00:35:33.700" style="s2">person who is moving through their</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.200" end="00:35:37.390" style="s2">behavior towards a self-destruct</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.700" end="00:35:40.210" style="s2">outcome but it&#39;s also moving towards a</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.390" end="00:35:42.280" style="s2">beautiful darkness towards something</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.210" end="00:35:45.220" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna say this is reality man</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.280" end="00:35:46.780" style="s2">you know so there&#39;s a lot of virtues</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.220" end="00:35:50.500" style="s2">although they&#39;re in a more compressed</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.780" end="00:35:52.780" style="s2">form that&#39;s that&#39;s cool okay so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.500" end="00:35:57.130" style="s2">room this is what came up for me with</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.780" end="00:36:01.270" style="s2">that so I talked about the problem</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.130" end="00:36:03.040" style="s2">aspect is five the therapeutic work and</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.270" end="00:36:04.960" style="s2">you&#39;ll see why that&#39;s relevant to what</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.040" end="00:36:07.320" style="s2">you said in just a second so somebody</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.960" end="00:36:12.520" style="s2">comes in and well what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.320" end="00:36:14.349" style="s2">you know I&#39;m too stubborn I just I got</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.520" end="00:36:17.650" style="s2">everybody&#39;s coming on so confrontational</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.349" end="00:36:19.480" style="s2">and stubborn and no I got it I gotta let</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.650" end="00:36:20.890" style="s2">go oh that&#39;s interesting and then you</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.480" end="00:36:22.540" style="s2">talk to them for a while and you get</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.890" end="00:36:24.609" style="s2">them off and you get them into sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.540" end="00:36:26.050" style="s2">the monologue autobiography they can</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.609" end="00:36:27.940" style="s2">just you a lot of human beings pretty</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.050" end="00:36:30.400" style="s2">naturally once you get past a few</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.940" end="00:36:32.800" style="s2">moments or you know politeness right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.400" end="00:36:34.089" style="s2">then while they&#39;re doing that you ask</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.800" end="00:36:36.339" style="s2">tell me something about yourself that</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.089" end="00:36:38.859" style="s2">you really like and let&#39;s say well I</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.339" end="00:36:45.160" style="s2">persevere I really keep going no matter</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.859" end="00:36:47.260" style="s2">what and you said and so so right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.160" end="00:36:50.500" style="s2">then part of the therapy is to get them</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.260" end="00:36:53.369" style="s2">to see the non-logical identity the</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.500" end="00:36:58.380" style="s2">aspects of identity lie between</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.369" end="00:37:01.060" style="s2">stubbornness and perseverance right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.380" end="00:37:04.030" style="s2">that&#39;s a very difficult thing to do so</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.060" end="00:37:06.849" style="s2">here&#39;s a question because it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.030" end="00:37:08.319" style="s2">like that aspect shift is is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.849" end="00:37:10.270" style="s2">aligned with what we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.319" end="00:37:13.569" style="s2">earlier the ability to see through</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.270" end="00:37:15.460" style="s2">rather than look at like the person who</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.569" end="00:37:16.930" style="s2">like the person because it&#39;s like it</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.460" end="00:37:19.390" style="s2">strikes me like the stereoscopic vision</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.930" end="00:37:21.099" style="s2">right because the person in therapy</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.390" end="00:37:24.369" style="s2">needs to get a stereoscopic vision on</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.099" end="00:37:26.560" style="s2">stubbornness and perseverance in order</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.369" end="00:37:29.140" style="s2">to break through to the depths whereas</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.560" end="00:37:31.599" style="s2">the person who&#39;s trapped is only looking</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.140" end="00:37:34.359" style="s2">at the stubbornness and looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.599" end="00:37:36.250" style="s2">perseverance that does that make yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.359" end="00:37:38.650" style="s2">absolutely like if I imagine a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.250" end="00:37:40.900" style="s2">cartoonish image where we all come built</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.650" end="00:37:44.800" style="s2">in with these instincts and some of</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.900" end="00:37:46.240" style="s2">those instincts are virtue experiences</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.800" end="00:37:47.119" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.240" end="00:37:50.390" style="s2">and these</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.119" end="00:37:52.640" style="s2">can develop analogous to say Howard</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.390" end="00:37:55.549" style="s2">Gardner&#39;s intelligences something like</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.640" end="00:37:57.319" style="s2">that right the developmental phases of</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.549" end="00:37:59.809" style="s2">these virtues would involve a</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.319" end="00:38:03.799" style="s2">complexification which has to involve a</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.809" end="00:38:06.829" style="s2">splitting and a synchronizing so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.799" end="00:38:09.829" style="s2">got you know I really am pursuing a</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.829" end="00:38:11.869" style="s2">virtue here I&#39;m persevering and you need</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.829" end="00:38:15.710" style="s2">to then help that person grow to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.869" end="00:38:18.319" style="s2">next more complex stable stage of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.710" end="00:38:20.930" style="s2">virtue which involves teasing it apart</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.319" end="00:38:22.609" style="s2">from its reciprocal but holding them in</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.930" end="00:38:24.859" style="s2">a synchronized way a stereoscopic</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.609" end="00:38:27.109" style="s2">fashion so that you can operate at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.859" end="00:38:29.809" style="s2">next attractor level or whatever we want</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.109" end="00:38:32.420" style="s2">to call that so this action sounds a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.809" end="00:38:34.940" style="s2">like it&#39;s what you just said was</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.420" end="00:38:36.289" style="s2">beautiful by the way that really yes</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.940" end="00:38:39.380" style="s2">that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.289" end="00:38:41.660" style="s2">and now what it sounds equally analogous</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.380" end="00:38:44.029" style="s2">to is a dynamic interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.660" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">Aristotle&#39;s golden mean right that what</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.029" end="00:38:50.660" style="s2">you&#39;re always trying to do by a and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:53.239" style="s2">know courage is in between calories and</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.660" end="00:38:55.700" style="s2">through hardiness like and here so</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.239" end="00:38:57.739" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of doing almost a two-way</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.700" end="00:39:00.200" style="s2">stereoscopically right and you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.739" end="00:39:02.779" style="s2">all of this complexification and virtual</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.200" end="00:39:07.009" style="s2">engineering so that now I&#39;m going to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.779" end="00:39:08.930" style="s2">a move here came up in the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.009" end="00:39:14.960" style="s2">first of all I want to flag something</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.930" end="00:39:18.950" style="s2">just as a general note what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.960" end="00:39:20.690" style="s2">here is interesting because for me the</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.950" end="00:39:22.339" style="s2">process and you know I&#39;m gonna go mana</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.690" end="00:39:25.309" style="s2">just for a second and then I&#39;ll return</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.339" end="00:39:27.410" style="s2">all right we&#39;re doing something we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.309" end="00:39:30.109" style="s2">doing a kind of argumentation in which</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.410" end="00:39:32.420" style="s2">instead of propositions were making</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.109" end="00:39:34.160" style="s2">proposals and then what we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.420" end="00:39:37.880" style="s2">the proposals are doing this gathering</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.160" end="00:39:39.799" style="s2">right right so it&#39;s it&#39;s normal it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.880" end="00:39:41.930" style="s2">the logical progression of premises</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.799" end="00:39:43.549" style="s2">although we&#39;re not we&#39;re not I hope</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.930" end="00:39:45.680" style="s2">we&#39;re not violating logical coherence</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.549" end="00:39:47.539" style="s2">but there&#39;s something much more it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.680" end="00:39:49.219" style="s2">much more that sense of the logos we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.539" end="00:39:51.229" style="s2">fine we&#39;re gathering things together and</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.219" end="00:39:54.109" style="s2">see so that they come to belong together</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.229" end="00:39:56.390" style="s2">and then afford another proposal that</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.109" end="00:39:58.309" style="s2">gathers things together and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.390" end="00:40:00.349" style="s2">I think is flipping that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.309" end="00:40:02.180" style="s2">Portmore I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.349" end="00:40:05.119" style="s2">located apart before a grounded and say</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.180" end="00:40:08.299" style="s2">we need to be paying attention to this</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.119" end="00:40:11.210" style="s2">kind of argumentation as opposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.299" end="00:40:15.859" style="s2">strict logical progression of premises</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.210" end="00:40:19.130" style="s2">this though there&#39;s no ghost progression</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.859" end="00:40:22.670" style="s2">of proposals strikes me as much more</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.130" end="00:40:26.479" style="s2">important for what we need to do when we</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.670" end="00:40:27.920" style="s2">are trying to cultivate wisdom or virtue</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.479" end="00:40:30.349" style="s2">so I just wanted to put that out there</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.920" end="00:40:33.619" style="s2">as something to flag and Expo K because</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.349" end="00:40:36.229" style="s2">you&#39;re helping me develop and explicate</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.619" end="00:40:38.180" style="s2">and understand what this is you know I</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.229" end="00:40:40.609" style="s2">have a lot of training in formal</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.180" end="00:40:44.150" style="s2">argumentation and I&#39;m not I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.609" end="00:40:45.799" style="s2">should just you know get rid of that get</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.150" end="00:40:47.660" style="s2">into really nearly romanticism or</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.799" end="00:40:49.609" style="s2">something but there&#39;s something more</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.660" end="00:40:51.259" style="s2">going on here and I have a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.609" end="00:40:53.059" style="s2">you&#39;re feeling and experiencing it too</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.259" end="00:40:54.799" style="s2">and I just wanted to note that for</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.059" end="00:40:57.049" style="s2">people because I think noting the</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.799" end="00:40:58.249" style="s2">process is relevant on to what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.049" end="00:41:00.130" style="s2">actually talking about because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.249" end="00:41:03.049" style="s2">actually trying to beautify the</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.130" end="00:41:07.640" style="s2">discourse of the communication so that</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.049" end="00:41:10.430" style="s2">being said within that context that that</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.640" end="00:41:13.489" style="s2">framing of argumentation I made an</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.430" end="00:41:15.859" style="s2">argument with too because it&#39;s a series</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.489" end="00:41:17.839" style="s2">of proposals I made an argument to Chris</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.859" end="00:41:19.009" style="s2">and Andrew that there seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.839" end="00:41:22.430" style="s2">therefore a deep connection between</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.009" end="00:41:24.829" style="s2">virtue beauty and wisdom given what</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.430" end="00:41:27.619" style="s2">we&#39;ve just said right about this</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.829" end="00:41:31.519" style="s2">complexification and and then going back</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.619" end="00:41:35.329" style="s2">to the seeing through right and also</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.519" end="00:41:38.049" style="s2">this is meta optimal gripping and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.329" end="00:41:40.130" style="s2">proposed to them that wisdom also has</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.049" end="00:41:43.729" style="s2">because I want to I want to turn the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.130" end="00:41:46.999" style="s2">stereoscopic vision sort of this way to</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.729" end="00:41:48.049" style="s2">link it into the reciprocal opening so</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.999" end="00:41:50.119" style="s2">this is what I&#39;m proposing there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.049" end="00:41:53.509" style="s2">kind of stereoscopic vision that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.119" end="00:41:56.599" style="s2">proposed in wisdom in aerosol namely</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.509" end="00:41:58.519" style="s2">like there&#39;s Sophia which is out into</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.599" end="00:42:01.309" style="s2">the morning and then there&#39;s furnaces</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.519" end="00:42:05.029" style="s2">which is into the sentence I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.309" end="00:42:07.249" style="s2">that&#39;s Barry as clearly I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.029" end="00:42:10.460" style="s2">all those terms be and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.249" end="00:42:12.619" style="s2">stereoscopic vision to wisdom if I can</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.460" end="00:42:14.599" style="s2">put it that way and then I&#39;ll throw in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.619" end="00:42:18.109" style="s2">Socratic idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.599" end="00:42:21.619" style="s2">and the Socratic idea is that virtues</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.109" end="00:42:24.109" style="s2">are always just specific enactment</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.619" end="00:42:27.049" style="s2">enactments of wisdom that being</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.109" end="00:42:30.319" style="s2">courageous is how I&#39;m wise in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.049" end="00:42:33.920" style="s2">situation and being kind is high and</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.319" end="00:42:35.450" style="s2">wise in this situation that you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.920" end="00:42:38.390" style="s2">to give me the stereoscopic sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.450" end="00:42:43.220" style="s2">wisdom for that to really be I think a</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.390" end="00:42:44.779" style="s2">viable proposal and then I could if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.220" end="00:42:47.059" style="s2">give me that and you give what you said</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.779" end="00:42:48.890" style="s2">about beauty here&#39;s a proposal that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.059" end="00:42:55.279" style="s2">think is a very important proposal that</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.890" end="00:42:59.690" style="s2">virtue is the beauty of wisdom that when</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.279" end="00:43:03.920" style="s2">I act courageously I&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.690" end="00:43:05.960" style="s2">stereoscopic optimal grip between the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.920" end="00:43:08.869" style="s2">more nests and misogynist that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.960" end="00:43:11.269" style="s2">be realized in this situation and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.869" end="00:43:13.670" style="s2">not just subjective and it&#39;s not just an</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.269" end="00:43:15.410" style="s2">objective but ayat I have coupled to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.670" end="00:43:18.200" style="s2">situation in the most appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.410" end="00:43:19.729" style="s2">fashion for that situation and in that</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.200" end="00:43:21.529" style="s2">way it&#39;s beautiful because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.729" end="00:43:23.749" style="s2">trying to understand in the symposium</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.529" end="00:43:26.329" style="s2">when Plato says something and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.749" end="00:43:28.160" style="s2">goes yeah I get that but he goes you</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.329" end="00:43:29.390" style="s2">know you move from physical beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.160" end="00:43:31.039" style="s2">then you move to the beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.390" end="00:43:33.319" style="s2">institutions and virtues and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.039" end="00:43:35.529" style="s2">goes goes yeah yeah what the hell are</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.319" end="00:43:37.910" style="s2">you talking about like how is it virtue</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.529" end="00:43:41.109" style="s2">beautiful like what does and that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.910" end="00:43:44.269" style="s2">proposal to you but I think that virtue</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.109" end="00:43:46.759" style="s2">but unless a virtuous beauty I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.269" end="00:43:51.829" style="s2">virtue is the beauty of wisdom it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.759" end="00:43:55.219" style="s2">right that&#39;s what I&#39;m proposing to well</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.829" end="00:43:57.680" style="s2">yeah I think there&#39;s a I mean if we</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.219" end="00:43:59.779" style="s2">define wisdom in a very general sense I</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.680" end="00:44:02.210" style="s2">would call it a toroidal sense because</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.779" end="00:44:06.289" style="s2">it you know it folds young the going-out</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.210" end="00:44:08.029" style="s2">folds back into the coming in yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.289" end="00:44:11.239" style="s2">you&#39;ve got that and now the very</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.029" end="00:44:13.969" style="s2">simplistic geometric structure of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.239" end="00:44:17.059" style="s2">pyramid right so you if you had beauty</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.969" end="00:44:19.249" style="s2">and justice and truth and goodness they</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.059" end="00:44:21.920" style="s2">have a convergence point of some kind at</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.249" end="00:44:24.619" style="s2">this pain eeeh Slee up going and in</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.920" end="00:44:28.070" style="s2">going wisdom function that overflows</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.619" end="00:44:30.440" style="s2">maybe back onto them so that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.070" end="00:44:33.710" style="s2">that&#39;s the transcendental notion of</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.440" end="00:44:36.020" style="s2">know-how yes anything that works is know</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.710" end="00:44:38.570" style="s2">how and if know-how is understood to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.020" end="00:44:40.550" style="s2">what wisdom is that makes a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.570" end="00:44:43.790" style="s2">so that anything that functions any</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.550" end="00:44:46.670" style="s2">virtue is a form of know-how but virtue</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.790" end="00:44:48.020" style="s2">isn&#39;t just when we look at a system and</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.670" end="00:44:51.020" style="s2">it functions well</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.020" end="00:44:53.960" style="s2">so it&#39;s expressing the virtue it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.020" end="00:44:56.690" style="s2">there&#39;s also the interior recognition of</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.960" end="00:45:00.010" style="s2">that quality so it has a beauty to it</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.690" end="00:45:02.420" style="s2">yes attractiveness of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.010" end="00:45:04.310" style="s2">exactly.you yeah that was well said</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.420" end="00:45:06.290" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly yeah I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.310" end="00:45:10.630" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m finding exactly I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.290" end="00:45:13.580" style="s2">get that there seems to be this because</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.630" end="00:45:18.140" style="s2">part of what I see Plato doing is he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.580" end="00:45:19.970" style="s2">trying to but extend Beauty he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.140" end="00:45:22.820" style="s2">actually explained instead Beauty into</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.970" end="00:45:26.300" style="s2">ah and this seems to hacks so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.820" end="00:45:31.070" style="s2">trying to extend wonder into ah and this</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.300" end="00:45:33.020" style="s2">seems to like correspond to that some</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.070" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">relationship between beauty and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.020" end="00:45:39.620" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to get out</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.640" end="00:45:42.470" style="s2">here that we pick up on right the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.620" end="00:45:44.300" style="s2">of wisdom and it draws us in and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.470" end="00:45:46.310" style="s2">eventually we can be you can come into</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.300" end="00:45:48.740" style="s2">reverence work and that&#39;s what I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.310" end="00:45:52.280" style="s2">it is to be 5eo Sophia to fall in love</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.740" end="00:45:53.960" style="s2">with wisdom it has to me in some deeply</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.280" end="00:45:58.460" style="s2">motivational and cognitive sound</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.960" end="00:46:02.240" style="s2">attractive to us the other thing about</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.460" end="00:46:05.090" style="s2">that for me is that it&#39;s so general that</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.240" end="00:46:06.980" style="s2">it&#39;s potentially could be unpacked or</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.090" end="00:46:10.730" style="s2">deployed into all kinds of different</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.980" end="00:46:13.190" style="s2">affairs right if you know it as personal</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.730" end="00:46:14.810" style="s2">cognition of beauty or is personal</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.190" end="00:46:17.180" style="s2">cognition of truth and you might think</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.810" end="00:46:19.190" style="s2">well how could I get that same thing in</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.180" end="00:46:22.640" style="s2">politics how could I get that same thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.190" end="00:46:24.470" style="s2">in my exercise routine the more refined</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.640" end="00:46:27.560" style="s2">I make the notion the more I&#39;m liable to</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.470" end="00:46:30.410" style="s2">be able to find that experience within</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.560" end="00:46:33.200" style="s2">any set of functions that works that</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.410" end="00:46:35.630" style="s2">expresses the wisdom of know how I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.200" end="00:46:37.970" style="s2">that&#39;s good I mean I would also put in</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.630" end="00:46:40.530" style="s2">perspective title and the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.970" end="00:46:41.760" style="s2">no in addition but I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.530" end="00:46:44.250" style="s2">using no matter their comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.760" end="00:46:48.630" style="s2">place so that&#39;s fine and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.250" end="00:46:51.690" style="s2">goes towards like again that again a</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.630" end="00:46:55.020" style="s2">kind of stereoscopic grasping or rocking</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.690" end="00:46:57.080" style="s2">of the deep learning that you you</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.020" end="00:46:59.580" style="s2">generate the very a you generate</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.080" end="00:47:03.000" style="s2">projective you let me use your language</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.580" end="00:47:06.570" style="s2">into the variations and then you you</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.000" end="00:47:10.230" style="s2">recollect it in into but what&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.570" end="00:47:12.870" style="s2">like as you get better at burying it you</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.230" end="00:47:14.790" style="s2">get better at expecting more deeper</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.870" end="00:47:17.010" style="s2">invariants what is much more general</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.790" end="00:47:20.040" style="s2">which then allows you to vary it more</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.010" end="00:47:22.110" style="s2">and then you get that cycle of deep</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.040" end="00:47:25.260" style="s2">learning which i think is part of what</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.110" end="00:47:28.110" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about as well here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.260" end="00:47:30.660" style="s2">and that is you know i immediately</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.110" end="00:47:33.540" style="s2">thought of general relativity when you</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.660" end="00:47:36.090" style="s2">said that einstein wanted to call</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.540" end="00:47:38.400" style="s2">invariants theory but we are relatively</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.090" end="00:47:41.430" style="s2">theory right and we have this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.400" end="00:47:43.230" style="s2">the vast number of changing frames of</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.430" end="00:47:46.500" style="s2">reference that have to be taken into</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.230" end="00:47:49.020" style="s2">account in some kind of expanded</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.500" end="00:47:51.870" style="s2">geometrical hyperspace so it seems very</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.020" end="00:47:54.390" style="s2">complex but it&#39;s also very simplifying</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.870" end="00:47:57.350" style="s2">because he&#39;s looking for the non varying</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.390" end="00:48:01.560" style="s2">qualities across all frames of reference</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.350" end="00:48:03.920" style="s2">that increase the the evolution beyond</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.560" end="00:48:06.180" style="s2">Newtonian mechanics involved the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.920" end="00:48:09.690" style="s2">simultaneous refining and simplifying</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.180" end="00:48:12.260" style="s2">and vast expanse that&#39;s great that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.690" end="00:48:14.910" style="s2">wonderful that&#39;s very good I like that I</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.260" end="00:48:17.910" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that he was actually wanted</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.910" end="00:48:20.670" style="s2">to follow that&#39;s really amazing we all</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.910" end="00:48:22.770" style="s2">like the argument is we knew about the</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.670" end="00:48:24.990" style="s2">relativity thing already Galileo had</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.770" end="00:48:26.850" style="s2">described the relativity of measurements</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.990" end="00:48:29.430" style="s2">and frames of references the problem was</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.850" end="00:48:31.740" style="s2">how do you overcome the relativity by</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.430" end="00:48:33.870" style="s2">finding what is invariant I have the</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.740" end="00:48:36.930" style="s2">speed of light presented itself as a</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.870" end="00:48:40.170" style="s2">good option that&#39;s fantastic Thank You</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.930" end="00:48:44.370" style="s2">Linda thank you for that thanks first of</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.170" end="00:48:45.900" style="s2">all just a good fact to know both for</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.370" end="00:48:48.150" style="s2">physics and for cognitive science that</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.900" end="00:48:51.180" style="s2">interesting the night sky as an example</p>

<p begin="00:48:51.180" end="00:48:53.770" style="s2">also just as a pertinent metaphor for</p>

<p begin="00:48:56.560" end="00:49:02.170" style="s2">way you keep reminding me because it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.980" end="00:49:03.580" style="s2">it is about Kuna even a bias and like</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.170" end="00:49:05.440" style="s2">because although I&#39;ve been working</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.580" end="00:49:08.440" style="s2">really hard with the help of others</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.440" end="00:49:10.300" style="s2">between addressing I often don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.440" end="00:49:11.710" style="s2">do think about descriptive cognition</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.300" end="00:49:13.480" style="s2">more and more but I I don&#39;t give enough</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.710" end="00:49:16.540" style="s2">to sort of what you might call the</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.480" end="00:49:23.470" style="s2">socio-political aspect of this just</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.540" end="00:49:25.750" style="s2">because I&#39;m so critical of their</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.470" end="00:49:28.600" style="s2">ideological tyranny and the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.750" end="00:49:31.810" style="s2">sort of the way it terrorizes discourse</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.600" end="00:49:34.840" style="s2">so much but what every time you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.810" end="00:49:38.700" style="s2">invoked it I found it to be well and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.840" end="00:49:38.700" style="s2">scum I found it to be a justification</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.130" end="00:49:48.310" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s an interesting field and I you</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.770" end="00:49:49.930" style="s2">know people who are working on the arts</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.310" end="00:49:52.510" style="s2">the sciences the self development</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.930" end="00:49:55.450" style="s2">practices anything where it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.510" end="00:49:58.660" style="s2">about human interiors or interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.450" end="00:50:00.940" style="s2">relationships can often have a gap when</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.660" end="00:50:03.930" style="s2">it comes to politics the end and</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.940" end="00:50:06.730" style="s2">legitimately so because it seems so</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.930" end="00:50:09.940" style="s2">flawed and trapped in its own category</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.730" end="00:50:11.790" style="s2">sets yeah and the people you hear talk</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.940" end="00:50:15.940" style="s2">about it are very often either</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.790" end="00:50:17.620" style="s2">dismissive or zealots yeah yeah but when</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.940" end="00:50:18.940" style="s2">you start to think through like if</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.620" end="00:50:21.190" style="s2">you&#39;re working on a project and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.940" end="00:50:24.250" style="s2">think how do we develop people how do we</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.190" end="00:50:27.700" style="s2">make a civilization of higher practices</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.250" end="00:50:29.590" style="s2">well you know what kinds of operative</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.700" end="00:50:31.300" style="s2">social and economic systems would allow</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.590" end="00:50:32.710" style="s2">for that and which ones start to</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.300" end="00:50:36.400" style="s2">interfere with that right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.710" end="00:50:38.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a way of unpacking science and</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.400" end="00:50:41.800" style="s2">Dharma into politics I think in a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.350" end="00:50:43.510" style="s2">simple way that we often don&#39;t do just</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.800" end="00:50:46.510" style="s2">because it seems like such a murky</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.510" end="00:50:47.380" style="s2">territory yeah yeah I think that was</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.510" end="00:50:52.120" style="s2">very well said</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.380" end="00:50:53.530" style="s2">at some point we&#39;re running at a pun</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.120" end="00:50:55.600" style="s2">today so don&#39;t want to jump on that but</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.530" end="00:50:58.540" style="s2">I&#39;d like to have a conversation with you</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.600" end="00:51:01.360" style="s2">about exactly that topic because it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.540" end="00:51:03.760" style="s2">but I mean I think I have well you would</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.360" end="00:51:06.360" style="s2">know that you have legitimate criticism</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.760" end="00:51:09.690" style="s2">or how we&#39;ve descended if you</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.360" end="00:51:12.000" style="s2">this aerial zero-sum game and that there</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.690" end="00:51:13.890" style="s2">are we&#39;re into the tyranny of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.000" end="00:51:15.900" style="s2">propositional and all kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.890" end="00:51:18.150" style="s2">that I think should politically be</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.900" end="00:51:21.300" style="s2">criticized and how they contribute to an</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.150" end="00:51:23.280" style="s2">exacerbate the meeting crisis but I want</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.300" end="00:51:27.330" style="s2">to acknowledge that there&#39;s an area that</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.280" end="00:51:31.260" style="s2">I well that I&#39;m not seeing through these</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.330" end="00:51:33.150" style="s2">are right and I&#39;d invite you to to talk</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.260" end="00:51:36.660" style="s2">more about that if you like because I</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.150" end="00:51:38.730" style="s2">think that&#39;d be very interesting III I</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.660" end="00:51:41.880" style="s2">have a good faith in you that you would</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.730" end="00:51:44.910" style="s2">be able to follow through on the framing</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.880" end="00:51:48.060" style="s2">you just posed which is to try and get</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.910" end="00:51:51.560" style="s2">this into a more helpful framing rather</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.060" end="00:51:54.720" style="s2">than in what to be fair what its</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.560" end="00:51:56.340" style="s2">prevalently sort of ossified into in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.720" end="00:51:57.750" style="s2">lot of ways well I would like that very</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.340" end="00:51:59.070" style="s2">much I would enjoy that very much</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.750" end="00:52:01.020" style="s2">yeah I think that would be an</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.070" end="00:52:04.590" style="s2">interesting topic for us to go at and</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.020" end="00:52:06.390" style="s2">for me I come from the angle of my own</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.590" end="00:52:09.600" style="s2">understanding of what I mean by religion</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.390" end="00:52:12.030" style="s2">yes it&#39;s the sort of social and</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.600" end="00:52:13.950" style="s2">interpersonal analog of this process of</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.030" end="00:52:17.130" style="s2">the production of an excess coherence</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.950" end="00:52:20.670" style="s2">within the individual subsystems that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.130" end="00:52:23.160" style="s2">immediately a political affair right</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.670" end="00:52:23.910" style="s2">it&#39;s a part of and that&#39;s what you just</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.160" end="00:52:26.730" style="s2">said was beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.910" end="00:52:28.500" style="s2">we&#39;re going to this conversation be</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.730" end="00:52:30.570" style="s2">careful here because we&#39;re coming close</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.500" end="00:52:36.120" style="s2">because that&#39;s exactly one of my</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.570" end="00:52:38.130" style="s2">criticisms that politics is I&#39;ll use</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.120" end="00:52:40.680" style="s2">neighbors distinction of manifest and</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.130" end="00:52:42.660" style="s2">it&#39;s manifesting secular but it&#39;s latent</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.680" end="00:52:46.200" style="s2">ly deeply religious and then it often</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.660" end="00:52:48.510" style="s2">comes off as something verging on a</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.200" end="00:52:50.670" style="s2">pseudo religion precisely because it</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.510" end="00:52:54.900" style="s2">won&#39;t acknowledge the religion with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.670" end="00:52:56.790" style="s2">religiosity what is doing because I</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.900" end="00:52:58.830" style="s2">think of a mistake that that will</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.790" end="00:53:02.070" style="s2">somehow violate you know the separation</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.830" end="00:53:03.620" style="s2">of church and state which is a policy</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.070" end="00:53:08.910" style="s2">decision which is a very different from</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.620" end="00:53:11.670" style="s2">drawing theoretical connections so like</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.910" end="00:53:13.440" style="s2">yes I want more on that right I used</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.670" end="00:53:16.230" style="s2">exactly that part of it because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.440" end="00:53:19.280" style="s2">part of my my team I don&#39;t like the way</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.230" end="00:53:21.020" style="s2">and I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m stating that by almost</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.280" end="00:53:23.960" style="s2">I&#39;m not just making criticism there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.020" end="00:53:27.830" style="s2">something about me that is put off by</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.960" end="00:53:29.869" style="s2">the way politics tries to take the place</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.830" end="00:53:32.330" style="s2">of religion and that we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.869" end="00:53:35.240" style="s2">disastrous consequences because of that</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.330" end="00:53:39.770" style="s2">on in the 20th century and so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.240" end="00:53:42.680" style="s2">know what it&#39;s like to unpack politics</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.770" end="00:53:44.960" style="s2">the way you&#39;re suggesting that like that</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.680" end="00:53:47.000" style="s2">accounts for its religiosity without</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.960" end="00:53:48.859" style="s2">falling into the Titanic evils of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.000" end="00:53:50.660" style="s2">pseudo religious ideologies that have</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.859" end="00:53:54.770" style="s2">drenched the world in flight that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.660" end="00:53:58.130" style="s2">that&#39;s for me that a really difficult</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.770" end="00:54:01.820" style="s2">problem of a get expanding this to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.130" end="00:54:03.590" style="s2">political domain sure well I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.820" end="00:54:06.260" style="s2">make sure not to say anything about that</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.590" end="00:54:08.420" style="s2">so that we can go in fresh yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.260" end="00:54:10.520" style="s2">time to work on that I&#39;m gonna bring us</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.420" end="00:54:12.980" style="s2">back around in a weird way by touching</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.520" end="00:54:16.270" style="s2">on your brief meta comment about how</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.980" end="00:54:19.340" style="s2">this is going yeah because I had two</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.270" end="00:54:23.800" style="s2">flashes well you said the first was that</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.340" end="00:54:23.800" style="s2">this process of bringing things together</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.760" end="00:54:32.300" style="s2">which is ideally trans rational rather</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.430" end="00:54:34.580" style="s2">than pre rational yes that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.300" end="00:54:36.500" style="s2">that&#39;s the way you have to go at it if</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.580" end="00:54:38.839" style="s2">what you want to hear is the leading</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.500" end="00:54:40.490" style="s2">edge of someone&#39;s insight into</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.839" end="00:54:42.589" style="s2">structures yes</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.490" end="00:54:46.460" style="s2">that kind of falls out of them during</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.589" end="00:54:52.040" style="s2">that process whereas a propositional</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.460" end="00:54:53.960" style="s2">debate is based on previously solidified</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.040" end="00:54:56.540" style="s2">assertions that you&#39;re gonna build up</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.960" end="00:55:00.290" style="s2">right so that&#39;s a very important process</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.540" end="00:55:02.869" style="s2">in our social evolution however it gets</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.290" end="00:55:05.900" style="s2">in the way of the immediacy of staying</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.869" end="00:55:10.220" style="s2">at our shared leading edge yeah unlike</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.900" end="00:55:13.160" style="s2">that and the other part of it is I had</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.220" end="00:55:15.380" style="s2">that that&#39;s how I see me chase idea of</p>

<p begin="00:56:24.200" end="00:56:29.420" style="s2">overflow that you talk about I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.060" end="00:56:33.170" style="s2">that for me if that&#39;s that&#39;s me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.420" end="00:56:36.470" style="s2">the defining feature of this now the</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.170" end="00:56:38.930" style="s2">Nietzschean core puts me in mind of he</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.470" end="00:56:42.020" style="s2">gave one clear example of the evil bitch</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.930" end="00:56:44.180" style="s2">it is writing it&#39;s good time which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.020" end="00:56:46.010" style="s2">not what most people think and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.180" end="00:56:48.500" style="s2">really interesting I just I was just</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.010" end="00:56:51.560" style="s2">sitting in on somebody who&#39;s defending a</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.500" end="00:56:53.690" style="s2">thesis on good and Barfield and Steiner</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.560" end="00:56:55.099" style="s2">and the whole new way of seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.690" end="00:56:57.349" style="s2">whole way of newly doing science which</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.099" end="00:56:59.390" style="s2">is all about participatory conformity</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.349" end="00:57:01.940" style="s2">and coupling to the phenomena rather</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.390" end="00:57:04.250" style="s2">than just objectively representing and</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.940" end="00:57:07.700" style="s2">predicting about it and so it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.250" end="00:57:11.930" style="s2">it&#39;s about science practice biologically</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.700" end="00:57:16.220" style="s2">right rather than just predictably and</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.930" end="00:57:20.300" style="s2">so I was thinking about what if Goethe</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.220" end="00:57:22.310" style="s2">is teaching being honest and it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.300" end="00:57:24.470" style="s2">hard to tell him he&#39;s playing or he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.310" end="00:57:27.200" style="s2">saying right but if let&#39;s say he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.470" end="00:57:29.450" style="s2">saying rather than just playing good to</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.200" end="00:57:31.010" style="s2">is the example of the new revenge then I</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.450" end="00:57:32.839" style="s2">think your interpretation that you just</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.010" end="00:57:36.200" style="s2">made there it&#39;s actually a very good one</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.839" end="00:57:38.839" style="s2">because I mean that&#39;s exactly the kind</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.200" end="00:57:40.670" style="s2">of relationship I think good and good to</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.839" end="00:57:43.609" style="s2">what I was hoping that you know in this</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.670" end="00:57:45.470" style="s2">on knowing flow you get then you realize</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.609" end="00:57:48.170" style="s2">the earth form of the foot on</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.470" end="00:57:49.700" style="s2">like almost in the Platonic sense I get</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.170" end="00:57:52.040" style="s2">to go through this neat transformative</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.700" end="00:57:54.020" style="s2">deep learning all this stuff we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.040" end="00:57:56.740" style="s2">talking about and then the phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.020" end="00:58:00.640" style="s2">right actually discloses itself to you</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.740" end="00:58:03.200" style="s2">yeah dirty&#39; is a very good example of</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.640" end="00:58:04.760" style="s2">what I would call an authentic religious</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.200" end="00:58:06.910" style="s2">figure whether they&#39;re socially</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.760" end="00:58:09.950" style="s2">recognized as being that or not but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.910" end="00:58:13.520" style="s2">science and art and poetry and ecology</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.950" end="00:58:16.640" style="s2">and botany and like down the line he</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.520" end="00:58:19.430" style="s2">embodies an integration of the genres of</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.640" end="00:58:21.470" style="s2">social activity in a way that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.430" end="00:58:24.260" style="s2">manifest itself as some transcendental</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.470" end="00:58:28.970" style="s2">quality about his historical person as</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.260" end="00:58:30.710" style="s2">well so that&#39;s very very well said ok</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.970" end="00:58:32.900" style="s2">well I think that&#39;s a good place to</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.710" end="00:58:36.260" style="s2">perhaps try to bring it to a close we</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.900" end="00:58:40.310" style="s2">know right here next time for politics</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.260" end="00:58:44.690" style="s2">yeah that would be really thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.310" end="00:58:48.680" style="s2">this discussion well this is via logos</p>
