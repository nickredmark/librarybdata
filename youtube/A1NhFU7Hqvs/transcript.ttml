<p begin="00:02:28.180" end="00:02:33.220" style="s2">source protest goes back to the open</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.069" end="00:02:36.519" style="s2">source development model we saw it move</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.220" end="00:02:39.700" style="s2">from software development to warfare and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.519" end="00:02:44.379" style="s2">there Iraq war and then we saw it porta</p>

<p begin="00:02:47.410" end="00:02:54.220" style="s2">there we&#39;ve seen it used in Puerto Rico</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.099" end="00:02:57.579" style="s2">to topple the governor and in variety of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.220" end="00:03:01.690" style="s2">other places what it basically is is is</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.579" end="00:03:03.700" style="s2">a protest or a movement that comes</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.690" end="00:03:06.120" style="s2">together very very quickly based on a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.700" end="00:03:09.160" style="s2">single plausible promise a single idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.120" end="00:03:11.349" style="s2">it&#39;s the only thing you can get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.160" end="00:03:13.480" style="s2">people to agree on it&#39;s it&#39;s got to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.349" end="00:03:16.989" style="s2">simple and it&#39;s got to be actionable and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.480" end="00:03:21.190" style="s2">it has to actually be proven successful</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.989" end="00:03:24.489" style="s2">enough to generate a crowd and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.190" end="00:03:27.880" style="s2">people that assemble to support it to</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.489" end="00:03:29.470" style="s2">move it forward towards completion come</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.880" end="00:03:30.940" style="s2">from variety different backgrounds they</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.470" end="00:03:33.930" style="s2">have a lot of different reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.940" end="00:03:37.060" style="s2">protesting for joining the movement and</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.930" end="00:03:40.180" style="s2">they don&#39;t necessarily agree with each</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.060" end="00:03:41.859" style="s2">other okay they can be a polar opposites</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.180" end="00:03:44.500" style="s2">because what we saw in the Iraq war and</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.859" end="00:03:46.600" style="s2">the open source of services that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.500" end="00:03:49.750" style="s2">were 70 different groups and there were</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.600" end="00:03:51.190" style="s2">a bunch of different flavors of jihadi</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.750" end="00:03:53.139" style="s2">that would knife each other if they were</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.190" end="00:03:57.220" style="s2">in the same room they had criminal</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.139" end="00:04:00.359" style="s2">organizations they had nationalists that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.220" end="00:04:03.069" style="s2">supported by sort of supported a Saddam</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.359" end="00:04:05.590" style="s2">those who didn&#39;t and the same thing we</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.069" end="00:04:09.609" style="s2">saw there is something that we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.590" end="00:04:13.540" style="s2">now in this protest is that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.609" end="00:04:16.180" style="s2">who wanted the protest Trump and wanted</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.540" end="00:04:18.789" style="s2">the protest to current environment use</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.180" end="00:04:21.340" style="s2">this as a way of doing that and they all</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.789" end="00:04:23.110" style="s2">joined and anyone who is interested in</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.340" end="00:04:26.740" style="s2">destabilizing the United States joined</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.110" end="00:04:27.310" style="s2">in also so we have the bulk of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.740" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.310" end="00:04:33.460" style="s2">are operating on a relatively peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:36.850" style="s2">basis but we also have more violent</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.460" end="00:04:41.760" style="s2">elements slotting themselves in to try</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.850" end="00:04:44.680" style="s2">to destabilize it to get it to reach a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.760" end="00:04:46.810" style="s2">different level of engagement with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.680" end="00:04:49.450" style="s2">US what do you what is the plausible</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.810" end="00:04:51.910" style="s2">promise here what is what is attracting</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.450" end="00:04:54.880" style="s2">these disparate groups to coalesce in</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.910" end="00:04:57.730" style="s2">this very moment to take action yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.880" end="00:05:01.900" style="s2">well I&#39;m seeing a lot of more elements</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.730" end="00:05:04.690" style="s2">in this one what seems to be the basis</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.900" end="00:05:06.100" style="s2">of this is that it&#39;s a equalizing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.690" end="00:05:10.090" style="s2">power relationship between the police</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.100" end="00:05:12.360" style="s2">and the populace defanging the police</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.090" end="00:05:15.820" style="s2">I&#39;m making them less effective at</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.360" end="00:05:18.160" style="s2">calling a protest or being able to exert</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.820" end="00:05:21.550" style="s2">power from the from the establishment or</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.160" end="00:05:23.169" style="s2">those who are in charge um that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.550" end="00:05:25.150" style="s2">be the kind of objective we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.169" end="00:05:27.250" style="s2">that in the defunding efforts we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.150" end="00:05:29.229" style="s2">seeing that in the you know pledging of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.250" end="00:05:31.260" style="s2">support where people are kneeling you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.229" end="00:05:36.190" style="s2">kind of giving your oath to the crowd</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.260" end="00:05:40.840" style="s2">and bending their knee taking a knee</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.190" end="00:05:42.570" style="s2">become spending any and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.840" end="00:05:44.800" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the core focus and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.570" end="00:05:48.190" style="s2">anything that moves it along towards</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.800" end="00:05:50.890" style="s2">that tends to be the accepted by the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.190" end="00:05:53.169" style="s2">crowd and supported an advanced do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.890" end="00:05:55.660" style="s2">think that that is the goal or that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.169" end="00:05:57.669" style="s2">an intermediate goal but equalizing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.660" end="00:06:00.370" style="s2">power between the people and the police</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.669" end="00:06:02.350" style="s2">is that is that the end destination or</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.370" end="00:06:04.660" style="s2">is this just like a hop on the way to</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.350" end="00:06:06.660" style="s2">the long-range destination and what and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.660" end="00:06:09.400" style="s2">if so what do you think that might be</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.660" end="00:06:11.620" style="s2">well for this protest that is the end</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.400" end="00:06:14.169" style="s2">destination so okay soon as that</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.620" end="00:06:16.979" style="s2">dissolves as soon as that either Forks</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.169" end="00:06:20.169" style="s2">too much that it becomes diffused and</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.979" end="00:06:22.960" style="s2">ineffective or achieves a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.169" end="00:06:25.390" style="s2">relative success and that it causes a</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.960" end="00:06:27.039" style="s2">lot of defunding events a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.390" end="00:06:29.410" style="s2">reorganizations and police departments</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.039" end="00:06:32.740" style="s2">forcing police into the defensive Crouch</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.410" end="00:06:35.830" style="s2">they don&#39;t engage with crowds they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.740" end="00:06:38.979" style="s2">take action when the teeth you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.830" end="00:06:42.000" style="s2">street crime or property crime like</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.979" end="00:06:45.190" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing in some some states</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.000" end="00:06:47.770" style="s2">then it will fall apart and there has to</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.190" end="00:06:50.140" style="s2">be another reason for that for the open</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.770" end="00:06:52.600" style="s2">source protests to come together I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.140" end="00:06:54.610" style="s2">open sources is very you know this kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.600" end="00:06:57.460" style="s2">of open source movement protest is very</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.610" end="00:06:59.140" style="s2">good at rapid mobilization when look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.460" end="00:07:01.900" style="s2">this I mean what other protest could go</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.140" end="00:07:04.090" style="s2">to 2800 different cities around the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.900" end="00:07:06.730" style="s2">world in a matter of days</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.090" end="00:07:10.540" style="s2">I mean you it&#39;s an organizational feat</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.730" end="00:07:12.310" style="s2">that just can&#39;t be matched in using</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.540" end="00:07:14.350" style="s2">other organizational methodologies and</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.310" end="00:07:18.670" style="s2">the tens of millions of people that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.350" end="00:07:21.310" style="s2">showed up to support it it&#39;s a and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.670" end="00:07:24.100" style="s2">very effective it&#39;s built to take on</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.310" end="00:07:26.470" style="s2">bigger foes I mean the insurgency in</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.100" end="00:07:28.630" style="s2">Iraq was built to take on the US</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.470" end="00:07:30.760" style="s2">military I mean in the US military being</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.630" end="00:07:33.430" style="s2">that the sole superpower at the time was</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.760" end="00:07:36.400" style="s2">supposed to be good enough and had the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.430" end="00:07:37.990" style="s2">resources that had the bench necessary</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.400" end="00:07:40.570" style="s2">to defeat it but that open-sourced</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.990" end="00:07:43.120" style="s2">insurgent dynamic allowed them to hold</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.570" end="00:07:44.790" style="s2">it at a standstill basically wear it out</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.120" end="00:07:47.260" style="s2">over the course of three or four years</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.790" end="00:07:48.910" style="s2">patience patience very important and for</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.260" end="00:07:51.310" style="s2">a generation war and that is for sure</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.910" end="00:07:53.140" style="s2">Adam what do you think about John&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.310" end="00:07:54.730" style="s2">about the plausible promise being the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.140" end="00:07:57.010" style="s2">thing that&#39;s attracting all these groups</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.730" end="00:07:58.870" style="s2">together do you agree with that do you</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.010" end="00:08:01.260" style="s2">think that the promise is accurate how</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.870" end="00:08:06.550" style="s2">do you see it what&#39;s motivating people</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.260" end="00:08:10.480" style="s2">um well I of course I agree John&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.550" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">authority there are very I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.480" end="00:08:14.890" style="s2">selective about what information I allow</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:18.850" style="s2">in because once it&#39;s kind of in my head</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.890" end="00:08:22.360" style="s2">is such a tedious process to extract it</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.850" end="00:08:25.030" style="s2">and it takes so much effort to take it</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.360" end="00:08:27.010" style="s2">out of my head so uh you know I&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.030" end="00:08:29.530" style="s2">John&#39;s book uh I&#39;ll give you a little</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.010" end="00:08:31.720" style="s2">bit of background and to answer your</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.530" end="00:08:33.370" style="s2">question for it and John and I discussed</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.720" end="00:08:35.830" style="s2">this a little bit yesterday going back</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.370" end="00:08:39.490" style="s2">four years I was a fan of John&#39;s blog</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.830" end="00:08:41.050" style="s2">before he had a patreon and I I called</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.490" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">John and I was very interested in his</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.050" end="00:08:46.540" style="s2">Brazilian cities both and what I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:51.250" style="s2">seeing within some very good friends of</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.540" end="00:08:54.070" style="s2">mine who ran forensic nodes against the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.250" end="00:08:57.100" style="s2">Bitcoin mining operations</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.070" end="00:08:58.990" style="s2">had overwhelmed Venezuela which I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.100" end="00:09:00.340" style="s2">John probably know is kind of on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.990" end="00:09:05.770" style="s2">periphery about which is where these</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.340" end="00:09:07.750" style="s2">gangs took over towns and and how much</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.770" end="00:09:11.320" style="s2">of that was the elites within Venezuela</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.750" end="00:09:12.970" style="s2">and and the petrol and how it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.320" end="00:09:14.590" style="s2">unknown but nevertheless they were</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.970" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">stripping towns of all the electricity</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.590" end="00:09:18.460" style="s2">and it was done not only as an extortion</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:21.760" style="s2">scheme but it was a done it was a done</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.460" end="00:09:23.850" style="s2">as a way to and not just take over the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.760" end="00:09:26.410" style="s2">towns but it was it was done as a way to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.850" end="00:09:28.540" style="s2">install new administrations because if</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.410" end="00:09:29.920" style="s2">you control the electricity you control</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.540" end="00:09:31.300" style="s2">the town right it&#39;s the same thing you</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.920" end="00:09:34.510" style="s2">hand up from antalya with the bitcoin</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.300" end="00:09:39.340" style="s2">mining farms and and everything that so</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.510" end="00:09:40.660" style="s2">I was much more interested John and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.340" end="00:09:42.670" style="s2">spoke at that time four years ago and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.660" end="00:09:44.380" style="s2">was very interested in okay well in New</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.670" end="00:09:46.840" style="s2">York City we don&#39;t have that right we</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.380" end="00:09:49.590" style="s2">don&#39;t have that type of infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.840" end="00:09:54.280" style="s2">vulnerability we don&#39;t have that type of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.590" end="00:09:55.930" style="s2">a four D warfare on our electrical grid</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.280" end="00:09:57.130" style="s2">going on which is what you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.930" end="00:09:59.730" style="s2">happening throughout the world that</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.130" end="00:10:02.140" style="s2">Americans are just so lucky we don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.730" end="00:10:04.420" style="s2">which is the protest will take over</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.140" end="00:10:07.150" style="s2">actually apparatus of the other go it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.420" end="00:10:10.240" style="s2">really wild to say so I was very</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.150" end="00:10:13.000" style="s2">interested and John will probably recall</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.240" end="00:10:14.590" style="s2">it because I you know we we refreshed</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.000" end="00:10:17.590" style="s2">our memories on yesterday I said well</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.590" end="00:10:19.540" style="s2">how will this exhibit itself within New</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.590" end="00:10:21.040" style="s2">York and if it does become this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.540" end="00:10:23.910" style="s2">a system this type of open warfare</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.040" end="00:10:26.430" style="s2">system the John you know elegantly has</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.910" end="00:10:30.940" style="s2">you know described throughout his career</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.430" end="00:10:32.800" style="s2">then how how can we respond to that and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.940" end="00:10:34.690" style="s2">I was very interested I anticipated the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.800" end="00:10:39.760" style="s2">crisis is we were going through now at</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.690" end="00:10:41.890" style="s2">least you know not with a severity and</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.760" end="00:10:43.300" style="s2">not with us as much operational support</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.890" end="00:10:45.010" style="s2">as they&#39;ve been given by media and</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.300" end="00:10:48.250" style="s2">everything else but I certainly saw that</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.010" end="00:10:50.020" style="s2">this was the way it was going so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.250" end="00:10:51.130" style="s2">reached out to John four years ago and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.020" end="00:10:54.580" style="s2">said well John when this comes to</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.130" end="00:10:56.410" style="s2">America in this form how can we respond</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.580" end="00:10:58.090" style="s2">and locally within New York where I know</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.410" end="00:11:00.030" style="s2">everybody I know all the politicians I</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.090" end="00:11:03.850" style="s2">know what power lead I know everything</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.030" end="00:11:07.420" style="s2">was our best way of responding to it in</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.850" end="00:11:11.410" style="s2">a healthy in a healthy way I live here</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.420" end="00:11:13.540" style="s2">how can I kind of mitigate all the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.410" end="00:11:15.610" style="s2">agitation and everything else both</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.540" end="00:11:17.320" style="s2">politically and do I just pack up and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.610" end="00:11:19.050" style="s2">move I saw was coming on I said do I</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.320" end="00:11:22.510" style="s2">just get the heck out in New York and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.050" end="00:11:25.570" style="s2">and hopefully I can outrun the mom so</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.510" end="00:11:27.790" style="s2">jobs at work spurt I defer to John when</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.570" end="00:11:31.510" style="s2">the way of saying I defer to John John</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.790" end="00:11:33.279" style="s2">there whatever he says well it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.510" end="00:11:34.959" style="s2">argue with that I guess John one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.279" end="00:11:37.089" style="s2">things that I was wondering about you</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.959" end="00:11:38.560" style="s2">mentioned the phrase how to fork the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.089" end="00:11:40.630" style="s2">inner you mentioned the phrase fork the</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.560" end="00:11:43.360" style="s2">insurgency I&#39;m slightly familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.630" end="00:11:45.279" style="s2">that when it comes to like crypto and</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.360" end="00:11:47.320" style="s2">blockchain events and and things like</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.279" end="00:11:49.570" style="s2">that I&#39;m not an expert on it by any</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.320" end="00:11:51.250" style="s2">means whatsoever but I do understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.570" end="00:11:52.899" style="s2">what you mean by fork the insurgency in</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.250" end="00:11:55.390" style="s2">a sense of like splitting these groups</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.899" end="00:11:58.269" style="s2">away from their the the goal that</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.390" end="00:12:00.250" style="s2">they&#39;ve coalesced around how have you</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.269" end="00:12:01.990" style="s2">seen maybe that playing out is it</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.250" end="00:12:04.450" style="s2">playing out the anticipated playing out</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.990" end="00:12:06.910" style="s2">if not is there something that you could</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.450" end="00:12:10.329" style="s2">suggest if you were in such a position</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.910" end="00:12:12.310" style="s2">to make advice about how to fork an</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.329" end="00:12:16.750" style="s2">insurgency like this and how to split</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.310" end="00:12:18.459" style="s2">the groups yeah yeah a fork is what</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.750" end="00:12:22.300" style="s2">happens to an open source movement when</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.459" end="00:12:24.220" style="s2">a smaller group decides to pursue</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.300" end="00:12:26.529" style="s2">difficult and they convince enough of</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.220" end="00:12:28.899" style="s2">those people were formally participating</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.529" end="00:12:32.620" style="s2">in in the and the bigger movement to</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.899" end="00:12:36.310" style="s2">come with it and it can also have kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.620" end="00:12:38.380" style="s2">of larger effects like for instance in</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.310" end="00:12:40.450" style="s2">the Iraq war and the reason why we were</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.380" end="00:12:44.200" style="s2">able to you know wrap it up to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.450" end="00:12:46.360" style="s2">degree is that a subsection of the Iraqi</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.200" end="00:12:50.380" style="s2">insurgency decided to blow up the golden</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.360" end="00:12:53.529" style="s2">mosque and that incident caused the Shia</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.380" end="00:12:57.010" style="s2">militias to start at the cleansing in</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.529" end="00:12:59.949" style="s2">Baghdad and that I mean massive militias</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.010" end="00:13:01.449" style="s2">walking through the you know the town</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.949" end="00:13:05.589" style="s2">taking out neighborhood after</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.449" end="00:13:07.870" style="s2">neighborhood and that put the the tribal</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.589" end="00:13:10.050" style="s2">elements as you know that we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.870" end="00:13:13.630" style="s2">in as part of the and the neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.050" end="00:13:16.089" style="s2">in Baghdad at risk they were fighting</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.630" end="00:13:19.209" style="s2">both the United States and these massive</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.089" end="00:13:20.550" style="s2">Shia militias and that caused them to</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.209" end="00:13:22.050" style="s2">give up the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.550" end="00:13:25.589" style="s2">cutting a deal with the US for</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.050" end="00:13:27.060" style="s2">protection and luckily we&#39;re able to see</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.589" end="00:13:29.490" style="s2">the signal and actually see it because</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.060" end="00:13:31.050" style="s2">I&#39;m in a wrote an article out bet in 95</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.490" end="00:13:33.360" style="s2">in the in the New York Times that</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.050" end="00:13:34.800" style="s2">basically said this is how this is how</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.360" end="00:13:36.810" style="s2">you solve it get the sheet militias to</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.800" end="00:13:38.760" style="s2">start doing something like this horrible</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.810" end="00:13:41.130" style="s2">way of doing it but it was a way of</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.760" end="00:13:43.110" style="s2">running it to a conclusion so three</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.130" end="00:13:45.950" style="s2">years later that&#39;s exactly what happened</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.110" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">but by chance so in this case some</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.950" end="00:13:52.680" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and what&#39;s potentially</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:55.410" style="s2">forking it well things like we saw would</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.680" end="00:13:58.589" style="s2">occupy okay where people start making</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.410" end="00:14:00.839" style="s2">lists of demands that are you know you</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.589" end="00:14:02.970" style="s2">know a mile long I mean they have you</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.839" end="00:14:04.290" style="s2">know laundry lists and they start to</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.970" end="00:14:06.209" style="s2">move off in all these different</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.290" end="00:14:08.160" style="s2">directions and their demands of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.209" end="00:14:10.769" style="s2">local City Council&#39;s and the demands of</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.160" end="00:14:12.029" style="s2">this has that become so onerous that</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.769" end="00:14:14.899" style="s2">people just don&#39;t take them seriously</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.029" end="00:14:16.980" style="s2">and people argue over it and they start</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.899" end="00:14:19.920" style="s2">dispersing from the movement we see a</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.980" end="00:14:24.300" style="s2">little bit of that with the paths I call</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.920" end="00:14:27.870" style="s2">it they call touch as that temporary</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.300" end="00:14:29.459" style="s2">autonomous loan in Seattle in that has a</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.870" end="00:14:32.579" style="s2">different motive its it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.459" end="00:14:35.370" style="s2">necessarily geared towards the possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.579" end="00:14:37.800" style="s2">promise of this protest they&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.370" end="00:14:39.930" style="s2">it at a different direction and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.800" end="00:14:41.940" style="s2">fork and it&#39;s almost a way to</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.930" end="00:14:44.040" style="s2">de-escalate an open-source protest is</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.940" end="00:14:48.060" style="s2">allow it to fork like that you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.040" end="00:14:49.560" style="s2">allow it to get off-topic and soak up</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.060" end="00:14:52.850" style="s2">their energies and start squabbling</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.560" end="00:14:56.250" style="s2">internally and that internal squabbles</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.850" end="00:14:59.190" style="s2">enough to shatter it and shatter the</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.250" end="00:15:01.529" style="s2">shadow the movement one thing one thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.190" end="00:15:02.910" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed about the guys in Chas and</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.529" end="00:15:04.500" style="s2">had them I&#39;m gonna ask you who do you</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.910" end="00:15:07.470" style="s2">think these people are in just a minute</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.500" end="00:15:09.449" style="s2">one thing I&#39;ve noticed about the Chad&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.470" end="00:15:12.300" style="s2">Fork which is a good way of calling it</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.449" end="00:15:14.520" style="s2">now is that they went from operating in</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.300" end="00:15:16.980" style="s2">a 4G space to basically going back to</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.520" end="00:15:18.839" style="s2">like trench warfare like now we have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.980" end="00:15:20.519" style="s2">perimeter we must defend the perimeter</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.839" end="00:15:22.529" style="s2">and it&#39;s like they&#39;re standing in a line</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.519" end="00:15:24.810" style="s2">with a gun against people trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.529" end="00:15:26.790" style="s2">in or out of where they are and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.810" end="00:15:30.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to me to be in line with</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.790" end="00:15:33.089" style="s2">like an insurgency a 4G insurgency in</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.420" end="00:15:33.850" style="s2">this in this context it seems to be sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.089" end="00:15:35.620" style="s2">of an error</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.850" end="00:15:38.620" style="s2">was made on the ground at least from my</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.620" end="00:15:41.800" style="s2">perspective and it is fascinating to see</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.620" end="00:15:44.259" style="s2">how the thing can splinter apart and if</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.800" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">somebody wanted to splinter it apart it</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.259" end="00:15:49.750" style="s2">sounds to me like one option would be to</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:51.160" style="s2">like float unreasonable demands try to</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.750" end="00:15:53.889" style="s2">make them look like they&#39;re coming from</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.160" end="00:15:55.959" style="s2">the insurgency group try to just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.889" end="00:15:58.240" style="s2">make them look absurd or make things as</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.959" end="00:16:01.300" style="s2">crazy as possible to make people lose</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.240" end="00:16:04.029" style="s2">interest it&#39;s interesting to think who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.300" end="00:16:05.800" style="s2">actually following along and this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.029" end="00:16:08.680" style="s2">something I really want to explore like</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.800" end="00:16:10.630" style="s2">Adam who do you think that people are in</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.680" end="00:16:12.550" style="s2">the protests who do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.630" end="00:16:15.639" style="s2">people are rioting who do you think the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.550" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">people are in Chaz are they the same are</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.639" end="00:16:19.870" style="s2">they different</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:22.269" style="s2">is it more as a sneakier than we think</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.870" end="00:16:25.569" style="s2">is it as obvious as they&#39;re saying like</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.269" end="00:16:27.730" style="s2">what do you think Adam do I also get to</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.569" end="00:16:28.839" style="s2">ask John questions because I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.730" end="00:16:31.149" style="s2">follow-up questions to what John just</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.839" end="00:16:32.740" style="s2">said do it and go forward Adam</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.149" end="00:16:36.790" style="s2">so it&#39;s interesting because I&#39;m watching</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.740" end="00:16:41.560" style="s2">the res the warlord it&#39;s a awesome the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.790" end="00:16:43.389" style="s2">whole thing is insane and if I had been</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.560" end="00:16:45.490" style="s2">given the opportunity if I was the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.389" end="00:16:47.920" style="s2">warlord of my own autonomous zone my</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.490" end="00:16:49.630" style="s2">list would be like ten times longer just</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.920" end="00:16:55.089" style="s2">say no I&#39;ve got a lot of things I want</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.630" end="00:16:57.250" style="s2">so I I don&#39;t know if you noticed but</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.089" end="00:16:59.380" style="s2">recently and I tweeted it out they had</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.250" end="00:17:02.380" style="s2">created this like community council for</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.380" end="00:17:06.579" style="s2">some type of civic resolution things did</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.380" end="00:17:10.390" style="s2">you see that John yeah Jack did you see</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.579" end="00:17:13.480" style="s2">it had like mine edits to it and it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.390" end="00:17:15.789" style="s2">mr. so remarkable thing just to watch</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.480" end="00:17:17.770" style="s2">this kind of I&#39;m not a lawyer so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.789" end="00:17:20.079" style="s2">understand it and John understands the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.770" end="00:17:21.970" style="s2">things in his own type of a in his own</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.079" end="00:17:25.030" style="s2">type of view I just look at it as just</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.970" end="00:17:27.130" style="s2">absolute chaos and and my friends from</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.030" end="00:17:28.960" style="s2">around the world looked at it and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.130" end="00:17:33.970" style="s2">kind of used to this type of chaos this</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.960" end="00:17:34.600" style="s2">type of in term insanity right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.970" end="00:17:36.610" style="s2">insanity</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.600" end="00:17:38.080" style="s2">and throughout those nine edits and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.610" end="00:17:40.000" style="s2">there was interesting because then that</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.080" end="00:17:43.500" style="s2">was or they tried to scrub it so I took</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.000" end="00:17:46.299" style="s2">screenshots of it just as it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.500" end="00:17:47.710" style="s2">memorialization of the insanity right</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.299" end="00:17:51.310" style="s2">and how it was kind of being</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.710" end="00:17:55.030" style="s2">but when they took that out uh was that</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.310" end="00:17:56.680" style="s2">then trying to resolve this fork so were</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.030" end="00:17:58.990" style="s2">they trying to take that for you said</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.680" end="00:18:01.060" style="s2">that the way these things divide up in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.990" end="00:18:02.560" style="s2">way they Fork is you know the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.060" end="00:18:04.540" style="s2">move in different direction so here was</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.560" end="00:18:06.370" style="s2">a direction and the loose credibility</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.540" end="00:18:08.560" style="s2">right by doing that they lose moral</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.370" end="00:18:09.640" style="s2">authorities or lose Authority and</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.560" end="00:18:11.350" style="s2">they&#39;ll lose their persuade that</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.640" end="00:18:13.450" style="s2">persuasion that they had that kept</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.350" end="00:18:17.790" style="s2">everybody contained so when they took</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.450" end="00:18:20.650" style="s2">out those are the civic resolution</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.790" end="00:18:22.380" style="s2">whatever that they have within Chas was</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.650" end="00:18:26.790" style="s2">that their way of trying to recapture</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.380" end="00:18:31.510" style="s2">that for that they saw splitting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.790" end="00:18:34.620" style="s2">yep yeah it&#39;s um anything in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.510" end="00:18:38.620" style="s2">off-topic anything that&#39;s off the main</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.620" end="00:18:40.390" style="s2">thrust of the movement is a fork so</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.620" end="00:18:43.630" style="s2">anything that was you know geared</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.390" end="00:18:47.680" style="s2">specifically to the Chas to specifically</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.630" end="00:18:51.070" style="s2">to you know certain needs that they had</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.680" end="00:18:54.880" style="s2">that weren&#39;t part of the movement is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.070" end="00:18:57.640" style="s2">full and yeah it&#39;s very hard because the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.880" end="00:18:59.800" style="s2">the chaotic elements in this are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.640" end="00:19:02.800" style="s2">extreme um there&#39;s a way around that</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.800" end="00:19:04.030" style="s2">though is that in an open-source protest</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.800" end="00:19:05.560" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be in</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.030" end="00:19:08.890" style="s2">just individuals it could be very</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.560" end="00:19:10.180" style="s2">tightly run groups okay and a tightly</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.890" end="00:19:14.080" style="s2">run group which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.180" end="00:19:15.490" style="s2">authoritarian in his nature is perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.080" end="00:19:21.250" style="s2">welcomed within the context of an</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.490" end="00:19:23.140" style="s2">open-source movement and if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.250" end="00:19:25.270" style="s2">tightly run group and you have access to</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.140" end="00:19:29.980" style="s2">it a temporary autonomous zone you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.270" end="00:19:31.990" style="s2">do really wild stuff and for instance in</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.980" end="00:19:35.170" style="s2">the Iraqi insurgency you know take over</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.990" end="00:19:37.690" style="s2">a Fallujah allowed them to open it up to</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.170" end="00:19:39.550" style="s2">bomb factories to all sorts of different</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.690" end="00:19:42.690" style="s2">development that allowed the insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.550" end="00:19:44.920" style="s2">to power those insurgency over the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.690" end="00:19:45.970" style="s2">course of the entire country over the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.920" end="00:19:50.020" style="s2">you know the breadth of the entire</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.970" end="00:19:52.690" style="s2">country so um the knowledge is or the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.020" end="00:19:55.600" style="s2">insight is it&#39;s a temporary zone it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.690" end="00:19:57.460" style="s2">headache but it&#39;s only temporary and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:19:59.110" style="s2">that allows you to do certain things and</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.460" end="00:20:00.760" style="s2">those things have to be focused on</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.110" end="00:20:03.340" style="s2">moving the insurgency for</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.760" end="00:20:06.220" style="s2">removing the movement for it if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.340" end="00:20:07.660" style="s2">start to have other ideas in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.220" end="00:20:10.270" style="s2">trying to make it permanent and try to</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.660" end="00:20:12.280" style="s2">do turn it into it a habitable zone or</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.270" end="00:20:13.990" style="s2">trying to you know have other demands</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.280" end="00:20:19.020" style="s2">for other grievances they have with the</p>

<p begin="00:20:19.020" end="00:20:24.220" style="s2">turns into something that well pretty</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.150" end="00:20:28.809" style="s2">soon after that movement slows down be</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.220" end="00:20:30.429" style="s2">rolled up right like the the original</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.809" end="00:20:32.320" style="s2">list of demands from black lives matter</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.429" end="00:20:34.090" style="s2">didn&#39;t include creating autonomous zones</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.320" end="00:20:36.429" style="s2">in the middle of our major cities right</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.090" end="00:20:40.690" style="s2">so we&#39;re ready to go distraction and</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.429" end="00:20:43.809" style="s2">this thing that Adams referencing the I</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.690" end="00:20:46.090" style="s2">think the acronym was crack ca RK</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.809" end="00:20:47.860" style="s2">something about a council and resolution</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.090" end="00:20:49.870" style="s2">or something and what he&#39;s referencing</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.860" end="00:20:51.190" style="s2">is the fact that they said okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.870" end="00:20:53.230" style="s2">gonna have five people on this council</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.190" end="00:20:54.580" style="s2">none of them are gonna be white dudes</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.230" end="00:20:56.590" style="s2">they&#39;re all good they&#39;re gonna be this</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.580" end="00:20:58.510" style="s2">that another and then the next edit was</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.590" end="00:21:00.280" style="s2">like okay well you forgot about this do</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.510" end="00:21:01.690" style="s2">you know the disabled green person from</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.280" end="00:21:03.510" style="s2">this part of the country okay we got to</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.690" end="00:21:06.309" style="s2">do that and they went through the whole</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.510" end="00:21:09.010" style="s2">intersectional slicing and dicing of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.309" end="00:21:10.690" style="s2">every oppressed group and they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.010" end="00:21:12.400" style="s2">oh crap we got to get even more people</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.690" end="00:21:14.169" style="s2">we need even more people and before you</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.400" end="00:21:16.179" style="s2">know it they were like four or five to</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.169" end="00:21:18.880" style="s2">like twelve different people and it just</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.179" end="00:21:21.910" style="s2">the absurdity of watching it happen sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.880" end="00:21:24.580" style="s2">of in real time was actually a great</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.910" end="00:21:27.220" style="s2">demonstration to see intersectionality</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.580" end="00:21:29.950" style="s2">in action intersectionality in the wild</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.220" end="00:21:32.950" style="s2">sort of how it works and how impossible</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.950" end="00:21:35.770" style="s2">it is to use it as a basis for social</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.950" end="00:21:38.250" style="s2">cohesion or the foundation of any future</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.770" end="00:21:40.780" style="s2">Society which is I think the goal</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.250" end="00:21:43.150" style="s2">intersectionality is clearly the moral</p>

<p begin="00:21:52.150" end="00:21:57.070" style="s2">me all kind of intrude within it here</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.370" end="00:22:00.130" style="s2">because you know I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m less</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.070" end="00:22:01.540" style="s2">interested in kind of the the driving</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.130" end="00:22:03.370" style="s2">ideology because I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.540" end="00:22:07.990" style="s2">particularly coherent right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.370" end="00:22:10.360" style="s2">there&#39;s no you know I my family were</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.990" end="00:22:13.150" style="s2">World War two vets and the history of</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.360" end="00:22:14.500" style="s2">the civil rights movement was uh how</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.150" end="00:22:16.240" style="s2">much that experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.500" end="00:22:17.860" style="s2">and John I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll know a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.240" end="00:22:19.960" style="s2">and other people who are you know vets</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.860" end="00:22:21.850" style="s2">will know a lot more kind of the history</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.960" end="00:22:24.730" style="s2">of this in a historical record but for</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.850" end="00:22:26.679" style="s2">my own studies which a fairly extensive</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.730" end="00:22:28.600" style="s2">I read over Taylor branch books and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.679" end="00:22:30.940" style="s2">know my own family which became academic</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.600" end="00:22:33.039" style="s2">Innes is you know that kind of black and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.940" end="00:22:34.090" style="s2">Jews uniting in the South uniting and</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.039" end="00:22:36.030" style="s2">this kind of conversion and</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.090" end="00:22:38.289" style="s2">transformation of the southern church</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.030" end="00:22:42.820" style="s2">that occurred after World War two when</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.289" end="00:22:44.020" style="s2">everybody came back from war and I can</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.820" end="00:22:45.909" style="s2">tell you about it from our own family</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.020" end="00:22:47.470" style="s2">experience it was a very real type of</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.909" end="00:22:49.600" style="s2">thing that people had never had a chance</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.470" end="00:22:54.309" style="s2">to meet before and so I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.600" end="00:22:56.520" style="s2">don&#39;t really assign what I&#39;m seeing to</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.309" end="00:22:59.650" style="s2">anything with an ideological or</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.520" end="00:23:01.030" style="s2">theological or historical nucleus to it</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.650" end="00:23:02.350" style="s2">and that&#39;s you know I was very</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.030" end="00:23:04.900" style="s2">interested in what John said about</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.350" end="00:23:09.490" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of one driving almost</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.900" end="00:23:10.780" style="s2">me that that moves the population and</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.490" end="00:23:12.490" style="s2">that&#39;s I suppose because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.780" end="00:23:18.429" style="s2">they&#39;re just gonna squabble within each</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.490" end="00:23:20.770" style="s2">other so I&#39;m less interested in in that</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.429" end="00:23:23.380" style="s2">and its intersection I thought the that</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.770" end="00:23:25.270" style="s2">crack thing was very interesting also</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.380" end="00:23:29.400" style="s2">because if you did the math at the end</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.270" end="00:23:31.570" style="s2">of it they had given they are divided</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.400" end="00:23:34.090" style="s2">initially they had divided Asians up</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.570" end="00:23:35.350" style="s2">kind of monolithically and they said hey</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.090" end="00:23:37.690" style="s2">if you&#39;re Asian you know this and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.350" end="00:23:39.880" style="s2">on this you know here you go and then if</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.690" end="00:23:44.380" style="s2">you did the math by edit nine they had</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.880" end="00:23:46.570" style="s2">given Asians basically a 2/5 they have</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.380" end="00:23:48.970" style="s2">two fifths for the Asians which I</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.570" end="00:23:52.500" style="s2">thought was remarkable that they did not</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.970" end="00:23:52.500" style="s2">even give them adequate representation</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.590" end="00:23:59.260" style="s2">so I&#39;m less interested in that because</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.890" end="00:24:01.150" style="s2">I&#39;m also I&#39;m because I realize that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.260" end="00:24:03.429" style="s2">has to deteriorate but now I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.150" end="00:24:05.679" style="s2">interested in watching as it has already</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.429" end="00:24:06.760" style="s2">crumbled right where it&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.679" end="00:24:08.200" style="s2">establishment now</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.760" end="00:24:10.360" style="s2">I mean if it&#39;s now such a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.200" end="00:24:12.730" style="s2">media and it&#39;s now become a tourist site</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.360" end="00:24:16.539" style="s2">it&#39;s a tourist destination at this point</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.730" end="00:24:18.220" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a tourist I mean it is what</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.539" end="00:24:19.360" style="s2">it is it&#39;s what people want to go there</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.220" end="00:24:21.429" style="s2">so they can take their selfie there</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.360" end="00:24:23.860" style="s2">having lived through 9/11 here and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.429" end="00:24:25.929" style="s2">lost a lot of friends to it I watched</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.860" end="00:24:28.060" style="s2">that become a selfie opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.929" end="00:24:29.830" style="s2">people and so it&#39;s emotional</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.060" end="00:24:31.750" style="s2">potency has been entirely lost of</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.830" end="00:24:35.950" style="s2">whatever a chance were supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.750" end="00:24:38.080" style="s2">and I see it instead I&#39;m trying to look</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.950" end="00:24:41.160" style="s2">through it differently which is also why</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.080" end="00:24:43.540" style="s2">I&#39;m so interested in John because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.160" end="00:24:47.260" style="s2">my former bosses and colleagues over</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.540" end="00:24:50.950" style="s2">Rancourt I&#39;ve have written a lot on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.260" end="00:24:55.470" style="s2">Emerald City protests you know on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.950" end="00:24:58.360" style="s2">Seattle protests and on on various</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.470" end="00:25:01.300" style="s2">organizational schemas of how you create</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.360" end="00:25:03.400" style="s2">disruptions and how they&#39;re managed both</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.300" end="00:25:05.110" style="s2">the public relations of it where I see</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.400" end="00:25:10.570" style="s2">CNN has clearly become this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.110" end="00:25:16.180" style="s2">public relations arm of of Chas and of</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.570" end="00:25:17.920" style="s2">whatever it&#39;s Paleolithic movement you</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.180" end="00:25:20.110" style="s2">know kind of is and now they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.920" end="00:25:21.280" style="s2">to propel it because it had lost its own</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.110" end="00:25:24.670" style="s2">meaning there furth they&#39;re now trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.280" end="00:25:27.880" style="s2">to turn it into this Disney Disney World</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.670" end="00:25:31.930" style="s2">for the radicals and clearly they&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.880" end="00:25:34.090" style="s2">trying to franchise it out and and have</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.930" end="00:25:36.040" style="s2">it be set up around it&#39;s very clear I</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.090" end="00:25:38.770" style="s2">mean it&#39;s becoming a franchise very very</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.040" end="00:25:42.520" style="s2">very quickly and now they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.770" end="00:25:44.050" style="s2">replicate it around the country so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.520" end="00:25:46.330" style="s2">less interest interested in kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.050" end="00:25:49.470" style="s2">black lives matter as element of it</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.330" end="00:25:53.050" style="s2">because that&#39;s in itself so highly</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.470" end="00:25:55.560" style="s2">emotional recharge and where it takes a</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.050" end="00:25:57.670" style="s2">such a great amount of human</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.560" end="00:25:59.950" style="s2">conversation to be able to kind of piece</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.670" end="00:26:02.530" style="s2">whatever it is together or piece would</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.950" end="00:26:04.120" style="s2">take take away whatever it&#39;s not I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.530" end="00:26:05.740" style="s2">much more interested now and how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.120" end="00:26:08.430" style="s2">also kind of franchising out and its</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.740" end="00:26:11.530" style="s2">franchising out very opportunistically</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.430" end="00:26:14.590" style="s2">so that it&#39;s gonna whoever is not an</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.530" end="00:26:17.170" style="s2">inherent right is now going to be chased</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.590" end="00:26:18.550" style="s2">out of their homes right so if it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.170" end="00:26:21.040" style="s2">can see it clearly is going to move to</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.550" end="00:26:22.360" style="s2">to Texas next and it&#39;s going to move to</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.040" end="00:26:25.570" style="s2">some of the kind of more conservative</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.360" end="00:26:27.310" style="s2">hubs chasing you know chasing out the</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.570" end="00:26:29.740" style="s2">local populations getting adherence and</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.310" end="00:26:35.110" style="s2">then as John said kind of getting people</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.740" end="00:26:36.460" style="s2">to take a knee we feel like Johnny could</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.110" end="00:26:40.060" style="s2">be I said what do you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.460" end="00:26:41.820" style="s2">job yeah that could have spread that he</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.060" end="00:26:44.830" style="s2">could franchise out</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.820" end="00:26:46.120" style="s2">if it&#39;s too much of a departure from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.830" end="00:26:47.620" style="s2">original movement though it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.120" end="00:26:50.200" style="s2">to have the heft it&#39;s not going to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.620" end="00:26:52.779" style="s2">not going to take in this iteration but</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.200" end="00:26:56.080" style="s2">if it can be molded into something that</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.779" end="00:26:58.870" style="s2">advances the movement we&#39;ll see it</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.080" end="00:27:00.639" style="s2">it&#39;s generally something that that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.870" end="00:27:02.639" style="s2">gonna see in protests moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.639" end="00:27:05.049" style="s2">because I mean we what we basically are</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.639" end="00:27:06.909" style="s2">experiencing is a kind of a defending of</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.049" end="00:27:10.570" style="s2">the police the police are in a defensive</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.909" end="00:27:12.490" style="s2">crunch I mean they can&#39;t apply force</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.570" end="00:27:15.250" style="s2">particularly you know in a public</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.490" end="00:27:17.169" style="s2">setting without getting you know severe</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.250" end="00:27:19.899" style="s2">repercussions I mean people get fired</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.169" end="00:27:23.889" style="s2">people get go to jail over even you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.899" end="00:27:27.490" style="s2">minor stuff and now we&#39;re seeing teargas</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.889" end="00:27:30.220" style="s2">bands and you know generalized bands on</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.490" end="00:27:33.370" style="s2">non-lethal sand what that does to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.220" end="00:27:35.769" style="s2">police force as a whole is that it puts</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.370" end="00:27:38.710" style="s2">them into a force protection posture I</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.769" end="00:27:41.169" style="s2">mean they have no power to use against</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.710" end="00:27:44.710" style="s2">to protest even if it gets out of hand</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.169" end="00:27:47.710" style="s2">and what they&#39;ll do is they&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.710" end="00:27:50.590" style="s2">withdraw from so if the protest wants to</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.710" end="00:27:53.559" style="s2">advance they&#39;ll back off if the protest</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.590" end="00:27:55.899" style="s2">wants to loot they&#39;ll back off they want</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.559" end="00:27:59.250" style="s2">to avoid the confrontation avoid getting</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.899" end="00:28:03.240" style="s2">in a situation where they get hurt and</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.250" end="00:28:06.240" style="s2">it makes them completely ineffective and</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.240" end="00:28:07.990" style="s2">that is a you know that kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.240" end="00:28:10.330" style="s2">reducing that feedback loop that</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.990" end="00:28:14.470" style="s2">mitigation loop that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.330" end="00:28:17.919" style="s2">negative damping that did that slows</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.470" end="00:28:19.149" style="s2">down a protest is going to lead to some</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.919" end="00:28:22.389" style="s2">interesting things that will see</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.149" end="00:28:25.330" style="s2">protests that range a lot farther afield</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.389" end="00:28:27.580" style="s2">they get bigger and they can take</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.330" end="00:28:29.019" style="s2">buildings and hold them and intake</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.580" end="00:28:31.629" style="s2">structures that we didn&#39;t think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.019" end="00:28:33.269" style="s2">possible you know going in and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.629" end="00:28:36.039" style="s2">even taking the White House and</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.269" end="00:28:37.750" style="s2">trampling it over and you know no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.039" end="00:28:39.789" style="s2">there to defendant no ones no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.750" end="00:28:41.549" style="s2">willing to actually you know put up the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.789" end="00:28:48.059" style="s2">defense necessary to stop it from being</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.549" end="00:28:50.919" style="s2">trampled or you know looting and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.059" end="00:28:54.630" style="s2">selectively looting like we saw in Hong</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.919" end="00:28:56.910" style="s2">Kong or you know certain businesses were</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.630" end="00:28:59.370" style="s2">targeted I mean the businesses that</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.910" end="00:29:01.020" style="s2">supported the protest weren&#39;t vandalized</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.370" end="00:29:03.420" style="s2">they didn&#39;t loot but they focused on</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.020" end="00:29:04.680" style="s2">vandalization because they didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.420" end="00:29:07.170" style="s2">to be portrayed as criminals by the</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.680" end="00:29:09.090" style="s2">Chinese government and then the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.170" end="00:29:11.910" style="s2">businesses that supported the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.090" end="00:29:14.670" style="s2">government that had done backroom deals</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.910" end="00:29:17.610" style="s2">or part of it you know national chain</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.670" end="00:29:21.050" style="s2">weren&#39;t targeted like banks and the like</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.610" end="00:29:24.510" style="s2">and they were they were often gutted so</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.050" end="00:29:26.190" style="s2">um we can see that here in the states</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.510" end="00:29:30.300" style="s2">where there&#39;s kind of a selective kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.190" end="00:29:31.650" style="s2">of pressure kind of there&#39;s a user word</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.300" end="00:29:33.750" style="s2">I like to use is called alignment</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.650" end="00:29:36.570" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of what we&#39;re seeing in</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.750" end="00:29:39.860" style="s2">networks is in network warfare is is</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.570" end="00:29:43.350" style="s2">forcing alignment forcing people to</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.860" end="00:29:46.050" style="s2">support and and face in the same</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.350" end="00:29:47.850" style="s2">direction as the as the network if if</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.050" end="00:29:51.150" style="s2">the government controls a network like</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.850" end="00:29:53.070" style="s2">China they&#39;re forcing corporations and</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.150" end="00:29:54.810" style="s2">individuals to align themselves to</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.070" end="00:29:58.230" style="s2">publicly align themselves and do this so</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.810" end="00:30:02.430" style="s2">on an ongoing basis not just them</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.230" end="00:30:04.620" style="s2">domestically but globally and that what</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.430" end="00:30:06.720" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing with with a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.620" end="00:30:09.150" style="s2">movements online is they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.720" end="00:30:11.940" style="s2">force that same alignment forcing people</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.150" end="00:30:15.060" style="s2">to kind of in their public actions and</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.940" end="00:30:20.610" style="s2">their behaviors express support or</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.060" end="00:30:22.880" style="s2">continue to you know give give</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.610" end="00:30:28.020" style="s2">credibility to the unit or to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.880" end="00:30:30.840" style="s2">protest and and the like so um yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.020" end="00:30:32.310" style="s2">that&#39;s my thinking I&#39;ve much to add</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.840" end="00:30:34.050" style="s2">alarm&#39; desire you jump right in real</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.310" end="00:30:35.370" style="s2">quick for a second I&#39;ve seen so much of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.050" end="00:30:37.740" style="s2">this force alignment happening</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.370" end="00:30:39.270" style="s2">everywhere all the corporations forced</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.740" end="00:30:40.950" style="s2">to send over hundreds of millions of</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.270" end="00:30:42.930" style="s2">dollars in some case like a billion</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.950" end="00:30:44.400" style="s2">dollars where&#39;s all that money going</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.930" end="00:30:45.650" style="s2">it&#39;s a very good question who&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.400" end="00:30:50.120" style="s2">account for that that&#39;ll be funny</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.650" end="00:30:52.680" style="s2">there&#39;s an enforced alignment when the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.120" end="00:30:54.990" style="s2">anti-defamation league sends out reading</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.680" end="00:30:57.900" style="s2">list to the PTAs across the country with</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.990" end="00:31:00.090" style="s2">white fragility and anti racism at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.900" end="00:31:02.520" style="s2">top of the list injecting them directly</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.090" end="00:31:04.350" style="s2">into our students lives bypassing the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.520" end="00:31:06.360" style="s2">parents sending it to the schools</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.350" end="00:31:07.830" style="s2">putting it into their curricula doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.360" end="00:31:08.240" style="s2">these like community meetings that they</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.830" end="00:31:10.070" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:11.660" style="s2">week at some schools where they talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.070" end="00:31:13.970" style="s2">about these issues they ask these kids</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.660" end="00:31:16.460" style="s2">to explore and sit with their racism etc</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.970" end="00:31:19.130" style="s2">etc so there is this forced alignment</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.460" end="00:31:20.809" style="s2">happening on all fronts and all fronts</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.130" end="00:31:23.390" style="s2">and later I do want to circle back to</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.809" end="00:31:25.460" style="s2">sort of the display of force and how</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.390" end="00:31:27.410" style="s2">that impacted what I saw on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.460" end="00:31:28.760" style="s2">in terms of the rioters but Adam you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.410" end="00:31:31.640" style="s2">got something you wanted to say on that</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.760" end="00:31:33.020" style="s2">subject go for it well let me just go</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.640" end="00:31:35.330" style="s2">backwards a little bit you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.020" end="00:31:38.390" style="s2">afterward you said I don&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.330" end="00:31:40.400" style="s2">about the social I don&#39;t know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.390" end="00:31:43.670" style="s2">about kind of the social language that</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.400" end="00:31:46.010" style="s2">you&#39;ve used so you know I can&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.670" end="00:31:47.900" style="s2">I&#39;ve observed agree or disagree with any</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.010" end="00:31:49.850" style="s2">of them okay just because I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.900" end="00:31:51.890" style="s2">what these things are honestly I just</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.850" end="00:31:54.200" style="s2">don&#39;t know what these things are the</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.890" end="00:31:55.640" style="s2">terminology whether I don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.200" end="00:31:59.690" style="s2">opinion on I&#39;m just not informed on</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.640" end="00:32:01.640" style="s2">anything so I just want to kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.690" end="00:32:03.260" style="s2">know just kind of give some framework</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.640" end="00:32:05.870" style="s2">for that that it&#39;s just not what I&#39;m oh</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.260" end="00:32:07.550" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I&#39;m just not involved in</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.870" end="00:32:09.470" style="s2">these little kind of social kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.550" end="00:32:11.030" style="s2">small issues even though I understand</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.470" end="00:32:15.410" style="s2">they have greater implications when I</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.030" end="00:32:17.929" style="s2">see Chaz though um I it&#39;s interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.410" end="00:32:19.040" style="s2">watched it because Americans are not</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.929" end="00:32:20.840" style="s2">used to what other countries have</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.040" end="00:32:23.570" style="s2">experienced and you know John&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.840" end="00:32:28.480" style="s2">referenced a lot of what he&#39;s observed</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.570" end="00:32:32.120" style="s2">within Iraq the kind of oil spot type of</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.480" end="00:32:34.160" style="s2">you know system of advancement of a kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.120" end="00:32:36.320" style="s2">of almost tactical guerilla type of</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.160" end="00:32:39.230" style="s2">warfare and how it it you know it</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.320" end="00:32:41.059" style="s2">advances with enough it becomes this</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.230" end="00:32:43.220" style="s2">hierarchy and then take Cesar&#39;s control</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.059" end="00:32:45.350" style="s2">and it&#39;s very interesting however when I</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.220" end="00:32:47.090" style="s2">would I see Americans are not used to</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.350" end="00:32:50.830" style="s2">seeing United Front</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.090" end="00:32:54.320" style="s2">which is kind of a political and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.830" end="00:32:58.940" style="s2">economic apparatus that&#39;s very highly</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.320" end="00:33:00.740" style="s2">evolved from from China that has a whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.940" end="00:33:04.059" style="s2">bunch of different purposes they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.740" end="00:33:09.190" style="s2">Americans have not seen that merit and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.059" end="00:33:11.900" style="s2">have not seen a lot of very coercive</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.190" end="00:33:13.610" style="s2">measures that the Chinese Communist</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.900" end="00:33:15.800" style="s2">Party has done within other countries</p>

<p begin="00:33:15.800" end="00:33:19.730" style="s2">has this is these are regular events in</p>

<p begin="00:33:19.730" end="00:33:22.040" style="s2">I mean Australia universities have</p>

<p begin="00:33:44.600" end="00:33:49.030" style="s2">and Canada&#39;s already had this but</p>

<p begin="00:33:54.940" end="00:34:02.960" style="s2">about the driving forces behind some of</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.770" end="00:34:04.880" style="s2">these and you know how they infiltrate</p>

<p begin="00:34:55.610" end="00:35:01.730" style="s2">they&#39;re very good at prying into the</p>

<p begin="00:35:13.310" end="00:35:17.800" style="s2">of very interesting to watch it now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.450" end="00:35:21.350" style="s2">seeing it in America so when I hear as</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.800" end="00:35:25.430" style="s2">the warlord of Chas right</p>

<p begin="00:35:34.790" end="00:35:42.310" style="s2">because I think that&#39;s very genuine</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.320" end="00:35:45.850" style="s2">and actuality however it&#39;s also clearly</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.310" end="00:35:53.180" style="s2">now been infused with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.850" end="00:35:56.360" style="s2">formalized rigid United Front Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.180" end="00:35:58.850" style="s2">Communist Party propaganda uh and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.360" end="00:36:00.650" style="s2">its mechanism so I&#39;m not sure normally</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.850" end="00:36:03.440" style="s2">what their process is is they&#39;ll bring</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.650" end="00:36:05.350" style="s2">people over to China to do you know hey</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.440" end="00:36:08.360" style="s2">look you know we&#39;re not the imperialist</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.350" end="00:36:11.570" style="s2">oppressor that America is look how well</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.360" end="00:36:15.020" style="s2">we treat our black people look how well</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.570" end="00:36:17.480" style="s2">we treat our economically disadvantaged</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.020" end="00:36:18.740" style="s2">and China is very good at giving</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.480" end="00:36:21.820" style="s2">Americans tours</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.740" end="00:36:26.480" style="s2">China is incredibly good at giving</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.820" end="00:36:33.850" style="s2">Westerners tours it&#39;s to the point that</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.480" end="00:36:36.200" style="s2">it&#39;s actually nice nice okay yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.850" end="00:36:39.040" style="s2">John I want to hear your dog now bark</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.200" end="00:36:43.370" style="s2">back to his before kind of thing gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.040" end="00:36:45.740" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting because clearly</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.370" end="00:36:49.490" style="s2">he&#39;s been trained and I can see that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.740" end="00:36:51.140" style="s2">was watching some videos and again I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.490" end="00:36:52.520" style="s2">not watching within an idea I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.140" end="00:36:54.110" style="s2">to watch as a disembodied intellect</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.520" end="00:36:58.670" style="s2">right I&#39;m not really trying to watch and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.110" end="00:37:01.280" style="s2">assign my own type of emotional reserves</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.670" end="00:37:02.870" style="s2">to it I&#39;m interested in it because of</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.280" end="00:37:04.070" style="s2">how it fits in my futurist type of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.870" end="00:37:06.710" style="s2">thinking which I&#39;ll discuss a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.070" end="00:37:08.420" style="s2">but uh there&#39;s a reason that other</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.710" end="00:37:10.940" style="s2">people aren&#39;t beating him up I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.420" end="00:37:12.650" style="s2">who&#39;s not particularly menacing he</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.940" end="00:37:14.780" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a significant physical</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.650" end="00:37:16.640" style="s2">presence he does seem to be charismatic</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.780" end="00:37:20.300" style="s2">and so I think that adds to it but being</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.640" end="00:37:22.370" style="s2">a charismatic leader also has much more</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.300" end="00:37:25.070" style="s2">vulnerabilities than being a type of</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.370" end="00:37:25.780" style="s2">leader that can you know Beach over the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.070" end="00:37:28.040" style="s2">head</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.780" end="00:37:31.580" style="s2">all right charismatic leaders he can</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.040" end="00:37:35.720" style="s2">much more easily displace than the type</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.580" end="00:37:36.980" style="s2">of leader who&#39;s a quiet opposition by</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.720" end="00:37:38.660" style="s2">hitting people over the head and by</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.980" end="00:37:40.160" style="s2">cruelty right you need to have cruelty</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.660" end="00:37:44.540" style="s2">to be a leader so we haven&#39;t seen any</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.160" end="00:37:46.250" style="s2">exhibition of his cruelty um so to me</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.540" end="00:37:48.410" style="s2">he&#39;s got a whole support network behind</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.250" end="00:37:50.540" style="s2">him that&#39;s propelling this</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.410" end="00:37:53.210" style="s2">right so you think he&#39;s been trained by</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.540" end="00:37:56.720" style="s2">somebody prepared for this I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.210" end="00:37:58.280" style="s2">want to infer him right as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.720" end="00:37:59.660" style="s2">because I don&#39;t really know him right I</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.280" end="00:38:03.710" style="s2">haven&#39;t had a chance to speak with them</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.660" end="00:38:05.870" style="s2">um I don&#39;t know I can only tell you what</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.710" end="00:38:09.830" style="s2">I&#39;ve observed right and I&#39;m not talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.870" end="00:38:13.010" style="s2">about the cause and the expresses and/or</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.830" end="00:38:16.010" style="s2">his talents because clearly he is a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.010" end="00:38:18.080" style="s2">charismatic person seems to be very</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.010" end="00:38:20.360" style="s2">relatable he has a intimate there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.080" end="00:38:21.830" style="s2">you the little videos I&#39;ve seen of them</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.360" end="00:38:24.890" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of intimacy right people</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.830" end="00:38:29.240" style="s2">like talking with him and that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.890" end="00:38:31.280" style="s2">not just kind of granting him Authority</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.240" end="00:38:33.320" style="s2">he naturally does have some authority in</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.280" end="00:38:35.750" style="s2">his interactions with people but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.320" end="00:38:36.770" style="s2">what what I&#39;ve observed also is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.750" end="00:38:39.560" style="s2">when I&#39;ve seen him in physical</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.770" end="00:38:41.840" style="s2">confrontation places where he&#39;s wildly</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.560" end="00:38:43.460" style="s2">outnumbered and he&#39;s around kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.840" end="00:38:44.600" style="s2">mob that&#39;s out of his own control</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.460" end="00:38:48.290" style="s2">because that&#39;s kind of what John</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.600" end="00:38:50.960" style="s2">described is as a you know the the group</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.290" end="00:38:52.490" style="s2">only works as long as it&#39;s not fractured</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.960" end="00:38:54.680" style="s2">but the second that you have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.490" end="00:38:57.110" style="s2">human interactions going on it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.680" end="00:38:58.970" style="s2">get fractured right the second people</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.110" end="00:39:01.820" style="s2">have a chance to say a couple of words</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.970" end="00:39:02.900" style="s2">to each other they&#39;re they&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.820" end="00:39:04.250" style="s2">to be an agreement what&#39;s wrong so</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.900" end="00:39:05.300" style="s2">they&#39;ve got to keep that rage going</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.250" end="00:39:07.730" style="s2">they&#39;ve got to keep that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.300" end="00:39:09.350" style="s2">feedback with going and it&#39;s and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.730" end="00:39:10.760" style="s2">breaking up fight it&#39;s like there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.350" end="00:39:14.260" style="s2">reason people aren&#39;t beating this guy up</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.760" end="00:39:17.060" style="s2">it&#39;s not this type of a natural organic</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.260" end="00:39:17.480" style="s2">Authority that he&#39;s got and I&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.060" end="00:39:20.300" style="s2">elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.480" end="00:39:23.080" style="s2">right I&#39;ve seen it in uh in India and</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.300" end="00:39:26.890" style="s2">Pakistan and I&#39;ve particularly seen it</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.080" end="00:39:29.720" style="s2">with how the Chinese United Front</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.890" end="00:39:33.860" style="s2">apparatus works John what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.720" end="00:39:37.010" style="s2">about that yeah I know I&#39;ve visited all</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.860" end="00:39:41.660" style="s2">the garden spots and you know they were</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.010" end="00:39:43.190" style="s2">wracked by civil war and I like when</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.660" end="00:39:45.320" style="s2">they were hot</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.190" end="00:39:47.270" style="s2">I saw how people were agitated and God</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.320" end="00:39:50.450" style="s2">got involved and how these groups sprang</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.270" end="00:39:54.170" style="s2">up I do think though that the the focus</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.450" end="00:39:58.250" style="s2">on the Chas is a little bit of a head</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.170" end="00:40:02.180" style="s2">fake it you know the real big thing here</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.250" end="00:40:04.940" style="s2">is it&#39;s forcing alignment</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.180" end="00:40:06.620" style="s2">enforcing alignment within the big</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.940" end="00:40:09.950" style="s2">corporations particularly the big social</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.620" end="00:40:14.000" style="s2">networking giants the Amazon like and</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.950" end="00:40:17.650" style="s2">they&#39;re changing their way in which they</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.000" end="00:40:19.850" style="s2">interact with people on a mass scale I</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.650" end="00:40:21.290" style="s2">mean just like for instance the seeing</p>

<p begin="00:42:29.940" end="00:42:34.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of complexity to that well</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.580" end="00:42:35.580" style="s2">that&#39;s I mean that&#39;s what I do is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.080" end="00:42:37.140" style="s2">they in the in an open source movement</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.580" end="00:42:39.240" style="s2">it really doesn&#39;t matter who the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.140" end="00:42:41.400" style="s2">component groups are I mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.240" end="00:42:43.440" style="s2">they&#39;re sliding in and the each have</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.400" end="00:42:45.930" style="s2">their own motivations for joining and</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.440" end="00:42:48.600" style="s2">much more complex and than you know much</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.930" end="00:42:52.800" style="s2">more nuanced and then the the core</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.600" end="00:42:57.720" style="s2">thrust of the movement but they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.800" end="00:42:59.970" style="s2">part of a larger dominant consensus in</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.720" end="00:43:02.130" style="s2">the country that clearly I mean I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.970" end="00:43:05.250" style="s2">looking at the support for the protests</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.130" end="00:43:08.820" style="s2">even when bad behavior was in evidence</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.250" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">and me through the looting and all in</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.820" end="00:43:14.040" style="s2">many major metropolitan areas shows that</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:17.190" style="s2">it is the dominant it is the kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.040" end="00:43:20.000" style="s2">dominant movement and getting most</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.190" end="00:43:23.550" style="s2">politicians to align with that getting</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.000" end="00:43:27.210" style="s2">cities to flip on it quickly get the big</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.550" end="00:43:29.940" style="s2">all the companies to express support and</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.210" end="00:43:32.370" style="s2">make changes to the how they behave and</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.940" end="00:43:34.110" style="s2">mass to get the big social networks that</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.370" end="00:43:36.360" style="s2">they get inside our head there are</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.110" end="00:43:38.190" style="s2">sitting in between each other all of us</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.360" end="00:43:41.220" style="s2">in every conversation that we have</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.190" end="00:43:42.810" style="s2">nowadays is is mitigated and mediated by</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.220" end="00:43:46.380" style="s2">these social networks and these that</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.810" end="00:43:50.850" style="s2">these companies they&#39;re forcing changes</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.380" end="00:43:52.950" style="s2">on and so you know the extreme version</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.850" end="00:43:55.620" style="s2">of this of courses is is what we see in</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.950" end="00:43:58.980" style="s2">China where the government and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.620" end="00:44:03.960" style="s2">corporations and the dominant consensus</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.980" end="00:44:07.050" style="s2">is all one and it dictates and it uses</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.960" end="00:44:08.910" style="s2">the network and it uses you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.050" end="00:44:11.160" style="s2">gamified versions in terms of this</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.910" end="00:44:12.750" style="s2">social social credit system to enforce</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.160" end="00:44:18.150" style="s2">it down to the individual level and</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.750" end="00:44:19.890" style="s2">change behavior so you know this is this</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.150" end="00:44:23.910" style="s2">is a dominant movement it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.890" end="00:44:25.800" style="s2">revolutionary movement it&#39;s propagating</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.910" end="00:44:27.090" style="s2">consensus and you don&#39;t have to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.800" end="00:44:28.850" style="s2">the individual groups in order to see it</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.090" end="00:44:31.550" style="s2">so let me ask you a question</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.850" end="00:44:33.800" style="s2">and I&#39;m just so happy to be able to ask</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.550" end="00:44:41.600" style="s2">you these questions - so awesome good</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.800" end="00:44:44.060" style="s2">arm and which came first the movement or</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.600" end="00:44:47.570" style="s2">the corporation&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.060" end="00:44:49.970" style="s2">desire to have this movement I mean if I</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.570" end="00:44:54.410" style="s2">were to take so I keep a log right right</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.970" end="00:44:55.880" style="s2">well I started a log in 2015 and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.410" end="00:44:59.150" style="s2">always kept the log but I&#39;ve started one</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.880" end="00:45:02.680" style="s2">type of log in 2015 and then in 2019 I</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.150" end="00:45:05.270" style="s2">started a log about kovat okay and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.680" end="00:45:07.910" style="s2">started it because I saw what was I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.270" end="00:45:09.710" style="s2">very familiar with China with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.910" end="00:45:11.990" style="s2">the operational issues and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.710" end="00:45:13.130" style="s2">people operating system and I very</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.990" end="00:45:14.870" style="s2">pretty familiar with it both</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.130" end="00:45:17.300" style="s2">particularly financially and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.870" end="00:45:21.410" style="s2">economic issues within it and so I saw</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.300" end="00:45:23.990" style="s2">that the protests had completely gained</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.410" end="00:45:28.930" style="s2">moral authority that the police could no</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.990" end="00:45:32.690" style="s2">longer handle it um kind of provincially</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.930" end="00:45:33.920" style="s2">that it had just kind of though the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.690" end="00:45:35.450" style="s2">protests that you were seeing in hong</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.920" end="00:45:36.890" style="s2">kong you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.450" end="00:45:38.210" style="s2">it was just you&#39;re only seeing those</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.890" end="00:45:39.830" style="s2">because that&#39;s all the media was there</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.210" end="00:45:41.570" style="s2">was just as many protests going on</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.830" end="00:45:45.140" style="s2">Titanic actually a lot more violent</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.570" end="00:45:46.970" style="s2">going on in the mainland and they after</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.140" end="00:45:49.130" style="s2">they burned down the univer or after the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.970" end="00:45:50.690" style="s2">the people&#39;s aren&#39;t police intruding in</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.130" end="00:45:52.490" style="s2">a university they had lost all type of</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.690" end="00:45:54.410" style="s2">you know people background so then all</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.490" end="00:45:58.190" style="s2">the sudden and there with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.410" end="00:46:00.580" style="s2">triads war more violent things you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.190" end="00:46:04.990" style="s2">in service to the people&#39;s aren&#39;t police</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.580" end="00:46:07.190" style="s2">and so and then all the sudden this</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.990" end="00:46:11.030" style="s2">kovaydin came around and it was a way of</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.190" end="00:46:12.770" style="s2">really channeling up dissent oh and how</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.030" end="00:46:14.840" style="s2">much of you know the kovat was</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.770" end="00:46:16.400" style="s2">embellished in order to channel dissent</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.840" end="00:46:19.970" style="s2">is something I found very interesting so</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.400" end="00:46:23.750" style="s2">I started a log at that point and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.970" end="00:46:26.300" style="s2">log was in was was Kovac Kovac January</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.750" end="00:46:29.540" style="s2">covered February covered March and now</p>

<p begin="00:46:39.920" end="00:46:44.740" style="s2">I don&#39;t see any of these exclusive</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.650" end="00:46:48.170" style="s2">I see the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.740" end="00:46:49.940" style="s2">channeling of dissent oh they are and</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.170" end="00:46:51.380" style="s2">how that dissent expressed itself which</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.940" end="00:46:55.430" style="s2">is different than it is here for a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.380" end="00:46:56.660" style="s2">of different reasons you are you are you</p>

<p begin="00:47:23.930" end="00:47:27.230" style="s2">and they stripped away all the</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.280" end="00:47:29.690" style="s2">congressional all the People&#39;s Congress</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.230" end="00:47:30.890" style="s2">powers they just did a lot of changes</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.690" end="00:47:32.950" style="s2">that you didn&#39;t hear about but it really</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.890" end="00:47:36.200" style="s2">substantive changes that just basically</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.950" end="00:47:38.420" style="s2">stripped away all the political power</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.200" end="00:47:40.520" style="s2">that people had within the mainland and</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.420" end="00:47:41.930" style="s2">made them made their own local</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.520" end="00:47:44.630" style="s2">provincial government inaccessible to</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.930" end="00:47:47.000" style="s2">them so it&#39;s very interesting to watch</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.630" end="00:47:50.450" style="s2">in our system we still have the burden</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.000" end="00:47:53.150" style="s2">of the way I view it I&#39;m a futurist</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.450" end="00:47:56.140" style="s2">right in our system we still have the</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.150" end="00:47:58.880" style="s2">burden of trying to preserve the</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.140" end="00:48:03.760" style="s2">appearance of continuity right we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.880" end="00:48:06.140" style="s2">have this violent overnight change</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.760" end="00:48:07.460" style="s2">people would resist everybody would be</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.140" end="00:48:08.840" style="s2">on its feet resisting if they were to</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.460" end="00:48:11.720" style="s2">say hey you know we&#39;re going to change</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.840" end="00:48:14.090" style="s2">the Constitution in this way so in our</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.720" end="00:48:16.790" style="s2">people operating system we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.090" end="00:48:18.590" style="s2">able to still have the appearance of</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.790" end="00:48:20.060" style="s2">this continuity that&#39;s the way I view it</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.590" end="00:48:21.560" style="s2">I mean this is my own kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.060" end="00:48:23.330" style="s2">about the thing but we need to have our</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.560" end="00:48:24.800" style="s2">own appearance of continuity this kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.330" end="00:48:27.250" style="s2">of facade that our institutions</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.800" end="00:48:29.150" style="s2">everything still exists so as I saw</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.250" end="00:48:32.650" style="s2">kovat happening everybody locking</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.150" end="00:48:35.930" style="s2">everybody up and how in their house I</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.650" end="00:48:42.110" style="s2">and kind of the media imaginations that</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.930" end="00:48:44.390" style="s2">were required to kind of keep this to</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.110" end="00:48:46.180" style="s2">take to keep this for foremost in</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.390" end="00:48:48.350" style="s2">people&#39;s thoughts so that they would</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.180" end="00:48:51.650" style="s2">volunteer themselves to be locked up in</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.350" end="00:48:53.870" style="s2">their house and volunteer and coerce</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.650" end="00:48:55.220" style="s2">others which was happening around the</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.870" end="00:48:56.200" style="s2">Western countries whether they were in</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.220" end="00:48:57.970" style="s2">Germany they were reporting</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.200" end="00:49:00.820" style="s2">each other or if your kid without seen</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.970" end="00:49:02.440" style="s2">playing they would report yeah literally</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.820" end="00:49:03.700" style="s2">to the police in England it&#39;s crazy in</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.440" end="00:49:06.880" style="s2">Troy I mean the whole thing is crazy</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.700" end="00:49:15.040" style="s2">I&#39;ve kept the log I&#39;m an expert on so um</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.880" end="00:49:17.109" style="s2">as as we saw Co vid beginning to die</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.040" end="00:49:20.140" style="s2">down not just in terms of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.109" end="00:49:22.240" style="s2">number of reported cases in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.140" end="00:49:23.500" style="s2">reported deaths we saw the case is going</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.240" end="00:49:25.270" style="s2">up but we saw up being somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.500" end="00:49:27.099" style="s2">commensurate with the number of tests</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.270" end="00:49:28.869" style="s2">that we&#39;re out there alright so we won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.099" end="00:49:30.940" style="s2">see any yeah there&#39;s one little other</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.869" end="00:49:33.270" style="s2">factor there though it took us 2 3</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.940" end="00:49:36.070" style="s2">months to figure out how to sequester or</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.270" end="00:49:37.480" style="s2">the people most vulnerable to actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.070" end="00:49:39.849" style="s2">protect them well so if you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.480" end="00:49:41.950" style="s2">Florida you&#39;ll see the case is going up</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.849" end="00:49:45.040" style="s2">among the younger people under 50s and</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.950" end="00:49:47.849" style="s2">going down for the older people but that</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.040" end="00:49:51.130" style="s2">we&#39;ve learned how to actually protect so</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.849" end="00:49:53.020" style="s2">if we had that ability at the get-go we</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.130" end="00:49:54.910" style="s2">would have this would have blown through</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.020" end="00:49:58.599" style="s2">I mean it would have been no no-brainer</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.910" end="00:50:00.940" style="s2">but it took months how do you know that</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.599" end="00:50:02.200" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s it you&#39;re making a</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.940" end="00:50:04.510" style="s2">pretty strong statement is all I have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.200" end="00:50:06.250" style="s2">accept it because it&#39;s fact you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.510" end="00:50:08.130" style="s2">saying if we had known then this would</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.250" end="00:50:10.420" style="s2">have occurred why do I have to accept</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.130" end="00:50:13.030" style="s2">it&#39;s a learning process in terms of how</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.420" end="00:50:15.960" style="s2">to figure out how to properly protect</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.030" end="00:50:18.660" style="s2">people in rest homes how to properly</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.960" end="00:50:20.800" style="s2">protect people who are most vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.660" end="00:50:23.890" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t something that you could do</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.800" end="00:50:25.390" style="s2">out of the out of the box the UK tried</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.890" end="00:50:27.220" style="s2">it I mean they said ok let&#39;s try to</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.390" end="00:50:29.230" style="s2">figure figure out a way to sequester</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.220" end="00:50:31.480" style="s2">these these people these vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.230" end="00:50:33.460" style="s2">populations which in the u.s. is huge I</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.480" end="00:50:36.300" style="s2">mean what 37% of our population was</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.460" end="00:50:38.560" style="s2">vulnerable to the virus it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.300" end="00:50:41.589" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t something you could do as an</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.560" end="00:50:44.260" style="s2">initial strategy before a pandemic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.589" end="00:50:46.690" style="s2">something you had to learn how to do and</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.260" end="00:50:49.030" style="s2">you know what we made the the big lie</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.690" end="00:50:50.829" style="s2">going on today and we always end up</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.030" end="00:50:55.240" style="s2">getting to these big kind of deal each</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.829" end="00:50:57.730" style="s2">itemizing lies is that no politician is</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.240" end="00:51:00.400" style="s2">out there saying ok we&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.730" end="00:51:03.790" style="s2">accept a couple thousand people dead a</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.400" end="00:51:05.710" style="s2">day we basically are allowing it you</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.790" end="00:51:08.140" style="s2">know communicable cancer or heart</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.710" end="00:51:09.590" style="s2">disease on that level but we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.140" end="00:51:11.360" style="s2">try to keep it contained within</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.590" end="00:51:13.550" style="s2">so we can continue to have our lives</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.360" end="00:51:14.990" style="s2">we&#39;re willing to accept that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.550" end="00:51:17.090" style="s2">that&#39;s the policy that&#39;s an effective</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.990" end="00:51:19.580" style="s2">policy but nobody&#39;s up there saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.090" end="00:51:21.740" style="s2">this is what we&#39;re willing to do and</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.580" end="00:51:23.780" style="s2">that we&#39;re still kind of giving kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.740" end="00:51:28.820" style="s2">most politicians are giving a head nod</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.780" end="00:51:31.850" style="s2">to eradicating it through measures or</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.820" end="00:51:34.310" style="s2">ignoring like it doesn&#39;t even exist it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.850" end="00:51:35.900" style="s2">a weird kind of you know hyper</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.310" end="00:51:38.090" style="s2">normalization kind of thing going on</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.900" end="00:51:40.790" style="s2">here that it&#39;s very confusing to people</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.090" end="00:51:44.120" style="s2">well okay but I want to go backwards</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.790" end="00:51:48.640" style="s2">because um again I have to accept your</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.120" end="00:51:48.640" style="s2">assumptions which I don&#39;t know okay so</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.260" end="00:51:54.590" style="s2">let me go back to kind of the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.090" end="00:51:58.930" style="s2">inception of it because I&#39;ve chronicled</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.590" end="00:52:02.060" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve archived all of this and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.930" end="00:52:03.290" style="s2">your assumption is that there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.060" end="00:52:04.610" style="s2">of them that are both within that I</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.290" end="00:52:05.900" style="s2">would be hard to me even chose to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.610" end="00:52:08.600" style="s2">kind of the forensics on it</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.900" end="00:52:10.190" style="s2">because the only being the entire thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.600" end="00:52:12.140" style="s2">is built upon an assumption and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.190" end="00:52:14.330" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like this bubble theory of</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.140" end="00:52:16.250" style="s2">assumptions that I&#39;ve got I&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.330" end="00:52:19.640" style="s2">have something yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.250" end="00:52:21.020" style="s2">okay so I won&#39;t do that okay what I will</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.640" end="00:52:23.240" style="s2">say is let&#39;s just stick with what the</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.020" end="00:52:24.470" style="s2">actual facts are the absolute facts</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.240" end="00:52:31.270" style="s2">something that corresponds with true</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.470" end="00:52:33.860" style="s2">right so so december-january</p>

<p begin="00:54:04.150" end="00:54:06.700" style="s2">really trying to psyche</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.960" end="00:54:07.900" style="s2">so it&#39;s interesting because I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.700" end="00:54:10.329" style="s2">wait for him to get back but in any</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.900" end="00:54:11.920" style="s2">event it&#39;s interesting because again I</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.329" end="00:54:14.920" style="s2">still have to accept the assumption</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.920" end="00:54:16.240" style="s2">which I don&#39;t want to do so what is the</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.920" end="00:54:21.010" style="s2">assumption let me write it down okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.240" end="00:54:24.400" style="s2">that had we had that the information</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.010" end="00:54:26.770" style="s2">that we obtained along the way became</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.400" end="00:54:28.960" style="s2">the data sets were becoming better and</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.770" end="00:54:32.559" style="s2">better so we could observe more in</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.960" end="00:54:34.539" style="s2">real-time measures that could be taken</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.559" end="00:54:37.869" style="s2">to sequester older people and to save</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.539" end="00:54:39.430" style="s2">lives and to do this and and so the the</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.869" end="00:54:40.930" style="s2">assumption that I have to agree with</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.430" end="00:54:42.910" style="s2">this first that the information was a</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.930" end="00:54:44.529" style="s2">pristine or even that the information</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.910" end="00:54:46.779" style="s2">the data that we were being provided was</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.529" end="00:54:49.240" style="s2">was true I mean things have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.779" end="00:54:52.390" style="s2">correspond with fact and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.240" end="00:54:55.660" style="s2">that they ever were so I think we first</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.390" end="00:55:02.140" style="s2">have to get an agreement on the quality</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.660" end="00:55:06.250" style="s2">the quantitative qualitative aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.140" end="00:55:09.279" style="s2">the information that we were provided so</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.250" end="00:55:12.460" style="s2">if I if we can&#39;t get agreement on that</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.279" end="00:55:13.990" style="s2">and how can how can I agree with John</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.460" end="00:55:16.059" style="s2">statement that you know we learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.990" end="00:55:18.039" style="s2">hide sequester old people to save their</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.059" end="00:55:22.150" style="s2">lives and also how to eat young people</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.039" end="00:55:23.410" style="s2">alive I mean it&#39;s one has to one have to</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.150" end="00:55:25.599" style="s2">kind of sequentially build upon the</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.410" end="00:55:27.460" style="s2">other yeah I think for me the most</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.599" end="00:55:30.849" style="s2">important data point all the corona</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.460" end="00:55:32.500" style="s2">stuff is just deaths right like all the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.849" end="00:55:35.610" style="s2">other issues are what they are</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.500" end="00:55:38.490" style="s2">okay so can I start it up sure</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.610" end="00:55:42.180" style="s2">what do you mean yeah I mean deaths of</p>

<p begin="00:55:42.180" end="00:55:47.130" style="s2">understand what you mean what I mean is</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.190" end="00:55:49.500" style="s2">is deaths above and beyond what was</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.130" end="00:55:53.250" style="s2">typical in an ordinary year at that time</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.500" end="00:55:55.350" style="s2">thanks oh so we&#39;re drilling down John so</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.250" end="00:55:58.830" style="s2">it you were saying that just to recap is</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.350" end="00:56:01.850" style="s2">that yeah the pandemic gave an</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.830" end="00:56:03.990" style="s2">opportunity to the global elites to</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.850" end="00:56:06.720" style="s2">consolidate power and eliminate these</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.990" end="00:56:09.540" style="s2">protests and I heartily agree in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.720" end="00:56:11.190" style="s2">most cynical way possible these the</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.540" end="00:56:13.020" style="s2">pandemic allowed a consolidation of</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.190" end="00:56:15.020" style="s2">power on a global scale that we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.020" end="00:56:19.230" style="s2">seen no I</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.020" end="00:56:19.980" style="s2">okay no no I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s a part</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.230" end="00:56:21.960" style="s2">of what I said</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.980" end="00:56:24.150" style="s2">I mean first we have to also agree on</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.960" end="00:56:26.670" style="s2">what pandemic is right because pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.150" end="00:56:28.440" style="s2">we did not have an adequate definition I</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.670" end="00:56:31.140" style="s2">mean this happened before in 2009 with</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.440" end="00:56:32.280" style="s2">the swine flu h1n1 flu and at that time</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.140" end="00:56:35.430" style="s2">there actually was an inoperable</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.280" end="00:56:38.160" style="s2">definition of pandemic pandemic is just</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.430" end="00:56:39.510" style="s2">a term like flatten the curve or</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.160" end="00:56:42.380" style="s2">something else is thrown into a</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.510" end="00:56:44.310" style="s2">vernacular that has no science</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.380" end="00:56:45.540" style="s2">significant science meaning to it but</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.310" end="00:56:47.850" style="s2">it&#39;s something that&#39;s nice for people to</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.540" end="00:56:52.460" style="s2">say but particularly at that time were</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.850" end="00:56:56.760" style="s2">pandemic was inadequately defined so arm</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.460" end="00:56:58.800" style="s2">so we we still haven&#39;t figured out or</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.760" end="00:57:02.880" style="s2">come to an agreement about what the</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.800" end="00:57:05.820" style="s2">pandemic was how we worried observing</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.880" end="00:57:08.250" style="s2">the pandemic and was the relation was</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.820" end="00:57:14.220" style="s2">the information that we were given the</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.250" end="00:57:17.100" style="s2">data truthful and so is the information</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.220" end="00:57:21.420" style="s2">that we have calculated and are now</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.100" end="00:57:23.790" style="s2">formulating this discussion upon sincere</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.420" end="00:57:26.700" style="s2">was it authentic information so let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.790" end="00:57:28.920" style="s2">back to December January then so</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.700" end="00:57:32.850" style="s2">December January there were all these</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.920" end="00:57:34.200" style="s2">riots going on then in January as</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.850" end="00:57:35.610" style="s2">actually December malicious State</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.200" end="00:57:39.840" style="s2">January because that&#39;s a timely that</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.610" end="00:57:41.730" style="s2">most people have we saw the videos on on</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.840" end="00:57:43.650" style="s2">Twitter which all of us to have a life</p>

<p begin="00:57:47.340" end="00:57:52.080" style="s2">on the street basically from Kovac</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.320" end="00:57:54.060" style="s2">now I&#39;m pretty familiar with with China</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.080" end="00:57:57.570" style="s2">I knew that was impossible right I know</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.060" end="00:57:59.100" style="s2">how videos leak out of China and I know</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.570" end="00:58:01.140" style="s2">how they&#39;re not gonna leak out of China</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.100" end="00:58:04.610" style="s2">and if they were leak out of China it</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.140" end="00:58:08.040" style="s2">difficult that they would have finding a</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.610" end="00:58:11.070" style="s2">fewer especially on Twitter in social</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.040" end="00:58:16.500" style="s2">media which is very responsive to</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.070" end="00:58:18.720" style="s2">discourse power of China so so now in</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.500" end="00:58:20.100" style="s2">January we see these videos now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.720" end="00:58:21.810" style="s2">beginning to call something on pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.100" end="00:58:26.550" style="s2">right we&#39;re saying it&#39;s going to jump</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.810" end="00:58:28.770" style="s2">over a little bit and in there really</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.550" end="00:58:30.540" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a lot of deaths right there there</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.770" end="00:58:32.340" style="s2">just wasn&#39;t a lot of morbidity attached</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.540" end="00:58:33.900" style="s2">to it then we heard a lot about Italy if</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.340" end="00:58:36.900" style="s2">you guys remember Italy so Italy was</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.900" end="00:58:39.090" style="s2">january/february a a system that was</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.900" end="00:58:41.490" style="s2">already I had a lot of difficulties and</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.090" end="00:58:44.520" style="s2">that it was well operating well over</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.490" end="00:58:47.040" style="s2">capacity it had been underfunded for a</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.520" end="00:58:52.320" style="s2">long time and it had a very unhealthy</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.040" end="00:58:55.710" style="s2">older population yeah so then around</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.320" end="00:58:57.900" style="s2">March 11th we started hearing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.710" end="00:59:01.680" style="s2">buzz about it Angela Merkel comes out</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.900" end="00:59:03.420" style="s2">with a speech March 11 March 11 Tom</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.680" end="00:59:04.320" style="s2">Hanks I was just discussing is the food</p>

<p begin="00:59:04.320" end="00:59:09.440" style="s2">March 11 Angela Merkel comes out with a</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.020" end="00:59:11.880" style="s2">speech saying that this is Germany&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.440" end="00:59:14.190" style="s2">world this is Germany&#39;s world war two</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.880" end="00:59:19.410" style="s2">moment okay that was the language to use</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.190" end="00:59:20.640" style="s2">this is the war on okay so I get very</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.410" end="00:59:22.110" style="s2">worried about things that are described</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.640" end="00:59:23.790" style="s2">as the war line but that&#39;s the language</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.110" end="00:59:25.290" style="s2">he used it&#39;s also language Trump Houston</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.790" end="00:59:29.610" style="s2">certainly and a lot of other politicians</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.290" end="00:59:34.110" style="s2">have used so Tom Hanks Angela Merkel and</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.610" end="00:59:35.670" style="s2">the NBA all use this same on the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.110" end="00:59:39.660" style="s2">day where in all the newspapers</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.670" end="00:59:42.120" style="s2">everywhere okay all about Kovac Tom</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.660" end="00:59:46.850" style="s2">Hanks had exposure to what he said NBA</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.120" end="00:59:50.430" style="s2">player had exposure to it so March 11th</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.850" end="00:59:52.650" style="s2">is also or early March is also when Neil</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.430" end="00:59:54.870" style="s2">Ferguson came out with a very Floyd</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.650" end="00:59:55.980" style="s2">report are you familiar with that John</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.870" end="00:59:58.560" style="s2">yeah I read it</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.980" end="01:00:00.360" style="s2">okay yeah well when you say you read it</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.560" end="01:00:03.150" style="s2">what do you mean you read it I read the</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.360" end="01:00:06.240" style="s2">report how much a report did you read</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.150" end="01:00:09.090" style="s2">okay okay did you have a child a chance</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.240" end="01:00:11.160" style="s2">to interrogate any of that report yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.090" end="01:00:15.630" style="s2">looked at it it was being portrayed</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.160" end="01:00:17.400" style="s2">really strangely in the media and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.630" end="01:00:19.640" style="s2">the the things that they were pulling up</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.400" end="01:00:24.090" style="s2">and the claims that were being made</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.640" end="01:00:26.040" style="s2">really off because if you really looked</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.090" end="01:00:30.150" style="s2">at at least from my reading of it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.040" end="01:00:32.580" style="s2">that if you applied various social</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.150" end="01:00:35.220" style="s2">distancing techniques and and you could</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.580" end="01:00:38.760" style="s2">achieve the same thing that you would</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.220" end="01:00:40.200" style="s2">get from from a full lockdown and what</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.760" end="01:00:42.840" style="s2">they were saying they were taking that</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.200" end="01:00:44.730" style="s2">report and saying hey this is a reason</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.840" end="01:00:46.380" style="s2">why you shouldn&#39;t use these techniques</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.730" end="01:00:48.420" style="s2">and that we need a lockdown which was</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.380" end="01:00:52.380" style="s2">exactly opposite of what the report</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.420" end="01:00:54.030" style="s2">actually said so I was a it was very</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.380" end="01:00:55.850" style="s2">disturbing I mean I mean one thing I</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.030" end="01:00:58.170" style="s2">found is looking at all these Fe</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.850" end="01:01:01.470" style="s2">epidemiological models and hearing how</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.170" end="01:01:03.750" style="s2">these epidemiological epidemiologists</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.470" end="01:01:06.000" style="s2">think I mean the assumptions they make</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.750" end="01:01:08.190" style="s2">is that them you know a lot of these</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.000" end="01:01:13.830" style="s2">assumptions are really flawed and they</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.190" end="01:01:16.200" style="s2">were the models are pretty weak and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.830" end="01:01:18.420" style="s2">taken them way too long to update them</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.200" end="01:01:20.910" style="s2">and but you know you still can tease</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.420" end="01:01:24.390" style="s2">information out of them if you if you</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.910" end="01:01:26.940" style="s2">understand where the plaza okay so can I</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.390" end="01:01:30.450" style="s2">interrupt you you can tease information</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.940" end="01:01:31.500" style="s2">um well first I mean I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.450" end="01:01:34.020" style="s2">pronounce in these things I have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.500" end="01:01:37.740" style="s2">little bit of a list so epidemiologist</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.020" end="01:01:39.180" style="s2">or whatever they are colleges yes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.740" end="01:01:43.070" style="s2">not even gonna try it&#39;s embarrassing so</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.180" end="01:01:44.820" style="s2">whatever you just said what what&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.070" end="01:01:47.610" style="s2">academic background I mean what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.820" end="01:01:50.610" style="s2">required what is the what type what type</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.610" end="01:01:54.810" style="s2">of a degree is that usually some masters</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.610" end="01:01:57.330" style="s2">or a PhD in science but in Bandini</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.810" end="01:02:00.510" style="s2">ecology yeah it&#39;s a study of infectious</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.330" end="01:02:02.760" style="s2">diseases in a population scale are you</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.510" end="01:02:05.400" style="s2">sure are you for that my sister&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.760" end="01:02:06.930" style="s2">epidemiologist okay she&#39;s an epic but</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.400" end="01:02:10.970" style="s2">are you sure that that&#39;s a qualification</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.930" end="01:02:13.110" style="s2">required of one well actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.970" end="01:02:15.360" style="s2">the interesting thing is that we saw a</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.110" end="01:02:16.710" style="s2">lot of people writing papers and making</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.360" end="01:02:18.150" style="s2">pronouncements on</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.710" end="01:02:20.839" style="s2">that came from a variety of different</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.150" end="01:02:23.880" style="s2">backgrounds so we see physicists we see</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.839" end="01:02:26.069" style="s2">statisticians we see people who are</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.880" end="01:02:28.589" style="s2">involved in general health I mean the</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.069" end="01:02:30.180" style="s2">volume of data being produced in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.589" end="01:02:33.960" style="s2">volume of studies in the volume of</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.180" end="01:02:35.609" style="s2">information in a large part you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.960" end="01:02:37.410" style="s2">drowned out a lot of what you get from</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.609" end="01:02:40.680" style="s2">the people who were professionals at</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.410" end="01:02:42.359" style="s2">this okay more the professional models</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.680" end="01:02:45.119" style="s2">so they were built under some just like</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.359" end="01:02:47.869" style="s2">hi she&#39;s like here&#39;s a good example that</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.119" end="01:02:50.039" style="s2">if you have voluntary social distancing</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.869" end="01:02:52.619" style="s2">requirements and recommendations that</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.039" end="01:02:54.660" style="s2">only 10% of the population with John we</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.619" end="01:02:58.230" style="s2">got to go backwards there happen but we</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.660" end="01:03:01.230" style="s2">haven&#39;t rule on what an epidemiologist</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.230" end="01:03:02.730" style="s2">this okay yeah and you have an advantage</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.230" end="01:03:04.049" style="s2">on me because your sister is one so</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.730" end="01:03:06.059" style="s2">you&#39;re just used to saying it around the</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.049" end="01:03:08.039" style="s2">dinner table I&#39;ve said it five times in</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.059" end="01:03:09.270" style="s2">my life okay I&#39;d have to like stay at</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.039" end="01:03:11.430" style="s2">home and practice in front of a mirror</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.270" end="01:03:15.000" style="s2">to be able to see the thing so but what</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.430" end="01:03:17.190" style="s2">is the academic requirement to be an</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.000" end="01:03:18.690" style="s2">epic I mean if can can you go out there</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.190" end="01:03:27.230" style="s2">tomorrow and say that you are one of</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.690" end="01:03:30.150" style="s2">those why not are you sure that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.230" end="01:03:31.980" style="s2">okay so you&#39;re sure that in order to do</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.150" end="01:03:34.740" style="s2">that I don&#39;t need some other type of I</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.980" end="01:03:36.839" style="s2">can&#39;t just self-proclaimed if I have a</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.740" end="01:03:40.410" style="s2">an academic background and let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.839" end="01:03:41.609" style="s2">computer modeling data sets ah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.410" end="01:03:43.349" style="s2">not stopping people from actually making</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.609" end="01:03:45.839" style="s2">pronouncements and doing studies and</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.349" end="01:03:48.359" style="s2">claiming insight into the into the</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.839" end="01:03:54.539" style="s2">pandemic and you know we have very very</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.359" end="01:03:56.849" style="s2">few examples of pandemics at this scale</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.539" end="01:03:58.770" style="s2">that that really let people you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.849" end="01:04:01.920" style="s2">dive into building models for it and</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.770" end="01:04:05.069" style="s2">this one was unique in okay more</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.920" end="01:04:06.990" style="s2">different me offering it was he by the</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.069" end="01:04:09.299" style="s2">definition that you feel is kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.990" end="01:04:12.660" style="s2">threshold right baggy was he you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.299" end="01:04:16.410" style="s2">perhaps a degree and eventually in</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.660" end="01:04:21.029" style="s2">biology or infect e ology was was he any</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.410" end="01:04:23.309" style="s2">of those I don&#39;t know it&#39;s just it was a</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.029" end="01:04:26.819" style="s2">model it was a model that that you can</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.309" end="01:04:29.890" style="s2">either make assumptions as valuable or</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.819" end="01:04:31.480" style="s2">you not I mean oh you want me to agree</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.890" end="01:04:33.010" style="s2">I mean I because this is an important</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.480" end="01:04:35.260" style="s2">point because we&#39;re you know with Muto</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.010" end="01:04:37.270" style="s2">Mathis is really my question to you is</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.260" end="01:04:39.730" style="s2">you want me to agree with the deaths</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.270" end="01:04:41.230" style="s2">that how successful we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.730" end="01:04:42.220" style="s2">sequestering or not sequestering with</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.230" end="01:04:45.070" style="s2">what we&#39;ve learned along the way</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.220" end="01:04:46.870" style="s2">well are now even just going to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.070" end="01:04:50.800" style="s2">beginning of this we&#39;re looking at a</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.870" end="01:04:52.480" style="s2">report from a person who by the rigid</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.800" end="01:04:54.670" style="s2">definition of you would like write the</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.480" end="01:04:56.590" style="s2">most authoritative one which is some</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.670" end="01:04:59.170" style="s2">type of a degree in biology or in fact</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.590" end="01:05:00.400" style="s2">theology he is none of those things is</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.170" end="01:05:04.060" style="s2">that&#39;s not what he it that&#39;s not what he</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.400" end="01:05:07.020" style="s2">it is I mean it&#39;s not what he is so I</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.060" end="01:05:09.820" style="s2">have so I don&#39;t want to agree to anybody</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.020" end="01:05:11.140" style="s2">to anybody&#39;s further argument I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.820" end="01:05:12.250" style="s2">it&#39;s a dangerous thing I mean I want to</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.140" end="01:05:16.530" style="s2">agree cuz I&#39;m gonna agree we&#39;ll take the</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.250" end="01:05:19.270" style="s2">guy but I fear of being an agreement um</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.530" end="01:05:21.580" style="s2">on with was something that originated</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.270" end="01:05:23.200" style="s2">with a report that was not from an</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.580" end="01:05:27.340" style="s2">authoritative source that was presented</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.200" end="01:05:28.450" style="s2">as such and initially Angela Merkel</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.340" end="01:05:31.120" style="s2">which I mean you know you obviously</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.450" end="01:05:32.740" style="s2">picked up on you know she said that</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.120" end="01:05:34.750" style="s2">something like two hundred million</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.740" end="01:05:37.350" style="s2">Americans were gonna get infected and</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.750" end="01:05:41.200" style="s2">there would be a two point two million</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.350" end="01:05:44.430" style="s2">possible people dying of kovat I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.200" end="01:05:48.430" style="s2">think that actually those those those</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.430" end="01:05:51.280" style="s2">okay in general we have a terrible way</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.430" end="01:05:54.220" style="s2">of communicating information in this</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.280" end="01:05:57.520" style="s2">country and the bureaucracies the health</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.220" end="01:05:59.470" style="s2">bureaucracy proved totally incompetent</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.520" end="01:06:02.410" style="s2">in terms of coordinating their behavior</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.470" end="01:06:03.940" style="s2">to planning in this instance and as well</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.410" end="01:06:05.530" style="s2">as the financial bureaucracy did in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.940" end="01:06:08.320" style="s2">financial crisis and they and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.530" end="01:06:11.050" style="s2">foreign policy and military communities</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.320" end="01:06:14.110" style="s2">totally flubbed the Iraq war and their</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.050" end="01:06:15.490" style="s2">response to it and we&#39;re seeing that</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.110" end="01:06:17.230" style="s2">again and again that these these</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.490" end="01:06:19.150" style="s2">bureaucracies that we built that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.230" end="01:06:20.380" style="s2">invested in that all these millions of</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.150" end="01:06:21.430" style="s2">people that we&#39;ve paid incredible</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.380" end="01:06:22.120" style="s2">amounts of money to indicate in</p>

<p begin="01:06:22.120" end="01:06:26.650" style="s2">can&#39;t generate high-quality</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.610" end="01:06:29.800" style="s2">decision-making anymore and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.650" end="01:06:36.010" style="s2">resulting in in this environment and we</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.800" end="01:06:39.340" style="s2">see projections being purposely hyped we</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.010" end="01:06:43.020" style="s2">see people saying like the CDC it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.340" end="01:06:45.750" style="s2">saying that masks don&#39;t work okay</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.020" end="01:06:47.250" style="s2">because is the noble lie they say right</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.750" end="01:06:48.540" style="s2">is that they&#39;re misleading people</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.250" end="01:06:50.430" style="s2">because they didn&#39;t want them going out</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.540" end="01:06:52.470" style="s2">and buying masks I mean that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.430" end="01:06:55.140" style="s2">incredibly stupid thing I mean there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:06:55.140" end="01:07:00.800" style="s2">hospitals it&#39;s a common sense but now</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.560" end="01:07:06.390" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because Neil Ferguson</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.800" end="01:07:09.990" style="s2">okay what was part of the research team</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.390" end="01:07:13.620" style="s2">that led to the killing the culling of</p>

<p begin="01:07:21.870" end="01:07:27.120" style="s2">their all their livestock it turns out</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.850" end="01:07:29.130" style="s2">that the data was it was incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.120" end="01:07:30.630" style="s2">wrong okay just incredible all that they</p>

<p begin="01:08:28.770" end="01:08:33.450" style="s2">question is is who took advantage of</p>

<p begin="01:08:51.509" end="01:08:59.219" style="s2">interested in as I&#39;ve is how it</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.489" end="01:09:00.839" style="s2">led off into how the media was able to</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.219" end="01:09:02.549" style="s2">get everybody sequestered for whatever</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.839" end="01:09:07.049" style="s2">reason whether even if the intention was</p>

<p begin="01:09:07.049" end="01:09:11.609" style="s2">bad thing whether whether or not or</p>

<p begin="01:09:15.390" end="01:09:19.500" style="s2">now how the media was able to allow</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.549" end="01:09:21.779" style="s2">everybody to escape essentially into</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.500" end="01:09:23.190" style="s2">like this dark city world and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.779" end="01:09:27.930" style="s2">clearly they&#39;re setting up a media</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.190" end="01:09:29.279" style="s2">narrative so I look at it I&#39;m a futurist</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.930" end="01:09:30.989" style="s2">right even as a kid I&#39;m a financial</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.279" end="01:09:32.430" style="s2">futurist I&#39;m always into I knew as a kid</p>

<p begin="01:09:36.630" end="01:09:43.920" style="s2">a tiny little kid and now I I look at it</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.630" end="01:09:47.730" style="s2">as our people operating system is</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.920" end="01:09:50.989" style="s2">changing and I look at the current</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.730" end="01:09:53.940" style="s2">social movements that are out there as</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.989" end="01:09:56.730" style="s2">the Triads that the Chinese used just as</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.940" end="01:09:58.440" style="s2">very overt physical force I&#39;ve written a</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.730" end="01:10:00.540" style="s2">lot on Twitter and in my own personal</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.440" end="01:10:02.310" style="s2">life a lot more about China and about</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.540" end="01:10:04.860" style="s2">its social revolution and kind of now</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.310" end="01:10:07.500" style="s2">for olds and how it was rolled in I look</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.860" end="01:10:12.330" style="s2">at as being identical so I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.500" end="01:10:16.260" style="s2">in how do you see that this is helping</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.330" end="01:10:18.030" style="s2">in the role of a power and and not only</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.260" end="01:10:21.660" style="s2">how is it helping in the role of a power</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.030" end="01:10:23.700" style="s2">but who do you anticipate to be the the</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.660" end="01:10:25.530" style="s2">biggest beneficiary and once that has</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.700" end="01:10:26.550" style="s2">been accomplished right once they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.530" end="01:10:27.810" style="s2">rolled it up cuz I&#39;ve only got a little</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.550" end="01:10:29.370" style="s2">bit further to go they just pumped in</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.810" end="01:10:31.800" style="s2">five trillion into the market and what</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.370" end="01:10:33.960" style="s2">ever are they gonna then dismantle it</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.800" end="01:10:35.790" style="s2">and let everybody live in peace and say</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.960" end="01:10:38.730" style="s2">look this is our new operating system</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.790" end="01:10:42.090" style="s2">deal with it or are they gonna say the</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.730" end="01:10:45.320" style="s2">only way that we can sustain our own</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.090" end="01:10:49.080" style="s2">power is to continue causing disagree</p>

<p begin="01:10:49.080" end="01:10:51.840" style="s2">way that we can preserve this and that</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.489" end="01:10:54.360" style="s2">would require a lot more social</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.840" end="01:11:00.480" style="s2">agitation great question</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.360" end="01:11:03.510" style="s2">right well I view it as a kind of a kind</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.480" end="01:11:05.340" style="s2">of a Counter Reformation kind of moment</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.510" end="01:11:08.239" style="s2">for the neoliberal system so the</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.340" end="01:11:10.159" style="s2">neoliberal system before was focused on</p>

<p begin="01:11:10.159" end="01:11:14.030" style="s2">lowering barriers to capital flow</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.750" end="01:11:16.790" style="s2">lowering barriers to wealth creation and</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.030" end="01:11:18.679" style="s2">that ended up concentrating wealth and</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.790" end="01:11:22.190" style="s2">concentrating wealth man&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.679" end="01:11:24.280" style="s2">few people and that what they gave to</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.190" end="01:11:27.500" style="s2">people instead of the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.280" end="01:11:31.030" style="s2">middle-class experience kind of income</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.500" end="01:11:33.619" style="s2">associated with that is the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.030" end="01:11:35.150" style="s2">self actualize in the sense that they</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.619" end="01:11:37.159" style="s2">can choose their identity and they could</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.150" end="01:11:40.690" style="s2">travel and they could there was no</p>

<p begin="01:11:52.400" end="01:11:58.250" style="s2">terms of a power relationship for a</p>

<p begin="01:12:03.710" end="01:12:13.730" style="s2">and now it&#39;s falling apart in and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.510" end="01:12:16.699" style="s2">a kind of a reformation moment where the</p>

<p begin="01:15:13.960" end="01:15:18.909" style="s2">ever but in this particular instance it</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.480" end="01:15:21.699" style="s2">seemed to me he had an opportunity to be</p>

<p begin="01:15:41.900" end="01:15:46.639" style="s2">there was a power role up by the the the</p>

<p begin="01:16:44.780" end="01:16:49.250" style="s2">transformation are probably 20 years but</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.510" end="01:16:50.719" style="s2">it&#39;s only accelerated this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.250" end="01:16:53.480" style="s2">transformation in our political system</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.719" end="01:16:55.219" style="s2">now keep in mind I have done a lot in</p>

<p begin="01:17:07.219" end="01:17:13.190" style="s2">no longer powerful they&#39;re powerful in</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.230" end="01:17:14.960" style="s2">terms of kind of the symbolism um but</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.190" end="01:17:16.969" style="s2">it&#39;s not there nothing in compared to</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.960" end="01:17:18.800" style="s2">the power of Google or the power of</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.969" end="01:17:20.179" style="s2">Facebook the power so I&#39;ve seen this</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.800" end="01:17:22.250" style="s2">real transformation over the years that</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.179" end="01:17:23.989" style="s2">i if i I&#39;ve tried to describe and I</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.250" end="01:17:26.059" style="s2">think about it is territorial</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.989" end="01:17:28.849" style="s2">sovereignty which is I&#39;m sitting here</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.059" end="01:17:30.980" style="s2">right now and you know don&#39;t Messiah</p>

<p begin="01:17:45.440" end="01:17:49.820" style="s2">I have to fall within and I have more</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.050" end="01:17:51.290" style="s2">interaction with it I&#39;ve touched it more</p>

<p begin="01:17:51.290" end="01:17:56.030" style="s2">Constitution of the United States so I</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.690" end="01:17:58.880" style="s2">take a look at the roll-up of power not</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.030" end="01:18:00.530" style="s2">as some type of a brand out there kind</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.880" end="01:18:04.190" style="s2">of grabbing a market share</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.530" end="01:18:07.420" style="s2">I think about it much more with economic</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.190" end="01:18:11.060" style="s2">currency and social currency which is</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.420" end="01:18:14.900" style="s2">the transformation of our people</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.060" end="01:18:18.470" style="s2">operating system from one that was a</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.900" end="01:18:19.790" style="s2">kind of a republic and whatever a</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.470" end="01:18:22.550" style="s2">republic is and the way kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.790" end="01:18:27.200" style="s2">decompress is a republic to now where</p>

<p begin="01:18:48.350" end="01:18:53.120" style="s2">over the judiciary which is why certain</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.530" end="01:18:55.280" style="s2">people couldn&#39;t get a date in and</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.120" end="01:18:57.920" style="s2">there&#39;s an ad and it&#39;s why they had to</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.280" end="01:18:58.820" style="s2">kind of charade manna for or stone</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.920" end="01:19:01.280" style="s2">people I don&#39;t particularly like</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.820" end="01:19:05.810" style="s2">nevertheless but they had to really put</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.280" end="01:19:08.060" style="s2">them on display because it it is allowed</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.810" end="01:19:09.260" style="s2">to show all the people that to distract</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.060" end="01:19:10.700" style="s2">most people that weren&#39;t within a</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.260" end="01:19:12.470" style="s2">corrupt system I know John on a podcast</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.700" end="01:19:14.000" style="s2">regionally spoke about banking failures</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.470" end="01:19:15.860" style="s2">and why nobody went to jail and how this</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.000" end="01:19:18.020" style="s2">kind of led to a you know whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.860" end="01:19:20.150" style="s2">but so I see a complete transformation</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.020" end="01:19:22.880" style="s2">on people operating system that has</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.150" end="01:19:23.960" style="s2">happened kind of innocuous it&#39;s not like</p>

<p begin="01:22:09.350" end="01:22:12.650" style="s2">one&#39;s called ap NRA</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.340" end="01:22:14.119" style="s2">to take the platform people will have</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.650" end="01:22:16.130" style="s2">guns or whatever you call that type of a</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.119" end="01:22:18.980" style="s2">thing but you said the banks are now</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.130" end="01:22:20.260" style="s2">going to be de platforming people to</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.980" end="01:22:23.050" style="s2">enforce</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.260" end="01:22:26.480" style="s2">this movement to take away people&#39;s guns</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.050" end="01:22:29.420" style="s2">remember yeah you&#39;re way ahead of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.480" end="01:22:32.659" style="s2">curve with that uh and that&#39;s what I was</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.420" end="01:22:35.000" style="s2">thinking how do they do this I know</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.659" end="01:22:36.469" style="s2">where I I know where they&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.000" end="01:22:37.670" style="s2">to right because I can see it because</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.469" end="01:22:41.570" style="s2">I&#39;m a futurist and that&#39;s what I think</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.670" end="01:22:45.290" style="s2">about so but you&#39;re the guy that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.570" end="01:22:46.520" style="s2">says okay I say you know John this is</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.290" end="01:22:49.869" style="s2">where I want to get to how do I get</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.520" end="01:22:53.060" style="s2">there I&#39;m alright I&#39;m a visionary I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.869" end="01:22:57.489" style="s2">I&#39;m B entrepreneur entrepreneur not the</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.060" end="01:23:00.710" style="s2">operator I to complain I&#39;m also a</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.489" end="01:23:02.389" style="s2">entrepreneur but I tend to having been</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.710" end="01:23:04.760" style="s2">burned on trying to figure out where</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.389" end="01:23:06.440" style="s2">things are gonna head is that I look for</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.760" end="01:23:08.869" style="s2">actual instantiation some little teeny</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.440" end="01:23:11.330" style="s2">example that points me in the right</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.869" end="01:23:14.449" style="s2">direction so I&#39;m not just theory</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.330" end="01:23:16.429" style="s2">crafting which is always a fear of mine</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.449" end="01:23:20.300" style="s2">that I&#39;ll end up building this elaborate</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.429" end="01:23:25.550" style="s2">theory that that&#39;s based on nothing and</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.300" end="01:23:30.590" style="s2">it it falls apart at the you know first</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.550" end="01:23:32.929" style="s2">first pushback yeah the whole deep</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.590" end="01:23:35.150" style="s2">platforming it&#39;s done through alignment</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.929" end="01:23:36.800" style="s2">and you know most people are still</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.150" end="01:23:39.889" style="s2">thinking that everything has to be done</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.800" end="01:23:41.360" style="s2">through legislation or has to be done</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.889" end="01:23:43.960" style="s2">through the government and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.360" end="01:23:46.070" style="s2">true I mean if you get enough</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.960" end="01:23:48.949" style="s2">corporations and individuals to align</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.070" end="01:23:52.730" style="s2">and and you can get government does it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.949" end="01:23:57.110" style="s2">not necessary you can be platform you</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.730" end="01:23:59.449" style="s2">can get things done and that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.110" end="01:24:02.000" style="s2">a form of power in a networked age and</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.449" end="01:24:03.830" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna see a ton of that in in</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.000" end="01:24:06.560" style="s2">particular in this instance this is</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.830" end="01:24:09.860" style="s2">largely focused on on equalizing power</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.560" end="01:24:12.400" style="s2">relationships with the what at least an</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.860" end="01:24:14.770" style="s2">intersectional see is to power Lee</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.400" end="01:24:17.590" style="s2">eliminating their ownership of guns</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.770" end="01:24:20.330" style="s2">eliminating their access to police</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.590" end="01:24:22.710" style="s2">eliminating their access to jobs and</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.330" end="01:24:26.409" style="s2">wealth and power</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.710" end="01:24:29.500" style="s2">it&#39;s a-you know that equalization is is</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.409" end="01:24:30.880" style="s2">key to all of this they printed it could</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.500" end="01:24:33.520" style="s2">be a positive thing and that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.880" end="01:24:37.329" style="s2">kind of more on an equal basis but it</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.520" end="01:24:40.150" style="s2">can be also used as it as well so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.329" end="01:24:42.840" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because again what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.150" end="01:24:45.250" style="s2">seen is over the last few years</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.840" end="01:24:46.809" style="s2">corporations the Megas right because</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.250" end="01:24:51.309" style="s2">they Volk result unit and there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.809" end="01:24:52.659" style="s2">five or six content companies anymore</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.309" end="01:24:54.670" style="s2">almost in the world is probably only</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.659" end="01:24:56.409" style="s2">kind of them anymore in the entire world</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.670" end="01:25:01.000" style="s2">that are effective the rest are just</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.409" end="01:25:02.679" style="s2">kind of you know just trying to rub</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.000" end="01:25:04.179" style="s2">nickels together essentially you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.679" end="01:25:05.500" style="s2">a business long enough until the one of</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.179" end="01:25:07.210" style="s2">the makers acquires them right and</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.500" end="01:25:08.920" style="s2">there&#39;s only three or four pipe</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.210" end="01:25:11.460" style="s2">companies like Google where you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.920" end="01:25:16.059" style="s2">they do all the plumbing and you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.460" end="01:25:17.139" style="s2">there&#39;s just a few them so I&#39;ve it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.059" end="01:25:23.860" style="s2">interesting because they&#39;ve enlisted</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.139" end="01:25:25.360" style="s2">this balance and the fowling has darn is</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.860" end="01:25:28.000" style="s2">working in service of them because the</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.360" end="01:25:30.400" style="s2">argument of the filings is that Nancy</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.000" end="01:25:33.039" style="s2">Pelosi can&#39;t act quickly enough Trump</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.400" end="01:25:34.360" style="s2">out can&#39;t act quickly enough so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.039" end="01:25:36.550" style="s2">care about the Constitution anymore</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.360" end="01:25:38.800" style="s2">because it&#39;s not responsive to us right</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.550" end="01:25:40.869" style="s2">and not only is it not responsive to us</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.800" end="01:25:43.809" style="s2">as quickly as we need it to be it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.869" end="01:25:45.219" style="s2">like this uber refined type of you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.809" end="01:25:46.750" style="s2">this you&#39;ve commented a lot on the</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.219" end="01:25:48.579" style="s2">behavior of a keishon that we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.750" end="01:25:51.429" style="s2">now and the change in behavior that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.579" end="01:25:53.079" style="s2">being built into people but people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.429" end="01:25:57.329" style="s2">not not only is it not responsive</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.079" end="01:25:59.590" style="s2">quickly enough legislation but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.329" end="01:26:01.840" style="s2">they no longer have the physical</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.590" end="01:26:04.210" style="s2">proximity to a politician anymore</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.840" end="01:26:06.610" style="s2">so for them because they don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.210" end="01:26:08.639" style="s2">can&#39;t sit next to a Pelosi anymore right</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.610" end="01:26:12.010" style="s2">it&#39;s not like it was ten years ago that</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.639" end="01:26:15.670" style="s2">they are this experience of sitting</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.010" end="01:26:17.969" style="s2">across from power whether it&#39;s Pelosi or</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.670" end="01:26:20.739" style="s2">whether it&#39;s Facebook the only way</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.969" end="01:26:25.000" style="s2">Facebook is more available it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.739" end="01:26:27.250" style="s2">convenient to interact with Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.000" end="01:26:28.920" style="s2">power than it is with Pelosi power so</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.250" end="01:26:31.300" style="s2">she&#39;s you know she&#39;s retreated</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.920" end="01:26:35.230" style="s2">deliberately she&#39;s retreated from power</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.300" end="01:26:35.860" style="s2">and in her stead she&#39;s pushed forward</p>

<p begin="01:27:14.650" end="01:27:17.530" style="s2">thing is is coming to mind is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.909" end="01:27:19.449" style="s2">talking about using the networks to</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.530" end="01:27:21.429" style="s2">force alignment to affect change and</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.449" end="01:27:22.540" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple of things happening one</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.429" end="01:27:24.670" style="s2">there&#39;s just like the decade-long</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.540" end="01:27:26.830" style="s2">consolidation of the Democrats into the</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.670" end="01:27:29.050" style="s2">corporate party right Matt Stoller has</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.830" end="01:27:31.800" style="s2">done a fantastic job of laying out how</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.050" end="01:27:34.360" style="s2">the Democrats gave in to Chicago right</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.800" end="01:27:36.310" style="s2">neoliberal you know market ideas and</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.360" end="01:27:37.900" style="s2">when they came into power in after</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.310" end="01:27:39.429" style="s2">Watergate they just for some reason</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.900" end="01:27:41.590" style="s2">forgot about putting a check on</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.429" end="01:27:42.969" style="s2">corporate power so the Google and the</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.590" end="01:27:45.040" style="s2">rest of the folks they want to keep sure</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.969" end="01:27:47.110" style="s2">they want to make sure that the federal</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.040" end="01:27:48.670" style="s2">government stays distracted and doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.110" end="01:27:51.520" style="s2">get involved in using their power to</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.670" end="01:27:52.810" style="s2">actually regulate trust Matt Stoller you</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.520" end="01:27:54.699" style="s2">should check out his book Goliath it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.810" end="01:27:56.949" style="s2">fantastic I did a podcast with him it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.699" end="01:27:59.340" style="s2">coming out next week now the other thing</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.949" end="01:28:02.710" style="s2">about alignment and an effecting change</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.340" end="01:28:04.690" style="s2">I I think I&#39;ve heard you maybe say Adam</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.710" end="01:28:06.489" style="s2">that it&#39;s not happening quickly but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.690" end="01:28:09.100" style="s2">thinking it happened in lightning fast</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.489" end="01:28:11.080" style="s2">so we had the riots and protests in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.100" end="01:28:13.389" style="s2">last couple of weeks already we have</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.080" end="01:28:16.540" style="s2">seen in Washington DC a whole slew of</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.389" end="01:28:18.969" style="s2">police reform legislation pastor DC City</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.540" end="01:28:20.350" style="s2">Council without any public review we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.969" end="01:28:22.659" style="s2">had New York City Police Department</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.350" end="01:28:24.670" style="s2">disband their 600 member played in</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.659" end="01:28:26.440" style="s2">plainclothes division and I imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.670" end="01:28:28.000" style="s2">this is playing out all over the country</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.440" end="01:28:29.980" style="s2">all at the same time so really what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.000" end="01:28:31.360" style="s2">happened is it black lives matter the</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.980" end="01:28:34.360" style="s2">phalanx is you want to call it whatever</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.360" end="01:28:36.130" style="s2">they have become a political party with</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.360" end="01:28:38.080" style="s2">force with billions of dollars</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.130" end="01:28:40.270" style="s2">supporting them they&#39;re the most popular</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.080" end="01:28:42.340" style="s2">institution in America practically</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.270" end="01:28:44.380" style="s2">behind the US military at this point and</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.340" end="01:28:46.960" style="s2">they&#39;re making change and effecting</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.380" end="01:28:49.620" style="s2">change in a real way very quickly across</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.960" end="01:28:52.020" style="s2">the country and achieving the goals that</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.620" end="01:28:54.720" style="s2">they want to achieve and into me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.020" end="01:28:56.370" style="s2">scary because they&#39;re not elected they</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.720" end="01:28:58.380" style="s2">don&#39;t represent the views that I hold</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.370" end="01:28:59.730" style="s2">they have a contrary view of justice and</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.380" end="01:29:02.190" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of other elements</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.730" end="01:29:03.750" style="s2">there that&#39;s kind of terrifying but</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.190" end="01:29:06.870" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen and John pointed this out</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.750" end="01:29:09.240" style="s2">years ago is this alignment between the</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.870" end="01:29:11.250" style="s2">resistance and the corporations and they</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.240" end="01:29:13.020" style="s2">are together they are operating together</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.250" end="01:29:15.240" style="s2">they have their own plausible promise</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.020" end="01:29:17.040" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure what it is but they are</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.240" end="01:29:19.590" style="s2">working together and in concert and you</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.040" end="01:29:21.210" style="s2">can see it happening and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.590" end="01:29:23.160" style="s2">not always necessarily for like</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.210" end="01:29:26.460" style="s2">immediate bottom-line for a company like</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.160" end="01:29:28.590" style="s2">Nike to go woke or whatever but it is</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.460" end="01:29:30.540" style="s2">for sort of long-term consolidation and</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.590" end="01:29:32.700" style="s2">for a long-term ability to keep the</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.540" end="01:29:35.130" style="s2">government at bay which they have been</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.700" end="01:29:36.660" style="s2">very successful in doing so ask Matt</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.130" end="01:29:39.990" style="s2">Stoller a Democrat he&#39;ll tell you all</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.660" end="01:29:42.330" style="s2">about it and then also now affecting</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.990" end="01:29:44.880" style="s2">change immediately in local</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.330" end="01:29:47.010" style="s2">jurisdictions actual cops taken off the</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.880" end="01:29:48.720" style="s2">street actual police policies change</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.010" end="01:29:50.040" style="s2">actual money being taken away from</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.720" end="01:29:52.440" style="s2">police departments so that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.040" end="01:29:54.420" style="s2">corporation&#39;s want that&#39;s what they want</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.440" end="01:29:56.850" style="s2">though I mean they&#39;re all aligned in</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.420" end="01:29:59.130" style="s2">this regard yes but so the I&#39;d never</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.850" end="01:30:00.780" style="s2">said that they weren&#39;t that the our</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.130" end="01:30:02.490" style="s2">political processes and corporate</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.780" end="01:30:06.810" style="s2">processes were not working harmoniously</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.490" end="01:30:09.720" style="s2">clearly they are I mean I I just said</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.810" end="01:30:13.410" style="s2">that they&#39;ve been able to use its</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.720" end="01:30:15.180" style="s2">filings to arm overwhelm back in China</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.410" end="01:30:17.310" style="s2">was called no guard the house right but</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.180" end="01:30:21.180" style="s2">during a social revolution but they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.310" end="01:30:25.530" style="s2">used it to entrench deep political power</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.180" end="01:30:26.640" style="s2">and in and then let that power retreat</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.530" end="01:30:28.530" style="s2">because they got sick of having to run</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.640" end="01:30:30.330" style="s2">for office anyway and let all the</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.530" end="01:30:33.590" style="s2">corporate power</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.330" end="01:30:36.660" style="s2">run run dominant and you know I</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.590" end="01:30:38.220" style="s2">obviously you know the they were doing</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.660" end="01:30:43.470" style="s2">this deliberately I mean defund the</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.220" end="01:30:45.180" style="s2">police um was uh was it to me what it</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.470" end="01:30:47.280" style="s2">appears to is as a corporate interest</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.180" end="01:30:49.200" style="s2">because you know that money has to be</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.280" end="01:30:51.750" style="s2">money doesn&#39;t disappear it&#39;s reallocated</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.200" end="01:30:53.880" style="s2">elsewhere so whenever I hear that I hear</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.750" end="01:30:55.470" style="s2">well where&#39;s that money gonna go and you</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.880" end="01:30:57.360" style="s2">know some small sliver of change will</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.470" end="01:30:58.590" style="s2">make its way into activist organizations</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.360" end="01:31:00.690" style="s2">and hopefully good of community</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.590" end="01:31:02.250" style="s2">evangelists and advocates but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.690" end="01:31:04.690" style="s2">talking about billions of dollars it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.250" end="01:31:06.610" style="s2">going to wind up some</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.690" end="01:31:08.410" style="s2">and I&#39;m much more interested again and</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.610" end="01:31:10.470" style="s2">where it goes and it&#39;s it&#39;s going to go</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.410" end="01:31:12.730" style="s2">back to those same mega corporations I</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.470" end="01:31:16.080" style="s2">mean the interesting thing for me is</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.730" end="01:31:18.820" style="s2">that even just an example of this is</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.080" end="01:31:22.750" style="s2">that you know they&#39;re creating all these</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.820" end="01:31:25.420" style="s2">gofund means to bail out people who are</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.750" end="01:31:28.960" style="s2">being arrested and all they&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.420" end="01:31:30.220" style="s2">creating a it&#39;s feeding a beast right</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.960" end="01:31:31.840" style="s2">it&#39;s like when Tory with Bernie Sanders</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.220" end="01:31:33.970" style="s2">said you know I wanted to take away the</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.840" end="01:31:35.140" style="s2">system and it sucks and and he said well</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.970" end="01:31:37.060" style="s2">give me two hundred million dollars I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.140" end="01:31:39.190" style="s2">not gonna beat up the system really good</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.060" end="01:31:41.140" style="s2">by feeding it he thought he was gonna</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.190" end="01:31:43.000" style="s2">feed it to death it&#39;s basically that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.140" end="01:31:45.070" style="s2">feedback loop I mean it&#39;s their synergy</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.000" end="01:31:48.670" style="s2">between corporations and and and the</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.070" end="01:31:49.720" style="s2">network and it&#39;s not being a like unlike</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.670" end="01:31:51.040" style="s2">China it&#39;s not being led by the</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.720" end="01:31:53.700" style="s2">government it&#39;s not being dictated by</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.040" end="01:31:59.470" style="s2">the government but this this new system</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.700" end="01:32:01.180" style="s2">Network and corporate combined I think</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.470" end="01:32:02.950" style="s2">it&#39;s being led more on the network side</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.180" end="01:32:04.060" style="s2">but the corporations are opportunistic</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.950" end="01:32:06.790" style="s2">and they&#39;re and they&#39;re taking advantage</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.060" end="01:32:08.650" style="s2">of it because it allows them in many</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.790" end="01:32:12.310" style="s2">ways to operate unfettered as long as</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.650" end="01:32:14.950" style="s2">they censor as long as say help help the</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.310" end="01:32:20.230" style="s2">movement along hope the network grow and</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.950" end="01:32:22.750" style="s2">get powerful my fear is it is that over</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.230" end="01:32:24.910" style="s2">the long term is that you know what we</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.750" end="01:32:26.440" style="s2">should be aiming for as a dialectic and</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.910" end="01:32:28.270" style="s2">kind of a back and forth between a</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.440" end="01:32:31.150" style="s2">consensus idea that this is what we need</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.270" end="01:32:33.430" style="s2">to do together right now and a dissent</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.150" end="01:32:37.330" style="s2">that can dismantle it when it shows</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.430" end="01:32:41.290" style="s2">weakness and when it has expired which</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.330" end="01:32:42.850" style="s2">is largely has been on the right you</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.290" end="01:32:46.690" style="s2">know for the last three four years and</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.850" end="01:32:48.460" style="s2">and what we&#39;re when we&#39;re headed towards</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.690" end="01:32:51.010" style="s2">and the stronger movement is that when a</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.460" end="01:32:53.410" style="s2">network is locked in when a network</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.010" end="01:32:57.100" style="s2">becomes consolidated and it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.410" end="01:33:02.470" style="s2">rigid and that it doesn&#39;t allow the kind</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.100" end="01:33:05.740" style="s2">of free association free freedom of</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.470" end="01:33:07.540" style="s2">ideas and and we become rigid and</p>

<p begin="01:35:11.550" end="01:35:16.470" style="s2">after and that spectacle I would say</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.730" end="01:35:19.260" style="s2">spectacles at the Colosseum would always</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.470" end="01:35:21.890" style="s2">get larger and you know clearly there</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.260" end="01:35:23.940" style="s2">was become the expectation of the mob</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.890" end="01:35:26.160" style="s2">which is what you were trying to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.940" end="01:35:28.530" style="s2">satiate there and you needed a bigger</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.160" end="01:35:30.290" style="s2">bigger distraction because underlying</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.530" end="01:35:32.900" style="s2">some of the social conditions</p>

<p begin="01:35:32.900" end="01:35:38.180" style="s2">kind of give people some type of safety</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.780" end="01:35:39.950" style="s2">valve and a release from that and they</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.180" end="01:35:41.420" style="s2">did a pretty good job of it and even up</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.950" end="01:35:43.430" style="s2">until medieval times they you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.420" end="01:35:46.040" style="s2">continued to do that where you know the</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.430" end="01:35:47.750" style="s2">elites would give back at least</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.040" end="01:35:49.670" style="s2">periodically they would give back one to</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.750" end="01:35:53.060" style="s2">twice a year and say here&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.670" end="01:35:57.320" style="s2">festival right and now we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.060" end="01:35:58.970" style="s2">every single all I look at it episodic</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.320" end="01:36:01.370" style="s2">lis right we&#39;re existing in a time of</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.970" end="01:36:03.620" style="s2">like everything is a sitcom show or a</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.370" end="01:36:05.360" style="s2">police show and we&#39;re going from episode</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.620" end="01:36:07.520" style="s2">to episode in each episode young</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.360" end="01:36:09.050" style="s2">amplifications like on spinal tap where</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.520" end="01:36:13.400" style="s2">it just keeps on going up to eleven and</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.050" end="01:36:15.020" style="s2">then twelve so we saw russia uh two</p>

<p begin="01:36:15.020" end="01:36:19.580" style="s2">then we&#39;re seeing just louder and louder</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.810" end="01:36:22.070" style="s2">and louder and more people emotionally</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.580" end="01:36:24.500" style="s2">engaged but i do think about once this</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.070" end="01:36:26.840" style="s2">dies down which clearly that movement</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.500" end="01:36:28.130" style="s2">for the time being is no longer I was</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.840" end="01:36:29.570" style="s2">just doing a Google search on it now</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.130" end="01:36:32.590" style="s2">just to see what type of volume it had</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.570" end="01:36:35.450" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely died down the velocity</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.590" end="01:36:36.710" style="s2">of black lives matter searches</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.450" end="01:36:38.750" style="s2">everything else has definitely died down</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.710" end="01:36:40.130" style="s2">now we&#39;re seeing more of CO vid so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.750" end="01:36:42.110" style="s2">going to get back to a covert hysteria</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.130" end="01:36:44.090" style="s2">which is fine I mean you know if you can</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.110" end="01:36:46.700" style="s2">anticipate it I can I can buy stocks</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.090" end="01:36:49.490" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna benefit from but then what</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.700" end="01:36:52.160" style="s2">happens next do or we can now</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.490" end="01:36:53.990" style="s2">continually go through these episodes</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.160" end="01:36:56.810" style="s2">where they have to get louder and louder</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.990" end="01:36:59.690" style="s2">and louder I mean at what point even if</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.810" end="01:37:02.090" style="s2">let&#39;s say Biden wins and whatever the</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.690" end="01:37:04.160" style="s2">Democrat attachment to some of this is</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.090" end="01:37:10.460" style="s2">perhaps not even ideologically but just</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.160" end="01:37:12.410" style="s2">through convenience right is is can it</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.460" end="01:37:14.050" style="s2">be turned down or we just now gonna look</p>

<p begin="01:37:57.320" end="01:38:02.210" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing what we saw with the</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.730" end="01:38:04.490" style="s2">protests is more of a pattern lockdown</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.210" end="01:38:06.110" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of post ideological now and</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.490" end="01:38:09.080" style="s2">there&#39;s not really an ideology driven</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.110" end="01:38:11.360" style="s2">driving it&#39;s a more of a kind of a big</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.080" end="01:38:13.850" style="s2">pattern like you know kind of the way</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.360" end="01:38:18.620" style="s2">queueing on is works in a in a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.850" end="01:38:20.240" style="s2">smaller scale but writ large that lots</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.620" end="01:38:24.260" style="s2">of people contribute to and lots of</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.240" end="01:38:27.290" style="s2">people enforce and that each of these</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.260" end="01:38:29.930" style="s2">each of these events reinforces that</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.290" end="01:38:34.220" style="s2">pattern it you know it allows it to grow</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.930" end="01:38:37.190" style="s2">and loves it to get more complex game</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.220" end="01:38:39.110" style="s2">more adherents where people spend all</p>

<p begin="01:38:43.700" end="01:38:46.970" style="s2">they they paste it and share it and they</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.590" end="01:38:49.040" style="s2">go okay look at this as a new one and</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.970" end="01:38:51.710" style="s2">they know the moment they see it they</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.040" end="01:38:53.570" style="s2">even the headline exactly a face and if</p>

<p begin="01:38:53.570" end="01:38:58.990" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean what what they think it</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.850" end="01:39:01.670" style="s2">means that they are completely unable to</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.990" end="01:39:03.140" style="s2">change their mind on it because it fits</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.670" end="01:39:05.960" style="s2">in the pattern it would and changing</p>

<p begin="01:39:05.960" end="01:39:11.600" style="s2">you know confront the pattern or you</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.420" end="01:39:12.590" style="s2">know disrupt the pattern so is it going</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.600" end="01:39:15.650" style="s2">to get worse of course it&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.590" end="01:39:17.600" style="s2">worse but our challenge is to to figure</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.650" end="01:39:21.500" style="s2">out how to use this mechanism this</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.600" end="01:39:22.880" style="s2">network decision-making system kind of</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.500" end="01:39:25.670" style="s2">it&#39;s serving as a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.880" end="01:39:27.440" style="s2">replacement for nationalism as we go</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.670" end="01:39:28.760" style="s2">forward in terms of what it can do in</p>

<p begin="01:39:28.760" end="01:39:32.710" style="s2">consensus it&#39;s it is pretty cohesive</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.639" end="01:39:39.159" style="s2">how do we regularize it how do we turn</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.639" end="01:39:40.330" style="s2">when we started big markets of financial</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.159" end="01:39:41.530" style="s2">markets how did we turn them into</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.330" end="01:39:44.350" style="s2">something that was useful instead of</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.530" end="01:39:45.909" style="s2">disruptive it just to stabilizing I mean</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.350" end="01:39:48.250" style="s2">how do we turn bureaucracies into</p>

<p begin="01:40:22.630" end="01:40:26.710" style="s2">technological artifact is that we use</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.820" end="01:40:28.270" style="s2">that to manage everything and and what</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.710" end="01:40:30.159" style="s2">we&#39;re really doing right now is really</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.270" end="01:40:34.570" style="s2">just fighting over how that artifact is</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.159" end="01:40:36.010" style="s2">built and infinitely ai&#39;s no that would</p>

<p begin="01:40:38.080" end="01:40:42.040" style="s2">so I&#39;ve had some really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.850" end="01:40:43.869" style="s2">conversations with folks lately I did an</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.040" end="01:40:46.900" style="s2">interview with Joe Norman yesterday was</p>

<p begin="01:41:06.760" end="01:41:11.679" style="s2">with social media and memes and fake</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.340" end="01:41:14.050" style="s2">news and viral spread of information and</p>

<p begin="01:41:14.050" end="01:41:17.920" style="s2">about how in the future there may be</p>

<p begin="01:41:24.219" end="01:41:27.310" style="s2">that causes this kind of disruption and</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.810" end="01:41:29.500" style="s2">that&#39;s totally in the same vein I think</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.310" end="01:41:31.869" style="s2">of having a eyes manage our social</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.500" end="01:41:33.520" style="s2">networks but for the medium term for</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.869" end="01:41:35.949" style="s2">right now what I&#39;m more concerned about</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.520" end="01:41:38.260" style="s2">is this sense that the federal</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.949" end="01:41:39.820" style="s2">government is losing its power the</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.260" end="01:41:41.710" style="s2">traditional political parties have what</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.820" end="01:41:43.150" style="s2">are losing their power black lives</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.710" end="01:41:45.219" style="s2">matter appears to be one of the most</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.150" end="01:41:47.409" style="s2">popular institutions in America at this</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.219" end="01:41:49.809" style="s2">time its operating as if it were</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.409" end="01:41:51.789" style="s2">political party they&#39;re making demands</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.809" end="01:41:54.249" style="s2">are getting response out of the federal</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.789" end="01:41:55.929" style="s2">government but it&#39;s not an official</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.249" end="01:41:57.729" style="s2">party in that sense that what we&#39;re used</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.929" end="01:41:59.679" style="s2">to and they can make demands that the</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.729" end="01:42:01.179" style="s2">rest of us don&#39;t want and then because</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.679" end="01:42:04.030" style="s2">of the alliance in between the</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.179" end="01:42:06.369" style="s2">resistance and the corporations and and</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.030" end="01:42:08.679" style="s2">the blue church they&#39;re able to enact</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.369" end="01:42:10.570" style="s2">their legislation overnight it was like</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.679" end="01:42:11.949" style="s2">in two days they had legislation done</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.570" end="01:42:16.829" style="s2">and there&#39;s gonna be more legislation</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.949" end="01:42:19.449" style="s2">coming so I&#39;m seeing this as like a</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.829" end="01:42:21.429" style="s2">natural phenomenon that we can&#39;t control</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.449" end="01:42:24.550" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s like it&#39;s like the mob on</p>

<p begin="01:42:28.989" end="01:42:35.829" style="s2">that were intruded upon within covin but</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.340" end="01:42:38.019" style="s2">it also happening uh I didn&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.829" end="01:42:39.669" style="s2">opinion on Russia gate whatever it is I</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.019" end="01:42:41.769" style="s2">just thought it was interesting to be an</p>

<p begin="01:42:41.769" end="01:42:47.979" style="s2">was amazing how quickly it happened how</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.249" end="01:42:50.019" style="s2">quickly all the legal processes were</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.979" end="01:42:51.550" style="s2">thrown out the window we defined how</p>

<p begin="01:42:59.679" end="01:43:04.919" style="s2">called how quickly they were able to get</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.039" end="01:43:07.929" style="s2">to an impeachment so it&#39;s not just them</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.919" end="01:43:10.150" style="s2">these social movements that are able to</p>

<p begin="01:54:35.539" end="01:54:39.349" style="s2">anymore I think there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.679" end="01:54:41.209" style="s2">misalignment in some ways I wish that</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.349" end="01:54:42.769" style="s2">they would just exclusively focus on the</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.209" end="01:54:44.539" style="s2">bottom line and that would drive a lot</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.769" end="01:54:47.389" style="s2">of different decision-making I believe</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.539" end="01:54:48.530" style="s2">there&#39;s no one I mean look they just</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.389" end="01:54:51.289" style="s2">took off</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.530" end="01:54:53.780" style="s2">the federalists and Zero Hedge off of</p>

<p begin="01:54:53.780" end="01:54:56.749" style="s2">money straight out of their pocket</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.039" end="01:54:59.389" style="s2">because they&#39;ve just had a different</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.749" end="01:55:01.010" style="s2">ideology now maybe there&#39;s an analysis</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.389" end="01:55:03.649" style="s2">to be made there that they would lose</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.010" end="01:55:04.969" style="s2">other other advertisers and net-net it</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.649" end="01:55:05.710" style="s2">was best for them but I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.969" end="01:55:08.499" style="s2">that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.710" end="01:55:10.479" style="s2">so I think Adam from your perspective is</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.499" end="01:55:12.760" style="s2">Oh as a Wall Street guy as an investor</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.479" end="01:55:17.889" style="s2">someone who depends on boards to be</p>

<p begin="01:55:20.800" end="01:55:25.599" style="s2">be true so that your worldview works but</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.800" end="01:55:27.579" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true but let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="01:55:25.599" end="01:55:29.739" style="s2">how it drives with Jon okay because</p>

<p begin="01:55:29.739" end="01:55:34.510" style="s2">articulated is kind of you know this</p>

<p begin="01:55:34.510" end="01:55:38.739" style="s2">itself within a system and how it</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.739" end="01:55:40.440" style="s2">infiltrates within a system and how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.739" end="01:55:44.380" style="s2">very disparate at the same time right</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.440" end="01:55:48.340" style="s2">but so that same network also attacks</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.380" end="01:55:49.989" style="s2">the Board of Directors all and the</p>

<p begin="01:55:53.530" end="01:55:56.889" style="s2">like Feroz I even said something about</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.389" end="01:55:59.590" style="s2">ESA it&#39;s obviously wrong but it&#39;s a very</p>

<p begin="01:56:08.469" end="01:56:12.579" style="s2">shareholders of Twitter and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.079" end="01:56:15.489" style="s2">say unless they do this I&#39;m gonna do</p>

<p begin="01:56:27.670" end="01:56:31.900" style="s2">but I mean some of the some of those</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.260" end="01:56:33.670" style="s2">major shareholders are also aligned with</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.900" end="01:56:36.820" style="s2">the resistance and they also have their</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.670" end="01:56:39.880" style="s2">own motivations I wish there was such a</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.820" end="01:56:41.679" style="s2">clearly set of incentives and alignments</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.880" end="01:56:43.599" style="s2">that like we could apply logic and</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.679" end="01:56:45.729" style="s2">necessarily to this circumstance but I</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.599" end="01:56:48.130" style="s2">don&#39;t see it and maybe maybe that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.729" end="01:56:50.320" style="s2">me I&#39;m not working on Wall Street and</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.130" end="01:56:53.139" style="s2">I&#39;m not a network specialist so it just</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.320" end="01:56:55.269" style="s2">strikes me as it&#39;s not necessarily the</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.139" end="01:56:58.809" style="s2">right frame of reference to try to</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.269" end="01:57:00.369" style="s2">understand what&#39;s happening perhaps I</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.809" end="01:57:01.989" style="s2">mean perhaps but again if we&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.369" end="01:57:04.659" style="s2">looking at a few different corporations</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.989" end="01:57:06.969" style="s2">and we&#39;re taking a look at a GDP of a</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.659" end="01:57:08.619" style="s2">couple trillion dollars that that can</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.969" end="01:57:10.829" style="s2">kind of allocate that money any way they</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.619" end="01:57:14.320" style="s2">want whether they want to subsidize a</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.829" end="01:57:16.749" style="s2">broadcast of CNN and hotels or not</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.320" end="01:57:18.369" style="s2">airports despite nobody really wants to</p>

<p begin="01:57:18.369" end="01:57:21.800" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.830" end="01:57:24.680" style="s2">poor I want to see like some Tom Cruise</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.800" end="01:57:25.970" style="s2">movie or something show yeah exactly I</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.680" end="01:57:29.450" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say like taunt</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.970" end="01:57:33.140" style="s2">so but so if the government chooses to</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.450" end="01:57:34.940" style="s2">pay a premium to have in airports and</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.140" end="01:57:36.920" style="s2">then you know in the authorities that</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.940" end="01:57:41.780" style="s2">you know that have jurisdiction over the</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.920" end="01:57:42.740" style="s2">of the airports um to show CNN and pay a</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.780" end="01:57:44.810" style="s2">premium for it</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.740" end="01:57:46.730" style="s2">well then CNN&#39;s going to do what whoever</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.810" end="01:57:48.710" style="s2">is controlling up straying for the</p>
