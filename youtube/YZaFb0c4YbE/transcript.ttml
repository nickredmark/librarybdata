<p begin="00:00:09.519" end="00:00:13.280" style="s2">hey folks</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.559" end="00:00:14.080" style="s2">welcome to the dark horse podcast live</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.280" end="00:00:18.000" style="s2">stream</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.080" end="00:00:21.199" style="s2">q and a cat infestation</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.000" end="00:00:23.279" style="s2">we are going to attempt to address your</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.199" end="00:00:24.880" style="s2">questions with answers that hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.279" end="00:00:26.800" style="s2">you will find suitable if</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.880" end="00:00:28.080" style="s2">they are not suitable i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.800" end="00:00:30.880" style="s2">we can do about it</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.080" end="00:00:31.760" style="s2">but perhaps we&#39;ll set up a process it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.880" end="00:00:34.800" style="s2">a process</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.760" end="00:00:37.200" style="s2">yeah a process yeah all right</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.800" end="00:00:38.719" style="s2">so we will start with a few questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.200" end="00:00:41.760" style="s2">from episode 50</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.719" end="00:00:42.480" style="s2">and uh then we&#39;re going to pull one uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.760" end="00:00:44.239" style="s2">that was</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.480" end="00:00:45.760" style="s2">sent in from the discord server and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.239" end="00:00:49.440" style="s2">begin with questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.760" end="00:00:50.640" style="s2">um at the highest monetary level from</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.440" end="00:00:52.800" style="s2">last hour and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.640" end="00:00:53.920" style="s2">finally uh answer questions from this</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.800" end="00:00:55.920" style="s2">area that come in in</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.920" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">the order in which they come in although</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.920" end="00:00:59.280" style="s2">we as always reserve the right to pick</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:01.039" style="s2">and choose since we never get through</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.280" end="00:01:04.239" style="s2">all of them</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.039" end="00:01:07.280" style="s2">question from last time</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.239" end="00:01:08.880" style="s2">is there hi friend uh is there an ess</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.280" end="00:01:10.640" style="s2">that is an evolutionarily stable</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.880" end="00:01:13.280" style="s2">strategy</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.640" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">likely to evolve over time as in decades</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.280" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">after sufficient number of oscillations</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:18.159" style="s2">of power between right and left that</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:18.880" style="s2">will eventually result in policies that</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.159" end="00:01:22.720" style="s2">are not</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.880" end="00:01:24.400" style="s2">polar uh yes</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.720" end="00:01:26.799" style="s2">problem being there is nothing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.400" end="00:01:28.000" style="s2">guarantees you don&#39;t go extinct before</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.799" end="00:01:30.880" style="s2">you get there so the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.000" end="00:01:31.600" style="s2">tendency will be to go in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.880" end="00:01:34.720" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.600" end="00:01:37.759" style="s2">danger is that we won&#39;t make it and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.720" end="00:01:41.680" style="s2">the solution of course involves</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.759" end="00:01:44.240" style="s2">us consciously thinking about our</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.680" end="00:01:45.200" style="s2">desire not to go extinct and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.240" end="00:01:48.880" style="s2">blueprinting</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.200" end="00:01:50.320" style="s2">a prototype that might replace the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.880" end="00:01:51.759" style="s2">system so anyway i think there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.320" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">to be said about</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.759" end="00:01:55.439" style="s2">what we might do to stop that dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">oscillation</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.439" end="00:01:59.200" style="s2">um the stinginess of the right the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:02.640" style="s2">utopianism of the left</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.200" end="00:02:06.320" style="s2">and the hazard that they repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.640" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">place us in so the way to fast forward</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.320" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">the process is to talk about the hazard</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:13.760" style="s2">and what might get us out of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:15.200" style="s2">yeah and i mean the ess itself is going</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">to be dynamic uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.200" end="00:02:21.520" style="s2">just like um you know it will</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:23.440" style="s2">itself include oscillations it has to</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.520" end="00:02:24.959" style="s2">there&#39;s not going to be a set point</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.440" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">there&#39;s not it&#39;s it won&#39;t it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.959" end="00:02:28.160" style="s2">static well</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:29.920" style="s2">it can be a little bit like the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.160" end="00:02:33.840" style="s2">temperature of one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.920" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">body where it is maintained within</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.840" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">relatively tight tolerances in other</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:37.519" style="s2">words i don&#39;t think it can be i think</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:40.879" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.519" end="00:02:42.160" style="s2">more like say a lot of volterra dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.879" end="00:02:44.239" style="s2">between predator and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.160" end="00:02:45.680" style="s2">prey that&#39;s the problem is that dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.239" end="00:02:47.200" style="s2">and the question is can you build</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.680" end="00:02:48.640" style="s2">something that recognizes that that</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.200" end="00:02:51.440" style="s2">dynamic in this case</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.640" end="00:02:52.959" style="s2">places you in danger something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.440" end="00:02:56.000" style="s2">serves the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.959" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">function of</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.000" end="00:03:02.560" style="s2">basically homeostasis and does the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:03.280" style="s2">the job that that oscillation does can</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.560" end="00:03:06.080" style="s2">you make</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.280" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">the body politic act like an individual</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.080" end="00:03:10.000" style="s2">organism</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:11.200" style="s2">right and i i&#39;m surprised to hear you</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.000" end="00:03:13.280" style="s2">say that you think</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.200" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">one can i don&#39;t think we have a choice</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.280" end="00:03:16.640" style="s2">uh i really but i mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:18.159" style="s2">not having a choice and it being</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.640" end="00:03:20.159" style="s2">possible are not</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.159" end="00:03:21.280" style="s2">the not just because you don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.159" end="00:03:22.159" style="s2">have a choice doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.280" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">possible well</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.159" end="00:03:26.480" style="s2">clearly you can at some scales and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.560" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">question is can we scale it up</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.480" end="00:03:34.959" style="s2">so that the the job is done but clearly</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:38.000" style="s2">the hazard of oscillating back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.959" end="00:03:41.599" style="s2">is so great that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.000" end="00:03:45.440" style="s2">long-term well-being of the body politic</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.599" end="00:03:49.120" style="s2">depends on us taming that dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.440" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">so i do think there&#39;s a way there</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.120" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">maybe a domestication process rather</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.040" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">than imagining that</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:59.040" style="s2">a group can act like an individual well</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:00.080" style="s2">i think we are beginning to have the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.040" end="00:04:03.760" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.080" end="00:04:05.360" style="s2">that recognizes that the tension between</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.760" end="00:04:09.120" style="s2">right and left</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.360" end="00:04:11.680" style="s2">is a navigation mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.120" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">that i think we for the first time i</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.680" end="00:04:15.680" style="s2">believe we know where</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.640" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">we want to go right and we humans</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.680" end="00:04:21.040" style="s2">no uh we the west okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:22.479" style="s2">um i believe we know what the end state</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.040" end="00:04:24.400" style="s2">looks like and that it&#39;s already been</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.479" end="00:04:27.199" style="s2">spelled out and what we differ over</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.400" end="00:04:27.759" style="s2">is how close we are how quickly we could</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.199" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.759" end="00:04:34.080" style="s2">further in that direction but you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.880" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">a society in which</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.080" end="00:04:40.479" style="s2">the tools to compete</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.120" end="00:04:43.600" style="s2">are available without bias</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.479" end="00:04:46.639" style="s2">and in which uh one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.600" end="00:04:48.320" style="s2">misfortune is hedged out by a protective</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.639" end="00:04:49.520" style="s2">mechanism and therefore people are</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.320" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">liberated to try</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.520" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">to bring benefit to humanity</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:57.680" style="s2">that is the liberal west right the fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:04:58.720" style="s2">that the liberal west has never gotten</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.680" end="00:05:00.800" style="s2">there that they&#39;ve always been</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.720" end="00:05:03.440" style="s2">populations that have been excluded from</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.800" end="00:05:04.639" style="s2">access to the market and all means that</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.440" end="00:05:05.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of work to do but it</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.639" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that there&#39;s anything we</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.680" end="00:05:10.479" style="s2">need to learn</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.800" end="00:05:10.479" style="s2">about where we&#39;re headed</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.639" end="00:05:14.000" style="s2">so i would say it&#39;s a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:17.120" style="s2">the discovery</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.000" end="00:05:18.800" style="s2">that a sphere minimizes surface to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.120" end="00:05:19.919" style="s2">volume ratio</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.800" end="00:05:21.039" style="s2">right you could have a sphere and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.919" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">could say well what&#39;s better than a</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.039" end="00:05:23.360" style="s2">sphere well nothing&#39;s better than a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:24.560" style="s2">sphere</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.360" end="00:05:25.919" style="s2">and then we can look at all the things</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:27.440" style="s2">that look spherical and we can say how</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.919" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2">close really are they</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.440" end="00:05:30.639" style="s2">um so in this case i think we know what</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:32.639" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.639" end="00:05:33.840" style="s2">we are in danger of taking it apart and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.639" end="00:05:36.240" style="s2">having to rebuild it</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.840" end="00:05:37.759" style="s2">because of some utopian nonsense about</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.240" end="00:05:39.600" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.759" end="00:05:41.280" style="s2">equitable thing that would be better</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.600" end="00:05:43.759" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.280" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">than the thing that the west aspires to</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.759" end="00:05:48.800" style="s2">but if we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:50.720" style="s2">if we can survive the the allergic</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.800" end="00:05:52.800" style="s2">reaction that people are having</p>

<p begin="00:05:52.800" end="00:05:55.680" style="s2">figure out how to measure where we</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.160" end="00:05:57.199" style="s2">actually are and how to keep going in</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.680" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">this direction which we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.199" end="00:06:01.440" style="s2">successfully doing for hundreds of years</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:03.199" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.440" end="00:06:05.120" style="s2">it seems to me that we can do that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.199" end="00:06:08.479" style="s2">the recognition</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.120" end="00:06:09.600" style="s2">that a system in which the right thinks</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.479" end="00:06:12.080" style="s2">we want to do x</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.600" end="00:06:13.759" style="s2">and the left thinks we want to do y is</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.080" end="00:06:16.639" style="s2">actually a hazard</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.759" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">um and that therefore the left and right</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.639" end="00:06:20.800" style="s2">should be interested</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:22.479" style="s2">in taming the dynamic so that they can</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.800" end="00:06:24.400" style="s2">each play their roles but</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.479" end="00:06:25.520" style="s2">with respect to getting to a common goal</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.400" end="00:06:29.680" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.520" end="00:06:32.800" style="s2">clearly the right answer all right</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.680" end="00:06:34.479" style="s2">44 states have science ed standards</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.800" end="00:06:35.840" style="s2">based on the next gen sci standards</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.479" end="00:06:36.960" style="s2">these standards require a shift in</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.840" end="00:06:37.759" style="s2">instruction and learning that might</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.960" end="00:06:39.360" style="s2">surprise you</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.759" end="00:06:41.280" style="s2">would you be opposed to doing a special</p>

<p begin="00:06:41.280" end="00:06:46.720" style="s2">each high school science standard</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.280" end="00:06:48.400" style="s2">so i had um this came in last time and i</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.720" end="00:06:49.280" style="s2">looked at it i didn&#39;t i forgot to pull</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.400" end="00:06:52.560" style="s2">it up again</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.280" end="00:06:54.000" style="s2">for this hour um and it is it is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.560" end="00:06:54.720" style="s2">little surprising what it is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.000" end="00:06:56.960" style="s2">proposing</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.720" end="00:06:58.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i think it&#39;s unlikely that</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.960" end="00:06:59.520" style="s2">um our time is going to end up being</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.720" end="00:07:02.960" style="s2">spent</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.520" end="00:07:06.880" style="s2">going through uh a new set of standards</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.960" end="00:07:08.960" style="s2">um i in general i don&#39;t i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.880" end="00:07:09.840" style="s2">spend time on the particulars of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.960" end="00:07:12.880" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.840" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">um for on</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.880" end="00:07:18.479" style="s2">on any number of topics um</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:19.919" style="s2">because looking for the patterns uh that</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.479" end="00:07:22.319" style="s2">are that are larger</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.919" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">are just for a number of reasons just</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.319" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">what are more interesting to me but</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:27.840" style="s2">um i did look at these i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.960" end="00:07:31.360" style="s2">you&#39;ve heard of them</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.840" end="00:07:33.280" style="s2">at all um and i was pleasantly surprised</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.360" end="00:07:35.680" style="s2">to see that uh some of them</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.280" end="00:07:37.280" style="s2">uh the the new science standards do seem</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.680" end="00:07:39.840" style="s2">to be about inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.280" end="00:07:41.039" style="s2">and actual science as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.840" end="00:07:43.759" style="s2">wokeness</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.039" end="00:07:44.800" style="s2">and shutting down questioning we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.759" end="00:07:47.919" style="s2">if they survive</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.800" end="00:07:49.360" style="s2">yeah has donnie paved the way for a flat</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.919" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">earth president is it feasible to</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.360" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">flatten the earth to meet demands</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.919" end="00:07:59.280" style="s2">um yeah i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.599" end="00:08:01.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t even know what to do with that</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.280" end="00:08:03.680" style="s2">you know is it donny</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.280" end="00:08:04.639" style="s2">is it the dynamic that left the door</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.680" end="00:08:07.599" style="s2">open</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.639" end="00:08:08.960" style="s2">to to trump i mean it i just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.599" end="00:08:11.039" style="s2">understand why we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.960" end="00:08:12.720" style="s2">this conversation as if he emerged out</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.039" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">of nowhere and forced his way into the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.720" end="00:08:14.319" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:16.800" style="s2">what conversation do you think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.319" end="00:08:20.720" style="s2">having that you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.800" end="00:08:24.080" style="s2">um a partisan one</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.720" end="00:08:27.199" style="s2">the system uh has</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.080" end="00:08:28.800" style="s2">cancer or rabies or something and i</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.199" end="00:08:32.479" style="s2">think we&#39;re still having a</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.800" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">um you know an argument about</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.479" end="00:08:35.519" style="s2">you know the left half of the raccoon is</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:37.839" style="s2">less rabid</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.519" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">and therefore we have to support the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.839" end="00:08:41.760" style="s2">left half of the raccoon</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:42.479" style="s2">rather than oh my god the raccoon has</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.760" end="00:08:44.320" style="s2">rabies</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.479" end="00:08:46.800" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have to get rid of it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.320" end="00:08:49.040" style="s2">replace it with a raccoon that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.800" end="00:08:50.240" style="s2">okay not that we need raccoons but i</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.040" end="00:08:52.160" style="s2">mean we do oh we&#39;d need</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.240" end="00:08:54.160" style="s2">we like raccoons yes all right i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.160" end="00:08:55.760" style="s2">gotten that tangled no that was good</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.160" end="00:08:58.000" style="s2">i think that helped you emerge from</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.760" end="00:09:00.880" style="s2">whatever funk you were in there briefly</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.000" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">that&#39;s good just get you on the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.880" end="00:09:05.839" style="s2">raccoons or perhaps hedgehogs</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:07.440" style="s2">oh no not again no</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.839" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">enough too many hedgehogs for one week</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.440" end="00:09:11.680" style="s2">oh mike too much</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:12.160" style="s2">too much hedgehog for one lifetime wow</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.680" end="00:09:14.560" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.160" end="00:09:15.839" style="s2">yeah no i would like to see hedgehogs</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:18.240" style="s2">that&#39;s why this comes up</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.839" end="00:09:19.120" style="s2">yes every time you speak with douglas</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.240" end="00:09:22.320" style="s2">for instance yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.120" end="00:09:24.160" style="s2">yes for example are biological parents</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.320" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">replaceable with surrogate or foster</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.160" end="00:09:26.800" style="s2">parents</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:30.800" style="s2">if so what do adopted children lose that</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.800" end="00:09:30.800" style="s2">only a biological lineage can provide</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.160" end="00:09:40.080" style="s2">go um lots to say here</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.680" end="00:09:40.080" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.800" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">a family that has entirely adopted</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.839" end="00:09:48.959" style="s2">children</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">uh is uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.959" end="00:09:55.519" style="s2">un it is is likely to uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:58.080" style="s2">have very few problems</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.519" end="00:09:59.040" style="s2">uh that a family with entirely genetic</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.080" end="00:10:02.079" style="s2">children</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.040" end="00:10:04.240" style="s2">uh might have that the um that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.079" end="00:10:06.959" style="s2">genetic lineage part of the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.240" end="00:10:10.959" style="s2">between parent and offspring</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.959" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">is is not largely something that looms</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.959" end="00:10:18.079" style="s2">looms large in daily life i think um</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:20.320" style="s2">it is difficult uh and i speak from</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.079" end="00:10:22.880" style="s2">experience in my own natal family and</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.320" end="00:10:24.480" style="s2">from hearing many other stories like it</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.880" end="00:10:26.240" style="s2">when there are both genetic and adopted</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:28.720" style="s2">children in the home</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.240" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">that that that you know even when</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.720" end="00:10:33.600" style="s2">everyone is trying their absolute best</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:34.399" style="s2">on that there is conflict that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.600" end="00:10:37.839" style="s2">erupts</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.399" end="00:10:39.839" style="s2">uh almost always so</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.839" end="00:10:41.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what more you want to say</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.839" end="00:10:45.040" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.440" end="00:10:47.279" style="s2">well i would just say there is no bar</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.040" end="00:10:49.279" style="s2">to an adoptive parent being an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.279" end="00:10:50.480" style="s2">parent there are things that make it</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.279" end="00:10:53.600" style="s2">less likely</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.480" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">mixed brood being one of them we know</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.600" end="00:10:56.640" style="s2">that from</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:10:58.720" style="s2">lots of research that says such</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.640" end="00:11:01.839" style="s2">households are much more prone to all</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.720" end="00:11:01.839" style="s2">the things that go wrong</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.800" end="00:11:06.720" style="s2">but the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.519" end="00:11:11.279" style="s2">i mean the problem is we are seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.519" end="00:11:13.120" style="s2">collapse of parenting</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.279" end="00:11:15.920" style="s2">all over the place because in large</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.120" end="00:11:20.399" style="s2">measure our circumstances are too novel</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.920" end="00:11:22.000" style="s2">and uh parents have antagonists</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.399" end="00:11:24.079" style="s2">that are trying to persuade kids of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.000" end="00:11:26.160" style="s2">things that aren&#39;t true for their own</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.079" end="00:11:28.399" style="s2">economic reasons and so anyway there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.160" end="00:11:29.279" style="s2">you know there are so many things going</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.399" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.279" end="00:11:36.720" style="s2">that um focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.120" end="00:11:39.760" style="s2">a what might be a small difference</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:42.480" style="s2">in the likeliness of an adoptive parent</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.760" end="00:11:44.160" style="s2">being an excellent parent uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.480" end="00:11:45.600" style="s2">i think is just wrong-headed we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.160" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">seeing a failure of parenting all over</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.600" end="00:11:48.880" style="s2">the place and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:52.000" style="s2">really the point is what what goes into</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.880" end="00:11:55.680" style="s2">excellent parenting and how can we</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.000" end="00:11:56.720" style="s2">bootstrap a return to a culture in which</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.680" end="00:12:00.079" style="s2">parenting is</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.720" end="00:12:01.680" style="s2">basically functional and that will</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.079" end="00:12:03.839" style="s2">bring adoptive parents along just as</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.680" end="00:12:06.800" style="s2">much as anyone else</p>

<p begin="00:12:06.800" end="00:12:10.079" style="s2">would you fly seven hours to see elderly</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.720" end="00:12:11.839" style="s2">relatives for holidays</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.079" end="00:12:14.560" style="s2">then stay with family in a hotel for two</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.839" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">days is this unsafe given the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.560" end="00:12:20.480" style="s2">note that the destination state requires</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:20.480" style="s2">a test or 14 day quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.639" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">so i included this not because i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.440" end="00:12:25.519" style="s2">we can answer</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:27.200" style="s2">it because i think you just you need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.519" end="00:12:29.519" style="s2">know more about everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.200" end="00:12:31.200" style="s2">risk tolerance and the particularities</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.519" end="00:12:34.639" style="s2">of how careful people are being and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.200" end="00:12:36.959" style="s2">and and all of this but um</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.639" end="00:12:38.480" style="s2">i i wanted to just say this out loud</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.959" end="00:12:39.519" style="s2">because i suspect that this is something</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.480" end="00:12:42.240" style="s2">that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.519" end="00:12:43.600" style="s2">are wrestling with uh right now as as</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.240" end="00:12:46.800" style="s2">the holidays approach</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.600" end="00:12:49.920" style="s2">um you know how is it that</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.800" end="00:12:53.040" style="s2">after gosh two-thirds of a year</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.920" end="00:12:56.399" style="s2">of almost yeah almost</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.040" end="00:12:56.720" style="s2">of of some combination of lockdowns and</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.399" end="00:12:59.519" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.720" end="00:13:00.720" style="s2">you know complete disorder at almost</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.519" end="00:13:04.839" style="s2">every level of</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.720" end="00:13:07.600" style="s2">of life uh how</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.839" end="00:13:10.880" style="s2">valuable are the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.600" end="00:13:13.519" style="s2">the shared memories that you would</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.880" end="00:13:13.920" style="s2">create around holidays together which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.519" end="00:13:15.519" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.920" end="00:13:17.120" style="s2">often a time that families see each</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.519" end="00:13:18.079" style="s2">other who don&#39;t otherwise have time to</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.120" end="00:13:20.160" style="s2">see each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.079" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">you know what what is a break you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.160" end="00:13:25.519" style="s2">for people who have an annual tradition</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:27.200" style="s2">for whom that that part of the annual</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.519" end="00:13:28.639" style="s2">tradition has actually not yet been</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.200" end="00:13:31.519" style="s2">disrupted</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.639" end="00:13:32.160" style="s2">what might disrupting regular traditions</p>

<p begin="00:13:32.160" end="00:13:36.160" style="s2">at that level of cyclicity due to</p>

<p begin="00:13:36.160" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">cause disorder and i i don&#39;t know but i</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.279" end="00:13:42.160" style="s2">think it&#39;s potentially big</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.720" end="00:13:44.079" style="s2">i think that there&#39;s been so much</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.160" end="00:13:45.199" style="s2">disruption this year but there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.079" end="00:13:47.600" style="s2">tether</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.199" end="00:13:48.560" style="s2">on the holiday season that can mean a</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.600" end="00:13:49.680" style="s2">lot of different things for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.560" end="00:13:51.600" style="s2">different people for some people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.680" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">thanksgiving for some people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.600" end="00:13:57.680" style="s2">christmas uh for some it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.120" end="00:13:59.519" style="s2">hanukkah isn&#39;t a real holiday but um but</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.680" end="00:14:03.199" style="s2">you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.519" end="00:14:06.560" style="s2">it&#39;s a minor holiday i not real but</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.199" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">um you know for for most</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.560" end="00:14:10.480" style="s2">people there is some holiday at the end</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:14.160" style="s2">of the year that feels like</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.480" end="00:14:14.639" style="s2">the thing that uh that they experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.160" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">that they</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.639" end="00:14:22.880" style="s2">that they return home for the solstice</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:26.240" style="s2">um and giving up on all of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.880" end="00:14:28.639" style="s2">may create even greater</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.240" end="00:14:30.639" style="s2">mental health disruption than we&#39;ve than</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.639" end="00:14:32.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve yet seen that said</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.639" end="00:14:34.000" style="s2">people often complain about the family</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.480" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">time around holidays</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.000" end="00:14:37.199" style="s2">um and you know missing it might</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:39.600" style="s2">actually reveal</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.199" end="00:14:41.440" style="s2">that it wasn&#39;t as bad as you thought so</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.600" end="00:14:43.680" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a lot going on here and</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.440" end="00:14:46.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t know the answer</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.680" end="00:14:47.680" style="s2">yeah i think a it could be very</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.720" end="00:14:52.240" style="s2">hazardous</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.680" end="00:14:54.000" style="s2">in the sense of the annual check-in</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.240" end="00:14:55.279" style="s2">that people typically experience may</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.000" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">have a calibration</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.279" end="00:14:58.959" style="s2">function that we don&#39;t missing it could</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.880" end="00:15:02.639" style="s2">be hazardous is what you mean absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.959" end="00:15:06.399" style="s2">um obviously there&#39;s a huge danger of</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.639" end="00:15:08.160" style="s2">uh you know a</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.399" end="00:15:09.760" style="s2">not a super spreader event but a super</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.160" end="00:15:13.199" style="s2">spreader moment where people</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.760" end="00:15:14.560" style="s2">are gathering and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.199" end="00:15:16.240" style="s2">versions of the virus are spreading</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.560" end="00:15:17.920" style="s2">around which could be</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.240" end="00:15:19.680" style="s2">hazardous in its own right one thing i</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.920" end="00:15:23.680" style="s2">would say that i think</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.680" end="00:15:25.440" style="s2">we have been discovering of late is</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.680" end="00:15:27.199" style="s2">this is actually a perfect model for</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.440" end="00:15:29.199" style="s2">what we were talking about before</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.199" end="00:15:33.040" style="s2">about the oscillation between left and</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.199" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">right at the moment we have two</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.040" end="00:15:38.959" style="s2">narratives about virus and</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:40.240" style="s2">carefulness surrounding it both of which</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.959" end="00:15:43.519" style="s2">are wrong</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.240" end="00:15:43.519" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.000" end="00:15:48.639" style="s2">the little bit of travel that we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.440" end="00:15:51.279" style="s2">just done</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.639" end="00:15:51.680" style="s2">and the gathering with people where we</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.279" end="00:15:54.160" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.680" end="00:15:55.680" style="s2">seen very few outside of our immediate</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.160" end="00:15:58.880" style="s2">circle</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.680" end="00:16:02.000" style="s2">for you know two-thirds of a year</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.880" end="00:16:04.480" style="s2">has revealed that there&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.000" end="00:16:05.920" style="s2">also the change in season all of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.480" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">things have revealed that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.920" end="00:16:11.440" style="s2">problem with the fact that we have not</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:12.320" style="s2">reached agreement on what we are trying</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:15.120" style="s2">to accomplish</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.320" end="00:16:16.959" style="s2">and therefore how to collectively make</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.120" end="00:16:19.680" style="s2">good decisions in other words</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.959" end="00:16:21.519" style="s2">there should be some discussion before</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.680" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">you gather with people</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.519" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">about how you&#39;re going to minimize the</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:27.519" style="s2">chances that if one of the people</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.360" end="00:16:29.360" style="s2">at the gathering has coveted that it</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.519" end="00:16:30.800" style="s2">will not spread to others in other words</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.360" end="00:16:34.320" style="s2">is there an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.800" end="00:16:37.040" style="s2">to meet outside what is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.320" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">code of conduct with respect to masks</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.040" end="00:16:40.880" style="s2">does the fact that i&#39;m not wearing a</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:44.399" style="s2">mask while we are meeting outside</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.880" end="00:16:47.519" style="s2">mean that i am against masks no so</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.399" end="00:16:49.360" style="s2">you know basically it would be great if</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.519" end="00:16:51.839" style="s2">a socially distant group</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.360" end="00:16:53.279" style="s2">outside didn&#39;t wear masks because</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.839" end="00:16:54.800" style="s2">they&#39;re unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.279" end="00:16:57.440" style="s2">put them on without anybody having to</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.800" end="00:16:59.920" style="s2">remind anybody as you go indoors</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.440" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">that you spend as little time as</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.920" end="00:17:03.519" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:04.240" style="s2">in very enclosed spaces you prefer rooms</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.519" end="00:17:06.319" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.240" end="00:17:08.240" style="s2">larger you prefer windows that are open</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.319" end="00:17:10.319" style="s2">you prefer fans that are on</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.240" end="00:17:11.679" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s really tough to do for most of</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.319" end="00:17:12.319" style="s2">the country though in november and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.679" end="00:17:14.880" style="s2">december</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.319" end="00:17:16.079" style="s2">right so what that means is that all of</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.880" end="00:17:17.760" style="s2">these things have changed and so what</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.079" end="00:17:18.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve discovered is that we had a really</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.760" end="00:17:21.600" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.240" end="00:17:23.679" style="s2">pattern that we were all in on</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.600" end="00:17:26.559" style="s2">and it just became we the four of us and</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.679" end="00:17:29.679" style="s2">our family here our immediate family</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.559" end="00:17:31.200" style="s2">had a pattern where you know we had we</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.679" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">were making use of</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.200" end="00:17:37.760" style="s2">restaurants always outdoors</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:38.720" style="s2">right and we you know we were very</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.760" end="00:17:40.720" style="s2">careful about</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.720" end="00:17:42.400" style="s2">windows and things when somebody came</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.720" end="00:17:44.000" style="s2">into the house</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.400" end="00:17:47.440" style="s2">and the problem is the weather is now</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.000" end="00:17:50.400" style="s2">taking the behaviors that were working</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.440" end="00:17:51.280" style="s2">and upending them and so what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.400" end="00:17:52.799" style="s2">resulting in</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.280" end="00:17:54.559" style="s2">is a kind of since we&#39;re not in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.799" end="00:17:56.240" style="s2">frame of mind of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.559" end="00:17:58.240" style="s2">covet every minute of the day anymore</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.240" end="00:18:01.280" style="s2">because we&#39;ve just gotten used to it</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.240" end="00:18:03.120" style="s2">we&#39;re now you know thinking well</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:04.400" style="s2">we&#39;re not even thinking so it&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.120" end="00:18:07.360" style="s2">is that restaurants</p>

<p begin="00:18:07.360" end="00:18:12.160" style="s2">and it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.559" end="00:18:15.200" style="s2">highly transmissible in food so</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.160" end="00:18:16.559" style="s2">um the temptation is you know we&#39;re back</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.200" end="00:18:18.559" style="s2">in restaurant mode where that</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.559" end="00:18:20.240" style="s2">restaurants are a possibility but</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.559" end="00:18:21.760" style="s2">they may again not be a possibility</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.240" end="00:18:24.240" style="s2">based on the fact the weather means that</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.760" end="00:18:27.600" style="s2">outdoor dining isn&#39;t happening anymore</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.240" end="00:18:30.640" style="s2">so all of these things require</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.600" end="00:18:33.520" style="s2">sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.640" end="00:18:34.559" style="s2">rebooting of the conscious discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.520" end="00:18:36.000" style="s2">how can we prevent</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.559" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">each other from getting coveted if</p>

<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:42.320" style="s2">and this is much more important than</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.080" end="00:18:44.240" style="s2">some fraction of the population seems to</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.320" end="00:18:46.480" style="s2">believe at the moment based on</p>

<p begin="00:18:52.000" end="00:18:58.320" style="s2">yep i will say that on our recent</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.120" end="00:19:00.000" style="s2">just four day trip uh to uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.320" end="00:19:01.600" style="s2">a place even farther north than we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.000" end="00:19:04.160" style="s2">now uh we</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.600" end="00:19:05.919" style="s2">went to eat outside in a mexican</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.160" end="00:19:07.600" style="s2">restaurant and it turns out that despite</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.919" end="00:19:09.679" style="s2">what their website said</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.600" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">they were only open for takeout but they</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.679" end="00:19:13.440" style="s2">were selling margaritas to</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:15.760" style="s2">drink while you waited for your takeout</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.440" end="00:19:17.360" style="s2">so we sat outside</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.760" end="00:19:20.000" style="s2">and drank extraordinarily cold</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.360" end="00:19:21.120" style="s2">margaritas under a very cold sky and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.000" end="00:19:23.120" style="s2">darkening sky</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.120" end="00:19:24.720" style="s2">and i thought this is not the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.120" end="00:19:26.000" style="s2">under which margaritas were invented</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.720" end="00:19:27.360" style="s2">this is not this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:29.679" style="s2">not the right circumstance to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.360" end="00:19:30.160" style="s2">drinking margaritas at all yeah but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.679" end="00:19:33.120" style="s2">food was</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.160" end="00:19:34.240" style="s2">freezing your ass off in margaritaville</p>

<p begin="00:19:34.240" end="00:19:38.559" style="s2">exactly all right um question from the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.200" end="00:19:39.760" style="s2">discord this week</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.559" end="00:19:41.840" style="s2">humans are running on ten</p>

<p begin="00:19:50.320" end="00:19:54.400" style="s2">so i&#39;ll let you take this um i will say</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.600" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">that some of what</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.400" end="00:19:57.760" style="s2">well two things first before you take it</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:19:59.280" style="s2">is that some of what we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.760" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">with regard to eric hoffer</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.280" end="00:20:04.640" style="s2">uh was uh addressed some of this a bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:06.159" style="s2">and then i&#39;m not sure where the number</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.640" end="00:20:06.480" style="s2">ten thousand year old hardware comes</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.159" end="00:20:08.400" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.480" end="00:20:09.919" style="s2">i think we&#39;ve got twenty uh rather two</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.400" end="00:20:12.880" style="s2">hundred thousand year old hardware</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.919" end="00:20:15.039" style="s2">the ten thousand number the number that</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.880" end="00:20:18.080" style="s2">that reminds me of is</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.039" end="00:20:20.080" style="s2">uh ten to twelve thousand years or so is</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.080" end="00:20:21.280" style="s2">about when agriculture was popping up in</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.080" end="00:20:22.799" style="s2">multiple places around the world</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.280" end="00:20:26.000" style="s2">independently evolved</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.799" end="00:20:29.039" style="s2">uh in three four five places depending</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.000" end="00:20:31.039" style="s2">um so our hardware is a lot older uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.039" end="00:20:33.679" style="s2">than 10 000 years</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.039" end="00:20:34.400" style="s2">but other than that well you know what</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.679" end="00:20:37.120" style="s2">we say</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.400" end="00:20:38.320" style="s2">in our book is that the hardware varies</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.120" end="00:20:40.799" style="s2">a lot so we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.320" end="00:20:42.400" style="s2">you know the basic platform was fully in</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.799" end="00:20:43.120" style="s2">place a couple hundred thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.400" end="00:20:45.120" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.120" end="00:20:46.400" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously some hardware level</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.120" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s altered</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:52.960" style="s2">in the post farming era for humanity</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:54.480" style="s2">um you know most of the hardware almost</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.960" end="00:20:55.919" style="s2">all of the hardware will be</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.480" end="00:20:57.280" style="s2">quite a bit more ancient than 10 000</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.919" end="00:20:59.120" style="s2">years but it doesn&#39;t really matter for</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.280" end="00:21:00.559" style="s2">this question because the basic answer</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.120" end="00:21:04.240" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.559" end="00:21:07.679" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with um evolved software</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.240" end="00:21:10.640" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think the moral panics</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.679" end="00:21:12.200" style="s2">of this kind would have been very common</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.640" end="00:21:15.440" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.200" end="00:21:18.640" style="s2">pre-agriculture because the</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.440" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">uh the shared fate aspect</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.640" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">of very small groups of people living</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:24.559" style="s2">together wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:26.159" style="s2">tolerated it and so you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.559" end="00:21:30.240" style="s2">dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.159" end="00:21:32.400" style="s2">the 10.0 or 12.0 version of the culture</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.240" end="00:21:34.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s where these things happen and</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.400" end="00:21:35.679" style="s2">i do think it has a lot to do with what</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.000" end="00:21:38.880" style="s2">we discussed in the first hour</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.679" end="00:21:39.520" style="s2">where you have competitive dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.880" end="00:21:41.280" style="s2">cause</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.520" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">a group that is in a position to do it</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.280" end="00:21:44.320" style="s2">to freeze out another group that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:46.159" style="s2">in a position to</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.320" end="00:21:47.520" style="s2">defend itself those who are frozen out</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.159" end="00:21:49.039" style="s2">rebel against the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.520" end="00:21:50.559" style="s2">meritocratic system because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.039" end="00:21:51.760" style="s2">well armed for it and therefore would be</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.559" end="00:21:53.679" style="s2">its losers</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.760" end="00:21:55.760" style="s2">and they uh topple it which causes a</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.679" end="00:21:58.880" style="s2">catastrophe and you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.760" end="00:22:01.440" style="s2">rents repeat um</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.880" end="00:22:02.320" style="s2">awesome i knew i could bring shampoo</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.440" end="00:22:05.679" style="s2">into it</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.320" end="00:22:06.799" style="s2">um so yeah so anyway that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.679" end="00:22:09.039" style="s2">it is you&#39;re dealing with a</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.799" end="00:22:10.799" style="s2">culturally evolved phenomenon not a</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.039" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">genetically evolved one yeah this does</p>

<p begin="00:23:37.840" end="00:23:42.720" style="s2">um counts fanaticism among the only four</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.279" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">really important inventions made between</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.720" end="00:23:48.640" style="s2">3000 bc and 1480. how would he even like</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:50.320" style="s2">where did he just pull those numbers out</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.640" end="00:23:51.440" style="s2">of his ass i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.320" end="00:23:53.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t know he&#39;s a pretty careful</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.440" end="00:23:54.960" style="s2">thinker um it sort of needs more than</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.440" end="00:23:58.000" style="s2">the paragraph to know what he was</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.960" end="00:24:00.880" style="s2">what he was getting at yeah all right</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.000" end="00:24:02.320" style="s2">okay first question from last hour</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.880" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">episode 51</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.320" end="00:24:06.320" style="s2">twin studies etc show that shared family</p>

<p begin="00:24:09.120" end="00:24:12.559" style="s2">can an individual parent still have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.640" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">large influence by using an unorthodox</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.559" end="00:24:16.840" style="s2">parenting style</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.600" end="00:24:18.720" style="s2">and becoming a statistical outlier on</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.840" end="00:24:20.880" style="s2">purpose</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.720" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">yes i would caution people i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.880" end="00:24:24.960" style="s2">we know nearly as much about</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.480" end="00:24:25.600" style="s2">how these things are inherited and there</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.960" end="00:24:29.919" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.600" end="00:24:32.240" style="s2">many very subtle mechanisms by which</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.919" end="00:24:33.679" style="s2">things can appear to be genetically</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.240" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">encoded and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.679" end="00:24:36.880" style="s2">parents have very little influence yadda</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:40.159" style="s2">yadda this can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.880" end="00:24:42.400" style="s2">possibly be right it cannot logically</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.159" end="00:24:43.679" style="s2">be correct right so the question is how</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.400" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">is it incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.679" end="00:24:47.279" style="s2">and once you&#39;re at the how is it</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:49.440" style="s2">incorrect then the landscape is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.279" end="00:24:52.880" style="s2">open</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.440" end="00:24:52.880" style="s2">from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.039" end="00:24:59.679" style="s2">mechanisms to influence so</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.600" end="00:25:01.120" style="s2">do not take this stuff as gospel that</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.679" end="00:25:03.039" style="s2">says there&#39;s very little that can be</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.120" end="00:25:05.200" style="s2">done the very fact of parenting being</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.039" end="00:25:06.799" style="s2">the highly intensive long-standing</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.200" end="00:25:09.440" style="s2">activity that it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.799" end="00:25:11.600" style="s2">and childhood being so darn long tells</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.440" end="00:25:14.000" style="s2">you that this is a very important</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.600" end="00:25:15.520" style="s2">set of interactions exactly we have we</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.000" end="00:25:18.159" style="s2">have the longest childhoods</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.520" end="00:25:18.720" style="s2">per life span of anyone on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.159" end="00:25:21.919" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.720" end="00:25:24.480" style="s2">every organism with a long childhood uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.919" end="00:25:25.520" style="s2">has a long childhood because they are</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.480" end="00:25:27.039" style="s2">being parented</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.520" end="00:25:28.559" style="s2">and they are learning how to be the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.039" end="00:25:29.120" style="s2">adults they will become this is what</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.559" end="00:25:33.600" style="s2">childhood</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.120" end="00:25:38.159" style="s2">is that&#39;s not childhood that&#39;s stasis</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.600" end="00:25:41.760" style="s2">so also rotifers i suspect like</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.159" end="00:25:42.880" style="s2">being able to just cheating that was</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.760" end="00:25:45.120" style="s2">cheating no</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.880" end="00:25:46.880" style="s2">well they do have a variable also not</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.120" end="00:25:49.440" style="s2">all hashtags right not all cicadas</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.880" end="00:25:50.080" style="s2">cicadas only periodicals oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:52.240" style="s2">getting</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.080" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">this is getting ugly yep um no but they</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.240" end="00:25:56.400" style="s2">do have this</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.120" end="00:25:57.600" style="s2">very long larval stage attached to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.400" end="00:26:01.520" style="s2">roots of</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.600" end="00:26:03.360" style="s2">trees yes um 13 or 17 years</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.520" end="00:26:04.960" style="s2">yes everything else that has a long</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.360" end="00:26:06.400" style="s2">childhood has a long childhood i mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.960" end="00:26:08.080" style="s2">there&#39;s probably other exceptions i just</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.400" end="00:26:10.159" style="s2">don&#39;t think that counts as childhood</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.080" end="00:26:11.919" style="s2">for one thing well it&#39;s a dreary</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.159" end="00:26:14.080" style="s2">childhood i will grant you that</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.919" end="00:26:15.919" style="s2">and it&#39;s totally isolated i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.080" end="00:26:18.559" style="s2">that we need actually to</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.919" end="00:26:19.840" style="s2">um accessorize the term childhood by</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.559" end="00:26:22.480" style="s2">specifying that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.840" end="00:26:22.960" style="s2">it&#39;s with others of your species but um</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.480" end="00:26:24.559" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.960" end="00:26:26.080" style="s2">that&#39;s the primary reason that i am</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.559" end="00:26:28.400" style="s2">declaring that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.080" end="00:26:30.640" style="s2">childhood of periodical cicadas for 13</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.400" end="00:26:34.000" style="s2">or 17 years is not in fact a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.640" end="00:26:37.120" style="s2">childhood all right</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.000" end="00:26:38.000" style="s2">okay both men and women parentheses</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.120" end="00:26:40.320" style="s2">mammals</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.000" end="00:26:42.880" style="s2">are physiologically sexually activated</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.320" end="00:26:44.960" style="s2">with erection or clitoral encouragement</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.880" end="00:26:46.559" style="s2">during rem sleep from a very young age</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.960" end="00:26:48.880" style="s2">onward even though the content of our</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.559" end="00:26:52.480" style="s2">dreams is often not of romantic nature</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.880" end="00:26:56.240" style="s2">do you have a hypothesis why</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.480" end="00:26:59.600" style="s2">um i don&#39;t think we have the ability</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.240" end="00:27:00.080" style="s2">to know what such states are correlated</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.600" end="00:27:04.559" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.080" end="00:27:07.919" style="s2">cognitively i mean how would we even</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.559" end="00:27:11.919" style="s2">um so right what i would say</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.919" end="00:27:15.039" style="s2">is you&#39;ve you&#39;ve got a system</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.919" end="00:27:18.159" style="s2">in which the purpose of the system is</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.039" end="00:27:19.440" style="s2">the propagation of certain genetic</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.159" end="00:27:22.880" style="s2">spellings</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.440" end="00:27:25.039" style="s2">and i mean this is the reason human</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.880" end="00:27:28.159" style="s2">beings are fascinated by sex is that it</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.039" end="00:27:29.200" style="s2">it matters evolutionarily and so at some</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.159" end="00:27:31.600" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.200" end="00:27:32.240" style="s2">dreams are an adaptive phenomenon this</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.600" end="00:27:33.760" style="s2">is clear</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.240" end="00:27:36.960" style="s2">by virtue of the fact that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.760" end="00:27:40.320" style="s2">expensive and persistent</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.960" end="00:27:43.520" style="s2">it is not surprising that there is</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.320" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">sexually relevant content</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.520" end="00:27:50.640" style="s2">throughout them and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:53.200" style="s2">it has some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.640" end="00:27:55.120" style="s2">relationship to physiological states i</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.200" end="00:27:58.399" style="s2">mean i mean we could we could</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.120" end="00:27:59.679" style="s2">uh we could pursue this in all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.399" end="00:28:01.520" style="s2">directions but i would just say you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.679" end="00:28:04.799" style="s2">got a state dependence issue</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.520" end="00:28:08.240" style="s2">where arousal</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.799" end="00:28:11.360" style="s2">accompanies sexual success</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.240" end="00:28:13.279" style="s2">in waking life and therefore the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.360" end="00:28:15.440" style="s2">scenario building surrounding attaining</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.279" end="00:28:17.360" style="s2">that success in sleeping life</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.440" end="00:28:18.880" style="s2">should be accompanied with physiological</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.360" end="00:28:22.960" style="s2">states that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.880" end="00:28:24.640" style="s2">um consistent with it</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.960" end="00:28:25.919" style="s2">so something in that neighborhood but i</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.640" end="00:28:27.760" style="s2">guess what i would say is i think i</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.919" end="00:28:30.960" style="s2">think i hear in your question</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.760" end="00:28:32.480" style="s2">the suggestion that those physiological</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.960" end="00:28:35.679" style="s2">states during rem sleep</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.480" end="00:28:37.360" style="s2">are uh uncorrelated</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.679" end="00:28:38.640" style="s2">with dreams that would make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.360" end="00:28:40.080" style="s2">them and i just don&#39;t know how we would</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.640" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">know that if there&#39;s a way to know that</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.080" end="00:28:44.000" style="s2">i&#39;d be very</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:48.080" style="s2">curious and your suspicion is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.000" end="00:28:50.880" style="s2">um there is sexual romantic content in</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.080" end="00:28:51.520" style="s2">related to i think physiological social</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.880" end="00:28:53.440" style="s2">activity</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.520" end="00:28:55.600" style="s2">i would put it in a different way which</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.440" end="00:28:59.919" style="s2">is sure to be misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.600" end="00:29:04.240" style="s2">but basically if all human activity</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.919" end="00:29:08.000" style="s2">is a means to an end that goes through</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.240" end="00:29:11.799" style="s2">sexual interaction then what exactly</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.000" end="00:29:14.880" style="s2">is you know what is</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.799" end="00:29:17.039" style="s2">non-sexual thought the point is it all</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.880" end="00:29:17.919" style="s2">heads that direction though very</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.039" end="00:29:21.200" style="s2">indirectly</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.919" end="00:29:24.480" style="s2">right so um anyway it&#39;s a high bar but</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.200" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">yep would a biden win</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.480" end="00:29:28.480" style="s2">effectively reward and reinforce</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:30.960" style="s2">pre-election political violence</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.480" end="00:29:32.399" style="s2">i am a lifelong democrat no fun of trump</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.960" end="00:29:34.080" style="s2">no fan of trump</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.399" end="00:29:35.679" style="s2">but to me a dem win would mean the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.080" end="00:29:37.360" style="s2">normalization of political violence and</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.679" end="00:29:39.520" style="s2">all election years henceforth would be</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.360" end="00:29:43.039" style="s2">like 2020.</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.520" end="00:29:46.399" style="s2">um yeah they&#39;re throwing a tantrum</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.039" end="00:29:48.799" style="s2">and uh they are</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.399" end="00:29:50.960" style="s2">yeah i i think yes and yet i&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.799" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">exactly the opposite argument as well</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.960" end="00:29:55.919" style="s2">that a trump win will uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:57.520" style="s2">mean that the pre-election political</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.919" end="00:29:59.520" style="s2">violence gets worse</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.520" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">uh and therefore that&#39;s why you need to</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.520" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">vote for</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:05.440" style="s2">for biden i mean maybe that&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:07.200" style="s2">that&#39;s the same argument i kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.440" end="00:30:08.880" style="s2">i feel like i&#39;ve heard all versions of</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.200" end="00:30:10.320" style="s2">this and i don&#39;t think i just quite</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.880" end="00:30:12.640" style="s2">said exactly the opposite version that i</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.320" end="00:30:15.679" style="s2">was trying to but i think people are</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.640" end="00:30:17.520" style="s2">talking themselves into well</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.679" end="00:30:19.279" style="s2">there&#39;s a simple answer and it involves</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.520" end="00:30:21.360" style="s2">doing x or not doing x</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.279" end="00:30:22.320" style="s2">yeah but i don&#39;t think this question is</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.360" end="00:30:24.480" style="s2">a simple</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.320" end="00:30:25.600" style="s2">this strikes me as true oh i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.480" end="00:30:29.200" style="s2">absolutely true</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.600" end="00:30:30.399" style="s2">um but what i would say is violence is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.200" end="00:30:32.559" style="s2">means to an end</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.399" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">the end has to do with power and</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.559" end="00:30:37.039" style="s2">resources</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:40.559" style="s2">so what i would say is i would expect</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.039" end="00:30:41.279" style="s2">a trump win to produce one reaction</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.559" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">which might</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.279" end="00:30:47.919" style="s2">well be a continuation</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:51.440" style="s2">of violence and i would expect</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.919" end="00:30:54.000" style="s2">a biden win to change</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.440" end="00:30:54.720" style="s2">the nature at which power is being</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.000" end="00:30:57.039" style="s2">wielded</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.720" end="00:30:58.000" style="s2">what i do not expect which i have heard</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.039" end="00:31:01.840" style="s2">people argue</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.000" end="00:31:05.120" style="s2">for is the idea that if biden wins</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.840" end="00:31:08.240" style="s2">this madness the woke madness will stop</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.120" end="00:31:10.000" style="s2">right i think this is utter nonsense it</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:13.039" style="s2">is completely illogical</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.000" end="00:31:15.679" style="s2">this woke madness is about power</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.039" end="00:31:16.399" style="s2">it has discovered how much power it has</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.679" end="00:31:18.559" style="s2">and it has</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.399" end="00:31:20.320" style="s2">every reason to continue that</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.559" end="00:31:22.480" style="s2">irrespective of who wins</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.320" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">and so i would expect it to function</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.480" end="00:31:28.159" style="s2">through the biden administration yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:28.480" style="s2">even if it doesn&#39;t remain in the streets</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.159" end="00:31:30.000" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.480" end="00:31:32.000" style="s2">it&#39;ll look different but this just this</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.000" end="00:31:33.679" style="s2">continues the lie and some people</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:35.519" style="s2">i think are generally confused but some</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.679" end="00:31:38.640" style="s2">people are just lying</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.519" end="00:31:39.039" style="s2">when they say that the craziness that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.640" end="00:31:42.240" style="s2">saw</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.039" end="00:31:44.399" style="s2">in fact after the 2016 election was a</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.240" end="00:31:47.120" style="s2">result of the 2016 election</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.399" end="00:31:48.399" style="s2">no and you know we we saw a particular</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.120" end="00:31:50.640" style="s2">version of it of course</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.399" end="00:31:52.799" style="s2">being still at evergreen at that time</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.640" end="00:31:55.919" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.799" end="00:31:58.000" style="s2">all of the you know chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.919" end="00:31:59.440" style="s2">you know even violence that happened on</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.000" end="00:32:02.080" style="s2">the campus of evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.440" end="00:32:05.519" style="s2">that year after november whatever it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.080" end="00:32:07.360" style="s2">2016 when trump was elected through</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.519" end="00:32:09.360" style="s2">you know through may 23rd 2017 and</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.360" end="00:32:10.080" style="s2">beyond when the protests and the riots</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.360" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.080" end="00:32:16.080" style="s2">erupted um in force at evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:17.519" style="s2">were not the beginning they were not the</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.080" end="00:32:19.600" style="s2">beginning campus was</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.519" end="00:32:21.039" style="s2">already going crazy for years before</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.600" end="00:32:24.159" style="s2">then and</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.039" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">um it was facilitated by leadership that</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.159" end="00:32:27.279" style="s2">tolerated it</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:29.039" style="s2">and so you know look look to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.279" end="00:32:32.880" style="s2">leadership who&#39;s tolerating this</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.039" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">and don&#39;t imagine that this is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:36.320" style="s2">trump&#39;s fault this is that i mean that</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.880" end="00:32:39.120" style="s2">is that is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.320" end="00:32:39.840" style="s2">ridiculously juvenile argument yeah just</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.120" end="00:32:42.399" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.840" end="00:32:44.080" style="s2">fit with how this unfolded no it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.399" end="00:32:47.120" style="s2">it trump changed it</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.080" end="00:32:48.640" style="s2">for sure and and he played it and he and</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.120" end="00:32:51.360" style="s2">he profited from it</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.640" end="00:32:53.919" style="s2">but um he did not create it yep he did</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.360" end="00:32:53.919" style="s2">not create it</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.039" end="00:33:02.880" style="s2">oh where am i here we go hey brett</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.679" end="00:33:04.880" style="s2">hey brett france gets 75 of their</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.880" end="00:33:06.799" style="s2">electricity from nuclear power</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.880" end="00:33:08.640" style="s2">some five-eyed children just saw a</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.799" end="00:33:09.600" style="s2">mushroom cloud rise over the minarets of</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.640" end="00:33:11.840" style="s2">paris</p>

<p begin="00:33:11.840" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">naturally i stand with you on your</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.760" end="00:33:18.880" style="s2">villainization of nuclear power</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.440" end="00:33:20.960" style="s2">thank goodness your math needs work</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.880" end="00:33:22.080" style="s2">um come on let&#39;s not play games like</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.960" end="00:33:25.120" style="s2">this um</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.080" end="00:33:28.399" style="s2">the fact is nuclear power</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.120" end="00:33:30.000" style="s2">is a gamble when nuclear when fission</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.399" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">power was first deployed</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.000" end="00:33:35.039" style="s2">for electrical power generation the idea</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.200" end="00:33:36.480" style="s2">was that we would figure out what to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.039" end="00:33:38.559" style="s2">with the waste and we never have and</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.480" end="00:33:40.080" style="s2">what&#39;s more we&#39;ve proven</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.559" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">that the mechanisms that we thought</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.080" end="00:33:45.440" style="s2">might work don&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:46.720" style="s2">i&#39;m not demonizing nuclear power for one</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.440" end="00:33:48.880" style="s2">thing as i keep saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.720" end="00:33:50.000" style="s2">nuclear power isn&#39;t one thing it&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.880" end="00:33:51.919" style="s2">opposite things</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.000" end="00:33:54.480" style="s2">and i am very much a proponent of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.919" end="00:33:57.440" style="s2">second thing that is to say fusion power</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.480" end="00:33:59.360" style="s2">with respect to fission power is there a</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.440" end="00:33:59.919" style="s2">way it could be done safely i remain to</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.360" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.919" end="00:34:03.840" style="s2">convinced but it certainly can&#39;t be done</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:06.559" style="s2">safely with the modern</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.840" end="00:34:07.360" style="s2">or the most recent generation of</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.559" end="00:34:09.919" style="s2">reactors</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.360" end="00:34:11.919" style="s2">you would need different reactors you</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.919" end="00:34:14.240" style="s2">might need a different fuel source</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.919" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">um but because of the potential for</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.240" end="00:34:18.879" style="s2">positive feedback and runaway meltdowns</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.240" end="00:34:20.639" style="s2">yeah yeah the meltdown potential and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.879" end="00:34:22.399" style="s2">even even when it doesn&#39;t melt down the</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.639" end="00:34:22.800" style="s2">generation of large amounts of waste</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.399" end="00:34:26.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:26.879" style="s2">is uh highly radioactive for thousands</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.240" end="00:34:30.000" style="s2">of years</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.879" end="00:34:31.119" style="s2">is um you know it&#39;s just going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.000" end="00:34:32.320" style="s2">continue to build up</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.119" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">it&#39;s eventually going to find its way</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.320" end="00:34:37.679" style="s2">into the environment</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.240" end="00:34:40.800" style="s2">so you know let&#39;s not pretend this is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.679" end="00:34:40.800" style="s2">simpler problem than it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.119" end="00:34:44.720" style="s2">it seems like moral systems need a place</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.040" end="00:34:46.399" style="s2">to experiment and to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.720" end="00:34:47.760" style="s2">they have such long-term consequences</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.399" end="00:34:49.679" style="s2">that we can&#39;t design them</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.760" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">would you agree how would we create</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.679" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">these spaces</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.359" end="00:34:57.599" style="s2">it seems like moral systems need a place</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.200" end="00:35:00.839" style="s2">to experiment well</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.599" end="00:35:05.040" style="s2">a we have this</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.839" end="00:35:06.560" style="s2">um what we don&#39;t have is a proper</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.040" end="00:35:08.079" style="s2">boundary in other words we have</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.560" end="00:35:11.920" style="s2">tremendous freedom</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.079" end="00:35:14.880" style="s2">to choose our level of adherence inside</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.920" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">of a moral system and this is a feature</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.880" end="00:35:20.079" style="s2">of almost all maybe all religious</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:22.720" style="s2">structures for example there are people</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.079" end="00:35:26.800" style="s2">who are orthodox there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.720" end="00:35:29.119" style="s2">are more liberal in their</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.800" end="00:35:30.000" style="s2">view and in some sense these things are</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.119" end="00:35:33.920" style="s2">in competition with</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.000" end="00:35:37.200" style="s2">each other and so that experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.920" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">occurs the hazard becomes in secular</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.200" end="00:35:40.880" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.079" end="00:35:41.680" style="s2">or pluralistic society you have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.880" end="00:35:44.079" style="s2">danger of</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.680" end="00:35:45.119" style="s2">profiting from opting out of moral</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.079" end="00:35:48.720" style="s2">restrictions that</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.119" end="00:35:52.400" style="s2">bind everyone else and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.720" end="00:35:55.040" style="s2">a temporary advantage to</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.400" end="00:35:57.440" style="s2">atheists or those who behave like them</p>

<p begin="00:35:57.440" end="00:36:01.680" style="s2">because not everybody is equally bound</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.200" end="00:36:02.800" style="s2">so that i think is the hazard within any</p>

<p begin="00:36:13.599" end="00:36:16.880" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s true and i guess i would add</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.119" end="00:36:18.240" style="s2">to that just i i would have i would have</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.880" end="00:36:19.440" style="s2">framed this slightly differently and</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.240" end="00:36:20.880" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.440" end="00:36:22.880" style="s2">um this reminds me of adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.880" end="00:36:25.920" style="s2">landscapes right that you are</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.880" end="00:36:27.760" style="s2">if if you are looking for a moral system</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.920" end="00:36:31.680" style="s2">that is better than the one that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.760" end="00:36:34.320" style="s2">or the populace are in you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.680" end="00:36:36.480" style="s2">blueprint it and say go there you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.320" end="00:36:39.920" style="s2">get off the peak you&#39;re on and get onto</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.480" end="00:36:42.240" style="s2">another slope and and see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.920" end="00:36:43.599" style="s2">and that&#39;s you know what what does that</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.240" end="00:36:45.200" style="s2">get on a different slope and see what</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.599" end="00:36:46.160" style="s2">happens look like like how do you create</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.200" end="00:36:48.079" style="s2">that space</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.160" end="00:36:49.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t have a decent answer and i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.079" end="00:36:51.119" style="s2">that&#39;s part of what you were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.520" end="00:36:53.680" style="s2">answer there but</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.119" end="00:36:54.720" style="s2">i totally agree uh that designing the</p>

<p begin="00:36:54.720" end="00:36:58.000" style="s2">is not going to be the savvy way to do</p>

<p begin="00:36:58.000" end="00:37:01.760" style="s2">approach because it&#39;s just not going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:01.760" style="s2">be possible</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.160" end="00:37:05.200" style="s2">the left seems highly capable of</p>

<p begin="00:37:05.200" end="00:37:08.960" style="s2">parentheses generating problems however</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.520" end="00:37:10.000" style="s2">it does not seem capable at all of</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.960" end="00:37:11.839" style="s2">solving them</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.000" end="00:37:14.079" style="s2">does it lack any sort of implementation</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.839" end="00:37:16.240" style="s2">arm does it gate keep people</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.079" end="00:37:18.960" style="s2">that would be in said arm based on</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:18.960" style="s2">aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.040" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">um i&#39;m not sure what that last part</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.480" end="00:37:25.599" style="s2">means i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:29.839" style="s2">the left i mean if you mean the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.599" end="00:37:33.200" style="s2">american blue team that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.839" end="00:37:35.200" style="s2">um but the left itself i mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.200" end="00:37:37.040" style="s2">progressives have engaged in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.200" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">tremendous amount of highly effective</p>

<p begin="00:37:37.839" end="00:37:41.920" style="s2">making and are not getting credit</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.880" end="00:37:44.560" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.920" end="00:37:46.800" style="s2">that which passes for progressive these</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.560" end="00:37:49.520" style="s2">days is so crazy that it makes it look</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.800" end="00:37:50.000" style="s2">like it&#39;s an insane way to think right</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.520" end="00:37:53.119" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.000" end="00:37:56.160" style="s2">not so much but from the i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.119" end="00:37:58.079" style="s2">60s 70s uh and before</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.160" end="00:37:59.440" style="s2">absolutely yeah well i would also say</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.079" end="00:38:02.960" style="s2">you know in light of</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.440" end="00:38:07.760" style="s2">the um consideration of of hoffer&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.960" end="00:38:07.760" style="s2">that you engaged in in the first hour</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.640" end="00:38:17.280" style="s2">there is there&#39;s a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.960" end="00:38:18.079" style="s2">that has to be on unpacked to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.280" end="00:38:20.680" style="s2">that what is</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.079" end="00:38:21.839" style="s2">passing is left now are basically</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.680" end="00:38:24.240" style="s2">authoritarians</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.839" end="00:38:27.040" style="s2">rejecting a system that&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.240" end="00:38:30.480" style="s2">thing as actual progressives proposing</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.040" end="00:38:34.240" style="s2">how society might be altered bettered</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.480" end="00:38:36.400" style="s2">fixed yes yes good</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.240" end="00:38:38.160" style="s2">you spoke of jordan peterson&#39;s book maps</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.400" end="00:38:40.400" style="s2">of meaning and its cover art</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.160" end="00:38:41.599" style="s2">it is a sculpture he made in 1985 as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.400" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">graduate student</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.599" end="00:38:45.599" style="s2">called the meaning of music to be an</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:46.960" style="s2">object that changes as you look at it</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.599" end="00:38:48.780" style="s2">like a necker cube</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.960" end="00:38:50.000" style="s2">what did it remind brett of</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.780" end="00:38:53.119" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.000" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">um we don&#39;t have it else i&#39;d show it</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.119" end="00:38:57.760" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.520" end="00:39:01.119" style="s2">yeah the what it reminded me of</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.760" end="00:39:05.040" style="s2">is what i called</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.119" end="00:39:08.079" style="s2">pie chart language so</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.040" end="00:39:11.200" style="s2">there is a missing</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.079" end="00:39:16.320" style="s2">um a missing</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.200" end="00:39:19.599" style="s2">bridge between psychological thinking</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.320" end="00:39:20.240" style="s2">and evolutionary thinking it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.599" end="00:39:21.839" style="s2">it is not</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.240" end="00:39:24.160" style="s2">obvious to many people that such a</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.839" end="00:39:24.640" style="s2">bridge is necessary but the first forays</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.160" end="00:39:27.440" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.640" end="00:39:29.200" style="s2">making that bridge um basically</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.440" end="00:39:30.960" style="s2">evolutionary ecology</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.200" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">kind of died on the vine and it did not</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.960" end="00:39:34.079" style="s2">take over and fuse the two disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">the way it should have</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.079" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">so as i was trying to build</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:43.040" style="s2">the proper tools for thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:46.880" style="s2">evolution and ecology</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.040" end="00:39:49.119" style="s2">it became clear that one needed to use</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.880" end="00:39:51.359" style="s2">pie charts in order to understand</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.119" end="00:39:54.640" style="s2">populations growth frontiers</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.359" end="00:39:56.400" style="s2">etc and that what happened is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.640" end="00:39:59.040" style="s2">slices of pie grew</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.400" end="00:40:01.200" style="s2">so they didn&#39;t fit the original confines</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.040" end="00:40:03.040" style="s2">of the pie</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.200" end="00:40:04.319" style="s2">and anyway i built a little proto</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.040" end="00:40:07.839" style="s2">language that allowed</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.319" end="00:40:09.839" style="s2">the description of an event in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.839" end="00:40:12.079" style="s2">how it affected the fortunes of multiple</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.839" end="00:40:13.599" style="s2">populations simultaneously dividing up a</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.079" end="00:40:14.480" style="s2">world of resources in which the world of</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.599" end="00:40:16.960" style="s2">resources</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.480" end="00:40:17.839" style="s2">changed its volume based on what was</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.960" end="00:40:19.839" style="s2">discovered</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.839" end="00:40:22.400" style="s2">so basically once you move from zero in</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.839" end="00:40:24.000" style="s2">from zero sum into non-zero sum dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.400" end="00:40:27.119" style="s2">you can still use this</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.000" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">new form of pie chart pie charts haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.119" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">been much reviled</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:32.000" style="s2">in in scientific literature but you were</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.160" end="00:40:34.880" style="s2">using this new form of pie charts</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.000" end="00:40:36.720" style="s2">to describe not just relative growth</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.880" end="00:40:40.079" style="s2">within a population but the growth</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.720" end="00:40:43.280" style="s2">of the opportunity uh under non-zero</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.079" end="00:40:43.599" style="s2">sum dynamics uh positive sum negative</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.280" end="00:40:45.680" style="s2">sum</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.599" end="00:40:47.119" style="s2">and zero sum dynamics inhabiting the</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.680" end="00:40:49.599" style="s2">same pie chart</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.119" end="00:40:50.560" style="s2">um was what was necessary in order to</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.599" end="00:40:52.480" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.560" end="00:40:54.960" style="s2">competition between populations for</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.480" end="00:40:57.359" style="s2">example um anyway so it looked to me a</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.960" end="00:40:59.119" style="s2">lot like</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.359" end="00:41:01.119" style="s2">that diagram that&#39;s good i didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.119" end="00:41:02.480" style="s2">that actually i</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.119" end="00:41:04.960" style="s2">at some point i want to sit down with</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.480" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">jordan and talk to him about what he was</p>

<p begin="00:42:07.520" end="00:42:11.440" style="s2">don&#39;t have a response yet</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.440" end="00:42:12.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t know what to say</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.440" end="00:42:14.160" style="s2">more than that i mean unfortunately i</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.880" end="00:42:14.720" style="s2">think there is nothing to say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.160" end="00:42:17.280" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.720" end="00:42:18.720" style="s2">i hope it goes well i do think we need</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.280" end="00:42:23.200" style="s2">to develop</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.720" end="00:42:27.520" style="s2">a modality as we started to on our last</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.200" end="00:42:29.839" style="s2">podcast getting people to write down</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.520" end="00:42:31.280" style="s2">their faulty claims so that they are</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.839" end="00:42:32.400" style="s2">checkable in the future and that they</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.280" end="00:42:35.520" style="s2">cannot escape them</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.400" end="00:42:36.160" style="s2">is one feature of that landscape in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.520" end="00:42:38.480" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.160" end="00:42:40.480" style="s2">if it&#39;s a training you can&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.480" end="00:42:42.319" style="s2">ask the person doing the training</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.480" end="00:42:43.599" style="s2">that one&#39;s applicable here but yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.319" end="00:42:47.599" style="s2">would i do</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.599" end="00:42:49.920" style="s2">here i think i would be trying to</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.599" end="00:42:52.880" style="s2">introduce the idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.920" end="00:42:54.160" style="s2">that that solution you are proposing is</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.880" end="00:42:56.960" style="s2">a threat</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.160" end="00:42:58.400" style="s2">to something that is serving everyone in</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:42:59.920" style="s2">other words</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.400" end="00:43:01.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a problem to be solved the</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.920" end="00:43:04.560" style="s2">solution you are proposing to it</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.520" end="00:43:07.119" style="s2">threatens to destroy much more than you</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.560" end="00:43:09.760" style="s2">realize is in its scope</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.119" end="00:43:11.200" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know frankly i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.760" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">an individual is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.200" end="00:43:15.839" style="s2">in general in any position at all to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.839" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">that in a context like the one</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.839" end="00:43:19.040" style="s2">you described but somehow to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:21.119" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.040" end="00:43:22.880" style="s2">as a larger group of people talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.119" end="00:43:27.200" style="s2">about this can</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.880" end="00:43:29.359" style="s2">lodge in the discussion um</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.200" end="00:43:30.480" style="s2">and well in fact i was talking to</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.359" end="00:43:33.839" style="s2">douglas murray</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.480" end="00:43:37.520" style="s2">in my podcast with him several days ago</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.839" end="00:43:42.079" style="s2">and he pointed out so my claim to him</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.520" end="00:43:44.560" style="s2">was that the woke revolution</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.079" end="00:43:46.319" style="s2">is actually going to destroy we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.560" end="00:43:49.359" style="s2">system that fails to meet</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.319" end="00:43:51.680" style="s2">its objective there&#39;s a gap between what</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.359" end="00:43:54.800" style="s2">it does and what it aspires to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.680" end="00:43:57.920" style="s2">but that the challenge to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.800" end="00:43:59.599" style="s2">system as a whole is going to evaporate</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.920" end="00:44:01.839" style="s2">the well-being that the system</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.599" end="00:44:04.480" style="s2">is delivering and distributing yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.839" end="00:44:07.440" style="s2">unfairly but distributing to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.480" end="00:44:08.160" style="s2">and what douglas said that i was unaware</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.440" end="00:44:11.520" style="s2">of he said</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.160" end="00:44:14.560" style="s2">this is reminiscent of kant&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.520" end="00:44:18.880" style="s2">about the bird that thinks</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.560" end="00:44:22.079" style="s2">that um the air which is causing</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">uh um drag drag</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.079" end="00:44:26.400" style="s2">yes uh is the obstacle to it flying</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:27.680" style="s2">really fast and if only the air</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.400" end="00:44:29.599" style="s2">could be done away with it would be that</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.680" end="00:44:30.400" style="s2">much speedier when in fact wouldn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.599" end="00:44:32.960" style="s2">be the life</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.400" end="00:44:33.599" style="s2">yeah it can&#39;t fly at all without the air</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.960" end="00:44:35.359" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.599" end="00:44:37.280" style="s2">to the extent that we can start making</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.359" end="00:44:38.880" style="s2">this point to people look you have no</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.280" end="00:44:41.680" style="s2">idea what you are threatening</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.880" end="00:44:42.480" style="s2">yes there are real problems with how</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.680" end="00:44:44.160" style="s2">well-being</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.480" end="00:44:45.760" style="s2">and opportunity are distributed there</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.160" end="00:44:48.240" style="s2">just are um</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.760" end="00:44:51.280" style="s2">but you&#39;re gonna kill the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.240" end="00:44:52.880" style="s2">makes well-being exist at all</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.280" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s not going to be good for</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.880" end="00:44:56.319" style="s2">anybody including the people that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:44:58.640" style="s2">think you&#39;re helping</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.319" end="00:45:01.599" style="s2">um so i don&#39;t know that we can make that</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.640" end="00:45:02.960" style="s2">resonate but it&#39;s the kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.599" end="00:45:05.040" style="s2">one person&#39;s saying it isn&#39;t going to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.960" end="00:45:05.760" style="s2">enough saying it multiple times isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.040" end="00:45:07.760" style="s2">going to be enough</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.760" end="00:45:09.200" style="s2">but to the extent that message begins to</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.760" end="00:45:11.520" style="s2">come from different places</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.200" end="00:45:12.960" style="s2">and it causes some who are on this</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.520" end="00:45:16.400" style="s2">bandwagon to think oh</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.960" end="00:45:18.960" style="s2">wait a second i could i could evaporate</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.400" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">the very thing that i&#39;m trying to see</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.960" end="00:45:22.400" style="s2">distributed</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.839" end="00:45:24.880" style="s2">more fairly um yeah i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.400" end="00:45:28.319" style="s2">enhance mental health for instance</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.880" end="00:45:30.560" style="s2">um across people and</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.319" end="00:45:33.280" style="s2">attending a healing racial trauma</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.560" end="00:45:36.400" style="s2">training having having to</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.280" end="00:45:37.119" style="s2">incorporate such thinking into the rest</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:39.440" style="s2">of what i do</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.119" end="00:45:40.720" style="s2">may actually cause everything to decline</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.440" end="00:45:43.119" style="s2">in quality</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.720" end="00:45:44.560" style="s2">yes i feel certain it absolutely will</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.119" end="00:45:46.079" style="s2">but you obviously have to couch things</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.560" end="00:45:48.560" style="s2">more gently for an audience that</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.079" end="00:45:50.160" style="s2">can&#39;t hear it yeah and i would also just</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.560" end="00:45:53.359" style="s2">add this whole idea of</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.160" end="00:45:56.400" style="s2">healing racial trauma it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.359" end="00:45:57.520" style="s2">so right and it is so backwards because</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.400" end="00:46:00.319" style="s2">the fact is what you</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.520" end="00:46:01.920" style="s2">actually need is opportunity if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.319" end="00:46:02.319" style="s2">been frozen out of opportunity what you</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:04.319" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.319" end="00:46:06.240" style="s2">is opportunity and the tools to make use</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.319" end="00:46:08.560" style="s2">of it and</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.240" end="00:46:09.760" style="s2">my experience dealing with people all</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.560" end="00:46:13.280" style="s2">over the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.760" end="00:46:15.200" style="s2">is as soon as you have that</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:17.200" style="s2">opportunity and the tools to utilize it</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.200" end="00:46:18.880" style="s2">the trauma scars over</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.200" end="00:46:20.560" style="s2">right it&#39;s not like it&#39;s gone it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.880" end="00:46:22.240" style="s2">like the history evaporates but the</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.560" end="00:46:23.040" style="s2">point is it is not an obstacle to</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.240" end="00:46:25.599" style="s2">day-to-day</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.040" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">well-being functioning happiness any of</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.599" end="00:46:29.920" style="s2">those things as soon as the problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:31.359" style="s2">is addressed well i mean this is an</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.920" end="00:46:34.240" style="s2">analogy that you&#39;ve used under</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.359" end="00:46:35.440" style="s2">a lot of um in a lot of circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.240" end="00:46:39.200" style="s2">here but it really</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.440" end="00:46:42.319" style="s2">is so apt is that um</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.200" end="00:46:44.160" style="s2">you don&#39;t we will all experience injury</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.319" end="00:46:46.720" style="s2">in life some of it literal some of it</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.160" end="00:46:47.760" style="s2">metaphorical and at first it creates</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.720" end="00:46:50.880" style="s2">wounds</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.760" end="00:46:51.680" style="s2">and long term short as short term as</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:53.680" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.680" end="00:46:55.200" style="s2">we hope that it scars over such that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.680" end="00:46:56.640" style="s2">wounds are a thing of the past without</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.200" end="00:46:57.200" style="s2">ever pretending that the injury did not</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.640" end="00:46:58.880" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:00.880" style="s2">you retain the scar you don&#39;t retain the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.880" end="00:47:04.240" style="s2">wound and that so much</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.880" end="00:47:06.000" style="s2">of the modern ideology is about picking</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.240" end="00:47:07.920" style="s2">and picking and picking and picking and</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.000" end="00:47:09.760" style="s2">making sure that you never scar over so</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.920" end="00:47:10.960" style="s2">there was always exposed wound to</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.760" end="00:47:14.400" style="s2">display to people</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.960" end="00:47:15.119" style="s2">and to announce about how how awful you</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.400" end="00:47:17.440" style="s2">have it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.119" end="00:47:18.400" style="s2">how it can never be made right and that</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.440" end="00:47:21.040" style="s2">is in part</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.400" end="00:47:21.520" style="s2">a result of the constant picking at it</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.040" end="00:47:23.599" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.520" end="00:47:24.960" style="s2">keeping the wound open because the wound</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.599" end="00:47:27.520" style="s2">is your entitlement</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.960" end="00:47:28.880" style="s2">to you know to be given something yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.520" end="00:47:31.119" style="s2">and like you know what the injury</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.880" end="00:47:32.720" style="s2">happened what you know whatever in some</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.119" end="00:47:35.040" style="s2">cases people are just making up</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.720" end="00:47:36.880" style="s2">right but presume that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.040" end="00:47:39.040" style="s2">real here the injury happened</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.880" end="00:47:40.480" style="s2">the scar can still be your indicator of</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.040" end="00:47:41.280" style="s2">injury but also allow you to move</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.480" end="00:47:43.599" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.280" end="00:47:45.520" style="s2">and a wound specifically keeps you mired</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.599" end="00:47:47.280" style="s2">in the past and keeps you from</p>

<p begin="00:47:56.640" end="00:48:02.079" style="s2">whole swathes of the population</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.640" end="00:48:04.000" style="s2">is i i think in part based on um</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.079" end="00:48:06.400" style="s2">you you seeing that so many people are</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.000" end="00:48:10.240" style="s2">busy picking at their wounds</p>

<p begin="00:48:10.240" end="00:48:13.119" style="s2">i know it&#39;s not entirely i know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.680" end="00:48:14.000" style="s2">another big part of it which is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.119" end="00:48:17.119" style="s2">they you know they</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.000" end="00:48:20.559" style="s2">they arrive you are arguing</p>

<p begin="00:48:25.440" end="00:48:32.640" style="s2">um but certainly it only makes it worse</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.520" end="00:48:34.160" style="s2">if you if what is being told</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.640" end="00:48:35.680" style="s2">to them and this is being this is</p>

<p begin="00:48:36.880" end="00:48:40.079" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.760" end="00:48:41.760" style="s2">all levels where they still could</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.079" end="00:48:43.119" style="s2">generate a toolkit with which to</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.760" end="00:48:45.839" style="s2">actually move forward with</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.119" end="00:48:47.440" style="s2">um creativity and analysis and</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.839" end="00:48:49.920" style="s2">productivity</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.440" end="00:48:50.800" style="s2">and if what they&#39;re being told instead</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.920" end="00:48:52.640" style="s2">is</p>

<p begin="00:48:55.680" end="00:48:59.359" style="s2">uh well no one&#39;s going to win ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.680" end="00:49:00.240" style="s2">except the very few people who are in</p>

<p begin="00:49:02.800" end="00:49:05.760" style="s2">say that in</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.440" end="00:49:06.800" style="s2">you know if we go back to the question</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.760" end="00:49:09.440" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.800" end="00:49:10.400" style="s2">can we agree on a collective objective</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.440" end="00:49:13.839" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.400" end="00:49:14.240" style="s2">that uh replaces the you know the left</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.839" end="00:49:16.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.240" end="00:49:18.079" style="s2">oscillation as a control mechanism the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.880" end="00:49:20.880" style="s2">point is look</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.079" end="00:49:22.960" style="s2">you have an obligation to make yourself</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.880" end="00:49:25.839" style="s2">as capable as possible</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.960" end="00:49:27.440" style="s2">right to deal to scar over rather than</p>

<p begin="00:49:31.200" end="00:49:34.720" style="s2">fair right to the extent of the system</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.920" end="00:49:36.319" style="s2">isn&#39;t fair</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.720" end="00:49:37.599" style="s2">we have work to do but you also have</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.319" end="00:49:38.960" style="s2">work to do and it is the partnership</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.599" end="00:49:40.160" style="s2">between those things you make yourself</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.960" end="00:49:42.319" style="s2">as capable as possible</p>

<p begin="00:49:44.000" end="00:49:47.359" style="s2">that&#39;s the shared objective and it</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.079" end="00:49:48.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t involve</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.359" end="00:49:50.480" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to make myself capable at</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.880" end="00:49:50.720" style="s2">all because the reason i&#39;m not capable</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.480" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.720" end="00:49:54.079" style="s2">unfairness and you know take care of me</p>

<p begin="00:50:57.119" end="00:51:00.240" style="s2">because i</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.079" end="00:51:01.280" style="s2">didn&#39;t interpret it correctly and i</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.240" end="00:51:04.640" style="s2">thought you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.280" end="00:51:06.800" style="s2">it looked awfully happy in that spot</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.640" end="00:51:07.760" style="s2">i wonder if that&#39;s a hunting perch and</p>

<p begin="00:51:15.359" end="00:51:20.240" style="s2">and i walked around the corner very</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.839" end="00:51:22.480" style="s2">slowly so i didn&#39;t spook the animal and</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.240" end="00:51:24.880" style="s2">sure enough he was sitting right there</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.480" end="00:51:25.599" style="s2">and i shot a bunch of pictures and got a</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.880" end="00:51:29.119" style="s2">good one</p>

<p begin="00:51:35.599" end="00:51:38.079" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.559" end="00:51:40.079" style="s2">twitter is a hazardous place it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.079" end="00:51:41.760" style="s2">deserve my owl picture and i should</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.079" end="00:51:43.680" style="s2">take it somewhere else but anyway i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.760" end="00:51:46.960" style="s2">take it under advisement</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.680" end="00:51:48.880" style="s2">from hi yes what&#39;s going on man um</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.960" end="00:51:50.960" style="s2">from an evolutionary standpoint why is</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.880" end="00:51:53.839" style="s2">violence reduced over the ages</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.960" end="00:51:55.599" style="s2">has uh just the propensity for physical</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.839" end="00:51:57.520" style="s2">violence reduced or has the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.599" end="00:51:58.240" style="s2">violence just morphed into something</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.520" end="00:51:59.839" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.240" end="00:52:01.599" style="s2">causing us to have a false sense of</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.839" end="00:52:03.359" style="s2">security</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.599" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">um i would say that this is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.359" end="00:52:07.520" style="s2">same thing that we&#39;ve been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.839" end="00:52:10.480" style="s2">addressing over several different</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.520" end="00:52:12.559" style="s2">questions here which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.480" end="00:52:13.760" style="s2">violence is not a good way of fixing</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.559" end="00:52:16.559" style="s2">things it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.760" end="00:52:17.839" style="s2">wasteful mechanism right does it work</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.559" end="00:52:19.680" style="s2">does it keep people in line does the</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.839" end="00:52:22.559" style="s2">threat of violence get them to</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.680" end="00:52:23.520" style="s2">um do things that they should probably</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.559" end="00:52:25.359" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.520" end="00:52:28.079" style="s2">the point is if you can get the same</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.359" end="00:52:29.440" style="s2">system to reduce the violence necessary</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.079" end="00:52:30.839" style="s2">in order to get people to behave in</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.440" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">other words if you can ritualize the</p>

<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">or if you can encode it in something</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.520" end="00:52:35.920" style="s2">else so it doesn&#39;t actually require</p>

<p begin="00:52:40.319" end="00:52:45.760" style="s2">we have all agreed to be less violent</p>

<p begin="00:52:48.240" end="00:52:53.839" style="s2">and i would expect that pattern to grow</p>

<p begin="00:53:14.559" end="00:53:18.079" style="s2">something that i used to assign to my</p>

<p begin="00:53:18.079" end="00:53:22.319" style="s2">i recommend this should be findable if</p>

<p begin="00:53:25.119" end="00:53:30.319" style="s2">and he walks through some of</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.000" end="00:53:33.680" style="s2">what it is that we look like as humans</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.319" end="00:53:36.000" style="s2">compared to some of the other primates</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.680" end="00:53:36.000" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.160" end="00:53:43.680" style="s2">final question here before we move over</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.160" end="00:53:44.720" style="s2">to this hour&#39;s question so this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.680" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">actually someone</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.720" end="00:53:51.119" style="s2">has written in several times</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:53.839" style="s2">with a link here&#39;s a totally new</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.119" end="00:53:55.200" style="s2">cyclical evolutionary hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.839" end="00:53:56.960" style="s2">the hypothesis explains political</p>

<p begin="00:53:59.440" end="00:54:02.880" style="s2">explains how hormone levels of oxytocin</p>

<p begin="00:54:08.319" end="00:54:14.800" style="s2">so that link is</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.680" end="00:54:16.079" style="s2">here zach you can show this again um i</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.800" end="00:54:16.800" style="s2">believe the person writing in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.079" end="00:54:18.720" style="s2">question is</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.800" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">is the author here it&#39;s a work in</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.720" end="00:54:22.400" style="s2">progress it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:24.319" style="s2">uh the title is cyclical evolution</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.400" end="00:54:26.400" style="s2">hypothesis generationally oscillating</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.319" end="00:54:27.760" style="s2">birth cohort specific hypothalamic</p>

<p begin="00:54:34.319" end="00:54:37.760" style="s2">so obviously these just came in neither</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.400" end="00:54:38.000" style="s2">of us had a chance to do anything but</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.760" end="00:54:40.640" style="s2">read</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.000" end="00:54:42.160" style="s2">the the title but my first reaction is</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.640" end="00:54:43.760" style="s2">that this is putting the approximate</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.160" end="00:54:45.280" style="s2">before the ultimate this is effectively</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.760" end="00:54:46.640" style="s2">putting the cart before the horse</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.280" end="00:54:49.040" style="s2">so it may well be true that you&#39;re onto</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.640" end="00:54:52.640" style="s2">something interesting here</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.040" end="00:54:54.559" style="s2">but citing hormone levels even you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.640" end="00:54:57.200" style="s2">cyclically fluctuating hormone levels</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.559" end="00:55:00.160" style="s2">that are reliable across</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.200" end="00:55:02.000" style="s2">across individuals is primarily</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.160" end="00:55:03.760" style="s2">approximate level analysis of what is</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.000" end="00:55:05.760" style="s2">going on rather than an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.760" end="00:55:06.640" style="s2">level analysis because the hormones will</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.760" end="00:55:10.000" style="s2">follow</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.640" end="00:55:13.760" style="s2">uh what is selected for um with</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.000" end="00:55:15.680" style="s2">relatively rare uh um</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.760" end="00:55:17.599" style="s2">events where you&#39;re just limited you</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:17.920" style="s2">have you know phylogenetic constraints</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.599" end="00:55:19.200" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.920" end="00:55:21.200" style="s2">you know for instance you know we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.200" end="00:55:21.680" style="s2">get to a better eye in vertebrates</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.200" end="00:55:24.000" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.680" end="00:55:25.359" style="s2">um it would take require going through</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.000" end="00:55:28.480" style="s2">blindness to get to</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.359" end="00:55:29.599" style="s2">say a cephalopod eye um this will not be</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.480" end="00:55:31.440" style="s2">clear to anyone who hasn&#39;t ever thought</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.599" end="00:55:31.839" style="s2">about cephalopod eyes but um basically</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.440" end="00:55:33.760" style="s2">like an</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.839" end="00:55:35.440" style="s2">octopus eye is built better and we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.760" end="00:55:37.040" style="s2">able to see better for more cheaply if</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.440" end="00:55:38.480" style="s2">we had one of their eyes but in order to</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.040" end="00:55:40.160" style="s2">make it we&#39;d have to go back through not</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.480" end="00:55:41.520" style="s2">having eyes at all and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.160" end="00:55:44.160" style="s2">basically evolution can&#39;t get there</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.520" end="00:55:47.760" style="s2">selection won&#39;t take us there</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.160" end="00:55:48.160" style="s2">whereas cyclical hormone levels could be</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.760" end="00:55:49.839" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.160" end="00:55:52.079" style="s2">could be modified and we know that they</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.839" end="00:55:53.760" style="s2">do get modified pretty regularly so</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.079" end="00:55:56.000" style="s2">i would say that the question is likely</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.760" end="00:55:58.319" style="s2">to need to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.000" end="00:55:59.920" style="s2">how do cyclical hormone levels serve</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.319" end="00:56:02.960" style="s2">what is being selected for</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.920" end="00:56:06.160" style="s2">as opposed to using the cyclical</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.960" end="00:56:09.520" style="s2">hormone levels as an answer they are</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.160" end="00:56:10.400" style="s2">in fact um an observation that warrants</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.520" end="00:56:13.359" style="s2">a question</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.400" end="00:56:14.480" style="s2">rather than an answer yeah i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.359" end="00:56:18.079" style="s2">a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.480" end="00:56:21.760" style="s2">saying you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.079" end="00:56:26.319" style="s2">20th century nation scale</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.760" end="00:56:26.319" style="s2">violence is the result of</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.040" end="00:56:34.079" style="s2">low voltage fluctuations</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.880" end="00:56:35.920" style="s2">right because you don&#39;t go to war in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.079" end="00:56:36.400" style="s2">20th century without making some phone</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.920" end="00:56:38.720" style="s2">calls</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.400" end="00:56:40.240" style="s2">and so if you were to track you know low</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.720" end="00:56:41.839" style="s2">voltage oscillations on</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.240" end="00:56:44.240" style="s2">phone wires you had no idea where you</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.839" end="00:56:46.559" style="s2">were going wow</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.240" end="00:56:48.559" style="s2">um if you were to track you know uh you</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.559" end="00:56:49.280" style="s2">know phone calls out of the pentagon or</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.559" end="00:56:51.839" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.280" end="00:56:52.799" style="s2">you might register there was a whole</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.839" end="00:56:55.359" style="s2">bunch of uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.799" end="00:56:57.119" style="s2">you know phone traffic and if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.359" end="00:56:58.240" style="s2">mistook the phone traffic is causing the</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.119" end="00:56:59.760" style="s2">wars you&#39;d think</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.240" end="00:57:01.440" style="s2">well this is important because it</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.760" end="00:57:01.920" style="s2">happens it&#39;s every single war you get</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.440" end="00:57:04.960" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.920" end="00:57:07.119" style="s2">phone calls um okay so i</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.960" end="00:57:08.720" style="s2">that&#39;s good i like that but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.119" end="00:57:10.559" style="s2">quite sufficient i don&#39;t think because</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.720" end="00:57:11.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a more standard like correlation</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.559" end="00:57:13.760" style="s2">causation</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.440" end="00:57:14.559" style="s2">conflation no no this is this is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.760" end="00:57:16.160" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.559" end="00:57:17.760" style="s2">okay i&#39;m saying exactly what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.160" end="00:57:21.280" style="s2">saying which is that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.760" end="00:57:22.160" style="s2">um phone calls are involved in how wars</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.280" end="00:57:25.599" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.160" end="00:57:28.960" style="s2">and if you therefore track them you will</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.599" end="00:57:30.480" style="s2">detect something but your point is</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.960" end="00:57:33.119" style="s2">the evolutionary dynamics are going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.480" end="00:57:34.640" style="s2">control why the hormones are fluctuating</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.119" end="00:57:36.319" style="s2">rather than the hormones fluctuating</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.640" end="00:57:36.720" style="s2">causing the dynamics so maybe it really</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.319" end="00:57:39.040" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.720" end="00:57:41.520" style="s2">is maybe maybe the proximate ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.040" end="00:57:43.599" style="s2">the the confusion that many many</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.520" end="00:57:45.119" style="s2">many people have in science and biology</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.599" end="00:57:46.400" style="s2">and evolutionary biology even although</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.119" end="00:57:48.079" style="s2">more rarely have</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.400" end="00:57:49.760" style="s2">between the proximate level the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.079" end="00:57:51.200" style="s2">mechanism level of what&#39;s happening and</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.760" end="00:57:52.480" style="s2">how it&#39;s happening versus the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.200" end="00:57:54.240" style="s2">level of why it&#39;s happening at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.480" end="00:57:57.680" style="s2">evolutionary level</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.240" end="00:58:00.000" style="s2">is in fact just a fancy deep history</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.680" end="00:58:01.440" style="s2">conflation of correlation and causation</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.000" end="00:58:03.200" style="s2">which i&#39;d never actually thought to put</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.440" end="00:58:04.720" style="s2">in those terms before but i think i</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.200" end="00:58:07.280" style="s2">think that&#39;s right i think that is right</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.720" end="00:58:08.559" style="s2">yeah so anyway i&#39;d be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.280" end="00:58:10.000" style="s2">looking more deeply into what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.559" end="00:58:12.000" style="s2">written and it&#39;s possible that</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.000" end="00:58:13.920" style="s2">um it&#39;s just that the title is leading</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.000" end="00:58:15.920" style="s2">us to imagine that this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.920" end="00:58:18.000" style="s2">uh a conflation that&#39;s here but i would</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.920" end="00:58:19.680" style="s2">guess if you&#39;re if you&#39;re thinking this</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.000" end="00:58:21.680" style="s2">is downstream of the hormones</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.680" end="00:58:23.040" style="s2">then the hormones are downstream of</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.680" end="00:58:24.000" style="s2">something else and it would be well</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.040" end="00:58:25.359" style="s2">worth understanding</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.000" end="00:58:27.119" style="s2">what it was that caused the hormone</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.359" end="00:58:30.880" style="s2">fluctuations yeah and you know not</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.119" end="00:58:33.520" style="s2">not to say that um hormone levels aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.880" end="00:58:33.920" style="s2">you know aren&#39;t very interesting in fact</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.520" end="00:58:37.359" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.920" end="00:58:40.720" style="s2">my um some of my prelim work</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.359" end="00:58:42.480" style="s2">in grad school was looking at the ways</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.720" end="00:58:43.440" style="s2">that androgens the so-called you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.480" end="00:58:45.119" style="s2">male specific</p>

<p begin="01:00:22.559" end="01:00:26.960" style="s2">right whatever damage we have all</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.040" end="01:00:28.559" style="s2">sustained and however much we may have</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.960" end="01:00:30.079" style="s2">lost out on opportunities that we might</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.559" end="01:00:32.960" style="s2">have availed ourselves of</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.079" end="01:00:33.599" style="s2">the difference between throwing in the</p>

<p begin="01:00:33.599" end="01:00:37.599" style="s2">and attempting to make the tools as</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.599" end="01:00:39.680" style="s2">sharp as possible and wield them as well</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.599" end="01:00:42.319" style="s2">as possible it&#39;s a gigantic difference</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.680" end="01:00:44.640" style="s2">so of course you should upgrade them but</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.319" end="01:00:45.680" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to pretend like we&#39;re in a</p>

<p begin="01:01:00.880" end="01:01:04.480" style="s2">it&#39;s about the fact that we are going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.079" end="01:01:06.400" style="s2">continue to do this for generation</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.480" end="01:01:08.079" style="s2">after generation of human beings that</p>

<p begin="01:01:17.680" end="01:01:21.520" style="s2">for rescue to be a worthwhile topic and</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.480" end="01:01:24.559" style="s2">let&#39;s just please</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.520" end="01:01:28.480" style="s2">not do it to any more kids yeah</p>

<p begin="01:02:06.640" end="01:02:09.920" style="s2">could have done to lose to this guy and</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.319" end="01:02:11.839" style="s2">i came upon identity politics and</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.920" end="01:02:14.000" style="s2">abandoning the working class</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.839" end="01:02:17.680" style="s2">if trump wins again how can we best ask</p>

<p begin="01:02:20.799" end="01:02:24.720" style="s2">really seems determined to uh not learn</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.920" end="01:02:27.760" style="s2">the lessons</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.720" end="01:02:30.480" style="s2">it does and so determined the idea i</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.760" end="01:02:34.079" style="s2">mean really at some level</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.480" end="01:02:38.720" style="s2">one wants to say</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.079" end="01:02:41.280" style="s2">you did this and if you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.720" end="01:02:42.240" style="s2">how that happened you&#39;re gonna keep</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.280" end="01:02:45.200" style="s2">doing it</p>

<p begin="01:02:57.440" end="01:03:00.960" style="s2">the answer is unless you are thinking</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.440" end="01:03:02.799" style="s2">about the fact that this dynamic is</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.960" end="01:03:04.079" style="s2">making things worse and worse over time</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.799" end="01:03:05.839" style="s2">and that we have to escape</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.079" end="01:03:08.319" style="s2">it then you&#39;re not in a position to say</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.839" end="01:03:11.280" style="s2">who you must vote for because</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.319" end="01:03:12.160" style="s2">as bad as trump is he could be far worse</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.280" end="01:03:15.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.160" end="01:03:17.760" style="s2">it is not at all clear that biden</p>

<p begin="01:04:35.680" end="01:04:41.119" style="s2">talking about this in some more depth</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.839" end="01:04:43.039" style="s2">um if</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.119" end="01:04:44.720" style="s2">let me take the slightly easier part</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.039" end="01:04:46.720" style="s2">first if you&#39;re if your question about</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.720" end="01:04:48.880" style="s2">refractive surgery is like lasik</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.720" end="01:04:49.920" style="s2">which i think it&#39;s going to be so like</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.880" end="01:04:52.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.920" end="01:04:55.119" style="s2">basically cutting um cutting slits</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.960" end="01:04:56.480" style="s2">in the cornea to change the curvature of</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.119" end="01:05:01.520" style="s2">the lens</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.480" end="01:05:05.280" style="s2">um if we had the precision to actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.520" end="01:05:07.119" style="s2">do that and and</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.280" end="01:05:09.440" style="s2">we expected that the eye wasn&#39;t changing</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.119" end="01:05:12.559" style="s2">shape over time which it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.440" end="01:05:14.240" style="s2">um then it might be it it might be a</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.559" end="01:05:15.680" style="s2">reasonable surgery i was actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.240" end="01:05:17.599" style="s2">days away from having that surgery</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.680" end="01:05:19.440" style="s2">myself um i have i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.599" end="01:05:21.200" style="s2">had myopia since i was pretty bad in my</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.440" end="01:05:24.240" style="s2">opiates since i was 13.</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.200" end="01:05:26.880" style="s2">and um i was lucky</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.240" end="01:05:28.720" style="s2">enough to have ended up with a crazy eye</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.880" end="01:05:31.680" style="s2">fungus from madagascar which</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.720" end="01:05:33.200" style="s2">put had me forced to put the surgery off</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.680" end="01:05:34.400" style="s2">which i&#39;d scheduled for after i came</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.200" end="01:05:36.799" style="s2">back from this</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.400" end="01:05:38.319" style="s2">five-month field trip field season in</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.799" end="01:05:40.480" style="s2">madagascar</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.319" end="01:05:42.799" style="s2">during which time i spent some more time</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.480" end="01:05:46.079" style="s2">looking into what</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.799" end="01:05:49.359" style="s2">success and lasik actually means and</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.079" end="01:05:50.000" style="s2">it turns out that anything at 2200 or</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.359" end="01:05:52.480" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.000" end="01:05:54.880" style="s2">which may or may not be improvable with</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.480" end="01:05:57.599" style="s2">glasses or contacts afterwards</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.880" end="01:05:58.799" style="s2">is called success and so obviously if</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.599" end="01:06:00.640" style="s2">you&#39;re doing things like</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.799" end="01:06:03.119" style="s2">playing sports and spending long times</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.640" end="01:06:04.480" style="s2">in the field in alone</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.119" end="01:06:06.319" style="s2">and you rely on your eyesight that</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.480" end="01:06:09.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actually sound like success</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.319" end="01:06:12.559" style="s2">so um i don&#39;t know if that surgery has</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.680" end="01:06:13.760" style="s2">improved since then but i guarantee you</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.559" end="01:06:16.480" style="s2">that given that</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.760" end="01:06:16.799" style="s2">like teeth eyes change over time like</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.480" end="01:06:18.319" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.799" end="01:06:19.680" style="s2">teeth change in terms of where they are</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.319" end="01:06:21.839" style="s2">positioned over time and they actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.680" end="01:06:23.200" style="s2">have a dynamic tension in the jaw</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.839" end="01:06:25.359" style="s2">as you heard bret talking about with</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.200" end="01:06:26.720" style="s2">mike mu in the evolutionary dentistry</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.359" end="01:06:28.400" style="s2">episode</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.720" end="01:06:30.880" style="s2">we know that the eye changes shape over</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.400" end="01:06:32.480" style="s2">time and it also becomes</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.880" end="01:06:33.920" style="s2">harder the cornea becomes harder over</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.480" end="01:06:35.119" style="s2">time and this is pos this is a large</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.920" end="01:06:38.160" style="s2">part of what like</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.119" end="01:06:39.680" style="s2">middle-aged uh presbyopia is about is um</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.160" end="01:06:41.119" style="s2">not being able to move back and forth</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.680" end="01:06:41.920" style="s2">between different focal lengths as</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.119" end="01:06:45.440" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.920" end="01:06:48.720" style="s2">so the idea of these quick fixes</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.440" end="01:06:51.440" style="s2">um that will simply correct you into</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.720" end="01:06:52.960" style="s2">perfection uh really ignores almost</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.440" end="01:06:55.599" style="s2">everything about what we are</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.960" end="01:06:56.720" style="s2">as organisms and you want to say</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.599" end="01:07:00.319" style="s2">something about you know so</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.720" end="01:07:03.920" style="s2">i yeah i would say one</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.319" end="01:07:07.440" style="s2">we are screwing children up two</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.920" end="01:07:11.119" style="s2">part of this is natural in other words</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.440" end="01:07:14.480" style="s2">the invention of printed</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.119" end="01:07:15.440" style="s2">material creates a dynamic that is</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.480" end="01:07:17.520" style="s2">unnatural</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.440" end="01:07:18.880" style="s2">and the value of printed material is</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.520" end="01:07:21.920" style="s2">presumably</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.880" end="01:07:24.319" style="s2">high so by</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.920" end="01:07:26.000" style="s2">having people read at a close distance</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.319" end="01:07:27.839" style="s2">we are disrupting a system in which the</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.000" end="01:07:28.799" style="s2">development of the eye would be normal</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.839" end="01:07:30.720" style="s2">this is likely</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.799" end="01:07:32.720" style="s2">the reason that we have so much eye</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.720" end="01:07:35.920" style="s2">dysfunction the idea that it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.720" end="01:07:37.920" style="s2">genetically encroached encroachment of</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.920" end="01:07:39.039" style="s2">mutations is nonsense just as it is with</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.920" end="01:07:42.079" style="s2">the teeth</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.039" end="01:07:45.039" style="s2">but two things one</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.079" end="01:07:46.880" style="s2">the eye takes its shape in large measure</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.039" end="01:07:48.319" style="s2">because of the musculature within the</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.880" end="01:07:50.160" style="s2">eye which adjusts the eye</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.319" end="01:07:51.680" style="s2">based on the distortion not within the</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.160" end="01:07:53.359" style="s2">eye but the extrinsic eye muscles around</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.680" end="01:07:55.119" style="s2">the eyeball well i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.359" end="01:07:56.720" style="s2">say too much because i don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.119" end="01:07:57.599" style="s2">yes you&#39;ve got extrinsic eye muscles</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.720" end="01:08:00.480" style="s2">there may also be</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.599" end="01:08:01.359" style="s2">endogenous stuff but the basic point is</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.480" end="01:08:03.760" style="s2">you are built</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.359" end="01:08:05.200" style="s2">to fix your own vision right how do you</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.760" end="01:08:07.440" style="s2">do that on the basis</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.200" end="01:08:08.480" style="s2">of information about the distortion in</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.440" end="01:08:10.799" style="s2">your vision</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.480" end="01:08:12.480" style="s2">what happens if you take distorted</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.799" end="01:08:15.200" style="s2">vision and you correct it</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.480" end="01:08:16.799" style="s2">externally well now the data coming in</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.200" end="01:08:17.520" style="s2">results in you not fixing your own</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.799" end="01:08:18.719" style="s2">vision</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.520" end="01:08:21.040" style="s2">in a context where you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.719" end="01:08:22.960" style="s2">destroy your own vision by</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.040" end="01:08:24.799" style="s2">focusing very closely and this is going</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.960" end="01:08:26.960" style="s2">to be screens too</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.799" end="01:08:28.799" style="s2">now here&#39;s the part maybe you don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.960" end="01:08:30.400" style="s2">coming it&#39;s kind of like taking the</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.799" end="01:08:34.400" style="s2">anti-fragility away from</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.400" end="01:08:36.880" style="s2">the feedback system between person and i</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.400" end="01:08:39.040" style="s2">like you yes you you create a fragile</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.880" end="01:08:41.679" style="s2">system where it was antifragile it did</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.040" end="01:08:43.040" style="s2">correct from it did correct on the basis</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.679" end="01:08:45.120" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.040" end="01:08:46.799" style="s2">insults that came in and insults being</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.120" end="01:08:48.640" style="s2">wow that thing is out of focus i really</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.799" end="01:08:50.640" style="s2">can&#39;t see what that thing is oh i keep</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.640" end="01:08:52.719" style="s2">on running into things out of focus</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.640" end="01:08:54.960" style="s2">maybe the extrinsic eye muscles or you</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.719" end="01:08:56.960" style="s2">know whatever it is need to change</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.960" end="01:08:58.319" style="s2">uh the curvature of my lens such that</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.960" end="01:08:59.679" style="s2">that thing that i keep on running into</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.319" end="01:09:00.560" style="s2">that keeps on being out of focus is no</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.679" end="01:09:02.719" style="s2">longer out of focus</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.560" end="01:09:03.920" style="s2">right exactly um and you know look</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.719" end="01:09:07.040" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.920" end="01:09:08.560" style="s2">basically a video camera made out of</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.040" end="01:09:11.199" style="s2">biological goo</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.560" end="01:09:13.440" style="s2">right it&#39;s not going to be perfect it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.199" end="01:09:15.520" style="s2">not precision ground so the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.440" end="01:09:17.040" style="s2">musculature is going to correct for</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.520" end="01:09:19.199" style="s2">those distortions</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.040" end="01:09:21.520" style="s2">that&#39;s a marvelous beautiful biological</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.199" end="01:09:25.440" style="s2">solution to a biological problem</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.520" end="01:09:27.839" style="s2">you now take a ground glass lens</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.440" end="01:09:28.799" style="s2">and you distort the the information</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.839" end="01:09:31.679" style="s2">coming in</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.799" end="01:09:32.640" style="s2">preventing the eye from fixing itself</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.679" end="01:09:34.000" style="s2">now what have you got</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.640" end="01:09:36.719" style="s2">well it is almost a definition of</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.000" end="01:09:39.600" style="s2">fragility because the fact is all of you</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.719" end="01:09:41.120" style="s2">folks who walk around needing glasses</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.600" end="01:09:42.960" style="s2">are dependent on the</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.120" end="01:09:44.880" style="s2">mechanism that produces glasses what</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.960" end="01:09:46.400" style="s2">would you do if civilization came apart</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.880" end="01:09:46.799" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t making glasses anymore</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.400" end="01:09:49.279" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.799" end="01:09:50.799" style="s2">so you&#39;ve been rendered you&#39;d be you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.279" end="01:09:52.560" style="s2">rendered fragile by this</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.799" end="01:09:54.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s not that serious in a world</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.560" end="01:09:56.880" style="s2">where lots of people are wearing glasses</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.640" end="01:09:59.280" style="s2">and civilization can produce them</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.880" end="01:10:01.199" style="s2">but it is a solvable problem in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.280" end="01:10:04.239" style="s2">following sense</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.199" end="01:10:04.800" style="s2">a we probably now have the technology we</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.239" end="01:10:06.719" style="s2">didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.800" end="01:10:09.040" style="s2">50 years ago but we probably now have</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.719" end="01:10:11.600" style="s2">the technology to take whatever</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.040" end="01:10:13.040" style="s2">close focus work kids need to do in</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.600" end="01:10:15.360" style="s2">order to</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.040" end="01:10:17.199" style="s2">educate themselves or whatever and to</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.360" end="01:10:19.840" style="s2">place it in a context where it appears</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.199" end="01:10:22.640" style="s2">to be far away like imagine that you are</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.840" end="01:10:24.239" style="s2">reading a book on a screen in a movie</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.640" end="01:10:28.640" style="s2">theater</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.239" end="01:10:30.159" style="s2">30 feet from you right that might change</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.640" end="01:10:32.080" style="s2">the dynamics so you didn&#39;t destroy your</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.159" end="01:10:35.920" style="s2">own vision in reading</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.080" end="01:10:37.040" style="s2">you know so i don&#39;t love at all the idea</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.920" end="01:10:39.840" style="s2">of kids wearing</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.040" end="01:10:41.760" style="s2">vr goggles that place printed material</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.840" end="01:10:43.199" style="s2">effectively 30 feet from them in order</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.760" end="01:10:44.480" style="s2">not to destroy their vision but i like</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.199" end="01:10:45.040" style="s2">it a lot better than destroying their</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.480" end="01:10:46.960" style="s2">vision</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.040" end="01:10:49.520" style="s2">so maybe there&#39;s some way it could be</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.960" end="01:10:50.800" style="s2">done that wouldn&#39;t be so intrusive but</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.520" end="01:10:52.320" style="s2">at the very least</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.800" end="01:10:54.400" style="s2">this is the same thing that we were just</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.320" end="01:10:57.120" style="s2">talking about all right</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.400" end="01:10:58.080" style="s2">we&#39;re screwed up let&#39;s not screw up</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.120" end="01:11:00.159" style="s2">another generation</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.080" end="01:11:01.280" style="s2">of eyes right let&#39;s let the next</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.159" end="01:11:03.280" style="s2">generation of kids</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.280" end="01:11:04.880" style="s2">have normal eyes and normal teeth by</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.280" end="01:11:05.120" style="s2">fixing the thing that we do that screws</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.880" end="01:11:07.360" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.120" end="01:11:09.040" style="s2">every generation upon arrival yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.360" end="01:11:10.960" style="s2">one one thing just to</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.040" end="01:11:12.239" style="s2">one more thing now but we will continue</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.960" end="01:11:13.440" style="s2">to talk about this</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.239" end="01:11:15.920" style="s2">to your question should kids wear</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.440" end="01:11:19.199" style="s2">glasses one thing that</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.920" end="01:11:23.600" style="s2">uh we have suggested is uh on</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.199" end="01:11:26.560" style="s2">you know if if your kid is myopic and</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.600" end="01:11:28.480" style="s2">he or she is at risk like really does</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.560" end="01:11:29.760" style="s2">seem to need some correction in order to</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.480" end="01:11:32.159" style="s2">move around the universe</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.760" end="01:11:34.159" style="s2">consider under correcting yeah consider</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.159" end="01:11:36.080" style="s2">uh you know whatever their diopter is</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.159" end="01:11:38.159" style="s2">correcting one you know half stop</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.080" end="01:11:40.080" style="s2">full stop that&#39;s camera language but you</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.159" end="01:11:44.960" style="s2">know whatever whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.080" end="01:11:46.320" style="s2">um below that um such that their eyes</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.960" end="01:11:47.600" style="s2">you know an ophthalmologist is gonna</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.320" end="01:11:49.360" style="s2">like this just like most dentists don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.600" end="01:11:50.400" style="s2">wanna hear what um you know what mike</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.360" end="01:11:51.679" style="s2">mew has to say but</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.400" end="01:11:53.760" style="s2">you know the kid who has to squint a</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.679" end="01:11:55.360" style="s2">little bit um to see the thing but can</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.760" end="01:11:57.520" style="s2">make it out</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.360" end="01:11:58.640" style="s2">their eyes are likely to keep on working</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.520" end="01:12:00.800" style="s2">to get it right</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.640" end="01:12:02.159" style="s2">and rather than give them the fully</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.800" end="01:12:04.080" style="s2">cushy oh this is great i could just</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.159" end="01:12:07.120" style="s2">relax into well failing further</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.080" end="01:12:08.560" style="s2">yep right so along these lines let me</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.120" end="01:12:11.360" style="s2">just say that as a kid</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.560" end="01:12:12.400" style="s2">i was diagnosed with i&#39;ve forgotten i</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.360" end="01:12:14.880" style="s2">definitely was diagnosed with</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.400" end="01:12:18.159" style="s2">astigmatism and who knows what else</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.880" end="01:12:20.080" style="s2">and i was given glasses that i was</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.159" end="01:12:20.840" style="s2">supposed to wear as a kid i was supposed</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.080" end="01:12:24.239" style="s2">to be wearing</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.840" end="01:12:27.360" style="s2">bifocals and</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.239" end="01:12:31.040" style="s2">i basically thought</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.360" end="01:12:33.520" style="s2"> that and so i didn&#39;t wear them ever</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.040" end="01:12:35.120" style="s2">my eyes corrected themselves and i had</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.520" end="01:12:37.600" style="s2">vision that needed no correction</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.120" end="01:12:39.360" style="s2">whatsoever until i got to 50 and reading</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.600" end="01:12:42.400" style="s2">glasses became a thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.360" end="01:12:44.640" style="s2">um but the point is that was</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.400" end="01:12:46.320" style="s2">an anecdotal demonstration of the fact</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.640" end="01:12:48.000" style="s2">that the eyes given the opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.320" end="01:12:48.800" style="s2">given data that actually comes in</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.000" end="01:12:50.560" style="s2">normally</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.800" end="01:12:52.000" style="s2">were in a position to fix themselves</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.560" end="01:12:53.679" style="s2">where i was being told</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.000" end="01:12:55.199" style="s2">you know that i had a problem that</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.679" end="01:12:57.679" style="s2">required intervention and</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.199" end="01:12:58.640" style="s2">just you know if we&#39;re doing anecdote as</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.679" end="01:13:01.600" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.640" end="01:13:03.199" style="s2">my anecdotal experience runs runs not at</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.600" end="01:13:04.320" style="s2">all like that right like my parents</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.199" end="01:13:05.760" style="s2">discovered that i was</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.320" end="01:13:07.040" style="s2">already having trouble seeing when we</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.760" end="01:13:08.640" style="s2">were on vacation and they were going</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.040" end="01:13:10.320" style="s2">look at the beautiful waterfalls across</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.640" end="01:13:12.239" style="s2">the ravine and i was like</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.320" end="01:13:14.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t see them they took me to</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.239" end="01:13:17.199" style="s2">the eye doctor i already had 2200 vision</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.960" end="01:13:19.440" style="s2">and i got contacts very quickly and</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.199" end="01:13:20.480" style="s2">within a few years i had 2800 vision</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.440" end="01:13:22.159" style="s2">where it has basically</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.480" end="01:13:25.120" style="s2">you know within four or five years it</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.159" end="01:13:26.640" style="s2">just like shot down to 2 800.</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.120" end="01:13:28.239" style="s2">well i don&#39;t know that that story goes</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.640" end="01:13:31.600" style="s2">in the opposite direction yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.239" end="01:13:33.280" style="s2">but and then it just it stabilized</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.600" end="01:13:35.280" style="s2">kind of getting slightly slightly</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.280" end="01:13:36.960" style="s2">slightly better now um</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.280" end="01:13:38.960" style="s2">that sort of the the middle age</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.960" end="01:13:40.960" style="s2">presbyopia is also setting in but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.960" end="01:13:43.040" style="s2">um the diopter is basically</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.960" end="01:13:44.239" style="s2">um down at like negative seven negative</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.040" end="01:13:47.280" style="s2">six point five</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.239" end="01:13:50.880" style="s2">and um there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.280" end="01:13:53.120" style="s2">i was already not seeing all that well</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.880" end="01:13:54.719" style="s2">but not saying anything about it because</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.120" end="01:13:57.440" style="s2">it just seemed like what was normal</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.719" end="01:13:59.520" style="s2">right but you had your nose buried in</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.440" end="01:14:01.280" style="s2">books and you were reading music</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.520" end="01:14:02.800" style="s2">hours a day but i was also outside</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.280" end="01:14:05.199" style="s2">playing sports and running around right</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.800" end="01:14:07.520" style="s2">but my point is that may be a job</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.199" end="01:14:09.360" style="s2">that that breadth of activity and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.520" end="01:14:11.120" style="s2">feedbacks in it may be beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.360" end="01:14:12.880" style="s2">capacity of the eyes to figure out how</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.120" end="01:14:14.400" style="s2">to correct and it may have biased in one</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.880" end="01:14:17.600" style="s2">direction and not the other</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.400" end="01:14:19.120" style="s2">who knows but at the very least hey you</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.600" end="01:14:20.960" style="s2">know we need</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.120" end="01:14:22.239" style="s2">evolutionary ophthalmology wouldn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.960" end="01:14:24.480" style="s2">be grand if people were actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.239" end="01:14:26.880" style="s2">studying these questions rationally</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.480" end="01:14:28.000" style="s2">not blaming genes which obviously are</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.880" end="01:14:31.120" style="s2">not going to be the explanation</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.000" end="01:14:33.440" style="s2">here yep um and we stopped screwing up</p>

<p begin="01:15:49.760" end="01:15:53.040" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter okay it&#39;s clear from</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.360" end="01:15:55.040" style="s2">the question yeah i think so too but</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.040" end="01:15:57.440" style="s2">here&#39;s the here&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.040" end="01:15:58.719" style="s2">you&#39;re leaping to the conclusion that</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.440" end="01:16:02.000" style="s2">there are going to be large</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.719" end="01:16:03.120" style="s2">innate differences right personally i</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.000" end="01:16:05.760" style="s2">would argue that is</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.120" end="01:16:06.880" style="s2">unlikely to be true there will be</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.760" end="01:16:10.159" style="s2">differences</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.880" end="01:16:13.840" style="s2">but are they innate immutable</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.159" end="01:16:14.480" style="s2">um etc and so anyway we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.840" end="01:16:17.840" style="s2">know this</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.480" end="01:16:19.520" style="s2">until we actually democratize access</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.840" end="01:16:21.440" style="s2">right democratizing access is the thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.520" end="01:16:24.800" style="s2">that will tell us whether or not those</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.440" end="01:16:25.760" style="s2">differences are durable but at the very</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.800" end="01:16:27.360" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.760" end="01:16:28.880" style="s2">you could build a world and we should</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.360" end="01:16:31.199" style="s2">build a world in which</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.880" end="01:16:33.360" style="s2">access is democratized you do have</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.199" end="01:16:34.239" style="s2">meritocracy which properly incentivizes</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.360" end="01:16:36.880" style="s2">people to</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.239" end="01:16:37.920" style="s2">produce cool stuff that enriches</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.880" end="01:16:40.800" style="s2">humanity</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.920" end="01:16:42.320" style="s2">in which you are protected from bad luck</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.800" end="01:16:43.920" style="s2">that is to say you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.320" end="01:16:45.679" style="s2">going to be you&#39;re not going to fall off</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.920" end="01:16:49.440" style="s2">the bottom of the ladder</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.679" end="01:16:52.000" style="s2">if you tried and failed and the fact is</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.440" end="01:16:53.840" style="s2">in such a context differences in</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.000" end="01:16:55.440" style="s2">well-being are tolerable</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.840" end="01:16:57.239" style="s2">you don&#39;t want extreme differences in</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.440" end="01:17:01.040" style="s2">well-being you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.239" end="01:17:04.239" style="s2">concentration of opportunity but</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.040" end="01:17:07.520" style="s2">the world in which we are all rendered</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.239" end="01:17:08.800" style="s2">equally well off is not a desirable</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.520" end="01:17:10.480" style="s2">world for one thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.800" end="01:17:12.159" style="s2">if you built that world where we were</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.480" end="01:17:14.480" style="s2">all equally well off</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.159" end="01:17:16.400" style="s2">it has a huge defect in it too which is</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.480" end="01:17:17.520" style="s2">that it makes people well off who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.400" end="01:17:20.159" style="s2">do anything</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.520" end="01:17:23.760" style="s2">and therefore is effectively punishing</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.159" end="01:17:25.520" style="s2">those who contribute most so</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.760" end="01:17:27.199" style="s2">what i would say what a conclusion i</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.520" end="01:17:29.679" style="s2">came to in a</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.199" end="01:17:31.360" style="s2">conversation i had last week was that</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.679" end="01:17:34.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference between those of us</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.360" end="01:17:36.480" style="s2">who think equality is the objective</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.800" end="01:17:39.360" style="s2">and those of us who think it&#39;s a means</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.480" end="01:17:41.600" style="s2">to an end and the fact is</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.360" end="01:17:43.040" style="s2">equality of opportunity as means to an</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.600" end="01:17:46.320" style="s2">end is</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.040" end="01:17:48.640" style="s2">the prerequisite for</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.320" end="01:17:52.640" style="s2">the best system that we have come up</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.640" end="01:17:52.640" style="s2">with and probably the best one possible</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.719" end="01:17:58.320" style="s2">equality of outcome is a</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.000" end="01:17:59.840" style="s2">devastating and terrible system and</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.320" end="01:18:02.400" style="s2">there&#39;s really a huge difference between</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.840" end="01:18:02.400" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.159" end="01:18:09.600" style="s2">uh fyi jordan peterson describes the</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.159" end="01:18:12.320" style="s2">maps of meaning logo</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.600" end="01:18:13.040" style="s2">as the meaning of music um yeah i think</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.320" end="01:18:15.600" style="s2">we already</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.040" end="01:18:17.040" style="s2">yeah but yes provided a link to that</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.600" end="01:18:18.880" style="s2">description so it might be that</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.040" end="01:18:20.400" style="s2">the answer to my question is buried in</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.880" end="01:18:22.960" style="s2">that video great</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.400" end="01:18:24.880" style="s2">thank you some weeks ago you could not</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.960" end="01:18:27.920" style="s2">identify freedom is slavery</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.880" end="01:18:28.239" style="s2">in the current movement um that being</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.920" end="01:18:30.080" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.239" end="01:18:33.280" style="s2">that being one of the three hey stop</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.080" end="01:18:36.239" style="s2">sweetie um that being one of the three</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.280" end="01:18:37.040" style="s2">sayings in the beginning of 1984 on the</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.239" end="01:18:40.560" style="s2">great pyramid</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.040" end="01:18:42.640" style="s2">the the ministry of truth i think</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.560" end="01:18:44.239" style="s2">freedom implies responsibility for your</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.640" end="01:18:46.880" style="s2">own life for a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.239" end="01:18:48.960" style="s2">responsibility feels a lot like slavery</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.880" end="01:18:50.719" style="s2">freedom is slavery is therefore hotter</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.960" end="01:18:51.199" style="s2">but shorter that&#39;s interesting i think</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.719" end="01:18:54.159" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.199" end="01:18:55.120" style="s2">yeah quite right yeah good uh keep up</p>

<p begin="01:18:56.800" end="01:19:00.719" style="s2">idea enough with the partisan mods i</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.120" end="01:19:02.640" style="s2">know you support free expression</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.719" end="01:19:04.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t think our mods are partisan i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.640" end="01:19:05.840" style="s2">sure they make decisions that not</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.000" end="01:19:06.480" style="s2">everyone agrees with all the time but uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.840" end="01:19:08.880" style="s2">we know</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.480" end="01:19:10.080" style="s2">who they are and they are awesome so i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:19:20.719" end="01:19:22.960" style="s2">bogosian for mayor if i lived there i</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.640" end="01:19:24.640" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.960" end="01:19:26.719" style="s2">hardest part of that choice is spelling</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.640" end="01:19:30.000" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.719" end="01:19:33.280" style="s2">well you spelled it correctly um</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.000" end="01:19:35.040" style="s2">um no i i love peter</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.280" end="01:19:37.679" style="s2">yeah i think he&#39;d make a much better</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.040" end="01:19:42.640" style="s2">mayor than either of these</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.679" end="01:19:44.239" style="s2">crazy people um that said</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.640" end="01:19:46.320" style="s2">you got to understand what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.239" end="01:19:48.320" style="s2">actually facing in portland and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.320" end="01:19:52.560" style="s2">that we have seen an effort that makes</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.320" end="01:19:54.159" style="s2">peter a viable candidate so i think</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.560" end="01:19:55.760" style="s2">this is that and heather and i have</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.159" end="01:19:58.239" style="s2">talked about this at length that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.760" end="01:20:00.159" style="s2">a very different logic that unfolds</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.239" end="01:20:02.080" style="s2">inside of our local election that</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.159" end="01:20:06.239" style="s2">unfolds in our presidential</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.080" end="01:20:09.280" style="s2">national election um so i would just say</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.239" end="01:20:11.120" style="s2">this is not uh this is not the place for</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.280" end="01:20:15.120" style="s2">a symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.120" end="01:20:17.120" style="s2">challenge to um the two other mayoral</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.120" end="01:20:20.239" style="s2">candidates this is a case where</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.120" end="01:20:23.679" style="s2">uh iran irony</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.239" end="01:20:26.880" style="s2">has to be defeated because iannarone</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.679" end="01:20:28.560" style="s2">has to be defeated because um</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.880" end="01:20:30.800" style="s2">she is going to make a terrible</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.560" end="01:20:33.199" style="s2">situation vastly worse</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.800" end="01:20:34.639" style="s2">so um there&#39;s no duopoly in portland in</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.199" end="01:20:35.920" style="s2">fact that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.639" end="01:20:37.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not part of the problem there just</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.920" end="01:20:38.480" style="s2">aren&#39;t even two parties there&#39;s just no</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.440" end="01:20:40.320" style="s2">republicans</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.480" end="01:20:41.920" style="s2">anywhere close so there&#39;s no tension</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.320" end="01:20:43.920" style="s2">between like democrats and republicans</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.920" end="01:20:46.960" style="s2">here we&#39;ve got wheeler</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.920" end="01:20:48.960" style="s2">who&#39;s uh like the george bridges of</p>

<p begin="01:21:57.840" end="01:22:01.360" style="s2">with the phrase incompetent boob that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:22:01.360" end="01:22:04.880" style="s2">that people make endorsements in that</p>

<p begin="01:22:54.880" end="01:22:57.920" style="s2">caused you to develop an allergy</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.560" end="01:22:59.840" style="s2">what was the allergy you developed and</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.920" end="01:23:02.880" style="s2">if you were able to get rid of it</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.840" end="01:23:06.239" style="s2">by quitting uh haven&#39;t gotten rid of it</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.880" end="01:23:09.199" style="s2">the allergy is just a</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.239" end="01:23:10.880" style="s2">reaction in my lungs and interestingly</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.199" end="01:23:14.400" style="s2">the reaction in my lungs</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.880" end="01:23:16.880" style="s2">happens even if i eat it</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.400" end="01:23:18.480" style="s2">so yeah that&#39;s true isn&#39;t it yeah um</p>

<p begin="01:23:21.199" end="01:23:24.880" style="s2">force</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.080" end="01:23:27.199" style="s2">learned to fight it and now if it shows</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.880" end="01:23:30.320" style="s2">up by any means even through the gut</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.199" end="01:23:33.360" style="s2">um my lungs react and they fill with goo</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.320" end="01:23:37.120" style="s2">yeah um so you know it&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.360" end="01:23:39.280" style="s2">i i yeah i had more than my share sorry</p>

<p begin="01:23:42.639" end="01:23:46.159" style="s2">through the questions that are here now</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.159" end="01:23:47.280" style="s2">even though god it&#39;s late but um</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.159" end="01:23:50.560" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna get through the rest of</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.280" end="01:23:53.040" style="s2">these this hour um</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.560" end="01:23:54.080" style="s2">check out kirk sorensen and gordon</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.040" end="01:23:56.239" style="s2">mcdowell&#39;s and others</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.080" end="01:23:57.360" style="s2">efforts to advance thorium within the</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.239" end="01:23:59.920" style="s2">nuclear industry</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.360" end="01:24:01.440" style="s2">it looks to be safe here so looks to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.920" end="01:24:03.199" style="s2">safer and more abundant but a barrier</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.440" end="01:24:03.760" style="s2">seems to be an entrenched uranium fuel</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.199" end="01:24:05.840" style="s2">industry</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.760" end="01:24:07.040" style="s2">yep no doubt so you know something about</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.840" end="01:24:09.040" style="s2">this oh i sure do</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.040" end="01:24:10.639" style="s2">i sure do and i remain to be convinced</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.040" end="01:24:13.040" style="s2">that thorium is safe enough</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.639" end="01:24:14.400" style="s2">but yes if you were going to be serious</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.040" end="01:24:16.560" style="s2">about fission power</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.400" end="01:24:18.400" style="s2">this would be one of the mechanisms you</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.560" end="01:24:19.280" style="s2">would want to be looking very carefully</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.400" end="01:24:22.719" style="s2">at it is</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.280" end="01:24:24.880" style="s2">clearly safer and better and you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.719" end="01:24:25.840" style="s2">of course the uranium fission industry</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.880" end="01:24:29.280" style="s2">is not interested</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.840" end="01:24:30.000" style="s2">right one do you see a parallel between</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.280" end="01:24:32.000" style="s2">neurodiversity</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.000" end="01:24:33.679" style="s2">movement and the crt movement in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.000" end="01:24:35.199" style="s2">sense that both regard the world is a</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.679" end="01:24:36.719" style="s2">construct founded on exploitation of</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.199" end="01:24:38.719" style="s2">diverse groups</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.719" end="01:24:39.920" style="s2">two do you support shock-based treatment</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.719" end="01:24:41.520" style="s2">of autism</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.920" end="01:24:43.440" style="s2">wow i&#39;ve never heard of shock-based</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.520" end="01:24:46.239" style="s2">treatment of autism i</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.440" end="01:24:47.440" style="s2">doubt it but i would have to hear more i</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.239" end="01:24:50.080" style="s2">don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.440" end="01:24:50.480" style="s2">um have you heard about this no okay but</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.080" end="01:24:52.800" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.480" end="01:24:54.800" style="s2">the second one&#39;s easy yeah right i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.800" end="01:24:58.159" style="s2">know exactly how you</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.800" end="01:25:01.840" style="s2">run the experiments but the answer is uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.159" end="01:25:02.880" style="s2">if it helps and helps has to be defined</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.840" end="01:25:05.120" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.880" end="01:25:06.320" style="s2">um you know in some integrative way</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.120" end="01:25:09.920" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.320" end="01:25:11.440" style="s2">more capable i don&#39;t know happier</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.920" end="01:25:12.960" style="s2">more fulfilled i just don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.440" end="01:25:13.280" style="s2">have a good enough model of autism i</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.960" end="01:25:14.800" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.280" end="01:25:16.400" style="s2">oh i don&#39;t think we do if if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.800" end="01:25:20.080" style="s2">talking about people who are</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.400" end="01:25:24.080" style="s2">you know deeply</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.080" end="01:25:26.560" style="s2">unable to function in the world um</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.080" end="01:25:28.159" style="s2">for whom something like that might help</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.560" end="01:25:29.600" style="s2">then then maybe but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.159" end="01:25:31.679" style="s2">there&#39;s so many high-functioning</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.600" end="01:25:33.920" style="s2">autistic people for whom right um</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.679" end="01:25:35.920" style="s2">i mean certainly wouldn&#39;t this wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.920" end="01:25:39.440" style="s2">be about requiring it of</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.920" end="01:25:41.360" style="s2">yeah i just but</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.440" end="01:25:42.560" style="s2">okay on the first one uh do you see a</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.360" end="01:25:44.080" style="s2">parallel between the neurodiversity</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.560" end="01:25:44.800" style="s2">movement and critical race theory</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.080" end="01:25:47.600" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.800" end="01:25:49.199" style="s2">um in the sense that both both regard</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.600" end="01:25:51.040" style="s2">the world&#39;s a construct founded on</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.199" end="01:25:52.000" style="s2">exploitation of diverse groups</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.040" end="01:25:53.840" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s not how i see the</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.000" end="01:25:54.960" style="s2">neurodiversity movement at all the</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.840" end="01:25:57.760" style="s2">problem with this one</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.960" end="01:25:59.840" style="s2">yeah i would say not at all on the other</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.760" end="01:26:03.360" style="s2">hand i think we&#39;ve been down this road</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.840" end="01:26:06.480" style="s2">with the term anti-racist where</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.360" end="01:26:07.760" style="s2">as viewers of the podcast will remember</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.480" end="01:26:09.440" style="s2">first time i heard the term it was</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.760" end="01:26:11.120" style="s2">applied to me and i thought that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.440" end="01:26:11.760" style="s2">i felt honored to be included in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.120" end="01:26:14.159" style="s2">category</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.760" end="01:26:15.600" style="s2">anti-racist and i found out it&#39;s narrow</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.159" end="01:26:17.520" style="s2">definition and it&#39;s like no i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.600" end="01:26:20.960" style="s2">to touch that with a barge pole</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.520" end="01:26:23.840" style="s2">but um so the point here</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.960" end="01:26:25.600" style="s2">is you know neurodiversity as i think</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.840" end="01:26:26.000" style="s2">people in our circle who talk about it</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.600" end="01:26:28.480" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.000" end="01:26:29.360" style="s2">is just the you know frankly there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.480" end="01:26:30.960" style="s2">lot of</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.360" end="01:26:33.520" style="s2">value that has been brought to the world</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.960" end="01:26:35.520" style="s2">by people who have things that would be</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.520" end="01:26:36.800" style="s2">considered deficits by many including</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.520" end="01:26:38.960" style="s2">high functioning autism</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.800" end="01:26:40.239" style="s2">high functioning autism you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.960" end="01:26:42.320" style="s2">dyslexics</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.239" end="01:26:43.920" style="s2">whatever it is and so in fact i did i</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.320" end="01:26:46.560" style="s2">did a big think video about this</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.920" end="01:26:48.239" style="s2">years ago yeah yeah so to the extent</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.560" end="01:26:49.440" style="s2">that neurodiversity is simply the</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.239" end="01:26:52.400" style="s2">recognition</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.440" end="01:26:54.560" style="s2">that even stuff where we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.400" end="01:26:56.719" style="s2">talking about some kind of damage</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.560" end="01:26:58.639" style="s2">that results in you having a different</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.719" end="01:26:59.440" style="s2">view of the world can be very positive</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.639" end="01:27:01.840" style="s2">and you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.440" end="01:27:02.800" style="s2">the term i use for myself and many</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.840" end="01:27:06.080" style="s2">students</p>

<p begin="01:27:14.000" end="01:27:19.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a very intuitive reason to</p>

<p begin="01:27:19.920" end="01:27:23.040" style="s2">look to stamp it out on the other hand</p>

<p begin="01:27:35.840" end="01:27:41.679" style="s2">about race so has neurodiversity become</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.600" end="01:27:43.199" style="s2">some sort of a toxic claim or is it</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.679" end="01:27:44.880" style="s2">headed that direction and then we should</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.199" end="01:27:46.159" style="s2">be wary of it if so we&#39;re not aware of</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.880" end="01:27:48.080" style="s2">it yet</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.159" end="01:27:49.280" style="s2">so i don&#39;t see the parallel but it could</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.080" end="01:27:52.000" style="s2">emerge</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.280" end="01:27:53.600" style="s2">yeah can we push back against this</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.000" end="01:27:55.440" style="s2">memory hole in some way</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.600" end="01:27:57.199" style="s2">i.e setting up a repository and</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.440" end="01:27:58.719" style="s2">decentralized server with censored</p>

<p begin="01:27:58.719" end="01:28:01.840" style="s2">i feel like there are some movements</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.320" end="01:28:03.600" style="s2">like that um</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.840" end="01:28:05.040" style="s2">happening in fact one is called the</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.600" end="01:28:06.239" style="s2">memory hole now</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.040" end="01:28:08.080" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a site called the memory</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.239" end="01:28:10.320" style="s2">hole okay um</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.080" end="01:28:11.280" style="s2">but yes we have to push back and also i</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.320" end="01:28:13.679" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.280" end="01:28:15.679" style="s2">that to the extent that something that</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.679" end="01:28:18.159" style="s2">does not have your interests at heart</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.679" end="01:28:18.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want you discussing something</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.159" end="01:28:22.000" style="s2">you have</p>

<p begin="01:28:22.000" end="01:28:25.199" style="s2">obligation to think carefully about it</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.000" end="01:28:26.239" style="s2">right whatever it is that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.199" end="01:28:27.440" style="s2">want us talking about we should be</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.239" end="01:28:29.199" style="s2">talking about so</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.440" end="01:28:30.880" style="s2">if you&#39;re not talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.199" end="01:28:34.000" style="s2">implications of</p>

<p begin="01:28:34.800" end="01:28:39.360" style="s2">his vp father you should be thinking</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.840" end="01:28:40.840" style="s2">about it whether you&#39;re voting for biden</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.360" end="01:28:43.280" style="s2">or not you should be thinking about the</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.840" end="01:28:46.159" style="s2">implications that a biden win</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.280" end="01:28:47.600" style="s2">is an influence peddler taking office</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.159" end="01:28:48.880" style="s2">and you should also be thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.600" end="01:28:50.239" style="s2">the fact that some of us were telling</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.880" end="01:28:53.199" style="s2">you that from the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.239" end="01:28:56.239" style="s2">yep so next question from the author of</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.199" end="01:28:59.120" style="s2">this cyclical evolution hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.239" end="01:29:00.880" style="s2">he i think clarifies the cyclical the</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.120" end="01:29:02.320" style="s2">cyclical evolutionary hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.880" end="01:29:04.960" style="s2">presents a self-driven</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.320" end="01:29:05.760" style="s2">population-wide multi-generational</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.960" end="01:29:08.000" style="s2">oscillating</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.760" end="01:29:09.679" style="s2">hormone cycle so it&#39;s an intrinsic</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.000" end="01:29:12.719" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.679" end="01:29:15.199" style="s2">okay it does sound like um</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.719" end="01:29:16.480" style="s2">integral theory in in some ways yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.199" end="01:29:18.639" style="s2">it does you know the idea that there</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.480" end="01:29:20.960" style="s2">might be some cyclical pattern</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.639" end="01:29:20.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.000" end="01:29:25.440" style="s2">might well be i still i still want to</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.480" end="01:29:27.840" style="s2">understand it</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.440" end="01:29:29.440" style="s2">can&#39;t be hormone driven yeah right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.840" end="01:29:30.400" style="s2">got to be hormones have to be driven by</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.440" end="01:29:33.840" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.400" end="01:29:37.600" style="s2">exactly um but hi</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.840" end="01:29:38.000" style="s2">there is a risk is there a risk that the</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.600" end="01:29:39.679" style="s2">increase</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.000" end="01:29:41.440" style="s2">of environmentalism in the west is going</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.679" end="01:29:43.360" style="s2">to create a new form of colonialism</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.440" end="01:29:44.719" style="s2">wherein rich nations intervene in other</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.360" end="01:29:46.159" style="s2">countries with the idea to protect</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.719" end="01:29:49.360" style="s2">gaia&#39;s resources</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.159" end="01:29:52.719" style="s2">it&#39;s already happening um hi</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.360" end="01:29:53.760" style="s2">yes we&#39;ve been on way too long</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.719" end="01:29:57.600" style="s2">apparently</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.760" end="01:29:58.800" style="s2">um yeah it&#39;s it absolutely is already</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.600" end="01:30:02.639" style="s2">happening you know the</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.800" end="01:30:03.840" style="s2">the the us got to basically cut down a</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.639" end="01:30:05.920" style="s2">lot of our forests</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.840" end="01:30:07.600" style="s2">and is now making a point of telling</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.920" end="01:30:08.080" style="s2">other people not to and i&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.600" end="01:30:12.000" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.080" end="01:30:15.679" style="s2">um what is it institut</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.000" end="01:30:18.800" style="s2">biodiversidad yeah in costa rica</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.679" end="01:30:20.000" style="s2">um which i think actually was is pretty</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.800" end="01:30:21.760" style="s2">honorable and i hope still</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.000" end="01:30:23.120" style="s2">exists but back when we were in graduate</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.760" end="01:30:24.719" style="s2">school we spent um</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.120" end="01:30:26.800" style="s2">a couple of seasons and a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.719" end="01:30:29.760" style="s2">field seasons in costa rica</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.800" end="01:30:30.560" style="s2">and uh were given a tour by our</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.760" end="01:30:34.560" style="s2">professor</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.560" end="01:30:36.080" style="s2">of inbio which was training uh which was</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.560" end="01:30:37.120" style="s2">run by costa rican scientists if i</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.080" end="01:30:38.960" style="s2">remember correctly so just</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.120" end="01:30:40.560" style="s2">jump in if i get something wrong and</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.960" end="01:30:44.400" style="s2">they were training um</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.560" end="01:30:46.239" style="s2">poor uh poor costa ricans porticos uh as</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.400" end="01:30:49.280" style="s2">what they were calling parataxonists</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.239" end="01:30:52.400" style="s2">to basically do collect an id um</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.280" end="01:30:53.600" style="s2">and then um and then but they were</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.400" end="01:30:55.600" style="s2">working with</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.600" end="01:30:57.440" style="s2">big pharma right so they were i think</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.600" end="01:30:59.360" style="s2">funded in part by</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.440" end="01:31:01.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t remember who it was pfizer mark</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.360" end="01:31:05.600" style="s2">or something probably mark</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.760" end="01:31:07.679" style="s2">and uh merck wasn&#39;t able to just come in</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.600" end="01:31:09.360" style="s2">like they had been before the</p>

<p begin="01:31:09.360" end="01:31:12.400" style="s2">and um you know and find lots of</p>

<p begin="01:31:12.400" end="01:31:16.239" style="s2">and take them back to the us or germany</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.320" end="01:31:18.000" style="s2">or whatever and um</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.239" end="01:31:20.080" style="s2">and create new compounds and you know do</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.000" end="01:31:21.840" style="s2">the r d and make make billions on some</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.080" end="01:31:23.040" style="s2">drug they now had to actually involve</p>

<p begin="01:31:23.040" end="01:31:30.080" style="s2">and its resources in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.400" end="01:31:31.840" style="s2">in the process somewhat but it was it</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.080" end="01:31:33.679" style="s2">was more honorable than it had been but</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.840" end="01:31:34.320" style="s2">it still had the risk of being predatory</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.679" end="01:31:36.639" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.320" end="01:31:38.480" style="s2">okay but you&#39;ve got a corrupt version of</p>
