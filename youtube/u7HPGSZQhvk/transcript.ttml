<p begin="00:00:00.210" end="00:00:06.000" style="s2">one of the other big ones that I came up</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.899" end="00:00:07.799" style="s2">with in the very beginning that I love</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.000" end="00:00:10.200" style="s2">the idea of and haven&#39;t talked about yet</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.799" end="00:00:11.820" style="s2">is a history website and how I</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.200" end="00:00:14.929" style="s2">envisioned that is very much like a</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.820" end="00:00:17.279" style="s2">Google map but besides just being</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.929" end="00:00:19.890" style="s2">zoomable in space</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.279" end="00:00:24.330" style="s2">it is also zoomable in time so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.890" end="00:00:27.330" style="s2">able to go from evolutionary time to</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.330" end="00:00:31.230" style="s2">current historical time and zoom in and</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.330" end="00:00:32.940" style="s2">out of places so I could see the whole</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.230" end="00:00:34.620" style="s2">African continent and how the borders</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.940" end="00:00:35.670" style="s2">have changed how the tribes used to it</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.620" end="00:00:38.660" style="s2">used to be there and where their</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:43.379" style="s2">territories were get the information for</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.660" end="00:00:45.000" style="s2">what tribes for doing what and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.379" end="00:00:48.329" style="s2">happened in North America before</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.000" end="00:00:50.010" style="s2">settlers came here I just having access</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.329" end="00:00:53.780" style="s2">to all that information but in a way</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.010" end="00:00:55.620" style="s2">that&#39;s very visual and very I mean I see</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.780" end="00:00:58.590" style="s2">different museums from all over the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.620" end="00:01:00.300" style="s2">world being able to post pictures of</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.590" end="00:01:02.460" style="s2">their artifacts and their stuff and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.300" end="00:01:03.899" style="s2">you can go and see it in person or you</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.460" end="00:01:05.670" style="s2">could have this like and what does that</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.899" end="00:01:06.840" style="s2">mean and how do how do we know that</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.670" end="00:01:09.210" style="s2">that&#39;s true how do we know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.840" end="00:01:10.650" style="s2">dated at that date how do we like this</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.210" end="00:01:11.760" style="s2">tool how do we know that was used for</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.650" end="00:01:13.830" style="s2">that and sometimes we don&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.760" end="00:01:15.930" style="s2">complete speculation but that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.830" end="00:01:17.400" style="s2">history is and the more were able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.930" end="00:01:18.659" style="s2">discuss it and see it and it can be</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.400" end="00:01:21.049" style="s2">different sides its history is</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.659" end="00:01:25.470" style="s2">definitely not a black and white even</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.049" end="00:01:27.000" style="s2">science that&#39;s very scientific is it</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.470" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">black and white you can have different</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.000" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">studies showing contradicting happens</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:33.630" style="s2">all the time contradicting outcomes and</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.200" end="00:01:34.950" style="s2">so history can be the same or like one</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.630" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">side says this is what happens well</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.950" end="00:01:37.560" style="s2">where&#39;s the evidence the other side says</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:39.619" style="s2">this is what happens okay well where is</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.560" end="00:01:43.649" style="s2">the evidence and both can be present and</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.619" end="00:01:46.670" style="s2">being able to follow nouns through</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.649" end="00:01:49.590" style="s2">histories so like people places things</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.670" end="00:01:50.460" style="s2">so being able to see okay when Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.590" end="00:01:51.930" style="s2">was coming up with the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.460" end="00:01:55.680" style="s2">relativity what else was going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.930" end="00:01:57.420" style="s2">world and well Darwin was having his</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.680" end="00:01:58.469" style="s2">journey what was Wallace doing who if</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.420" end="00:02:02.430" style="s2">you don&#39;t know is the other person who</p>

<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">will be there too but it&#39;s a piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.450" end="00:02:20.130" style="s2">it&#39;s not all of it and it&#39;s a piece that</p>
