<p begin="00:00:00.140" end="00:00:05.910" style="s2">what I want to talk about today is what</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.000" end="00:00:08.519" style="s2">emergence is as a phenomena as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.910" end="00:00:10.139" style="s2">property that&#39;s actually essential to</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.519" end="00:00:10.469" style="s2">understand the nature of the universe we</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.139" end="00:00:12.269" style="s2">live in</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.469" end="00:00:14.030" style="s2">and it&#39;s actually essential to</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.269" end="00:00:16.980" style="s2">understand what it means to be human and</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.030" end="00:00:19.529" style="s2">that is essential for understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.980" end="00:00:22.170" style="s2">basis for meaning for ethics for</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.529" end="00:00:23.039" style="s2">existentialism and then also what that</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.170" end="00:00:25.760" style="s2">portends</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.039" end="00:00:27.539" style="s2">for the future of civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.760" end="00:00:29.910" style="s2">addressing some of the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.539" end="00:00:32.730" style="s2">concerning and that are exciting okay so</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.910" end="00:00:34.079" style="s2">you can consider the next 20 minutes or</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.730" end="00:00:37.920" style="s2">however long this is as kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.079" end="00:00:40.920" style="s2">extemporaneous rambling ode to emergence</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.920" end="00:00:42.899" style="s2">itself right a kind of love talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.920" end="00:00:44.879" style="s2">how cool it is that universe actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.899" end="00:00:47.960" style="s2">has this property and that we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.879" end="00:00:51.090" style="s2">understand and participate within so</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.960" end="00:00:53.610" style="s2">let&#39;s start by defining what is</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.090" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">emergence emergence means something new</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.610" end="00:00:56.610" style="s2">arises that wasn&#39;t here before</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:00:59.039" style="s2">all right we all kind of have that sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.610" end="00:01:01.320" style="s2">intuitively but scientifically how the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.039" end="00:01:03.840" style="s2"> does that happen how do you bring</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.320" end="00:01:05.820" style="s2">particles or planets or anything</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:07.439" style="s2">together and all of a sudden the hole</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.820" end="00:01:09.260" style="s2">has some properties that none of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.439" end="00:01:13.770" style="s2">parts had like where do they come from</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.260" end="00:01:15.930" style="s2">which is why in in the fields of science</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.770" end="00:01:17.790" style="s2">that steady emergence which evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.930" end="00:01:19.439" style="s2">theory and biology and system science</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.790" end="00:01:21.780" style="s2">and complexity theory study it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.439" end="00:01:23.820" style="s2">considered the closest thing to magic</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.780" end="00:01:26.159" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a scientifically kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.820" end="00:01:27.540" style="s2">admissible term but it&#39;s still sketchy</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.159" end="00:01:29.960" style="s2">right in terms of the really</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.540" end="00:01:33.000" style="s2">understanding how this thing works and</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.960" end="00:01:36.180" style="s2">because how do we get fundamentally new</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.000" end="00:01:38.400" style="s2">things out of relationships of things</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.180" end="00:01:40.770" style="s2">where that didn&#39;t exist before this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.400" end="00:01:44.939" style="s2">this fascinating how do you have a cell</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.770" end="00:01:50.670" style="s2">that respirate s-- made up of molecules</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.939" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">none of whom respirate and so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.670" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">really interesting when you actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.840" end="00:01:56.070" style="s2">think about this right we we have a coin</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:01:58.140" style="s2">a paired term does anyone know what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.070" end="00:02:02.189" style="s2">term is that is key and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.140" end="00:02:04.290" style="s2">synergy in emergence is synergy synergy</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.189" end="00:02:06.360" style="s2">and emergence are two sides of the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.290" end="00:02:07.320" style="s2">phenomena synergy means whole that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.360" end="00:02:09.810" style="s2">greater than the sum of its parts</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.320" end="00:02:11.370" style="s2">emergence is what is that greater it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.810" end="00:02:13.200" style="s2">what is the new stuff that emerges out</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.370" end="00:02:15.000" style="s2">of bringing things together</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:18.660" style="s2">and so synergies more formally defined</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.000" end="00:02:20.160" style="s2">as properties of whole systems that</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.660" end="00:02:21.900" style="s2">aren&#39;t found in any of the parts taken</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.160" end="00:02:24.090" style="s2">separately which also means that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.900" end="00:02:26.459" style="s2">fundamentally unpredicted by the parts</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.090" end="00:02:28.250" style="s2">taken separately which portends a future</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.459" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">that is fundamentally ontologically</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.250" end="00:02:32.370" style="s2">unpredictable from the current state of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:34.500" style="s2">the future which is very different than</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.370" end="00:02:36.540" style="s2">a mechanistic clock unfolding Newtonian</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.500" end="00:02:38.220" style="s2">understanding of the future and yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.540" end="00:02:39.870" style="s2">still actually makes sense in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.220" end="00:02:42.049" style="s2">scientific laws super interesting right</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.870" end="00:02:44.519" style="s2">so synergy is this property of</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.049" end="00:02:47.870" style="s2">relationship where the whole has new</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.519" end="00:02:50.970" style="s2">properties that the parts didn&#39;t have so</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.870" end="00:02:53.640" style="s2">emergence is a result of synergy synergy</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.970" end="00:02:57.209" style="s2">as a result of relationship that makes</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.640" end="00:03:00.630" style="s2">sense and relationship is a result of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.209" end="00:03:01.739" style="s2">attractive forces there are some kinds</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.630" end="00:03:03.299" style="s2">of attractive forces whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.739" end="00:03:04.680" style="s2">gravity bringing dust together into</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.299" end="00:03:06.840" style="s2">planets or planets the other into solar</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.680" end="00:03:08.730" style="s2">systems whether it&#39;s electromagnetism</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.840" end="00:03:10.620" style="s2">bringing subatomic particles together</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.730" end="00:03:13.260" style="s2">into atoms or the strong force bringing</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.620" end="00:03:15.299" style="s2">quarks together into protons each of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.260" end="00:03:17.430" style="s2">those are emergent properties driven by</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.299" end="00:03:18.900" style="s2">synergy driven by relationship driven by</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.430" end="00:03:21.870" style="s2">attraction or whether it&#39;s bringing</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.900" end="00:03:24.450" style="s2">these people together via pheromones or</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.870" end="00:03:25.620" style="s2">love or intellectual affinity or a topic</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.450" end="00:03:26.549" style="s2">that we&#39;re all interested in like</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.620" end="00:03:29.130" style="s2">creating a better world</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.549" end="00:03:32.489" style="s2">there&#39;s some attractive forces and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.130" end="00:03:34.709" style="s2">Bucky fuller called love metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.489" end="00:03:36.900" style="s2">gravity in the same way that gravity and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.709" end="00:03:38.910" style="s2">physical forces act on physical bodies</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.900" end="00:03:40.889" style="s2">to attract them we have medical physical</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.910" end="00:03:44.340" style="s2">forces that act on metaphysical bodies</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.889" end="00:03:45.840" style="s2">to drive attraction but think about so</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.340" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">imagine if you think about all of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.840" end="00:03:50.340" style="s2">attractive forces as expressions of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:52.650" style="s2">fundamental principle of universe of</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.340" end="00:03:55.049" style="s2">allurement that there is a principle by</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.650" end="00:03:57.389" style="s2">which separate things have reason to</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.049" end="00:03:59.910" style="s2">come together that offers advantage that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.389" end="00:04:01.530" style="s2">being separate doesn&#39;t have and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.910" end="00:04:04.049" style="s2">think about all of the forces as special</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.530" end="00:04:06.150" style="s2">case applications of that imagine if</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.049" end="00:04:07.829" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t the case imagine if we had a</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.150" end="00:04:10.079" style="s2">universe where allurement wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.829" end="00:04:11.069" style="s2">fundamental principle of it and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.079" end="00:04:14.700" style="s2">whole thing would have stopped at</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.069" end="00:04:16.410" style="s2">quantum foam right you have quantum foam</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.700" end="00:04:17.639" style="s2">emerge you don&#39;t even quite get to the</p>

<p begin="00:04:17.639" end="00:04:22.310" style="s2">it because nothing attracts two then</p>

<p begin="00:04:27.060" end="00:04:30.360" style="s2">story why at the heart of the</p>

<p begin="00:04:30.360" end="00:04:34.620" style="s2">which is that it&#39;s actually a traction</p>

<p begin="00:04:45.030" end="00:04:50.280" style="s2">the arrow of evolution itself in terms</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.580" end="00:04:54.410" style="s2">of this set of phenomena together does</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.280" end="00:04:56.760" style="s2">that make sense so then evolution in</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.410" end="00:04:59.669" style="s2">complexity theory is defined most</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.760" end="00:05:01.410" style="s2">generally in terms of more elegantly</p>

<p begin="00:05:05.310" end="00:05:09.150" style="s2">out of Santa Fe Institute the definition</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.800" end="00:05:10.650" style="s2">has the word elegance built right in it</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.150" end="00:05:12.930" style="s2">because it&#39;s again one of these actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.650" end="00:05:15.210" style="s2">fairly mysterious properties but it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:05:21.540" end="00:05:25.680" style="s2">so think about think about all the parts</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.729" end="00:05:29.360" style="s2">that make up a cell right you&#39;ve got all</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.680" end="00:05:32.610" style="s2">these nonliving parts DNA and cell</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.360" end="00:05:34.380" style="s2">nucleus structures and all the different</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.610" end="00:05:37.620" style="s2">organelles and cytoplasm and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.380" end="00:05:39.300" style="s2">not living and then the cell is living</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.620" end="00:05:40.800" style="s2">but if you brought all those parts</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.300" end="00:05:42.360" style="s2">together but you didn&#39;t arrange them as</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.800" end="00:05:43.770" style="s2">a cell it was just a bunch of molecules</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.360" end="00:05:46.320" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t be that interesting right</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.770" end="00:05:47.940" style="s2">just be Goo if you took the 50 trillion</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.320" end="00:05:49.410" style="s2">cells that made you and you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.940" end="00:05:52.890" style="s2">arrange them exactly this way and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.410" end="00:05:54.600" style="s2">just had like 150 pounds worth of cells</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.890" end="00:05:55.470" style="s2">it would be much less interesting even</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.600" end="00:05:57.419" style="s2">though there&#39;d be just as much</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.470" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">complexity you wouldn&#39;t have an order in</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.419" end="00:06:00.210" style="s2">the complexity where the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:03.180" style="s2">property comes that&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.210" end="00:06:04.560" style="s2">relationship it&#39;s not just heaps coming</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.180" end="00:06:06.150" style="s2">together it&#39;s not just complexity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.560" end="00:06:08.580" style="s2">wholes and the difference between a hole</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.150" end="00:06:10.590" style="s2">and a heap is order and a specific set</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.580" end="00:06:15.030" style="s2">of patterns of order this means not</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.590" end="00:06:18.060" style="s2">every relationship is synergistic some</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.030" end="00:06:20.430" style="s2">relationships are entropic they actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.060" end="00:06:21.900" style="s2">create the opposite direction of new</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.430" end="00:06:24.440" style="s2">emergent properties they destroy some</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.900" end="00:06:29.150" style="s2">properties that were already there right</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.440" end="00:06:29.150" style="s2">almost everyone has some examples</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.889" end="00:06:34.999" style="s2">but you bring chemicals together that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.270" end="00:06:37.370" style="s2">rather than self-organizing to create</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.999" end="00:06:39.020" style="s2">higher ordered molecules with new</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.370" end="00:06:40.819" style="s2">thermodynamic properties they have an</p>

<p begin="00:06:42.439" end="00:06:47.659" style="s2">right this is true at all levels so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.889" end="00:06:49.460" style="s2">not just relationship it&#39;s specific</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.659" end="00:06:51.830" style="s2">kinds of relationship that maximize</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.460" end="00:06:53.529" style="s2">synergy this is a key thing to</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.830" end="00:06:55.849" style="s2">understand about the nature of universe</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.529" end="00:06:57.889" style="s2">it&#39;s also the case that if you bring the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.849" end="00:06:59.240" style="s2">same thing together a bunch of the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.889" end="00:07:01.189" style="s2">thing you don&#39;t get very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.240" end="00:07:02.120" style="s2">synergies you get very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.189" end="00:07:03.349" style="s2">synergies when you bring different</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.120" end="00:07:05.689" style="s2">things with different properties</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.349" end="00:07:07.159" style="s2">together in the right format where then</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.689" end="00:07:08.509" style="s2">you have the properties of each of those</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.159" end="00:07:10.039" style="s2">things and then the properties of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.509" end="00:07:11.960" style="s2">relationship between those which is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.039" end="00:07:14.930" style="s2">new stuff and you get emergent so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.960" end="00:07:16.009" style="s2">got hydrogen and you&#39;ve got oxygen which</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.930" end="00:07:17.330" style="s2">are different things and you bring them</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.009" end="00:07:19.460" style="s2">together and you get water in the basis</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.330" end="00:07:22.779" style="s2">for life but neither hydrogen or oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.460" end="00:07:25.460" style="s2">at room temperature or liquids right and</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.779" end="00:07:27.979" style="s2">so this is a fascinating thing so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.460" end="00:07:29.960" style="s2">actually very interested in having deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.979" end="00:07:33.919" style="s2">synergistic relationships with</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.960" end="00:07:37.339" style="s2">differences that lead to fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.919" end="00:07:39.770" style="s2">new emerging properties so it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.339" end="00:07:41.389" style="s2">net complexity it&#39;s ordered complexity</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.770" end="00:07:42.830" style="s2">and it&#39;s elegantly ordered complexity</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.389" end="00:07:45.020" style="s2">and then when you get a new property</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.830" end="00:07:46.479" style="s2">then universe selects for that right</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.020" end="00:07:48.919" style="s2">that new property offers some</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.479" end="00:07:50.689" style="s2">evolutionary advantage to that system</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.919" end="00:07:52.729" style="s2">that a system that didn&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.689" end="00:07:54.169" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have so things can come</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.729" end="00:07:55.669" style="s2">together all kinds of ways but the ones</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.169" end="00:07:57.830" style="s2">that come together most synergistically</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.669" end="00:07:59.389" style="s2">offer and confer the most advantage in</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.830" end="00:08:02.809" style="s2">Universal exports so universe is</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.389" end="00:08:04.969" style="s2">actually selecting for more differences</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.809" end="00:08:08.029" style="s2">right so it&#39;s selecting for diversity</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.969" end="00:08:10.219" style="s2">and then more synergistic combinations</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.029" end="00:08:12.740" style="s2">across those differences that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.219" end="00:08:14.749" style="s2">both of those more diversity and more</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.740" end="00:08:17.449" style="s2">unification across the diversity right</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.749" end="00:08:20.059" style="s2">more agency and more symbiosis at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.449" end="00:08:24.580" style="s2">same time is what defines the arrow of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.059" end="00:08:24.580" style="s2">evolution does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.590" end="00:08:32.500" style="s2">things that are separate autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.810" end="00:08:34.570" style="s2">agents right so like a cell you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.500" end="00:08:36.459" style="s2">think of as having its own agency right</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.570" end="00:08:38.469" style="s2">its own ability to act and its own</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.459" end="00:08:40.599" style="s2">boundary and periphery but you bring a</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.469" end="00:08:42.550" style="s2">bunch of cells together and this</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.599" end="00:08:44.740" style="s2">collection of cells can reflect on</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.550" end="00:08:46.540" style="s2">consciousness and existentialism and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.740" end="00:08:48.010" style="s2">have a conversation like this even</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.540" end="00:08:51.550" style="s2">though none of those cells on their own</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.010" end="00:08:53.050" style="s2">do that right and it&#39;s different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.550" end="00:08:55.570" style="s2">of cells you couldn&#39;t do that with just</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.050" end="00:08:57.940" style="s2">neurons it takes neurons and glial cells</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.570" end="00:09:00.850" style="s2">and immune cells and stem cells etc to</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.940" end="00:09:02.890" style="s2">all come together so more agency more</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.850" end="00:09:04.899" style="s2">differentiation more orderly</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.890" end="00:09:06.700" style="s2">relationship more synergy all of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.899" end="00:09:09.579" style="s2">comes together and the net defining</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.700" end="00:09:12.190" style="s2">thing is emergence how much fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.579" end="00:09:15.370" style="s2">new advantage arises and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.190" end="00:09:16.810" style="s2">evolution selects for and so if it</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.370" end="00:09:18.550" style="s2">wasn&#39;t for this whole combination of</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.810" end="00:09:24.519" style="s2">things together is this the message that</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.550" end="00:09:28.540" style="s2">says five minutes left fascinating so so</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.519" end="00:09:30.070" style="s2">I I&#39;ll see if we can go very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.540" end="00:09:34.420" style="s2">through that was the first 1% of what I</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.070" end="00:09:36.220" style="s2">hoped to discuss so I&#39;m going to just</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.420" end="00:09:39.880" style="s2">skim over the top of a bunch of topics</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.220" end="00:09:44.820" style="s2">and hopefully paint a distorted least of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.880" end="00:09:47.380" style="s2">an arc that&#39;s interesting so the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.820" end="00:09:48.910" style="s2">evolutionary universe story the kind of</p>

<p begin="00:09:50.560" end="00:09:53.470" style="s2">the sciences is that we have an</p>

<p begin="00:10:31.899" end="00:10:36.100" style="s2">cognition to abstraction so we have a</p>

<p begin="00:10:48.370" end="00:10:53.470" style="s2">is with our capacity for abstraction we</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.399" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">cannot just think about our experiential</p>

<p begin="00:11:01.720" end="00:11:05.140" style="s2">allows us to actually understand</p>

<p begin="00:11:13.839" end="00:11:17.800" style="s2">us a deeper insight as to how we got</p>

<p begin="00:12:00.640" end="00:12:03.880" style="s2">we should not think about the future at</p>

<p begin="00:12:21.699" end="00:12:27.040" style="s2">well then we say how can we learn from</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.920" end="00:12:29.589" style="s2">the past how universe works to be able</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.040" end="00:12:32.680" style="s2">to imagine a future in an omni</p>

<p begin="00:12:48.970" end="00:12:51.730" style="s2">in our ability to think about the whole</p>

<p begin="00:13:04.330" end="00:13:07.390" style="s2">better but we actually have the</p>

<p begin="00:13:07.390" end="00:13:12.390" style="s2">story is and identifying as well the</p>

<p begin="00:13:12.390" end="00:13:19.240" style="s2">brought me about and then woke up to</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.400" end="00:13:21.610" style="s2">itself in me and so in a meaningful way</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.240" end="00:13:23.470" style="s2">I am actually the evolutionary impulsive</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.610" end="00:13:25.060" style="s2">universal woke to itself in a form that</p>

<p begin="00:13:25.060" end="00:13:28.390" style="s2">contemplate that and then get to</p>

<p begin="00:13:28.390" end="00:13:37.330" style="s2">with it to be in a not just not just a</p>

<p begin="00:13:38.740" end="00:13:43.600" style="s2">and cosmos and so we move from evolution</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.529" end="00:13:46.420" style="s2">as a mostly unconscious algorithmic</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.960" end="00:14:04.000" style="s2">make sense so when we don&#39;t identify as</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.230" end="00:14:06.220" style="s2">evolutionary&#39;s then we can be actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.000" end="00:14:08.950" style="s2">kind of we identify as nouns rather than</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.220" end="00:14:10.990" style="s2">verbs and we stay stuck where we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.950" end="00:14:12.550" style="s2">and then we need pain as an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.990" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">driver and then emergence through</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.550" end="00:14:17.350" style="s2">emergency is how we grow as soon as we</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.279" end="00:14:19.779" style="s2">identify with the inexorable &#39;ti of</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.350" end="00:14:21.670" style="s2">evolution and ourselves as evolution</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.779" end="00:14:22.870" style="s2">incarnate we stopped needing pain to</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.800" end="00:14:33.820" style="s2">of the becoming is the bringing about</p>

<p begin="00:14:58.420" end="00:15:02.050" style="s2">because that&#39;s fundamental to what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.310" end="00:15:05.500" style="s2">actually here to do now when we all</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.050" end="00:15:05.889" style="s2">identify as evolutionary&#39;s we obsolete</p>

<p begin="00:15:14.199" end="00:15:20.109" style="s2">we also identify as fundamentally</p>

<p begin="00:15:39.999" end="00:15:43.839" style="s2">self is our self is actually an emergent</p>

<p begin="00:15:47.109" end="00:15:50.470" style="s2">actually key in terms of emergence</p>

<p begin="00:15:50.470" end="00:15:54.100" style="s2">whole universe because even though you</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.350" end="00:15:56.019" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.100" end="00:15:57.069" style="s2">in the same way without your brain and</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.019" end="00:15:59.739" style="s2">your body you also wouldn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.069" end="00:16:02.049" style="s2">without the atmosphere and the trees</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.739" end="00:16:04.439" style="s2">that make it and the plants and bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.049" end="00:16:06.639" style="s2">that make it and the gravity and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.439" end="00:16:08.379" style="s2">electromagnetism and foundational forces</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.639" end="00:16:11.230" style="s2">like the concept of I separate from</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.379" end="00:16:15.309" style="s2">universe is a misnomer does that make</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.230" end="00:16:16.869" style="s2">sense so the concept of a life path for</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.309" end="00:16:20.259" style="s2">ourself it isn&#39;t a life path for</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.869" end="00:16:22.029" style="s2">universe as a misnomer or advantage for</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.259" end="00:16:25.119" style="s2">self so when so then we get in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.029" end="00:16:26.739" style="s2">deepest sense when Einstein said the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.119" end="00:16:29.519" style="s2">idea that there are separate things is</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.739" end="00:16:33.610" style="s2">an optical delusion of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.519" end="00:16:35.669" style="s2">in reality there is one reality that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.610" end="00:16:39.089" style="s2">call universe of which we are all</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.669" end="00:16:42.279" style="s2">inextricably interconnected facets and</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.089" end="00:16:44.559" style="s2">your experience of self is a facet of</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.279" end="00:16:46.809" style="s2">that now what&#39;s so fascinating is</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.559" end="00:16:48.489" style="s2">that it is interconnected with all of it</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.809" end="00:16:49.629" style="s2">it&#39;s an expression of the foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.489" end="00:16:51.639" style="s2">all of it and it&#39;s also completely</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.629" end="00:16:55.839" style="s2">unique in all of universe it&#39;s a unique</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.639" end="00:16:57.249" style="s2">facet non fungible unique right what</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.839" end="00:16:59.319" style="s2">that means is you have something to</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.249" end="00:17:02.889" style="s2">offer universe in your experience and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.319" end="00:17:05.470" style="s2">your creativity that no one else has to</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.889" end="00:17:07.510" style="s2">offer exactly that way which means if</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.470" end="00:17:11.799" style="s2">you don&#39;t offer it like if Salvador Dali</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.510" end="00:17:13.839" style="s2">hadn&#39;t done Dali Michelangelo didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.799" end="00:17:14.829" style="s2">Dali I sure wouldn&#39;t have done Dali Dali</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.839" end="00:17:17.230" style="s2">just wouldn&#39;t have happened</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.829" end="00:17:18.890" style="s2">and so universe would have been</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.230" end="00:17:20.679" style="s2">fundamentally less</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.890" end="00:17:24.860" style="s2">so when you get that your own</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.679" end="00:17:26.480" style="s2">self-actualization is compulsory right</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.860" end="00:17:27.920" style="s2">you have an obligation to it but then</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.480" end="00:17:29.510" style="s2">when you get that everyone else if they</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.920" end="00:17:31.670" style="s2">don&#39;t self actualize universe is less</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.510" end="00:17:34.120" style="s2">your participation with helping everyone</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.670" end="00:17:38.049" style="s2">else self actualize is also compulsory</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.120" end="00:17:40.640" style="s2">so competition is an obsolete concept</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.049" end="00:17:42.020" style="s2">symbiotic to remember universe moves</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.640" end="00:17:44.000" style="s2">towards more differentiation more</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.020" end="00:17:46.760" style="s2">novelty and then more symbiosis across</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.000" end="00:17:49.910" style="s2">that novelty for more emergence and what</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.760" end="00:17:52.520" style="s2">we&#39;re moving towards is a civilization</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.910" end="00:17:55.549" style="s2">where everyone actually identifies this</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.520" end="00:17:57.740" style="s2">way as a emergent property of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.549" end="00:17:59.870" style="s2">as an interconnected part of universe</p>

<p begin="00:18:04.190" end="00:18:08.990" style="s2">with that human participation then</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.710" end="00:18:10.720" style="s2">humanity actually becomes a thing it</p>

<p begin="00:18:10.720" end="00:18:14.780" style="s2">right now it&#39;s an idea but we don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:18:14.780" end="00:18:20.720" style="s2">have humans bumping right it&#39;s we have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.710" end="00:18:22.190" style="s2">bunch of organelles that haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.720" end="00:18:24.530" style="s2">organized as a cell that starts</p>

<p begin="00:18:24.530" end="00:18:30.169" style="s2">of the whole that is centrally</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.720" end="00:18:32.780" style="s2">unconsciously self-organizing but we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.169" end="00:18:34.250" style="s2">and I would actually say and and this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.780" end="00:18:36.679" style="s2">what I wanted to have more time to get</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.250" end="00:18:39.950" style="s2">into but to just foreshadow quickly if</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.679" end="00:18:41.690" style="s2">we cherry pick from the huge data sets</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.950" end="00:18:43.910" style="s2">about where Humanity is going right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.690" end="00:18:45.530" style="s2">we can see that things are exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.910" end="00:18:46.700" style="s2">changing which means changing it more</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.530" end="00:18:48.799" style="s2">and more rapid and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.700" end="00:18:50.179" style="s2">significant rates and you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.799" end="00:18:51.740" style="s2">cherry-pick metrics where things are</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.179" end="00:18:53.330" style="s2">getting exponentially better and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.740" end="00:18:54.650" style="s2">true and other things we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.330" end="00:18:57.770" style="s2">exponentially worse and that&#39;s also true</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.650" end="00:18:59.120" style="s2">which means the future that you predict</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.770" end="00:19:01.700" style="s2">if you just follow any of those curves</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.120" end="00:19:03.320" style="s2">is not happening if things are getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.700" end="00:19:04.730" style="s2">exponentially better and worse at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.320" end="00:19:05.870" style="s2">same time does everybody kind of get</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.730" end="00:19:08.419" style="s2">that that&#39;s happening on different</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.870" end="00:19:09.830" style="s2">metrics then that doesn&#39;t mean things</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.419" end="00:19:13.360" style="s2">are getting better or worse it means the</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.830" end="00:19:19.280" style="s2">current system is destabilizing</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.360" end="00:19:21.650" style="s2">and that means self terminating and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.280" end="00:19:23.900" style="s2">we either have a discrete phase shift to</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.650" end="00:19:26.270" style="s2">a lower order entropic system or the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.900" end="00:19:27.860" style="s2">emergence of a higher order system that</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.270" end="00:19:30.290" style="s2">is foundationally different than the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.860" end="00:19:32.750" style="s2">current system we have in every in every</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.290" end="00:19:36.290" style="s2">way so the things getting bad</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.750" end="00:19:38.510" style="s2">are the pieces that can be reorganized</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.290" end="00:19:40.040" style="s2">to create a new civilization with a</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.510" end="00:19:41.990" style="s2">foundationally new structure right</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.040" end="00:19:44.750" style="s2">biosphere metrics are getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.990" end="00:19:47.240" style="s2">exponentially worse from misapplication</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.750" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">of technology technologies right</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.240" end="00:19:49.700" style="s2">application are making things</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:51.650" style="s2">fundamentally better but technology is</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.700" end="00:19:54.530" style="s2">giving us the capacity to do things like</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.650" end="00:19:56.450" style="s2">have data analytic capabilities to</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.530" end="00:19:58.220" style="s2">inventory all the world&#39;s resources to</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.450" end="00:19:59.870" style="s2">then be able to allocate all the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.220" end="00:20:01.280" style="s2">resources to meet all the world&#39;s needs</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.870" end="00:20:02.900" style="s2">with optimum efficiency we never have</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.280" end="00:20:04.370" style="s2">that ability before like the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.900" end="00:20:05.930" style="s2">transportation and communication</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.370" end="00:20:07.370" style="s2">technologies it can actually make us a</p>

<p begin="00:20:07.370" end="00:20:10.910" style="s2">before right</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.660" end="00:20:14.660" style="s2">and so the technological capacities that</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.910" end="00:20:16.460" style="s2">require us to step up otherwise we you</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.660" end="00:20:19.490" style="s2">know self extinctions very real thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.460" end="00:20:21.230" style="s2">also make possible a discrete phase</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.490" end="00:20:23.330" style="s2">shift and evolution that&#39;s characterized</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.230" end="00:20:25.130" style="s2">by three major things and this will be</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.330" end="00:20:28.010" style="s2">where I end at the level of social</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.130" end="00:20:30.200" style="s2">systems primarily economics the key</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.010" end="00:20:33.290" style="s2">shift we&#39;re going to move to is a moving</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.200" end="00:20:36.640" style="s2">from a differential advantage economy</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.290" end="00:20:38.840" style="s2">it&#39;s defined by private ownership</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.640" end="00:20:41.330" style="s2">valuation based on scarcity and</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.840" end="00:20:43.970" style="s2">differential advantage to an economic</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.330" end="00:20:45.980" style="s2">system that is defined by making sure</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.970" end="00:20:47.720" style="s2">that the incentive of every agent and</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.980" end="00:20:49.460" style="s2">the well-being of every other agent and</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.720" end="00:20:51.350" style="s2">the Commons is perfectly aligned with no</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.460" end="00:20:52.760" style="s2">externality meaning we actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.350" end="00:20:55.070" style="s2">understand that it&#39;s an interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.760" end="00:20:56.840" style="s2">system we identify all the externalities</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.070" end="00:20:58.970" style="s2">and internalize them so the system is</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.840" end="00:21:01.070" style="s2">actually defined by systemic advantage</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.970" end="00:21:02.810" style="s2">for the whole this is not communism or</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.070" end="00:21:04.610" style="s2">socialism or capitalism it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.810" end="00:21:06.440" style="s2">that was not possible before to even</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.610" end="00:21:08.600" style="s2">anticipate but it is how your body works</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.440" end="00:21:10.010" style="s2">where none of the cells are advantaging</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.600" end="00:21:11.000" style="s2">themselves at the expense of the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.010" end="00:21:12.470" style="s2">they&#39;re doing what&#39;s best for them</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.000" end="00:21:16.970" style="s2">what&#39;s best for the whole symbiotically</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.470" end="00:21:18.530" style="s2">at the same time right and so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.970" end="00:21:20.150" style="s2">key net shift at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.530" end="00:21:21.410" style="s2">macroeconomics and correspondingly</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.150" end="00:21:22.340" style="s2">governance and all of our social</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.410" end="00:21:24.860" style="s2">structures at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.340" end="00:21:26.450" style="s2">infrastructure in the built world we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:21:30.410" end="00:21:34.520" style="s2">finite resources and then turn it into</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.910" end="00:21:37.070" style="s2">trash to a closed-loop materials economy</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.520" end="00:21:38.540" style="s2">where the trash is the new stuff we stop</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.070" end="00:21:40.600" style="s2">extracting from the earth stop producing</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.540" end="00:21:43.310" style="s2">waste and we actually have a post growth</p>

<p begin="00:22:13.309" end="00:22:17.379" style="s2">there used to be such a thing as local</p>
