<p begin="00:00:07.799" end="00:00:13.230" style="s2">of these apps and once this type of</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.710" end="00:00:16.710" style="s2">platform actually exists and I believe</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.230" end="00:00:20.550" style="s2">you get a group of people together say</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.710" end="00:00:25.820" style="s2">honored people thousand people who share</p>

<p begin="00:00:25.820" end="00:00:34.050" style="s2">or people who like to eat food that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.609" end="00:00:36.030" style="s2">most of us and you find out what is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.050" end="00:00:38.579" style="s2">problem what stops you from eating</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.030" end="00:00:42.180" style="s2">healthy what stops you from eating</p>

<p begin="00:00:44.820" end="00:00:49.559" style="s2">brainstorm what a perfect app would be</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.879" end="00:00:52.219" style="s2">so but included absolutely everything</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.559" end="00:00:56.750" style="s2">and sky was the limit never no</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.219" end="00:01:00.030" style="s2">technological or monetary restrictions</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.750" end="00:01:01.260" style="s2">what would you create as a group and</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.030" end="00:01:03.539" style="s2">this can be done in small groups and</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.260" end="00:01:05.729" style="s2">then voted on and improved on to make</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.539" end="00:01:07.470" style="s2">the best lockdoor in this case you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.729" end="00:01:10.350" style="s2">just brainstorming so we&#39;ve got it</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.470" end="00:01:14.909" style="s2">together and then vote on the top ones</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.350" end="00:01:17.909" style="s2">you absolutely would need down to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.909" end="00:01:20.909" style="s2">ones that are able to be added on later</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.909" end="00:01:24.900" style="s2">and maybe some that probably are never</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.909" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">going to be included in it but finding a</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.900" end="00:01:27.930" style="s2">way to filter it down to what needs to</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:30.130" style="s2">be in it</p>

<p begin="00:01:31.700" end="00:01:38.670" style="s2">having people in realms create that so</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.159" end="00:01:40.409" style="s2">putting mock-ups saying how much it</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.670" end="00:01:42.299" style="s2">would cost to actually create it like if</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.409" end="00:01:43.500" style="s2">I created it I could make that fifty</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.299" end="00:01:44.790" style="s2">thousand and I can make it for ten</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.500" end="00:01:47.930" style="s2">thousand my company can make it for a</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.790" end="00:01:51.750" style="s2">million whatever it happens to be and</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.930" end="00:01:53.549" style="s2">then crowdsourcing the one that we vote</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.750" end="00:01:55.229" style="s2">for so maybe we want to make the million</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.549" end="00:01:58.799" style="s2">dollar project if you want to make the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.229" end="00:02:01.469" style="s2">ten thousand dollar project crowd just a</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.799" end="00:02:03.360" style="s2">crowdsourcing crowdfunding for it so</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.469" end="00:02:06.780" style="s2">let&#39;s come up with a million dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.360" end="00:02:08.640" style="s2">million people we put in $1 does that</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.780" end="00:02:09.899" style="s2">happen I don&#39;t know what we all eat so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.640" end="00:02:12.660" style="s2">think we can find a million people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.899" end="00:02:17.500" style="s2">eat and want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.660" end="00:02:19.510" style="s2">have food cue play and efficiently and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.500" end="00:02:21.280" style="s2">so is you going to create the app and</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.510" end="00:02:23.530" style="s2">then you have online systems that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.280" end="00:02:25.090" style="s2">monitor it and say who is using it what</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.530" end="00:02:25.450" style="s2">is their experience what would make it</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.090" end="00:02:28.090" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.450" end="00:02:33.310" style="s2">what should 2 point version 2.0 have and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.090" end="00:02:36.270" style="s2">that is the process to create an app in</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.310" end="00:02:36.270" style="s2">two and a half minutes</p>
