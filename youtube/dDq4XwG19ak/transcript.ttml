<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:04.560" style="s2">hey folks welcome to Bret Weinstein&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.310" end="00:00:07.140" style="s2">Dark Horse podcasts I am sitting here</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.560" end="00:00:10.080" style="s2">today with Chloe Valerie who is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.140" end="00:00:13.290" style="s2">architect behind theory of Enchantment</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.080" end="00:00:14.940" style="s2">welcome Chloe thank you can you tell me</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.290" end="00:00:16.890" style="s2">before we get into any of the other</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.940" end="00:00:19.140" style="s2">things that we want to discuss what the</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.890" end="00:00:20.880" style="s2">theory of Enchantment is so theory of</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.140" end="00:00:23.220" style="s2">Enchantment is a curriculum that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.880" end="00:00:25.830" style="s2">designed to teach mental health and</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.220" end="00:00:27.990" style="s2">healthy identity formation but the</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.830" end="00:00:29.910" style="s2">uniqueness of the curriculum is that it</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.990" end="00:00:31.890" style="s2">uses pop culture to teach these things</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.910" end="00:00:33.570" style="s2">so when you say identity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.890" end="00:00:38.280" style="s2">obviously a charged term these days</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.570" end="00:00:40.020" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about racial gender</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.280" end="00:00:41.700" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about these things or do</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.020" end="00:00:44.219" style="s2">you mean something else by no I think I</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.700" end="00:00:47.460" style="s2">mean something actually quite deeper</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.219" end="00:00:50.129" style="s2">than that which is sort of like the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.460" end="00:00:52.710" style="s2">fundamental humanists that we think of</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.129" end="00:00:54.120" style="s2">when we think of individuals and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.710" end="00:00:55.890" style="s2">something that transcends all the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.120" end="00:00:57.750" style="s2">categories that you just mentioned in</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.890" end="00:01:00.660" style="s2">some way so it almost sounds like an</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.750" end="00:01:03.149" style="s2">alternative to this modern view of</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.660" end="00:01:05.549" style="s2">identity maybe I think I think that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.149" end="00:01:07.439" style="s2">know I don&#39;t think that race or gender</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.549" end="00:01:09.150" style="s2">or such categories can&#39;t also be</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.439" end="00:01:11.880" style="s2">discussed I think that this just</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.150" end="00:01:14.189" style="s2">provides us with a better framework or a</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.880" end="00:01:16.250" style="s2">better roadmap to point us in the right</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.189" end="00:01:24.320" style="s2">direction as we discuss those things</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.250" end="00:01:26.369" style="s2">cool so maybe let&#39;s be bold okay and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.320" end="00:01:28.259" style="s2">actually maybe I have to ask your</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.369" end="00:01:31.970" style="s2">permission to do this first okay there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.259" end="00:01:35.729" style="s2">a way in which you as a person of</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.970" end="00:01:37.350" style="s2">African descent are living in a world in</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.729" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">which race is playing such a prominent</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.350" end="00:01:41.850" style="s2">role that whether you want that to be an</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.320" end="00:01:43.649" style="s2">important part of the way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.850" end="00:01:45.450" style="s2">interacting it is on so many people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.649" end="00:01:48.960" style="s2">minds that you&#39;re dragged into a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.450" end="00:01:50.729" style="s2">conversations about it and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.960" end="00:01:53.399" style="s2">certainly a part of me that would love</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.729" end="00:01:54.630" style="s2">to just bypass it entirely okay and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.399" end="00:01:57.210" style="s2">there&#39;s another part of me that thinks</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.630" end="00:01:58.829" style="s2">actually this is an opportunity sure you</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.210" end="00:02:01.530" style="s2">and I I think it&#39;s fair to say our</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.829" end="00:02:03.299" style="s2">friends yeah and I feel very comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.530" end="00:02:05.130" style="s2">with you I think you feel comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.299" end="00:02:07.320" style="s2">with me certain that means that in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:09.450" style="s2">sense we&#39;re really well positioned to</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.320" end="00:02:11.550" style="s2">have a conversation about things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.450" end="00:02:12.590" style="s2">other people aren&#39;t sure what to do with</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.550" end="00:02:15.650" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.590" end="00:02:20.930" style="s2">so can you tell me a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.650" end="00:02:22.940" style="s2">your background and then what you see on</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.930" end="00:02:25.489" style="s2">the modern landscape with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.940" end="00:02:28.750" style="s2">this topic that has become so charged</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.489" end="00:02:32.569" style="s2">sure that&#39;s a big question</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.750" end="00:02:34.730" style="s2">Kosmic even so I&#39;m from New Orleans</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.569" end="00:02:36.290" style="s2">Louisiana I&#39;m african-american both my</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.730" end="00:02:40.390" style="s2">parents are black my grandparents are on</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.290" end="00:02:45.080" style="s2">both my parents side are black I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.390" end="00:02:47.209" style="s2">fairly certain that my parents ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.080" end="00:02:49.310" style="s2">or at least by I think my parents</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.209" end="00:02:51.230" style="s2">ancestors who were slaves or probably</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.310" end="00:02:52.250" style="s2">slaves in Shreveport because Shreveport</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.230" end="00:02:54.530" style="s2">Louisiana because I have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.250" end="00:02:57.349" style="s2">friends family that still lives in</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.530" end="00:02:59.060" style="s2">Shreveport Louisiana but also I think my</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.349" end="00:03:00.950" style="s2">father&#39;s side of the family goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.060" end="00:03:03.530" style="s2">Haiti and that&#39;s the extent to which I</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.950" end="00:03:06.080" style="s2">know really about sort of immediate</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.530" end="00:03:08.540" style="s2">regional places that my family has come</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.080" end="00:03:11.540" style="s2">from so when you say goes back to Haiti</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.540" end="00:03:14.030" style="s2">your father&#39;s family you believe was</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.540" end="00:03:16.549" style="s2">living in Haiti so I believed in Haiti</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.030" end="00:03:17.630" style="s2">pressing sell farming sugar or something</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.549" end="00:03:19.250" style="s2">along those line I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.630" end="00:03:20.750" style="s2">know the specifics of that but I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.250" end="00:03:23.269" style="s2">that they I think that that was the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.750" end="00:03:25.579" style="s2">particular place where they were most</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.269" end="00:03:28.730" style="s2">recently before coming to America got it</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.579" end="00:03:31.430" style="s2">that make sense any idea what part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.730" end="00:03:32.840" style="s2">Africa your family emerges from so West</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.430" end="00:03:34.760" style="s2">Africa but that actually doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.840" end="00:03:37.220" style="s2">tell us anything because West Africa was</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.760" end="00:03:38.690" style="s2">we&#39;re like the slave port was yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.220" end="00:03:40.280" style="s2">everyone was going through West Africa</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.690" end="00:03:44.090" style="s2">but I mean maybe it tells us something</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.280" end="00:03:45.410" style="s2">if it says like 80 percent from West</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.090" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">West Africa maybe that means something</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.410" end="00:03:49.579" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure but my sense is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.040" end="00:03:54.760" style="s2">hard to tell</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.579" end="00:03:59.060" style="s2">so Louisiana that&#39;s interesting yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.760" end="00:04:02.120" style="s2">were in Louisiana in New Orleans during</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.060" end="00:04:03.950" style="s2">Katrina yes I was 11 years old or 11</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.120" end="00:04:05.720" style="s2">years old yeah all right</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.950" end="00:04:09.470" style="s2">we had to leave for a year because the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.720" end="00:04:11.060" style="s2">city shut down you know there was for a</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.470" end="00:04:12.709" style="s2">host of reasons off obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.060" end="00:04:16.130" style="s2">flooding and the shutting down of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.709" end="00:04:18.630" style="s2">city as well but thankfully my parents</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.130" end="00:04:21.870" style="s2">house was not destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.630" end="00:04:25.530" style="s2">and so we were able to go back after a</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.870" end="00:04:30.510" style="s2">year but I was still gone all for all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.530" end="00:04:33.510" style="s2">eleven and so your family was there you</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.510" end="00:04:38.430" style="s2">were in yeah in Louisiana for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.510" end="00:04:41.450" style="s2">hurricane yeah and so you saw you saw in</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.430" end="00:04:44.490" style="s2">person what most of us saw on television</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.450" end="00:04:47.100" style="s2">well yes or no so I didn&#39;t see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.490" end="00:04:50.430" style="s2">the more harrowing images that people</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.100" end="00:04:51.750" style="s2">saw on television just because so my</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.430" end="00:04:53.700" style="s2">grandmother was working at the VA</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.750" end="00:04:55.620" style="s2">hospital at the time and we were housed</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.700" end="00:04:57.270" style="s2">there for about a week and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.620" end="00:04:58.770" style="s2">everything just became unbearable</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.270" end="00:05:01.560" style="s2">because like like I said the city was</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.770" end="00:05:03.300" style="s2">shut down so we got rescued on military</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.560" end="00:05:06.540" style="s2">trucks and they took us to Zephyr</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.300" end="00:05:08.580" style="s2">Stadium and then from there they took us</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.540" end="00:05:11.220" style="s2">on buses where we went to Alexandria</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.580" end="00:05:13.710" style="s2">Louisiana where I stayed for a year so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.220" end="00:05:15.810" style="s2">saw I mean it was kind of weird to be on</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.710" end="00:05:19.740" style="s2">a military truck for example and hear</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.810" end="00:05:22.710" style="s2">gunshots in the distance but I also</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.740" end="00:05:24.600" style="s2">think that because I was 11 I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.710" end="00:05:27.990" style="s2">really remember a lot of it it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.600" end="00:05:31.950" style="s2">honestly a blur to a certain extent but</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.990" end="00:05:33.810" style="s2">I do i do remember like some things</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.950" end="00:05:35.850" style="s2">obviously being out of the ordinary but</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.810" end="00:05:39.120" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t as howling as other images of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.850" end="00:05:40.290" style="s2">like yeah people stranded out and people</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.120" end="00:05:42.060" style="s2">in the Superdome and sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.290" end="00:05:43.620" style="s2">troubles that they had as well people</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.060" end="00:05:47.910" style="s2">dead in their wheelchairs exactly</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.620" end="00:05:50.370" style="s2">exactly yeah yeah it was quite dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.910" end="00:05:53.250" style="s2">on the outside yeah of course you were</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.370" end="00:05:54.960" style="s2">11 right so there&#39;s also the added fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.250" end="00:05:58.140" style="s2">of having seen it through the eyes of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.960" end="00:06:01.800" style="s2">kid yeah at that point yeah I must tell</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.140" end="00:06:03.870" style="s2">you I have a very clear visceral memory</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.800" end="00:06:05.400" style="s2">of house Katrina unfolded</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.870" end="00:06:09.870" style="s2">I was watching news coverage like</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.400" end="00:06:11.730" style="s2">everybody else and I remember there was</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.870" end="00:06:14.880" style="s2">a moment I think it was George Bush</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.730" end="00:06:16.740" style="s2">himself who was announcing that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.880" end="00:06:19.980" style="s2">federal government was doing all it</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.740" end="00:06:24.810" style="s2">could but that it was having trouble</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.980" end="00:06:28.680" style="s2">getting its trucks into the city to help</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.810" end="00:06:30.840" style="s2">people and I had this visceral reaction</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.680" end="00:06:31.780" style="s2">I was overwhelmed with anger because</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.840" end="00:06:33.820" style="s2">there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.780" end="00:06:35.350" style="s2">way even if the president had forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.820" end="00:06:38.920" style="s2">that the federal government had</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.350" end="00:06:41.110" style="s2">helicopters right the federal government</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.920" end="00:06:42.970" style="s2">knew that it had them right and so the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.110" end="00:06:44.800" style="s2">fact that it was going to pretend that</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.970" end="00:06:46.270" style="s2">it couldn&#39;t help people because the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.800" end="00:06:49.630" style="s2">roads were in bad condition it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.270" end="00:06:52.419" style="s2">clearly an excuse sure so you know that</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.630" end="00:06:54.430" style="s2">actually in in light of what you do with</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.419" end="00:06:56.590" style="s2">theory of Enchantment using pop culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.430" end="00:07:01.150" style="s2">it it is the first place that I became</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.590" end="00:07:03.639" style="s2">aware of Kanye West well famous yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.150" end="00:07:05.230" style="s2">legend exertion was that yeah George</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.639" end="00:07:09.010" style="s2">Bush did not care about black people</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.230" end="00:07:11.760" style="s2">yeah I have to say I don&#39;t think was</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.010" end="00:07:14.919" style="s2">exactly what was going on right but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.760" end="00:07:17.380" style="s2">did understand exactly why that was the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.919" end="00:07:19.630" style="s2">impression because whatever it was that</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.380" end="00:07:21.760" style="s2">he did and didn&#39;t care about somehow</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.630" end="00:07:24.430" style="s2">helicopters that absolutely needed to</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.760" end="00:07:27.760" style="s2">arrive with help immediately were not</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.430" end="00:07:30.010" style="s2">arriving and so there was some failure</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.760" end="00:07:34.210" style="s2">of empathy on a massive scale</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.010" end="00:07:36.810" style="s2">definitely but anyway it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.210" end="00:07:39.580" style="s2">actually kind of a I think it&#39;s a a</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.810" end="00:07:41.919" style="s2">national trauma that we all witnessed</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.580" end="00:07:43.210" style="s2">the failure of of our government at that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.919" end="00:07:46.030" style="s2">moment that&#39;s so interesting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.210" end="00:07:48.820" style="s2">interesting to be to have lived that as</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.030" end="00:07:50.979" style="s2">opposed to have been the viewer of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.820" end="00:07:53.380" style="s2">and I wonder like the relationship that</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.979" end="00:07:55.330" style="s2">creates between the thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.380" end="00:07:58.180" style="s2">happening and the thing the person</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.330" end="00:07:59.979" style="s2">that&#39;s happening to because yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.180" end="00:08:02.080" style="s2">know maybe again because I was 11 and</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.979" end="00:08:05.140" style="s2">because I was in the middle of it as</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.080" end="00:08:07.690" style="s2">opposed to observing it that that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.140" end="00:08:09.310" style="s2">scope at that point in time was lost on</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.690" end="00:08:10.900" style="s2">me because I was in the middle of it as</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.310" end="00:08:13.419" style="s2">opposed to observing it yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.900" end="00:08:15.550" style="s2">impossible to understand the magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.419" end="00:08:18.039" style="s2">of the context if you&#39;re in it and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.550" end="00:08:21.220" style="s2">that&#39;s compounded by being a child yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.039" end="00:08:23.410" style="s2">at that point my sense at the time</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.220" end="00:08:25.300" style="s2">trying to understand what it was that</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.410" end="00:08:26.890" style="s2">had gone wrong and I have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.300" end="00:08:30.520" style="s2">whether I&#39;m right about this or another</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.890" end="00:08:32.469" style="s2">but I have the sense that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.520" end="00:08:34.360" style="s2">campaign I mean effectively we know</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.469" end="00:08:36.550" style="s2">there was a campaign and it came from</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.360" end="00:08:39.659" style="s2">the right okay and that campaign was</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.550" end="00:08:42.039" style="s2">effectively designed to wean us off</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.659" end="00:08:44.020" style="s2">dependence on government at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.039" end="00:08:45.590" style="s2">antipathy for government on the right</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.020" end="00:08:49.160" style="s2">was so great</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.590" end="00:08:52.190" style="s2">that it essentially took that part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.160" end="00:08:53.960" style="s2">government which functioned and hobbled</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.190" end="00:08:55.550" style="s2">it so that we wouldn&#39;t get the sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.960" end="00:08:58.010" style="s2">that government was the solution to any</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.550" end="00:09:02.510" style="s2">problem I see and you know on the Left I</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.010" end="00:09:04.370" style="s2">would say there is an over-dependence on</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.510" end="00:09:06.230" style="s2">governmental solutions often that have</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.370" end="00:09:08.450" style="s2">unintended consequences so it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.230" end="00:09:12.530" style="s2">I&#39;m saying the only fault here is on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.450" end="00:09:16.010" style="s2">right but the the hobbling of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.530" end="00:09:18.530" style="s2">government was in full swing at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.010" end="00:09:21.470" style="s2">point Katrina hit I mean it was almost</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.530" end="00:09:24.770" style="s2">at completion ok and I had the sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.470" end="00:09:26.840" style="s2">that there was a desire not to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.770" end="00:09:29.200" style="s2">helicopters fly in and save the day</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.840" end="00:09:31.910" style="s2">because it would remind people that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.200" end="00:09:36.620" style="s2">government actually stands between us</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.910" end="00:09:38.450" style="s2">and chaos and that it is necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.620" end="00:09:40.130" style="s2">useful and you well that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.450" end="00:09:43.310" style="s2">cuz that brings up a contradiction of</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.130" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">the right as you&#39;re saying that the last</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.310" end="00:09:48.040" style="s2">part the last piece that you just said</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.720" end="00:09:50.360" style="s2">because presumably the right believes in</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.040" end="00:09:52.220" style="s2">yes they believe in small government but</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.360" end="00:09:58.400" style="s2">they also believe in the governing of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.220" end="00:09:59.510" style="s2">the self in order to thwart chaos but</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.400" end="00:10:00.890" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting that that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.510" end="00:10:03.110" style="s2">extend from the individual to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.890" end="00:10:05.210" style="s2">collective in the right wing&#39;s conscious</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.110" end="00:10:06.470" style="s2">sense of sense of you know consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.210" end="00:10:09.140" style="s2">or whatever however you want to describe</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.470" end="00:10:11.180" style="s2">it because consistency would suggest</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.140" end="00:10:15.590" style="s2">that if you believe that self government</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.180" end="00:10:18.050" style="s2">is necessary to fort or to keep chaos</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.590" end="00:10:22.190" style="s2">back then if you were to take that and</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.050" end="00:10:24.680" style="s2">apply it on a macro level then</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.190" end="00:10:26.660" style="s2">governments are necessary also to thwart</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.680" end="00:10:29.560" style="s2">chaos right interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.660" end="00:10:32.300" style="s2">and so that&#39;s an inherent sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.560" end="00:10:34.820" style="s2">inconsistency now when you say although</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.300" end="00:10:36.800" style="s2">I could probably still mend the response</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.820" end="00:10:39.080" style="s2">to that but yeah well I mean all of</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.800" end="00:10:40.400" style="s2">these things will be yeah a balance and</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.080" end="00:10:43.460" style="s2">sure any of them can be taken too far</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.400" end="00:10:45.260" style="s2">better when you say the governance of</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.460" end="00:10:48.140" style="s2">self yeah are you talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.260" end="00:10:49.820" style="s2">basically self-restraint well I just</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.140" end="00:10:54.050" style="s2">know that the right tends to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.820" end="00:10:56.480" style="s2">the importance of like you know self</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.050" end="00:10:58.970" style="s2">regulation and not making sure not to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.480" end="00:11:01.819" style="s2">you know swept up by the passion</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.970" end="00:11:03.410" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a that&#39;s definitely mostly</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.819" end="00:11:05.509" style="s2">right-wing talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.410" end="00:11:10.879" style="s2">and so by self-governance I just mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.509" end="00:11:14.060" style="s2">being in control of one&#39;s faculty so as</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.879" end="00:11:16.399" style="s2">to not descend into chaos whether that</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.060" end="00:11:19.639" style="s2">chaos is decadence whether that chaos is</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.399" end="00:11:22.339" style="s2">in excess of anything right basically to</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.639" end="00:11:24.620" style="s2">always be in moderation and but in being</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.339" end="00:11:26.300" style="s2">in moderation requires governance yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.620" end="00:11:28.850" style="s2">and so if you don&#39;t extend that from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.300" end="00:11:30.470" style="s2">micro to the macro then you could it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.850" end="00:11:34.550" style="s2">it begs a question at the very least</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.470" end="00:11:38.540" style="s2">yeah and you know I think wise people on</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.550" end="00:11:41.870" style="s2">the left and right can surely agree that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.540" end="00:11:44.899" style="s2">it is important essentially to</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.870" end="00:11:46.970" style="s2">self-police at some great well now we we</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.899" end="00:11:48.769" style="s2">on the left might disagree with us on</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.970" end="00:11:50.300" style="s2">the right I don&#39;t mean to include you</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.769" end="00:11:52.699" style="s2">one way or the other you define yourself</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.300" end="00:11:55.850" style="s2">as you will sir we on the left meaning</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.699" end="00:11:58.250" style="s2">me and on the left might have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.850" end="00:12:00.980" style="s2">different view of where the the border</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.250" end="00:12:04.250" style="s2">of that responsibility is I think we</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.980" end="00:12:07.129" style="s2">could all agree that it is essential and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.250" end="00:12:10.689" style="s2">in fact one of the things that I am most</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.129" end="00:12:16.279" style="s2">disturbed by that I see on the modern</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.689" end="00:12:18.920" style="s2">radical left is essentially a juvenile</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.279" end="00:12:21.949" style="s2">abdication of responsibility to</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.920" end="00:12:24.610" style="s2">self-regulate a desire you know a sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.949" end="00:12:28.069" style="s2">of recognition I want that thing and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.610" end="00:12:30.170" style="s2">therefore I am entitled to it rather</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.069" end="00:12:32.029" style="s2">than any notion that there are</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.170" end="00:12:34.129" style="s2">trade-offs and balances that have to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.029" end="00:12:37.670" style="s2">struck and feeding values and these</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.129" end="00:12:40.910" style="s2">sorts of things but anyway I would love</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.670" end="00:12:42.800" style="s2">for the left and right to recognize the</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.910" end="00:12:45.680" style="s2">part of this viewpoint that they</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.800" end="00:12:49.970" style="s2">actually do share right unfortunately I</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.680" end="00:12:53.420" style="s2">think that would require giving up</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.970" end="00:12:56.990" style="s2">previously held positions the other is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.420" end="00:13:01.819" style="s2">monster so you cannot find something of</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.990" end="00:13:03.829" style="s2">quality in a monster and even more so</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.819" end="00:13:05.449" style="s2">you cannot admit that you find something</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.829" end="00:13:07.339" style="s2">in a monster which is similar to you</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.449" end="00:13:12.040" style="s2">because now you are identified with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.339" end="00:13:17.070" style="s2">monster so forever yeah 15 years I have</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.040" end="00:13:20.589" style="s2">saying the following set of ideas the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.070" end="00:13:23.410" style="s2">Fox News viewer believed that the New</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.589" end="00:13:25.149" style="s2">York Times reader is insane</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.410" end="00:13:28.060" style="s2">the New York Times reader believes yes</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.149" end="00:13:32.350" style="s2">the Fox News viewer is crazy they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.060" end="00:13:33.880" style="s2">both right yes okay yes and yes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.350" end="00:13:37.389" style="s2">something very powerful in what you said</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.880" end="00:13:39.759" style="s2">about it is impossible to find that</p>

<p begin="00:13:39.759" end="00:13:45.759" style="s2">other side what I have trouble relating</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.279" end="00:13:47.259" style="s2">to because frankly I don&#39;t see a monster</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.759" end="00:13:49.269" style="s2">on the other side generally I</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.259" end="00:13:51.940" style="s2">occasionally see them all those people</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.269" end="00:13:53.620" style="s2">exist but they&#39;re not common sure right</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.940" end="00:13:56.079" style="s2">it&#39;s not like there&#39;s an entire right</p>

<p begin="00:13:58.000" end="00:14:05.410" style="s2">true so I have no trouble sitting with</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.319" end="00:14:07.540" style="s2">people who I&#39;m told I shouldn&#39;t be able</p>

<p begin="00:14:13.660" end="00:14:19.300" style="s2">is that way I don&#39;t know find myself</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.579" end="00:14:20.620" style="s2">persuaded sure but it&#39;s not hard sure to</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.300" end="00:14:22.930" style="s2">grant them the benefit of the doubt and</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.620" end="00:14:25.149" style="s2">to discover their humanity I don&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.930" end="00:14:27.910" style="s2">this problem with people on the right</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.149" end="00:14:30.040" style="s2">generally even though I&#39;m far from the</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.910" end="00:14:32.199" style="s2">right mm-hmm I don&#39;t get the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.040" end="00:14:35.230" style="s2">you have trouble seeing humanity on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.199" end="00:14:37.089" style="s2">other side in fact your whole dear even</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.230" end="00:14:39.250" style="s2">Chapman ciriculum is built around the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.089" end="00:14:42.699" style="s2">idea of really deeply understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.250" end="00:14:45.250" style="s2">humanity on the other side yes so if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.699" end="00:14:46.690" style="s2">and I find this relatively easy to look</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.250" end="00:14:49.690" style="s2">across the aisle at people we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.690" end="00:14:51.850" style="s2">supposed to not be able to fathom and to</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.690" end="00:14:55.149" style="s2">actually find their humanity is there</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.850" end="00:14:57.459" style="s2">something a is it much easier than</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.149" end="00:14:59.260" style="s2">people think is there just like a simple</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.459" end="00:15:01.959" style="s2">error that they&#39;re making or is it</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.260" end="00:15:03.970" style="s2">harder mm-hmm then you and I find it</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.959" end="00:15:07.029" style="s2">because there&#39;s something about other</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.970" end="00:15:08.889" style="s2">people that stands in their way that</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.029" end="00:15:12.130" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t happen to be part of either</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.889" end="00:15:18.100" style="s2">of us I actually think it is hard in</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.130" end="00:15:22.680" style="s2">general because of what it requires one</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.100" end="00:15:25.660" style="s2">too it requires one too like shed</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.680" end="00:15:27.670" style="s2">preconceived notions and if one</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.660" end="00:15:30.940" style="s2">if one&#39;s identity is attached to</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.670" end="00:15:32.530" style="s2">preconceived ideas then and if you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.940" end="00:15:36.010" style="s2">to shed it then it&#39;s sort of like feels</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.530" end="00:15:37.810" style="s2">it feels like a disaster you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.010" end="00:15:40.450" style="s2">identified with a certain set of beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.810" end="00:15:43.870" style="s2">that said you have to bash person X</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.450" end="00:15:45.550" style="s2">because they they have a different set</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.870" end="00:15:47.140" style="s2">of opinions than you and you heavily</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.550" end="00:15:49.960" style="s2">identify with it like that wasn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.140" end="00:15:52.420" style="s2">an opinion you had it was a part of who</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.960" end="00:15:54.490" style="s2">you are or who you conceived yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.420" end="00:15:56.470" style="s2">be and now all of a sudden we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.490" end="00:16:00.160" style="s2">actually you can find common ground and</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.470" end="00:16:02.320" style="s2">you can find you can even find affinity</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:04.090" style="s2">for this person that is a total</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.320" end="00:16:06.250" style="s2">rejection of the thing that you thought</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.090" end="00:16:08.250" style="s2">was fundamentally a part of your very</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.250" end="00:16:10.930" style="s2">being and that&#39;s hard to actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.250" end="00:16:12.280" style="s2">overcome like living through that</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.930" end="00:16:15.880" style="s2">wrestling with that and accepting that</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.280" end="00:16:17.860" style="s2">so I want to know are you saying you</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.880" end="00:16:19.570" style="s2">find it hard or you saying that your</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.860" end="00:16:22.150" style="s2">experience with other people tells you</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.570" end="00:16:24.550" style="s2">that it&#39;s hard I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.150" end="00:16:26.650" style="s2">it hard anymore but I used to find it</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.550" end="00:16:27.970" style="s2">hard and so I can understand how on a</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.650" end="00:16:31.750" style="s2">psychological level it could be hard</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.970" end="00:16:34.240" style="s2">okay and do you know what experience you</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.750" end="00:16:36.930" style="s2">had or what you realized that caused it</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.240" end="00:16:40.210" style="s2">to become easier oh to become easier</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.930" end="00:16:41.410" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting question I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.210" end="00:16:44.560" style="s2">if it was I don&#39;t know if I could</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.410" end="00:16:47.050" style="s2">pinpoint it to a very specific thing or</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.560" end="00:16:48.820" style="s2">moment I think it was a gradual well</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.050" end="00:16:51.640" style="s2">actually it entailed reading a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.820" end="00:16:53.020" style="s2">books honestly so East of Eden was</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.640" end="00:16:56.410" style="s2">probably one of the most important books</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.020" end="00:17:00.070" style="s2">I read in my 20s actually that like</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.410" end="00:17:03.250" style="s2">enabled me to do that and to think in</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.070" end="00:17:04.720" style="s2">this way so to speak but other than that</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.250" end="00:17:07.930" style="s2">I think it was just an organic process</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.720" end="00:17:10.530" style="s2">of wrestling with these ideas which</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.930" end="00:17:13.750" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sound very satisfying but no</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.530" end="00:17:15.160" style="s2">first of all I don&#39;t I don&#39;t he&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.750" end="00:17:16.930" style="s2">wonderful if there was a simple answer</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.160" end="00:17:18.850" style="s2">yeah there was a simple answer it would</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.930" end="00:17:22.660" style="s2">probably be more widely discussed okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.850" end="00:17:26.020" style="s2">oh who knows but actually yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.660" end="00:17:27.550" style="s2">think I think the answer might be that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.020" end="00:17:31.780" style="s2">discovered that what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.550" end="00:17:33.550" style="s2">the ability to sit across from someone</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.780" end="00:17:35.140" style="s2">who you don&#39;t like or whose ideas you</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.550" end="00:17:39.250" style="s2">don&#39;t like and still find affinity for</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.140" end="00:17:41.410" style="s2">them that ideas actually found</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.250" end="00:17:45.190" style="s2">I would argue we actually do believe in</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.410" end="00:17:48.880" style="s2">that and and the proof that we believe</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.190" end="00:17:51.310" style="s2">in that is its present in pop culture so</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.880" end="00:17:53.020" style="s2">like the movies that we love the Disney</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.310" end="00:17:55.150" style="s2">movies that we love for example is are</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.020" end="00:17:58.360" style="s2">often all about that right and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.150" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2">repeat themselves in Disney movies a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.360" end="00:18:02.110" style="s2">of the artists songs that we listen to</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.400" end="00:18:04.270" style="s2">I&#39;m saying like a big cross-section of</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.110" end="00:18:07.330" style="s2">society right the types of artists that</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.270" end="00:18:09.490" style="s2">we gravitate toward oftentimes do talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.330" end="00:18:11.740" style="s2">about empathy in their music or do not</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.490" end="00:18:15.640" style="s2">even talk about it but but implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.740" end="00:18:18.550" style="s2">it&#39;s there essentially and so I think it</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.640" end="00:18:22.240" style="s2">was a realization that it is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.550" end="00:18:23.860" style="s2">embedded in what we desire to want to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:25.720" style="s2">at the very least because it&#39;s found in</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.860" end="00:18:28.900" style="s2">the pop culture that would create and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.720" end="00:18:32.950" style="s2">this idea that I initially thought was</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.900" end="00:18:36.430" style="s2">like a foreign idea became common in my</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.950" end="00:18:39.100" style="s2">eyes and I think that that realization</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.430" end="00:18:41.170" style="s2">and that organic sort of unfolding of</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.100" end="00:18:44.350" style="s2">the discovery of the meaning at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.170" end="00:18:46.780" style="s2">bottom of pop culture helped me to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.350" end="00:18:48.400" style="s2">able to more easily do that because then</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.780" end="00:18:50.140" style="s2">that that means that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.400" end="00:18:52.510" style="s2">describing is the fabric of stories</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.140" end="00:18:54.550" style="s2">found through art and so then it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.510" end="00:18:56.650" style="s2">then I have an entirely new relationship</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.550" end="00:18:59.650" style="s2">with that entire concept an entire</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.650" end="00:19:02.260" style="s2">process I really like that and I realize</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.650" end="00:19:05.380" style="s2">in hearing you describe it there are two</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.260" end="00:19:07.110" style="s2">things in my experience that dovetail</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.380" end="00:19:12.010" style="s2">with what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.110" end="00:19:13.210" style="s2">one is I have a memory when I was I</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.010" end="00:19:18.300" style="s2">don&#39;t know how young I would have been</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.210" end="00:19:23.170" style="s2">maybe eight or nine all right and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.300" end="00:19:26.140" style="s2">think I was you know ranting about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.170" end="00:19:27.910" style="s2">injustice of what was happening to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.140" end="00:19:30.070" style="s2">nature okay I&#39;ve always had a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.910" end="00:19:31.540" style="s2">strong okay affinity for nature and a</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.070" end="00:19:36.910" style="s2">fascination with it and I&#39;ve always had</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.540" end="00:19:38.500" style="s2">a desire to like animals a lot and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.910" end="00:19:42.900" style="s2">like thinking about them and watching</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.500" end="00:19:45.640" style="s2">them and anyway I was ranting about</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.900" end="00:19:48.490" style="s2">maybe I was ranting about hunting okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.640" end="00:19:50.170" style="s2">and Erik you know three and a half years</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.490" end="00:19:52.370" style="s2">older than me mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.170" end="00:19:56.290" style="s2">said you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.370" end="00:19:59.630" style="s2">you really need to read field and stream</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.290" end="00:20:02.210" style="s2">okay all right and I said what are you</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.630" end="00:20:06.800" style="s2">talking about and he said you really</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.210" end="00:20:08.480" style="s2">need to understand what it is on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.800" end="00:20:14.540" style="s2">other side you need to understand how</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.480" end="00:20:17.240" style="s2">they see the world and you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.540" end="00:20:19.760" style="s2">little hard to admit how profound and</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.240" end="00:20:22.190" style="s2">impact that had on my life because at</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.760" end="00:20:29.360" style="s2">some level I now recognize myself as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.190" end="00:20:31.400" style="s2">50 year old adult who delights in being</p>

<p begin="00:20:33.860" end="00:20:37.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a way I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.210" end="00:20:39.860" style="s2">honorable work and I don&#39;t mm-hmm in any</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.520" end="00:20:43.330" style="s2">way feel cynical about it but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.860" end="00:20:45.530" style="s2">way in which it does strike me as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.330" end="00:20:46.730" style="s2">challenge when I hear there&#39;s a gap I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.530" end="00:20:49.040" style="s2">not supposed to be able to cross I</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.730" end="00:20:50.960" style="s2">always want to figure out whether I can</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.040" end="00:20:53.090" style="s2">convey something to the person on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.960" end="00:20:55.070" style="s2">other side sure about my humanity that</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.090" end="00:20:57.910" style="s2">will cause them to suddenly wake up vice</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.070" end="00:21:01.880" style="s2">versa the other thing though is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.910" end="00:21:04.280" style="s2">watching a world develop online that</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.880" end="00:21:08.270" style="s2">obviously didn&#39;t exist sure I was a</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.280" end="00:21:10.250" style="s2">young person you know you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.270" end="00:21:13.760" style="s2">young enough that it has existed for</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.250" end="00:21:16.700" style="s2">most of your adult life or maybe all of</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.760" end="00:21:20.180" style="s2">your adult life but I&#39;m watching</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.700" end="00:21:23.120" style="s2">something happen with for example the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.180" end="00:21:25.940" style="s2">videos that people post of their pets</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.120" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">okay and so there&#39;s sort of a culture of</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.940" end="00:21:32.480" style="s2">people posting things about you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:35.720" style="s2">surprising things that cats do or dogs</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.480" end="00:21:39.110" style="s2">do and there&#39;s a kind of a language that</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.720" end="00:21:40.880" style="s2">develops around the recognition of you</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.110" end="00:21:43.010" style="s2">know there&#39;s a certain I&#39;m gonna botch</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.880" end="00:21:44.150" style="s2">it but you know there&#39;s good boy kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.010" end="00:21:47.420" style="s2">thing for when a dog does something</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.150" end="00:21:49.280" style="s2">really impressive and I&#39;m watching I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.420" end="00:21:50.690" style="s2">noticing that you know people are</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.280" end="00:21:55.160" style="s2">talking about these things on reddit or</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.690" end="00:21:56.420" style="s2">wherever and they don&#39;t know whether</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.160" end="00:21:58.760" style="s2">they are on the same side of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.420" end="00:22:00.710" style="s2">political aisle all right they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.760" end="00:22:02.750" style="s2">know anything about each yeah but the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.710" end="00:22:05.540" style="s2">fact that you know yeah it might be that</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.750" end="00:22:06.200" style="s2">I have a hard time seeing you right but</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.540" end="00:22:08.180" style="s2">if you and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.200" end="00:22:10.160" style="s2">looking at that dog the fact is our</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.180" end="00:22:12.350" style="s2">human relationship with dogs is</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.160" end="00:22:14.840" style="s2">universal enough right that we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.350" end="00:22:16.760" style="s2">actually come together so yeah I had</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.840" end="00:22:18.950" style="s2">that same exact similar experience with</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.760" end="00:22:22.060" style="s2">DJing because when I first moved to New</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.950" end="00:22:25.040" style="s2">York I discovered New York and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.060" end="00:22:28.210" style="s2">discovered when was this this is in 2015</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.040" end="00:22:30.410" style="s2">okay I discovered Brooklyn and you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.210" end="00:22:33.620" style="s2">some of my friends took me out to these</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.410" end="00:22:35.930" style="s2">crazy parties in Brooklyn to see these</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.620" end="00:22:39.790" style="s2">awesome DJs who are super talented and</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.930" end="00:22:42.200" style="s2">I&#39;ve always been fascinated with this</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.790" end="00:22:44.420" style="s2">this thing that happens at concerts were</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.200" end="00:22:45.830" style="s2">people are willing to stand as close as</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.420" end="00:22:48.440" style="s2">possible to the other person that they</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.830" end="00:22:50.510" style="s2">don&#39;t know in order to get as close as</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.440" end="00:22:52.190" style="s2">possible to the stage and so like what</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.510" end="00:22:55.970" style="s2">is it about that particular landscape</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.190" end="00:22:58.730" style="s2">that that allows people to let</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.970" end="00:23:00.770" style="s2">themselves be vulnerable essentially but</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.730" end="00:23:02.600" style="s2">to also it&#39;s a different style or a</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.770" end="00:23:04.370" style="s2">different kind of connection that occurs</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.600" end="00:23:07.250" style="s2">in that type of landscape and the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.370" end="00:23:09.170" style="s2">is true for the dance floor and when you</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.250" end="00:23:11.150" style="s2">have a good DJ so what is it because</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.170" end="00:23:13.400" style="s2">because you know two people dancing</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.150" end="00:23:14.660" style="s2">together who have just met each other on</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.400" end="00:23:16.970" style="s2">the dance floor could have two totally</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.660" end="00:23:18.860" style="s2">different political viewpoints right or</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.970" end="00:23:20.750" style="s2">two could see not even just politics but</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.860" end="00:23:22.480" style="s2">could see the world fundamentally and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.750" end="00:23:25.900" style="s2">told in totally different ways and yet</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.480" end="00:23:30.080" style="s2">what is going on that dance floor is</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.900" end="00:23:32.930" style="s2">it&#39;s powerful enough to have the people</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.080" end="00:23:34.010" style="s2">there not care or that&#39;s not even they</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.930" end="00:23:35.960" style="s2">understand that that is not the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.010" end="00:23:38.270" style="s2">of life that&#39;s not the essence of life</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.960" end="00:23:38.840" style="s2">in that moment and even if it&#39;s just for</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.270" end="00:23:40.640" style="s2">a moment</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.840" end="00:23:42.950" style="s2">they understand that whether or not they</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.640" end="00:23:45.020" style="s2">share the same political opinions is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.950" end="00:23:46.760" style="s2">really what is meaningful in that moment</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.020" end="00:23:48.680" style="s2">right so that would never really be a</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.760" end="00:23:49.790" style="s2">thing to come up or it would it</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.680" end="00:23:53.330" style="s2">certainly wouldn&#39;t be the first thing to</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.790" end="00:23:55.490" style="s2">come up it would be this this attempt at</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.330" end="00:23:56.900" style="s2">connection period and so what is it</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.490" end="00:24:00.440" style="s2">about the generation of the music</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.900" end="00:24:02.480" style="s2">happening with the DJ that conjures up</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.440" end="00:24:05.690" style="s2">and how can you take that bottle that</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.480" end="00:24:07.370" style="s2">and then put it into a landscape like</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.690" end="00:24:10.070" style="s2">Twitter for example or is it even</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.370" end="00:24:10.610" style="s2">possible to do that alright that&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.070" end="00:24:12.770" style="s2">amazing</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.610" end="00:24:14.300" style="s2">so I think you&#39;re being even a little</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.770" end="00:24:16.370" style="s2">cautious and talking of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.300" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">proposing about two people on a dance</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.370" end="00:24:19.280" style="s2">floor okay as if I if I modeled this</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:22.580" style="s2">based on</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.280" end="00:24:23.960" style="s2">experience of people if two people met</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.580" end="00:24:24.440" style="s2">in the circumstance you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.960" end="00:24:25.790" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.440" end="00:24:27.710" style="s2">and they found themselves on a dance</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.790" end="00:24:28.190" style="s2">floor together and they danced well</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.710" end="00:24:30.770" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.190" end="00:24:32.330" style="s2">yeah which has a whole meaning to it</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.770" end="00:24:34.250" style="s2">whatever that meaning is right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.330" end="00:24:36.830" style="s2">convinced we haven&#39;t unpacked it enough</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.250" end="00:24:39.020" style="s2">okay let&#39;s say two people experienced</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.830" end="00:24:41.660" style="s2">they they groove well together sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.020" end="00:24:44.420" style="s2">right and then they discover that they</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.660" end="00:24:45.800" style="s2">do have some differences difference yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.420" end="00:24:47.660" style="s2">opinion that is supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.800" end="00:24:48.650" style="s2">unbreachable right it totally changes</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.660" end="00:24:52.580" style="s2">the nature that they view that</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.650" end="00:24:54.890" style="s2">difference it heavily not only does it</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.580" end="00:24:56.470" style="s2">predispose them to find you know because</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.890" end="00:24:59.360" style="s2">they have connected in this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.470" end="00:25:00.470" style="s2">mysterious mystical way that dancing</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.360" end="00:25:03.230" style="s2">involves right</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.470" end="00:25:05.030" style="s2">they then a know that there is something</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.230" end="00:25:06.410" style="s2">right that person is not the monster</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.030" end="00:25:08.150" style="s2">connected to them you&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.410" end="00:25:09.830" style="s2">connected in some deep way yeah so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.150" end="00:25:13.160" style="s2">could find your way back there yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.830" end="00:25:15.140" style="s2">you have an incentive to figure out well</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.160" end="00:25:16.970" style="s2">surely that thing that we differ over</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.140" end="00:25:19.010" style="s2">have be the sum total of it because and</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.970" end="00:25:21.170" style="s2">it negates whatever it was implied by</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.010" end="00:25:22.910" style="s2">the dance right and it also it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.170" end="00:25:24.770" style="s2">because otherwise it would indict you</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.910" end="00:25:26.600" style="s2">right it would mean that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.770" end="00:25:28.430" style="s2">would it would mean that you had danced</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.600" end="00:25:31.400" style="s2">with the enemy right I mean that some</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.430" end="00:25:33.980" style="s2">that the enemy shared some aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.400" end="00:25:35.990" style="s2">you had some aspect of you in them and</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.980" end="00:25:38.330" style="s2">vice versa oh I love this so I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.990" end="00:25:40.460" style="s2">this is the stuff that right it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.330" end="00:25:43.310" style="s2">very deep yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.460" end="00:25:46.880" style="s2">well that&#39;s marvelous yeah so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.310" end="00:25:48.290" style="s2">get it to Twitter well so I&#39;m this is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.880" end="00:25:51.430" style="s2">weird week for us to be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.290" end="00:25:55.550" style="s2">this because my life on Twitter which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.430" end="00:25:57.890" style="s2">four years been completely been a</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.550" end="00:25:59.930" style="s2">terrible match for what people say about</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.890" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">the bitterness and rancor and inability</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.930" end="00:26:04.930" style="s2">to discuss things over years Heather and</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:07.310" style="s2">I have both had the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.930" end="00:26:09.350" style="s2">finding most of Twitter pretty</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.310" end="00:26:12.050" style="s2">respectful of us and pretty ready to</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.350" end="00:26:14.810" style="s2">listen ready to you know admit error</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.050" end="00:26:17.690" style="s2">when they say something intemperate and</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.810" end="00:26:21.650" style="s2">then you know this week that&#39;s turned on</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.690" end="00:26:24.770" style="s2">me okay as a result I think mostly or</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.650" end="00:26:28.040" style="s2">entirely of my going too far in</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.770" end="00:26:31.180" style="s2">challenging ah what I called New</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.040" end="00:26:33.050" style="s2">Atheists not realizing that that was a</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.180" end="00:26:35.300" style="s2">heavily charged</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.050" end="00:26:38.360" style="s2">mmm-hmm in any case this is a rough week</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.300" end="00:26:40.970" style="s2">for me on Twitter but but in general</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.360" end="00:26:42.560" style="s2">yeah I do think we all see a different</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.970" end="00:26:44.330" style="s2">Twitter and we don&#39;t necessarily know it</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.560" end="00:26:47.180" style="s2">because there&#39;s only one name for it oh</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.330" end="00:26:49.490" style="s2">right right yeah and so yeah when people</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.180" end="00:26:51.020" style="s2">talk about you know how terrible twitter</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.490" end="00:26:54.170" style="s2">is for discussion I know they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.020" end="00:26:57.230" style="s2">having my experience right all right all</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.170" end="00:26:59.750" style="s2">right so how do we get it there in part</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.230" end="00:27:01.520" style="s2">we&#39;ve got an antagonist we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.750" end="00:27:03.560" style="s2">because we don&#39;t know what role the AG</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.520" end="00:27:06.200" style="s2">algorithms are playing you search</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.560" end="00:27:14.420" style="s2">Twitter we see okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.200" end="00:27:17.480" style="s2">but I think there&#39;s something about my</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.420" end="00:27:19.010" style="s2">experience has been that figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.480" end="00:27:20.600" style="s2">how to bridge gaps you&#39;re not supposed</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.010" end="00:27:23.360" style="s2">to be able to bridge is actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.600" end="00:27:25.490" style="s2">addictive and I regarded as a positive</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.360" end="00:27:29.150" style="s2">addiction okay all right it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.490" end="00:27:31.910" style="s2">addicted to making music or okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.150" end="00:27:34.340" style="s2">and so in some sense I think the answer</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.910" end="00:27:36.590" style="s2">to your question must be that if you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.340" end="00:27:38.840" style="s2">just simply get people where they have</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.590" end="00:27:40.850" style="s2">the experience of making a connection</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.840" end="00:27:42.710" style="s2">with somebody they&#39;re not supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.850" end="00:27:45.130" style="s2">like and that connection being rewarding</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.710" end="00:27:47.390" style="s2">then it&#39;s almost self catalyzing I see</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.130" end="00:27:49.910" style="s2">do you think that has happened in real</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.390" end="00:27:53.030" style="s2">life though and not on online because</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.910" end="00:27:54.650" style="s2">but like I would I it&#39;s actually I would</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.030" end="00:27:57.230" style="s2">argue it would have to happen in real</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.650" end="00:27:59.360" style="s2">life otherwise it doesn&#39;t work and I can</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.230" end="00:28:01.730" style="s2">have psychologic has to translate to</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.360" end="00:28:05.380" style="s2">real that&#39;s a translator life okay but</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.730" end="00:28:09.380" style="s2">it could happen on Twitter first okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.380" end="00:28:11.150" style="s2">yeah so maybe like seeing a video where</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.380" end="00:28:13.750" style="s2">that happened and then it triggered some</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.150" end="00:28:15.980" style="s2">emotion in them that was very pleasing</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.750" end="00:28:18.050" style="s2">well I mean I think you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.980" end="00:28:20.360" style="s2">these videos I&#39;ve forgotten the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.050" end="00:28:23.360" style="s2">gentleman&#39;s name but this black guy who</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.360" end="00:28:26.060" style="s2">decided to go and talk to Klan members</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.360" end="00:28:29.480" style="s2">Oh Darryl Davis early yeah yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.060" end="00:28:31.490" style="s2">we teach him in creeks Oh perfect sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.480" end="00:28:33.020" style="s2">to it so I must say on the one hand I</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.490" end="00:28:34.160" style="s2">totally relate to what he&#39;s up to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.020" end="00:28:36.080" style="s2">think you know that thing I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.160" end="00:28:38.870" style="s2">about where yeah I feel the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.080" end="00:28:41.840" style="s2">yeah I can imagine that he feels that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.870" end="00:28:43.490" style="s2">yeah feels that challenge you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.840" end="00:28:45.050" style="s2">obviously extremely bold to do it right</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.490" end="00:28:46.429" style="s2">in the way that he does but I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.050" end="00:28:49.249" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.429" end="00:28:51.769" style="s2">for almost all of us yeah you got to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.249" end="00:28:55.100" style="s2">really cold yeah not to look at what</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.769" end="00:28:57.649" style="s2">he&#39;s done and feel like a warm sense of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.100" end="00:29:00.139" style="s2">shared humanity over what he&#39;s able to</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.649" end="00:29:03.499" style="s2">do and in fact even just seeing him on</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.139" end="00:29:07.129" style="s2">screen with former Klan members yeah who</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.499" end="00:29:09.200" style="s2">he&#39;s brought to their senses is you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.129" end="00:29:14.119" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a feel-good story for the ages</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.200" end="00:29:16.490" style="s2">definitely so it&#39;s got to be modeled</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.119" end="00:29:19.129" style="s2">okay little experiences have to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.490" end="00:29:21.019" style="s2">available to people um you know and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.129" end="00:29:23.299" style="s2">got to be small enough steps that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.019" end="00:29:25.970" style="s2">can get there but the key message I</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.299" end="00:29:30.369" style="s2">think for all of us who are good at</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.970" end="00:29:35.029" style="s2">crossing gaps is that in the end it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.369" end="00:29:36.830" style="s2">it&#39;s a richer experience of life so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.029" end="00:29:40.399" style="s2">I think that that is true I think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.830" end="00:29:43.039" style="s2">that last bit is definitely it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.399" end="00:29:46.249" style="s2">the objective and it has to be the goal</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.039" end="00:29:48.110" style="s2">that we measure like this process that</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.249" end="00:29:51.110" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about creating whether</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.110" end="00:29:53.240" style="s2">it&#39;s successful or not but it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.110" end="00:29:58.220" style="s2">that like I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.240" end="00:30:00.470" style="s2">to have deep enriching moments be</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.220" end="00:30:03.559" style="s2">translated on social media because the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.470" end="00:30:06.710" style="s2">nature of deep enriching moments or deep</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.559" end="00:30:10.009" style="s2">deep inverting feeling is such that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.710" end="00:30:12.499" style="s2">don&#39;t think it could happen on a in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.009" end="00:30:18.440" style="s2">landscape like so like it requires real</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.499" end="00:30:20.119" style="s2">life real-world experience all that type</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.440" end="00:30:22.279" style="s2">of process in order that&#39;s happened well</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.119" end="00:30:27.710" style="s2">I hate to go all fractal on you oh I</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.279" end="00:30:30.019" style="s2">lost the argument no you have it here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.710" end="00:30:32.960" style="s2">the thing yeah we are engaged in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.019" end="00:30:34.399" style="s2">conversation sure and you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.960" end="00:30:36.830" style="s2">some people who aren&#39;t gonna like it but</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.399" end="00:30:39.950" style="s2">yeah most people well most people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.830" end="00:30:41.869" style="s2">are just to tell them that we still have</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.950" end="00:30:44.990" style="s2">empathy for them and we care about them</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.869" end="00:30:45.619" style="s2">yes welcome back anytime they come to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.990" end="00:30:49.759" style="s2">their senses</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.619" end="00:30:55.429" style="s2">yes but the thing is we&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.759" end="00:30:56.779" style="s2">sure and it weren&#39;t you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.429" end="00:30:59.269" style="s2">reason that we&#39;re doing this long-form</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.779" end="00:31:00.070" style="s2">rather short form but this will go on</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.269" end="00:31:03.009" style="s2">social</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.070" end="00:31:06.489" style="s2">right yeah my guess is that some number</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.009" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">of people will even if they can&#39;t put</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.489" end="00:31:09.549" style="s2">their finger on what it is that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:11.289" style="s2">experienced they will appear you and me</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.549" end="00:31:13.210" style="s2">talking and they will understand I mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.289" end="00:31:15.970" style="s2">sure you know my experience at Evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.210" end="00:31:18.279" style="s2">was that a lot of people needed to hear</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.970" end="00:31:19.869" style="s2">somebody say what they couldn&#39;t write</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.279" end="00:31:25.299" style="s2">and having heard it</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.869" end="00:31:26.889" style="s2">it&#39;s fractal a synonym for meta no this</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.299" end="00:31:30.600" style="s2">way the very loose sense you could use</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.889" end="00:31:35.739" style="s2">it that way but ok fractal means that</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.600" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">some process is scale independent the</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.739" end="00:31:40.149" style="s2">point is you see you see the same</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.080" end="00:31:42.580" style="s2">process that certainly different scales</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.149" end="00:31:45.700" style="s2">okay so for example the example I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.580" end="00:31:47.679" style="s2">heard people use that simplest is if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.700" end="00:31:49.960" style="s2">were descending on the lunar lander onto</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.679" end="00:31:51.849" style="s2">the surface of the Moon and you saw a</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.960" end="00:31:53.320" style="s2">crater you couldn&#39;t tell how far away</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.849" end="00:31:56.019" style="s2">from the moon you were because there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.320" end="00:31:57.999" style="s2">craters at every size and so right right</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.019" end="00:32:00.099" style="s2">you know the distribution of the craters</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.999" end="00:32:03.849" style="s2">is okay fractal so all I&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.099" end="00:32:07.119" style="s2">that the the process that happens inside</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.849" end="00:32:10.090" style="s2">of you know a particularly delightful</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.119" end="00:32:11.769" style="s2">exchange of one-sentence also happens at</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.090" end="00:32:14.200" style="s2">the level of an hour or two hours</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.769" end="00:32:16.330" style="s2">inverse a ssin okay the level of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.200" end="00:32:17.289" style="s2">that&#39;s fair college class actually yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.330" end="00:32:20.409" style="s2">that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.289" end="00:32:24.309" style="s2">my entire startup it&#39;s promised upon</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.409" end="00:32:30.369" style="s2">this working because it argues that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.309" end="00:32:31.809" style="s2">can sort of you can gain those deep</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.369" end="00:32:34.690" style="s2">enriching moments by consuming pop</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.809" end="00:32:37.989" style="s2">culture which usually happens through a</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.690" end="00:32:39.489" style="s2">medium and not necessarily in in person</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.989" end="00:32:40.989" style="s2">meaning you go to the movie theater to</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.489" end="00:32:42.999" style="s2">watch a movie and you experience this</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.989" end="00:32:44.470" style="s2">you read a book and you experience this</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.999" end="00:32:47.200" style="s2">you listen to a song and you experience</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.470" end="00:32:48.820" style="s2">this so there is some medium that people</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.200" end="00:32:51.580" style="s2">are consuming and they&#39;re still feeling</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.820" end="00:32:55.090" style="s2">that larger experience so I guess that</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.580" end="00:32:58.330" style="s2">makes sense yeah so I think we&#39;re caught</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.090" end="00:33:01.299" style="s2">in a funny place okay pop culture okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.330" end="00:33:04.779" style="s2">um and I realize you know you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.299" end="00:33:07.690" style="s2">pop culture to great effect and even if</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.779" end="00:33:09.159" style="s2">most of pop culture were worthless it</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.690" end="00:33:11.679" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t mean that there wasn&#39;t enough</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.159" end="00:33:12.640" style="s2">of value to be mined there to spend a</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.679" end="00:33:15.010" style="s2">lifetime doing what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.640" end="00:33:17.110" style="s2">so there&#39;s no indictment here from me of</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.010" end="00:33:19.870" style="s2">what you&#39;re up to but I do have the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.110" end="00:33:23.680" style="s2">sense that pop culture works for what</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.870" end="00:33:27.010" style="s2">you&#39;re doing because we are wired for</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.680" end="00:33:29.290" style="s2">certain truths and therefore when those</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.010" end="00:33:31.300" style="s2">truths are uttered by somebody appealing</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.290" end="00:33:33.220" style="s2">in the public sphere</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.300" end="00:33:35.620" style="s2">lots of people gravitate to it so it</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.220" end="00:33:38.380" style="s2">generates wealth yes that causes it to</p>

<p begin="00:33:38.380" end="00:33:42.700" style="s2">which the resonant message is you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.720" end="00:33:45.040" style="s2">the record companies are a parasite on</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.700" end="00:33:48.040" style="s2">the exchange of relevant messages</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.040" end="00:33:50.050" style="s2">between people who feel them and those</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.040" end="00:33:52.330" style="s2">who are listening right on the other</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.050" end="00:33:54.310" style="s2">hand the market obviously distorts that</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.330" end="00:33:55.720" style="s2">relationship to it&#39;ll tell you what you</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.310" end="00:33:58.900" style="s2">want to hear rather than what you need</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.720" end="00:34:02.740" style="s2">to know sure and that&#39;s very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.900" end="00:34:05.110" style="s2">so for the moment I don&#39;t know where we</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.740" end="00:34:08.070" style="s2">are but you know it&#39;s it&#39;s so far it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.110" end="00:34:12.730" style="s2">impossible to get a computer to generate</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.070" end="00:34:16.179" style="s2">really compelling it can probably</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.730" end="00:34:17.380" style="s2">generate music that mirrors something</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.179" end="00:34:18.780" style="s2">that&#39;s already been produced but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.380" end="00:34:21.220" style="s2">hard for it to produce something</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.780" end="00:34:22.720" style="s2">creative novel and compelling at least</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.220" end="00:34:24.909" style="s2">at the level of lyrics so it would</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.720" end="00:34:27.130" style="s2">generate what&#39;s on the top 100 today</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.909" end="00:34:29.620" style="s2">right you could generate some slightly</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.130" end="00:34:31.659" style="s2">novel sounds exactly like because of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.620" end="00:34:34.030" style="s2">state at the top 100 today yeah rather</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.659" end="00:34:38.530" style="s2">than somebody telling you something deep</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.030" end="00:34:40.390" style="s2">right but you know so let&#39;s let&#39;s take a</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.530" end="00:34:41.350" style="s2">favorite example for people of my</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.390" end="00:34:44.110" style="s2">generation okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.350" end="00:34:45.909" style="s2">the matrix okay yeah perfect for this</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.110" end="00:34:50.110" style="s2">conversation perfect for this guy well</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.909" end="00:34:52.390" style="s2">the matrix is in effect planos cave yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.110" end="00:34:55.419" style="s2">right it&#39;s a very ancient yeah right you</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.390" end="00:34:57.340" style="s2">know it&#39;s Plato&#39;s cave and it was wildly</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.419" end="00:34:58.810" style="s2">successful because the production values</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.340" end="00:35:01.810" style="s2">were super high and the story was</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.810" end="00:35:06.820" style="s2">compelling and the modern twist wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.810" end="00:35:09.670" style="s2">superficial so in the sense you know a</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.820" end="00:35:11.650" style="s2">lot of people who had no relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.670" end="00:35:14.410" style="s2">Plato&#39;s cave wouldn&#39;t know what Plato&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.650" end="00:35:16.120" style="s2">cave was or people who did know what it</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.410" end="00:35:17.620" style="s2">was but didn&#39;t have a particularly deep</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.120" end="00:35:19.660" style="s2">relationship with the stories it</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.620" end="00:35:22.120" style="s2">suddenly had that story react sure our</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.660" end="00:35:24.910" style="s2">experience by this very vivid you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.120" end="00:35:26.030" style="s2">presentation of it and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.910" end="00:35:29.030" style="s2">important I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.030" end="00:35:31.340" style="s2">personally feel like Plato&#39;s cave is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.030" end="00:35:33.950" style="s2">very deep story because this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.340" end="00:35:36.110" style="s2">deep vulnerability for human beings the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.950" end="00:35:38.360" style="s2">fact that you know the the person who</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.110" end="00:35:40.330" style="s2">escapes Plato&#39;s cave gets killed upon</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.360" end="00:35:43.220" style="s2">re-entering and trying to know the truth</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.330" end="00:35:44.990" style="s2">Wow does that one hit home yeah what are</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.220" end="00:35:49.220" style="s2">the implications of that in your opinion</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.990" end="00:35:52.760" style="s2">well the implications of that are a the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.220" end="00:35:55.190" style="s2">idea that you can simply speak truth to</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.760" end="00:35:59.630" style="s2">power or the truth will out or any of</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.190" end="00:36:03.320" style="s2">these things is it&#39;s a naive fiction</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.630" end="00:36:05.210" style="s2">okay those who wish to unearth deep</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.320" end="00:36:08.110" style="s2">truths should understand what business</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.210" end="00:36:11.840" style="s2">they&#39;ve gotten involved in okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.110" end="00:36:14.390" style="s2">interesting but anyway I&#39;ve sidetracked</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.840" end="00:36:16.670" style="s2">us here this is all sidetracking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.390" end="00:36:20.630" style="s2">great that we can find out where that</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.670" end="00:36:23.360" style="s2">way oh no that&#39;s interesting trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.630" end="00:36:26.030" style="s2">see if I could see we were saying I</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.360" end="00:36:28.940" style="s2">could also see the opposite though being</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.030" end="00:36:31.760" style="s2">the case I&#39;m sure it is sometimes but</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.940" end="00:36:33.590" style="s2">yeah anyway meaning well when I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.760" end="00:36:35.930" style="s2">about what you said I think about you</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.590" end="00:36:38.900" style="s2">know the challenge to dr. King quoting</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.930" end="00:36:42.410" style="s2">William Cullen Bryant like the dark</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.900" end="00:36:42.920" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s the quote the about the</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.410" end="00:37:01.490" style="s2">universe</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.920" end="00:37:03.920" style="s2">no the arc of the moral universe annul</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.490" end="00:37:07.760" style="s2">t&#39;me is that these are competing forces</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.920" end="00:37:10.070" style="s2">sure what what Star Wars II yep well</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.760" end="00:37:13.880" style="s2">very Star Wars is very biblical yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.070" end="00:37:17.150" style="s2">yeah and but the I think the the point</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.880" end="00:37:19.340" style="s2">about the devastating thing about Martin</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.150" end="00:37:22.730" style="s2">Luther King Junior&#39;s invocation of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.340" end="00:37:25.430" style="s2">arc of the moral universe yes is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.730" end="00:37:30.020" style="s2">first part that is LARC of the moral</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.430" end="00:37:32.150" style="s2">ours is long and he&#39;s telling you is you</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.020" end="00:37:34.640" style="s2">might have to wait a very long time to</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.150" end="00:37:35.990" style="s2">see it bend towards just yes that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.640" end="00:37:38.750" style="s2">that&#39;s a devastating</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.990" end="00:37:39.500" style="s2">revelation yes well I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.750" end="00:37:42.230" style="s2">devastating</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.500" end="00:37:43.760" style="s2">I&#39;d say it&#39;s daunting I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.230" end="00:37:45.650" style="s2">necessarily use it war devastating I</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.760" end="00:37:47.570" style="s2">think is devastating to an individual</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.650" end="00:37:50.960" style="s2">because the point is you live in an era</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.570" end="00:37:53.390" style="s2">that&#39;s just brutal and that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.960" end="00:37:55.130" style="s2">comfort as an individual to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.390" end="00:37:58.580" style="s2">that eventually what was that things</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.130" end="00:38:00.170" style="s2">will get better fixed right um on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.580" end="00:38:03.050" style="s2">other hand at the lineage level that</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.170" end="00:38:05.090" style="s2">that&#39;s important and it is reassuring to</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.050" end="00:38:06.920" style="s2">know that even if you never escaped a</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.090" end="00:38:08.750" style="s2">particular injustice that your kids or</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.920" end="00:38:10.490" style="s2">your grandkids might see it reversed</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.750" end="00:38:11.900" style="s2">right but they might not according to</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.490" end="00:38:15.050" style="s2">your interpretation of the implication</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.900" end="00:38:16.730" style="s2">of Plato&#39;s cave so well let&#39;s put it</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.050" end="00:38:18.619" style="s2">this way I know Plato&#39;s cave is right</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.730" end="00:38:23.450" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen that one</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.619" end="00:38:27.140" style="s2">I hope dr. King was right yes and that</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.450" end="00:38:30.380" style="s2">in the end Plato&#39;s cave doesn&#39;t win okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.140" end="00:38:32.780" style="s2">right sure in the end the revelation of</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.380" end="00:38:34.790" style="s2">what&#39;s outside the cave right can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.780" end="00:38:38.180" style="s2">stopped because it is in fact true but</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.790" end="00:38:39.859" style="s2">but to be fair play the Plato&#39;s cave</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.180" end="00:38:41.780" style="s2">ends at a certain point meaning we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.859" end="00:38:43.430" style="s2">see what happens afterwards it could&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.780" end="00:38:45.260" style="s2">very well have been that this person</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.430" end="00:38:46.940" style="s2">could have affected let&#39;s type that be</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.260" end="00:38:49.010" style="s2">hypothetical for a moment some people</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.940" end="00:38:50.869" style="s2">outside of that cave who saw his great</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.010" end="00:38:54.380" style="s2">courage and valor and decided to follow</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.869" end="00:38:56.510" style="s2">suit absolutely right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.380" end="00:38:59.359" style="s2">interesting like to note where the book</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.510" end="00:39:01.160" style="s2">ends and what the implication of that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.359" end="00:39:04.490" style="s2">on society I would say that I do think</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.160" end="00:39:06.140" style="s2">that um I do think that dr. King&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.490" end="00:39:08.359" style="s2">vision would ultimately win out though</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.140" end="00:39:14.150" style="s2">just because the very fact that Plato</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.359" end="00:39:16.490" style="s2">wrote that book would suggest a toying</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.150" end="00:39:18.080" style="s2">with the notion of these concepts of</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.490" end="00:39:19.910" style="s2">freedom and liberty and equality and</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.080" end="00:39:21.410" style="s2">speaking truth to power like in writing</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.910" end="00:39:22.970" style="s2">that he is writing a book about speaking</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.410" end="00:39:24.980" style="s2">truth to power even if the person fails</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.970" end="00:39:26.570" style="s2">in the end so very idea speaking truth</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.980" end="00:39:28.089" style="s2">the power that becomes invented in that</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.570" end="00:39:31.280" style="s2">moment and that in and of itself is</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.089" end="00:39:36.619" style="s2">bending toward justice well I agree and</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.280" end="00:39:40.970" style="s2">I not only hope that dr. King was right</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.619" end="00:39:42.830" style="s2">yeah but at some level if he&#39;s not right</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.970" end="00:39:44.240" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what there is I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.830" end="00:39:45.560" style="s2">know what the point of right size is</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.240" end="00:39:47.599" style="s2">right right</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.560" end="00:39:50.330" style="s2">yeah he is right then the point is well</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.599" end="00:39:52.160" style="s2">all right we all get dealt a hand and we</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.330" end="00:39:52.610" style="s2">have to play it sure and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.160" end="00:39:55.970" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.610" end="00:39:58.070" style="s2">better than others but but at least</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.970" end="00:40:02.960" style="s2">we&#39;re headed in a direction of</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.070" end="00:40:08.150" style="s2">improvement yes so actually if I might I</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.960" end="00:40:11.180" style="s2">my grandfather was quite old in his in</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.150" end="00:40:14.240" style="s2">his 80s okay we started keeping accounts</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.180" end="00:40:15.290" style="s2">current okay that he was very clear on</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.240" end="00:40:16.790" style="s2">the fact that he wasn&#39;t gonna live</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.290" end="00:40:18.290" style="s2">forever and that meant that we should</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.790" end="00:40:20.570" style="s2">probably say what needed to be said</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.290" end="00:40:22.130" style="s2">mm-hmm before I was too late sure which</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.570" end="00:40:24.140" style="s2">was very uncomfortable at first and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.130" end="00:40:25.190" style="s2">it became very normal and I recommend it</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.140" end="00:40:26.810" style="s2">to everyone okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.190" end="00:40:28.940" style="s2">there&#39;s somebody you care about yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.810" end="00:40:32.990" style="s2">because they won&#39;t be around forever but</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.940" end="00:40:34.760" style="s2">at some point I asked him he had in my</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.990" end="00:40:38.120" style="s2">whole experience of him he had railed</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.760" end="00:40:39.950" style="s2">against the injustice of the system and</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.120" end="00:40:42.710" style="s2">the brokenness all of the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.950" end="00:40:45.890" style="s2">did wrong that were relatively</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.710" end="00:40:48.740" style="s2">transparent mm-hmm and I asked him if</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.890" end="00:40:50.420" style="s2">there was a period in time that he would</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.740" end="00:40:52.040" style="s2">like to go back to in his life rather</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.420" end="00:40:53.210" style="s2">than live in the present given how much</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.040" end="00:40:56.330" style="s2">he saw was wrong with it and he</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.210" end="00:40:58.760" style="s2">surprised me he said absolutely not yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.330" end="00:41:00.650" style="s2">and I said I&#39;m shocked you completely</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.760" end="00:41:05.690" style="s2">know much about the way things are yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.650" end="00:41:08.630" style="s2">and he says you have no idea about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.690" end="00:41:11.450" style="s2">profound ignorance of the past mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.630" end="00:41:14.360" style="s2">right and I was just you know I stopped</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.450" end="00:41:17.030" style="s2">in my tracks as I hadn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.360" end="00:41:18.680" style="s2">understood he was impatient for things</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.030" end="00:41:22.370" style="s2">to get better right that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.680" end="00:41:24.470" style="s2">complaining was but he had no illusions</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.370" end="00:41:26.960" style="s2">about where we had come from right and</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.470" end="00:41:28.970" style="s2">that enlightenment was frustratingly</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.960" end="00:41:31.790" style="s2">slow and it moves and fits and starts</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.970" end="00:41:35.540" style="s2">it can even go backwards but in general</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.790" end="00:41:38.480" style="s2">we are much clearer headed than we were</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.540" end="00:41:40.520" style="s2">mm-hmm reminds me of dr. King&#39;s last</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.480" end="00:41:43.940" style="s2">speech where he says sort of in a very</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.520" end="00:41:48.320" style="s2">like gospel way he basically paints this</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.940" end="00:41:51.710" style="s2">picture of his creator asking him if he</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.320" end="00:41:53.090" style="s2">could choose to be in any era where</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.710" end="00:41:54.650" style="s2">would it be and then he goes sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.090" end="00:41:56.360" style="s2">like this these biblical narratives of</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.650" end="00:41:58.880" style="s2">like the children in Israel and he would</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.360" end="00:42:00.500" style="s2">not stop there and I think he actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.880" end="00:42:01.550" style="s2">mentions Plato and Socrates and he said</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.500" end="00:42:03.650" style="s2">I would not stop there and he goes</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.550" end="00:42:06.560" style="s2">through Athens and he goes to Greece and</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.650" end="00:42:08.900" style="s2">he goes to I think certain time</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.560" end="00:42:11.870" style="s2">in America&#39;s early history and then he</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.900" end="00:42:13.730" style="s2">finally says that he would pick the here</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.870" end="00:42:15.800" style="s2">and now to be in and it&#39;s like actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.730" end="00:42:16.850" style="s2">a very beautiful speech and if your</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.800" end="00:42:19.550" style="s2">viewers haven&#39;t seen it I highly</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.850" end="00:42:21.680" style="s2">recommend they do but yeah it&#39;s like and</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.550" end="00:42:23.900" style="s2">if you know if you don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.680" end="00:42:26.150" style="s2">ignorance of the past then you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.900" end="00:42:27.920" style="s2">likely to be able to recognize that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.150" end="00:42:30.470" style="s2">actually have made progress like</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.920" end="00:42:32.390" style="s2">relatively speaking right and so so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.470" end="00:42:34.640" style="s2">you&#39;ll be impatient but you&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.390" end="00:42:36.650" style="s2">be more imbued with that same spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.640" end="00:42:40.520" style="s2">it&#39;s long but it&#39;s obviously bending</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.650" end="00:42:43.220" style="s2">because look where we were before yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.520" end="00:42:46.070" style="s2">I think that&#39;s absolutely right and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.220" end="00:42:47.810" style="s2">almost wonder in your retelling that if</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.070" end="00:42:49.850" style="s2">my grandfather was not in some way</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.810" end="00:42:51.410" style="s2">referencing consciously or not yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.850" end="00:42:57.230" style="s2">you&#39;re right it&#39;s yeah yeah it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.410" end="00:42:59.720" style="s2">same point that&#39;s cool yeah so I I must</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.230" end="00:43:04.340" style="s2">say I personally fear that although I</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.720" end="00:43:08.090" style="s2">think dr. King was right and it gives me</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.340" end="00:43:09.770" style="s2">hope I fear that there&#39;s a pattern in</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.090" end="00:43:11.840" style="s2">human behavior I&#39;ve written about it</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.770" end="00:43:16.220" style="s2">actually scientifically many years ago</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.840" end="00:43:19.160" style="s2">but I fear that there&#39;s a basically a</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.220" end="00:43:22.130" style="s2">flip-flop okay between how human beings</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.160" end="00:43:24.620" style="s2">behave in times of growth times of</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.130" end="00:43:27.230" style="s2">Plenty and how human beings behave in</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.620" end="00:43:29.720" style="s2">times of contraction of economic</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.230" end="00:43:32.330" style="s2">contraction or its equivalent and that</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.720" end="00:43:34.550" style="s2">in fact the arc of history or the arc of</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.330" end="00:43:37.010" style="s2">the moral universe may be long and bend</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.550" end="00:43:39.770" style="s2">towards justice but that it actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.010" end="00:43:44.290" style="s2">flips back and forth rather violently</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.770" end="00:43:47.480" style="s2">and this actually raises another</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.290" end="00:43:49.610" style="s2">interest of yours which will surprise my</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.480" end="00:43:51.740" style="s2">viewers who don&#39;t know you and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.610" end="00:43:53.600" style="s2">surprised those who have heard you speak</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.740" end="00:43:56.990" style="s2">elsewhere but you have a very deep</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.600" end="00:44:00.440" style="s2">relationship with Judaism yes and</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.990" end="00:44:00.830" style="s2">anti-semitism yes and in writing it</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.440" end="00:44:03.350" style="s2">folks</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.830" end="00:44:06.080" style="s2">yes absolutely oh right it was I unclear</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.350" end="00:44:09.770" style="s2">about that oh man that&#39;s terrible</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.080" end="00:44:11.120" style="s2">so why don&#39;t you just tell us where that</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.770" end="00:44:12.620" style="s2">relationship comes from and what it</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.120" end="00:44:14.390" style="s2">means to you and then we can go for</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.620" end="00:44:16.880" style="s2">there and okay draw the connection I was</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.390" end="00:44:19.310" style="s2">headed for sure so I was born and raised</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.880" end="00:44:20.539" style="s2">in a very atypical Christian family grew</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.310" end="00:44:23.479" style="s2">up in a Christian family</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.539" end="00:44:25.969" style="s2">observe things like Shabbat and</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.479" end="00:44:28.519" style="s2">kosher-style and all the holy days from</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.969" end="00:44:31.549" style="s2">our show notes yom kippur very similar</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.519" end="00:44:34.459" style="s2">to seven-day business but that naturally</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.549" end="00:44:35.839" style="s2">allowed the development or created the</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.459" end="00:44:38.479" style="s2">development of an affinity for Judaism</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.839" end="00:44:40.809" style="s2">because that was the closest community</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.479" end="00:44:45.019" style="s2">that did the same thing as me basically</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.809" end="00:44:47.150" style="s2">and so you know in high school I joined</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.019" end="00:44:48.739" style="s2">the Hebrew culture club I read books by</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.150" end="00:44:50.719" style="s2">Leon URIs which were all about three</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.739" end="00:44:52.819" style="s2">establishment of the State of Israel</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.719" end="00:44:55.279" style="s2">initially majored in film in college but</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.819" end="00:44:57.499" style="s2">then switched to International Studies</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.279" end="00:45:00.019" style="s2">because anti-semitism was resurfacing in</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.499" end="00:45:03.199" style="s2">Europe at the time this isn&#39;t like 2012</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.019" end="00:45:05.479" style="s2">and then after that I started a student</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.199" end="00:45:07.910" style="s2">pro-israel Club at the University of New</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.479" end="00:45:10.219" style="s2">Orleans and did it so advocacy for three</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.910" end="00:45:14.269" style="s2">and a half years and then after that</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.219" end="00:45:18.529" style="s2">works for two years in the Israel space</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.269" end="00:45:22.489" style="s2">Israel nonprofit space interesting so so</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.529" end="00:45:24.799" style="s2">many things far be it for me to define</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.489" end="00:45:26.779" style="s2">you in any way but I just try to</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.799" end="00:45:31.189" style="s2">understand okay you&#39;re not Jewish now</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.779" end="00:45:34.969" style="s2">but you have a deep cultural affinity</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.189" end="00:45:38.959" style="s2">for is what is it is it the Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.969" end="00:45:39.619" style="s2">religion is it its people or what kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.959" end="00:45:40.999" style="s2">of all of it</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.619" end="00:45:43.759" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t know if a catch-all</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.999" end="00:45:45.650" style="s2">term but I guess it&#39;s culture I guess</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.759" end="00:45:46.819" style="s2">culture is a word that would carry all</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.650" end="00:45:47.239" style="s2">of that what could hold all of those</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.819" end="00:45:50.409" style="s2">terms</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.239" end="00:45:53.929" style="s2">so I&#39;d say culture okay very broadly</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.409" end="00:45:56.929" style="s2">speaking very broadly speaking yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.929" end="00:46:00.919" style="s2">well I find this fascinating I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.929" end="00:46:03.049" style="s2">obviously Jewish um I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.919" end="00:46:06.769" style="s2">particularly deep relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.049" end="00:46:09.019" style="s2">religion I have I what I think is a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.769" end="00:46:12.890" style="s2">deep relationship with the culture of</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.019" end="00:46:17.029" style="s2">the Diaspora okay but anyway you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.890" end="00:46:18.739" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m not observant sure and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.029" end="00:46:23.659" style="s2">anyway I have I have a kind of distance</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.739" end="00:46:25.159" style="s2">from Judaism that happened I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.659" end="00:46:27.199" style="s2">choose it it comes as sort of is where I</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.159" end="00:46:31.489" style="s2">ended up but it&#39;s very interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.199" end="00:46:34.340" style="s2">hear somebody from the outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.489" end="00:46:38.060" style="s2">population who finds an affinity</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.340" end="00:46:39.350" style="s2">for the style of thinking or something</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.060" end="00:46:44.570" style="s2">about it and it you know raises all</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.350" end="00:46:46.340" style="s2">kinds of questions for me about well the</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.570" end="00:46:50.930" style="s2">connection I was going to draw that sent</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.340" end="00:46:53.450" style="s2">us down this road was Jews are a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.930" end="00:46:56.570" style="s2">an odd phenomenon okay you tend to exist</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.450" end="00:46:59.030" style="s2">at low density okay you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.570" end="00:47:00.950" style="s2">diaspora sure if you asked me as an</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.030" end="00:47:03.350" style="s2">evolutionary biologist how likely is</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.950" end="00:47:05.030" style="s2">that to work as a long-term strategy for</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.350" end="00:47:07.400" style="s2">persisting on earth I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.030" end="00:47:08.630" style="s2">chances are almost zero okay all right</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.400" end="00:47:11.360" style="s2">it&#39;s too dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.630" end="00:47:13.190" style="s2">sure right the fact is having a majority</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.360" end="00:47:17.270" style="s2">population that can always turn on you</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.190" end="00:47:20.060" style="s2">sure is it&#39;s a tremendous hazard that</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.270" end="00:47:22.460" style="s2">looms always and the boom-and-bust cycle</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.060" end="00:47:25.370" style="s2">issue that I was talking about basically</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.460" end="00:47:27.770" style="s2">I think like in plenty and in scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.370" end="00:47:31.000" style="s2">right the society you know plenty it may</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.770" end="00:47:34.010" style="s2">be the Jews are tolerated but as things</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.000" end="00:47:36.110" style="s2">turned towards austerity anti-semitism</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.010" end="00:47:38.300" style="s2">rises again and the amazing thing is</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.110" end="00:47:40.250" style="s2">that Jews have persisted for the long</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.300" end="00:47:46.040" style="s2">period of time that they have and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.250" end="00:47:49.040" style="s2">think these that fact and the high level</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.040" end="00:47:51.890" style="s2">of success the Jews have experienced and</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.040" end="00:47:52.400" style="s2">things like advancing science at cetera</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.890" end="00:47:55.550" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.400" end="00:48:01.430" style="s2">I suspect they are coupled okay that in</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.550" end="00:48:03.350" style="s2">effect Jews I hate the idea of it shows</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.430" end="00:48:07.270" style="s2">and people okay I think it&#39;s time that</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.350" end="00:48:10.160" style="s2">humans got over that idea sure but just</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.270" end="00:48:13.690" style="s2">for your stuff so your viewers no no no</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.160" end="00:48:13.690" style="s2">that won&#39;t happen the arc of the moral</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.900" end="00:48:19.730" style="s2">I don&#39;t like the idea of chosen people</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.760" end="00:48:21.410" style="s2">because I find it there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.730" end="00:48:24.140" style="s2">wrong with the idea that if there was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.410" end="00:48:26.200" style="s2">creator created some people he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.140" end="00:48:28.400" style="s2">choose Christo I don&#39;t Barbra I</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.200" end="00:48:30.860" style="s2">understand your objection to it and a</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.400" end="00:48:32.720" style="s2">little from literal sense yeah but if</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.860" end="00:48:34.610" style="s2">you were looking at impress on a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.720" end="00:48:36.170" style="s2">psychological level it could be the case</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.610" end="00:48:37.700" style="s2">that it&#39;s important to have a chosen</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.170" end="00:48:39.230" style="s2">people because then other people will</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.700" end="00:48:41.870" style="s2">think that it is possible that they too</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.230" end="00:48:44.270" style="s2">could be chosen well first of all I</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.870" end="00:48:47.030" style="s2">should just say I&#39;m not a I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.270" end="00:48:47.900" style="s2">believer in the supernatural sure so in</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.030" end="00:48:49.550" style="s2">a sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.900" end="00:48:51.590" style="s2">even thinking about it as a literal</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.550" end="00:48:55.310" style="s2">matter I don&#39;t even know what to do with</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.590" end="00:49:00.500" style="s2">it okay but my sense is that we are</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.310" end="00:49:02.480" style="s2">better off considering this is probably</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.500" end="00:49:06.740" style="s2">also uncomfortable because declaring any</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.480" end="00:49:09.530" style="s2">thing about any racial group special</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.740" end="00:49:12.800" style="s2">sure especially if it&#39;s one you belong</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.530" end="00:49:15.140" style="s2">to sure have some problems it smacks of</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.800" end="00:49:17.300" style="s2">arrogance or hubris or something but</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.140" end="00:49:19.580" style="s2">anyway my point would be maybe not the</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.300" end="00:49:23.960" style="s2">chosen people but maybe the anti fragile</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.580" end="00:49:33.230" style="s2">people and that means that basically the</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.960" end="00:49:37.030" style="s2">amount of hazard per era mm-hmm that</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.230" end="00:49:39.530" style="s2">Jews have faced has created a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.030" end="00:49:42.080" style="s2">ability to survive in all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.530" end="00:49:44.060" style="s2">extreme circumstances what has not</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.080" end="00:49:49.550" style="s2">killed us has made us stronger in a way</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.060" end="00:49:54.260" style="s2">now personally yes I suspect that what</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.550" end="00:49:57.410" style="s2">is special is transmitted culturally</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.260" end="00:50:00.470" style="s2">sure and therefore to the extent it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.410" end="00:50:05.570" style="s2">valuable it can be democratized sure I</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.470" end="00:50:08.390" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that&#39;s right but okay I</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.570" end="00:50:09.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know okay as far as I know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.390" end="00:50:12.530" style="s2">wait what was the lesson use that to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.920" end="00:50:14.930" style="s2">extent that it is culture it can be</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.530" end="00:50:16.880" style="s2">democratized yeah right well I have it</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.930" end="00:50:20.450" style="s2">this way if it was genetic right right</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.880" end="00:50:23.120" style="s2">if the fact of many trials and</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.450" end="00:50:24.500" style="s2">tribulations had created special genes</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.120" end="00:50:27.770" style="s2">sure there&#39;d be nothing you could do</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.500" end="00:50:30.590" style="s2">about it other than I see breed them out</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.770" end="00:50:32.300" style="s2">as I mean breed them out into the other</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.590" end="00:50:34.060" style="s2">population but that doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.300" end="00:50:36.230" style="s2">mean that culture can be democratized</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.060" end="00:50:41.660" style="s2">well this ultra can be Democritus</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.230" end="00:50:45.230" style="s2">because and in fact you&#39;re the proof no</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.660" end="00:50:46.850" style="s2">but I&#39;m an anomaly well and you were</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.230" end="00:50:49.750" style="s2">this is a totally uncontrolled</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.850" end="00:50:51.890" style="s2">experiment in a sense that you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.750" end="00:50:53.810" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing there&#39;s nothing about</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.890" end="00:50:55.580" style="s2">this that is controlled I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.810" end="00:51:00.380" style="s2">everybody is idiosyncratic sure</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.580" end="00:51:03.030" style="s2">including you but the point is you</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.380" end="00:51:07.260" style="s2">Judaism is not a recruiting religion</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.030" end="00:51:09.180" style="s2">right it does not seek converts right</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.260" end="00:51:12.120" style="s2">in fact it sort of looks askance at</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.180" end="00:51:13.770" style="s2">people who wish to join sure but it</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.120" end="00:51:21.860" style="s2">allows it yes um</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.770" end="00:51:26.760" style="s2">and you have taken an interest in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.860" end="00:51:28.890" style="s2">culture yes and have absorbed the</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.760" end="00:51:31.140" style="s2">meaning of that culture yes very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.890" end="00:51:32.700" style="s2">sir right so that&#39;s that&#39;s the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.140" end="00:51:33.810" style="s2">of democratizing of culture I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.700" end="00:51:36.660" style="s2">don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the process by which</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.810" end="00:51:41.130" style="s2">that happened it&#39;s really scalable well</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.660" end="00:51:44.190" style="s2">I&#39;m not really because I have pathetical</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.130" end="00:51:45.030" style="s2">so as a college professor when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.190" end="00:51:50.010" style="s2">college professor</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.030" end="00:51:53.460" style="s2">I took the stuff that I had learned at</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.010" end="00:51:55.590" style="s2">the dinner table about how to argue a</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.460" end="00:51:57.870" style="s2">point how to hold other people&#39;s feet to</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.590" end="00:52:00.210" style="s2">the fire how to back off when you</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.870" end="00:52:01.590" style="s2">discovered that you something about your</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.210" end="00:52:08.100" style="s2">thinking is incorrect how to gracefully</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.590" end="00:52:10.200" style="s2">you know grant that fact and I taught</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.100" end="00:52:12.360" style="s2">students to do it irrespective of their</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.200" end="00:52:15.540" style="s2">background sure some part of me felt</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.360" end="00:52:18.240" style="s2">like I was taking things that were very</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.540" end="00:52:20.160" style="s2">common at a Jewish dinner table okay and</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.240" end="00:52:26.220" style="s2">introducing them into the classroom and</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.160" end="00:52:28.890" style="s2">later point I guess would be the unusual</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.220" end="00:52:33.960" style="s2">level of success that Jews have</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.890" end="00:52:36.990" style="s2">experienced in certain quadrants to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.960" end="00:52:41.970" style="s2">extent that it is culturally transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.990" end="00:52:43.470" style="s2">which may be all of it okay um I I find</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.970" end="00:52:46.560" style="s2">it hard to imagine any of it is not</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.470" end="00:52:48.210" style="s2">readily learning that&#39;s interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.560" end="00:52:50.850" style="s2">don&#39;t know I wonder what that would look</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.210" end="00:52:55.110" style="s2">like or that process would look like</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.850" end="00:52:56.640" style="s2">well on a mass scale I&#39;ve said this</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.110" end="00:52:59.610" style="s2">elsewhere at least once I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.640" end="00:53:04.380" style="s2">where exactly but the I think the other</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.610" end="00:53:07.890" style="s2">proof of this is the Enlightenment okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.380" end="00:53:11.010" style="s2">which was not a Jewish project sure but</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.890" end="00:53:13.670" style="s2">Jews myself included have taken those</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.010" end="00:53:16.339" style="s2">tools and wielded them</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.670" end="00:53:22.010" style="s2">effectively and at some level I feel</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.339" end="00:53:24.530" style="s2">like the Enlightenment was an</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.010" end="00:53:26.270" style="s2">achievement it was a human achievement</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.530" end="00:53:28.040" style="s2">mm-hmm it belongs to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.270" end="00:53:29.859" style="s2">sure right and this is one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.040" end="00:53:31.940" style="s2">that breaks my heart about the</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.859" end="00:53:33.410" style="s2">intersection of movement and the present</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.940" end="00:53:34.490" style="s2">is the rejection of the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.410" end="00:53:36.799" style="s2">which state will flatter</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.490" end="00:53:38.809" style="s2">flatly tell you they want to see if your</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.799" end="00:53:44.380" style="s2">enlightenment is somehow biased and</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.809" end="00:53:47.000" style="s2">white and ready to be tossed out right</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.380" end="00:53:48.559" style="s2">well my feeling is no actually what it</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.000" end="00:53:49.849" style="s2">needs to be done what needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.559" end="00:53:53.359" style="s2">with it is it needs to be taught so</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.849" end="00:53:54.380" style="s2">everybody has access to those tools you</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.359" end="00:53:56.410" style="s2">know you&#39;re not you&#39;re not gonna beat</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.380" end="00:53:59.180" style="s2">the scientific method which is it right</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.410" end="00:54:03.559" style="s2">directly yeah the Enlightenment is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.180" end="00:54:05.930" style="s2">product of the Enlightenment sure so in</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.559" end="00:54:07.579" style="s2">any case the democratizing of those</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.930" end="00:54:09.770" style="s2">tools that are acquired through some</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.579" end="00:54:12.670" style="s2">sort of history seems to me the right</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.770" end="00:54:16.670" style="s2">answer okay I think that perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.670" end="00:54:18.230" style="s2">intersectional left&#39;s objection to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.670" end="00:54:20.480" style="s2">Enlightenment is proof that the very</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.230" end="00:54:26.720" style="s2">least such as the marketization process</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:28.520" style="s2">could be hindered later on because well</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.720" end="00:54:29.660" style="s2">I you know because if they&#39;re rejecting</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.520" end="00:54:31.790" style="s2">the Enlightenment which was the mock</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.660" end="00:54:34.099" style="s2">sighs to certain extent</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.790" end="00:54:35.780" style="s2">then you know I don&#39;t know maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.099" end="00:54:36.950" style="s2">just a back and forth a cyclical tension</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.780" end="00:54:40.970" style="s2">that always keeps happening</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.950" end="00:54:43.700" style="s2">for some reason well if we were to steal</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.970" end="00:54:46.720" style="s2">men their point oh yes please do</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.700" end="00:54:50.480" style="s2">I do think that there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.720" end="00:54:53.270" style="s2">the attempt or the attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.480" end="00:54:58.390" style="s2">democratize the benefits of for example</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.270" end="00:55:02.660" style="s2">the Enlightenment have stalled okay and</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.390" end="00:55:04.490" style="s2">so I think you know look I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.660" end="00:55:06.250" style="s2">of the people who are leading the</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.490" end="00:55:08.960" style="s2">intersectional movement are actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.250" end="00:55:10.160" style="s2">cynical actors serving themselves but I</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.960" end="00:55:11.930" style="s2">don&#39;t think the average person in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.160" end="00:55:13.670" style="s2">movement is cynical okay the average</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.930" end="00:55:21.109" style="s2">person in the movement has been misled</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.670" end="00:55:23.270" style="s2">okay but the the idea that something has</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.109" end="00:55:27.700" style="s2">not worked about democratization of</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.270" end="00:55:30.280" style="s2">these concepts and tools I&#39;m all ears</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.700" end="00:55:32.730" style="s2">the extent to which these tools are</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.280" end="00:55:36.070" style="s2">themselves sure</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.730" end="00:55:37.930" style="s2">problematic I find impossible to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.070" end="00:55:40.050" style="s2">given how well they work and given that</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.930" end="00:55:42.610" style="s2">their central value I mean the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.050" end="00:55:47.980" style="s2">central value of the scientific method</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.610" end="00:55:51.360" style="s2">is that it corrects for bias right sure</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.980" end="00:55:54.640" style="s2">I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s all too</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.360" end="00:55:57.240" style="s2">well are you planning on conducting an</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.640" end="00:56:02.220" style="s2">experiment to see if Judaism can be</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.240" end="00:56:04.720" style="s2">democratized I mean I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.220" end="00:56:06.100" style="s2">say this without seeming like a weirdo</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.720" end="00:56:08.800" style="s2">but I sort of think that we&#39;re engaged</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.100" end="00:56:10.120" style="s2">in that right here and that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.800" end="00:56:11.260" style="s2">figuring out right I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.120" end="00:56:16.330" style="s2">just me at this moment</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.260" end="00:56:17.860" style="s2">oh yeah it&#39;s you and me okay um I was in</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.330" end="00:56:19.420" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like the matrix when you</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.860" end="00:56:24.670" style="s2">wake up and you realize what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.420" end="00:56:25.930" style="s2">right well what I mean you know but I</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.670" end="00:56:29.050" style="s2">don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a conscious thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.930" end="00:56:31.060" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh might not be and I might be</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.050" end="00:56:33.730" style="s2">a might be a foolish thing to even say</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.060" end="00:56:37.900" style="s2">out loud yeah I mean I wouldn&#39;t go that</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.730" end="00:56:39.100" style="s2">far but but yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.900" end="00:56:41.440" style="s2">the implications I don&#39;t know if I need</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.100" end="00:56:43.420" style="s2">to know the implications of what that</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.440" end="00:56:50.020" style="s2">would mean but it&#39;s a cool thing to</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.420" end="00:56:51.760" style="s2">think about I guess well is the maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.020" end="00:56:53.940" style="s2">let me rephrase those okay point this</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.760" end="00:56:59.550" style="s2">way and try it out on you okay</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.940" end="00:57:03.220" style="s2">the Greeks yeah discovered a very power</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.550" end="00:57:09.130" style="s2">powerful tool kit for thought okay for</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.220" end="00:57:11.320" style="s2">mathematical proof mm-hmm etc mm-hmm it</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.130" end="00:57:12.640" style="s2">was a discovery of the Greeks but it</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.320" end="00:57:16.500" style="s2">doesn&#39;t belong to the Greek sir all</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.640" end="00:57:23.520" style="s2">right everybody gets to use trig sure</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.500" end="00:57:28.540" style="s2">the Galileo huh</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.520" end="00:57:33.460" style="s2">obviously innovated a perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.540" end="00:57:35.950" style="s2">allowed us to understand things about</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.460" end="00:57:37.510" style="s2">our physical universe and our place in</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.950" end="00:57:40.500" style="s2">it yet</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.510" end="00:57:43.050" style="s2">are not</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.500" end="00:57:46.830" style="s2">his property not the property of choice</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.050" end="00:57:47.310" style="s2">people but they are human achievements</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.830" end="00:57:51.090" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.310" end="00:57:55.200" style="s2">when Americans landed on the moon in</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.090" end="00:57:57.710" style="s2">1969 Americans may have viewed it as an</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.200" end="00:58:00.360" style="s2">American achievement and it was sure but</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.710" end="00:58:02.100" style="s2">there&#39;s also a way in which people all</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.360" end="00:58:04.620" style="s2">over the world viewed it as a human</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.100" end="00:58:05.730" style="s2">achievement and it was sure right I feel</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.620" end="00:58:08.550" style="s2">like I know where this is going right</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.730" end="00:58:10.710" style="s2">well I&#39;m yeah it is going and it is it</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.550" end="00:58:12.450" style="s2">is it is apparently there but the basic</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.710" end="00:58:14.910" style="s2">point is look stuff is gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.450" end="00:58:16.560" style="s2">discovered by some population first it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.910" end="00:58:18.150" style="s2">just inevitable that it will and some</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.560" end="00:58:21.120" style="s2">stuff is going to get discovered many</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.150" end="00:58:22.920" style="s2">places that aren&#39;t in contact which I</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.120" end="00:58:26.430" style="s2">mean farming was discovered five</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.920" end="00:58:29.040" style="s2">different places released right across</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.430" end="00:58:31.770" style="s2">the planet does that mean that people</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.040" end="00:58:33.390" style="s2">who don&#39;t come from a population that</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.770" end="00:58:36.170" style="s2">discovered had a farm are not entitled</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.390" end="00:58:42.620" style="s2">to do it of course not right so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.170" end="00:58:45.540" style="s2">the question is is not the most noble</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.620" end="00:58:51.210" style="s2">viewpoint on how we are to move forward</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.540" end="00:58:54.960" style="s2">as a species that wherever valuable</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.210" end="00:58:57.480" style="s2">stuff is discovered the insights</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.960" end="00:58:59.100" style="s2">belonged to all of us you don&#39;t discover</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.480" end="00:59:03.510" style="s2">on behalf of your population you</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.100" end="00:59:05.400" style="s2">discover on behalf of enlightenment so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.510" end="00:59:07.290" style="s2">think it&#39;s a great question by the way</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.400" end="00:59:10.200" style="s2">well done I think really a good question</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.290" end="00:59:14.460" style="s2">so I think that it&#39;s the answers both</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.200" end="00:59:17.670" style="s2">and this is a paradox so but I think the</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.460" end="00:59:18.900" style="s2">answer can be that both in one sense</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.670" end="00:59:23.280" style="s2">when you discover something it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.900" end="00:59:26.250" style="s2">behalf of humanity but also and yes they</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.280" end="00:59:28.800" style="s2">are the how did you put it they are the</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.250" end="00:59:31.710" style="s2">they belong to everyone and like anyone</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.800" end="00:59:33.360" style="s2">can practice trigonometry right so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.710" end="00:59:35.280" style="s2">think that&#39;s true but I think it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.360" end="00:59:38.760" style="s2">true that human beings need and are</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.280" end="00:59:42.870" style="s2">wired for story and so from that</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.760" end="00:59:46.200" style="s2">perspective the idea of having a story</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.870" end="00:59:48.990" style="s2">which sort of maps out a direction that</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.200" end="00:59:51.570" style="s2">gives meaning to your life is also</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.990" end="00:59:53.430" style="s2">itself necessary for human development</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.570" end="00:59:54.299" style="s2">so it&#39;s necessary for human development</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.430" end="00:59:55.920" style="s2">to be able to say we can</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.299" end="00:59:57.449" style="s2">all use trigonometry but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.920" end="00:59:59.819" style="s2">necessary for human development tell the</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.449" end="01:00:03.539" style="s2">particular story whether we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.819" end="01:00:05.429" style="s2">about in the form of Judaism or I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.539" end="01:00:07.769" style="s2">saying story in general is necessary for</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.429" end="01:00:09.900" style="s2">the for human psyche I think because</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.769" end="01:00:12.259" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re wired for so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.900" end="01:00:15.119" style="s2">measuring two different values</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.259" end="01:00:18.959" style="s2">essentially in this conversation one</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.119" end="01:00:20.189" style="s2">value is the value of like the value of</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.959" end="01:00:21.630" style="s2">the collective and this is actually a</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.189" end="01:00:22.979" style="s2">very Jewish thing to say but one value</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.630" end="01:00:24.539" style="s2">is the value of the collective and one</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.979" end="01:00:25.679" style="s2">value is the value of the individual and</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.539" end="01:00:28.439" style="s2">so the question is how do you balance</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.679" end="01:00:31.589" style="s2">those two things because both of them</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.439" end="01:00:33.479" style="s2">are necessary in terms of how we shape</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.589" end="01:00:36.539" style="s2">the stories that we tell our lives</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.479" end="01:00:39.359" style="s2">it is incredibly moving to think about</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.539" end="01:00:41.910" style="s2">you know the landing on the moon being</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.359" end="01:00:43.589" style="s2">an achievement for all of humanity and</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.910" end="01:00:46.199" style="s2">sort of like a what a feeling of oneness</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.589" end="01:00:48.569" style="s2">with all of what all human beings on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.199" end="01:00:53.309" style="s2">other hand we do know that it is very</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.569" end="01:00:55.289" style="s2">hard to conceptualize a statistic of</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.309" end="01:00:57.900" style="s2">multiple people dying as opposed to one</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.289" end="01:01:02.249" style="s2">individual dying right and so we are</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.900" end="01:01:04.559" style="s2">wired as such that we need we need the</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.249" end="01:01:05.969" style="s2">cosmic but we also need the particular</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.559" end="01:01:07.679" style="s2">we need the universal but we also need a</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.969" end="01:01:10.499" style="s2">particular and the challenge is how to</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.679" end="01:01:15.719" style="s2">how to balance both of those things in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.499" end="01:01:18.179" style="s2">healthy way beautiful now here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.719" end="01:01:20.819" style="s2">question that I suspect haunts this</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.179" end="01:01:22.469" style="s2">analysis okay which is yep you got the</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.819" end="01:01:25.650" style="s2">individual yeah you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.469" end="01:01:31.559" style="s2">collective but which collectives okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.650" end="01:01:36.839" style="s2">and so what I see after decades of study</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.559" end="01:01:42.449" style="s2">of history evolution human nature</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.839" end="01:01:46.079" style="s2">mmm-hmm what I see is a tragic story in</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.449" end="01:01:48.449" style="s2">which we are built to cooperate mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.079" end="01:01:49.979" style="s2">to compete and cooperate to compete</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.449" end="01:01:51.989" style="s2">that&#39;s what we do we operate in order to</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.979" end="01:01:54.959" style="s2">complete cooperate in order to compete</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.989" end="01:01:57.209" style="s2">and in and of itself that is not</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.959" end="01:02:02.369" style="s2">inherently bad it results in all sorts</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.209" end="01:02:05.249" style="s2">of marvelous things but it is the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.369" end="01:02:07.499" style="s2">seed of our undoing is in that formula</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.249" end="01:02:08.220" style="s2">because we have gotten more and more</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.499" end="01:02:15.570" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.220" end="01:02:18.350" style="s2">in that process and the ability to play</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.570" end="01:02:20.850" style="s2">that competition to a fatal end is</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.350" end="01:02:22.590" style="s2">looming sure nearby because of</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.850" end="01:02:24.030" style="s2">Technology because of technology because</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.590" end="01:02:25.770" style="s2">of the size of the population and</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.030" end="01:02:27.690" style="s2">because of the interconnectedness okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.770" end="01:02:32.160" style="s2">which we live okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.690" end="01:02:36.000" style="s2">and the question is there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.160" end="01:02:38.970" style="s2">process in which the collective has been</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.000" end="01:02:42.690" style="s2">broadened historically so if I think for</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.970" end="01:02:44.930" style="s2">example of the story of the Good</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.690" end="01:02:47.520" style="s2">Samaritan yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.930" end="01:02:49.620" style="s2">the Golden Rule which evolves in</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.520" end="01:02:52.560" style="s2">multiple traditions yes there&#39;s a ll</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.620" end="01:02:58.920" style="s2">version and the Jesus version but these</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.560" end="01:03:01.800" style="s2">stories create a context for broadening</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.920" end="01:03:04.080" style="s2">the circle with whom you collaborate</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.800" end="01:03:06.690" style="s2">sure why in order to compete with</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.080" end="01:03:10.830" style="s2">something outside of it but we are now</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.690" end="01:03:13.860" style="s2">linked together in a way that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.830" end="01:03:15.810" style="s2">collaborate all of us the collective</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.860" end="01:03:16.740" style="s2">there is a collective which is all of us</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.810" end="01:03:19.740" style="s2">okay right</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.740" end="01:03:23.790" style="s2">it hasn&#39;t successfully collaborated sure</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.740" end="01:03:26.100" style="s2">yet sure if it doesn&#39;t we&#39;ve got a big</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.790" end="01:03:29.010" style="s2">problem and my guess would be it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.100" end="01:03:33.750" style="s2">fatal problem in the near term but we</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.010" end="01:03:36.360" style="s2">are not wired for it because cooperate</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.750" end="01:03:40.110" style="s2">to compete works up until there&#39;s no one</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.360" end="01:03:43.070" style="s2">to compete with ah right and so in some</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.110" end="01:03:46.140" style="s2">sense we have to level ourselves up and</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.070" end="01:03:50.780" style="s2">hence the need for the chosen people no</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.140" end="01:03:54.870" style="s2">hence the need for us to take all of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.780" end="01:03:58.890" style="s2">the important discoveries that different</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.870" end="01:04:00.600" style="s2">populations have made and pull them and</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.890" end="01:04:08.670" style="s2">there&#39;s one way in which you could take</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.600" end="01:04:13.560" style="s2">this as some sort of you know utopian</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.670" end="01:04:15.390" style="s2">okay all is one yeah viewpoint oh and</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.560" end="01:04:19.220" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying is that the difficulty</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.390" end="01:04:21.900" style="s2">is that the story in which we all</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.220" end="01:04:23.970" style="s2">realize you know what astronaut</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.900" end="01:04:25.440" style="s2">typically realize yeah they look back at</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.970" end="01:04:28.020" style="s2">the earth and they sir have what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.440" end="01:04:30.630" style="s2">called the overview effect right that</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.020" end="01:04:32.190" style="s2">that experience somehow has to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.630" end="01:04:34.289" style="s2">translated to everybody</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.190" end="01:04:35.819" style="s2">yeah the discoveries that each</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.289" end="01:04:41.940" style="s2">population have made that are valuable</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.819" end="01:04:44.880" style="s2">has to be democratized okay and that we</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.940" end="01:04:48.589" style="s2">are not wired for that transition even</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.880" end="01:04:50.970" style="s2">if we require it is a daunting challenge</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.589" end="01:04:54.210" style="s2">okay I see you&#39;re saying yes I was gonna</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.970" end="01:04:59.430" style="s2">say I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s possible to</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.210" end="01:05:03.319" style="s2">translate all the sort of discoveries of</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.430" end="01:05:06.569" style="s2">every community to the entire circle</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.319" end="01:05:09.119" style="s2">meaning the meaning meaning to say that</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.569" end="01:05:11.099" style="s2">you all we all inherit this or this is</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.119" end="01:05:12.119" style="s2">our inheritance all of us collectively I</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.099" end="01:05:12.630" style="s2">don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.119" end="01:05:17.940" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.630" end="01:05:22.400" style="s2">well okay at the risk of pushing this</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.940" end="01:05:27.380" style="s2">somewhere three uncomfortable oh okay</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.400" end="01:05:32.930" style="s2">yes sorry um at the risk of doing that</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.380" end="01:05:35.730" style="s2">can we talk about the predicament of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.930" end="01:05:40.049" style="s2">population of people who arrived in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.730" end="01:05:40.529" style="s2">new world for the purpose of functioning</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.049" end="01:05:42.210" style="s2">as slaves</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.529" end="01:05:44.779" style="s2">I mean sure this is a population that</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.210" end="01:05:49.020" style="s2">you drive from on both sides you sure</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.779" end="01:05:53.700" style="s2">that population a was many populations</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.020" end="01:05:56.309" style="s2">mm-hmm in Africa yeah but that</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.700" end="01:06:01.200" style="s2">population that assembled here yes as a</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.309" end="01:06:03.990" style="s2">purpose of doing the labor yes of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.200" end="01:06:06.270" style="s2">population with power right it had its</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.990" end="01:06:08.430" style="s2">culture systematically destroyed sure</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.270" end="01:06:10.950" style="s2">right now yeah hundred percent yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.430" end="01:06:14.839" style="s2">to a great extent yeah for the purpose</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.950" end="01:06:14.839" style="s2">of making enslavement function right</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.220" end="01:06:26.279" style="s2">that population therefore does not have</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.690" end="01:06:28.859" style="s2">access mmm-hmm to the ancestral sure the</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.279" end="01:06:31.579" style="s2">garrisons right its language destroyed</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.859" end="01:06:33.900" style="s2">or its languages destroyed at its</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.579" end="01:06:35.609" style="s2">coherent set of cultural traditions</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.900" end="01:06:38.839" style="s2">largely disrupted</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.609" end="01:06:43.469" style="s2">so the point is that population actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.839" end="01:06:45.539" style="s2">has to take on another sum it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.469" end="01:06:47.160" style="s2">have to be one populations package of</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.539" end="01:06:49.289" style="s2">discoveries but it has to take on</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.160" end="01:06:51.410" style="s2">something to replace that which was</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.289" end="01:06:55.229" style="s2">stolen from oh that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.410" end="01:06:57.180" style="s2">am I wrong about that I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.229" end="01:07:02.700" style="s2">necessarily think about it in this in in</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.180" end="01:07:06.150" style="s2">these terms because if certain elements</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.700" end="01:07:07.739" style="s2">of culture are universal and thus can be</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.150" end="01:07:10.969" style="s2">found in every culture then technically</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.739" end="01:07:13.019" style="s2">one could guess that the things that</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.969" end="01:07:14.459" style="s2">that the things that we&#39;re taking from</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.019" end="01:07:17.190" style="s2">other cultures were also part of our</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.459" end="01:07:21.959" style="s2">culture at some point even before it was</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.190" end="01:07:24.509" style="s2">destroyed um well let me let me come at</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.959" end="01:07:26.160" style="s2">that biologically and just look at my</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.509" end="01:07:30.180" style="s2">best guess okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.160" end="01:07:33.809" style="s2">people are very similar yes their</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.180" end="01:07:35.880" style="s2">capacity to discover yes see you know if</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.809" end="01:07:38.819" style="s2">you take a Guns Germs and Steel view of</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.880" end="01:07:40.650" style="s2">history which I very definitely do what</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.819" end="01:07:44.519" style="s2">you basically see is that human beings</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.650" end="01:07:46.619" style="s2">inherited very uneven pieces of turf</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.519" end="01:07:49.380" style="s2">okay and that those very uneven pieces</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.619" end="01:07:51.449" style="s2">of turf caused some populations to move</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.380" end="01:07:53.219" style="s2">faster sure and some populations to move</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.449" end="01:07:55.259" style="s2">slower based on for example how many</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.219" end="01:07:56.880" style="s2">domesticable animals are available to</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.259" end="01:08:00.449" style="s2">them sure there was a concentration of</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.880" end="01:08:04.799" style="s2">domesticable animals above you know the</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.449" end="01:08:07.049" style="s2">size of a rabbit um you know in Asia</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.799" end="01:08:11.369" style="s2">right and there was a deficit of them in</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.049" end="01:08:12.930" style="s2">New World example so that is to say the</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.369" end="01:08:16.409" style="s2">ones that exist in the New World Network</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.930" end="01:08:21.929" style="s2">transported from Asia and via Europe</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.409" end="01:08:24.239" style="s2">right my merrily but but people are</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.929" end="01:08:25.949" style="s2">basically people will discover what</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.239" end="01:08:27.630" style="s2">there is to discover the rates at which</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.949" end="01:08:30.299" style="s2">they discover these things are heavily</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.630" end="01:08:32.609" style="s2">dependent on idiosyncrasies of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.299" end="01:08:35.159" style="s2">environment that they inherit just by</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.609" end="01:08:38.670" style="s2">virtue of where they are on earth and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.159" end="01:08:42.449" style="s2">I don&#39;t think there is any reason to</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.670" end="01:08:44.159" style="s2">imagine that a many of these things were</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.449" end="01:08:46.469" style="s2">discovered in various places in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.159" end="01:08:47.969" style="s2">earth or across the earth and that in</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.469" end="01:08:49.200" style="s2">places where they hadn&#39;t been discovered</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.969" end="01:08:51.600" style="s2">yet they would</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.200" end="01:08:54.750" style="s2">right you know we can see in mesoamerica</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.600" end="01:08:58.680" style="s2">for example a highly sophisticated</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.750" end="01:09:02.460" style="s2">culture that was a few hundred years</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.680" end="01:09:04.140" style="s2">behind Europeans in terms of metallurgy</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.460" end="01:09:06.090" style="s2">okay all right maybe it&#39;s a thousand</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.140" end="01:09:09.300" style="s2">years behind but it doesn&#39;t yeah vast</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.090" end="01:09:11.670" style="s2">distance in historical context and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.300" end="01:09:13.110" style="s2">point is well that created a military</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.670" end="01:09:15.530" style="s2">disadvantage that was absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.110" end="01:09:20.580" style="s2">unbeatable when Europeans showed up but</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.530" end="01:09:23.610" style="s2">but my point is I agree that populations</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.580" end="01:09:26.730" style="s2">that have had their culture disrupted</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.610" end="01:09:28.740" style="s2">mm-hmm either had those discoveries in</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.730" end="01:09:32.550" style="s2">their history or would have come across</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.740" end="01:09:34.770" style="s2">them soon enough sure but from the point</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.550" end="01:09:37.050" style="s2">of view of where we all land now sure I</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.770" end="01:09:38.700" style="s2">think the point is well we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.050" end="01:09:41.730" style="s2">libraries sure they&#39;re full of these</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.700" end="01:09:45.870" style="s2">discoveries yeah why don&#39;t we just make</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.730" end="01:09:48.870" style="s2">sure that a package that contains all of</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.870" end="01:09:51.450" style="s2">the most useful stuff is given to every</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.870" end="01:09:52.890" style="s2">little yeah yes made available I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.450" end="01:09:56.970" style="s2">think that&#39;s fine I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.890" end="01:10:01.170" style="s2">that&#39;s a it&#39;s a different analogy but I</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.970" end="01:10:03.270" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a good solution to well</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.170" end="01:10:05.210" style="s2">we&#39;ve sort of meandered from this</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.270" end="01:10:09.000" style="s2">particular verse is the universal two</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.210" end="01:10:12.720" style="s2">who inherit what&#39;s or proof that there</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.000" end="01:10:15.990" style="s2">has to be this approach that says that</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.720" end="01:10:18.210" style="s2">everyone would have access to the the</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.990" end="01:10:19.740" style="s2">gifts that all communities are all</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.210" end="01:10:21.900" style="s2">ancient people have created or</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.740" end="01:10:24.090" style="s2">discovered because if you run into a</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.900" end="01:10:26.520" style="s2">situation like people&#39;s history being</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.090" end="01:10:28.110" style="s2">wiped out they will need to take from</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.520" end="01:10:29.610" style="s2">other people&#39;s histories or other</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.110" end="01:10:32.310" style="s2">people&#39;s accomplishments and also be</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.610" end="01:10:33.150" style="s2">able to call it their own but I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.310" end="01:10:34.620" style="s2">they&#39;re able to call it their own</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.150" end="01:10:36.710" style="s2">because they&#39;re human beings not because</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.620" end="01:10:40.020" style="s2">of where they come from or because of</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.710" end="01:10:42.090" style="s2">even the even the origin so I think that</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.020" end="01:10:46.080" style="s2">the fact of the human being that we are</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.090" end="01:10:50.640" style="s2">human beings transcends all of that and</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.080" end="01:10:52.710" style="s2">so that is why for example African</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.640" end="01:10:55.950" style="s2">Americans have a right to that heritage</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.710" end="01:11:00.090" style="s2">not because not because it&#39;s useful but</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.950" end="01:11:01.470" style="s2">because it is and this is I can&#39;t prove</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.090" end="01:11:02.460" style="s2">this but because it is because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.470" end="01:11:05.640" style="s2">metaphysical statement</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.460" end="01:11:07.770" style="s2">it is objectively the case that what</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.640" end="01:11:12.210" style="s2">transcends all of that is the dignity of</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.770" end="01:11:14.400" style="s2">the human person yeah I think in fact</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.210" end="01:11:18.120" style="s2">well I think these are two facets of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.400" end="01:11:20.520" style="s2">same coin and okay I agree that if we</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.120" end="01:11:22.620" style="s2">taught but yeah if we if we acknowledge</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.520" end="01:11:24.180" style="s2">the dignity of the human person and like</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.620" end="01:11:26.790" style="s2">what that entails we also have to</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.180" end="01:11:29.340" style="s2">recognize that in order to thrive I</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.790" end="01:11:32.610" style="s2">think human beings need stories and not</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.340" end="01:11:37.230" style="s2">stories just of the collective but also</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.610" end="01:11:38.969" style="s2">stories of the particular and so you</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.230" end="01:11:40.080" style="s2">know so to ask the question which is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.969" end="01:11:42.570" style="s2">challenging question it&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.080" end="01:11:44.640" style="s2">question why can&#39;t the accomplishments</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.570" end="01:11:46.320" style="s2">for example of the Jewish people be the</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.640" end="01:11:48.570" style="s2">collective accomplishments of all of</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.320" end="01:11:50.280" style="s2">humanity right I supposed to see this is</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.570" end="01:11:53.219" style="s2">very specific thing but a particular</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.280" end="01:11:54.989" style="s2">thing in a sense because scale Lil&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.219" end="01:11:57.060" style="s2">accomplishments are not seen as the</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.989" end="01:12:01.530" style="s2">Italian people is a conference right</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.060" end="01:12:03.330" style="s2">right so there&#39;s this difference there</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.530" end="01:12:04.410" style="s2">but I don&#39;t necessarily think that</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.330" end="01:12:06.510" style="s2">there&#39;s anything wrong with the</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.410" end="01:12:07.560" style="s2">difference oh I don&#39;t think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.510" end="01:12:10.500" style="s2">anything wrong with the difference and</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.560" end="01:12:13.710" style="s2">I&#39;m not looking to sanitize or</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.500" end="01:12:16.920" style="s2">neutralize the stories at all it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.710" end="01:12:19.430" style="s2">even really the accomplishments you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.920" end="01:12:24.000" style="s2">well I guess accomplishments is maybe</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.430" end="01:12:26.310" style="s2">too vague it&#39;s the tools hmm it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.000" end="01:12:28.590" style="s2">tools that I see as an absolutely vital</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.310" end="01:12:30.710" style="s2">that we democratize everybody needs</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.590" end="01:12:34.140" style="s2">access to those tools and to the extent</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.710" end="01:12:36.510" style="s2">that our cooperate to compete modality</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.140" end="01:12:39.840" style="s2">has brought us to this place</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.510" end="01:12:42.180" style="s2">it has also caused us to wield tools and</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.840" end="01:12:45.660" style="s2">to deny them to others sure that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.180" end="01:12:49.140" style="s2">that&#39;s the key strategy yes I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.660" end="01:12:52.110" style="s2">discover a tool I&#39;m going to wield it to</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.140" end="01:12:54.989" style="s2">benefit me and whatever I identify as</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.110" end="01:12:57.480" style="s2">self sure right and I&#39;m going to deny it</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.989" end="01:12:59.670" style="s2">to those with whom I am competing so</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.480" end="01:13:01.560" style="s2">interesting in light it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.670" end="01:13:02.940" style="s2">notion in light of the fact that some</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.560" end="01:13:05.760" style="s2">intersectional lists reject the</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.940" end="01:13:08.300" style="s2">Enlightenment all right yes cuz it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.760" end="01:13:11.880" style="s2">reverse thing because you would think</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.300" end="01:13:13.590" style="s2">that many people in who hold this</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.880" end="01:13:16.349" style="s2">political ideology believe that they do</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.590" end="01:13:17.610" style="s2">so in the name of minority groups</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.349" end="01:13:19.230" style="s2">well you&#39;re saying is there if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.610" end="01:13:21.500" style="s2">rejects these tools which are the</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.230" end="01:13:23.750" style="s2">inheritance of all of humanity then</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.500" end="01:13:27.929" style="s2">you&#39;re doing something that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.750" end="01:13:30.420" style="s2">fundamentally undemocratic you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.929" end="01:13:33.150" style="s2">reversing that democratic process yes</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.420" end="01:13:35.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s so self-defeating yes because</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.150" end="01:13:36.179" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re only hurting yourself</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.040" end="01:13:38.219" style="s2">essentially because you&#39;re denying</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.179" end="01:13:39.540" style="s2">yourself access to the tool which is</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.219" end="01:13:41.460" style="s2">actually your inheritance as a human</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.540" end="01:13:43.920" style="s2">being it&#39;s your inheritance and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.460" end="01:13:45.449" style="s2">this is exactly this is exactly my</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.920" end="01:13:47.130" style="s2">frustration is that I have the sense</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.449" end="01:13:50.909" style="s2">there is really something to the idea</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.130" end="01:13:52.710" style="s2">that some people have been shut out of</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.909" end="01:13:54.480" style="s2">access to those tools and instead of</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.710" end="01:13:56.280" style="s2">demanding access to those tools right</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.480" end="01:13:57.960" style="s2">they are declaring the tools right</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.280" end="01:14:02.969" style="s2">illegitimate and biased which is not the</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.960" end="01:14:05.760" style="s2">case right that&#39;s interesting yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.969" end="01:14:07.770" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s very strange</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.760" end="01:14:12.030" style="s2">yeah it is very strange it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.770" end="01:14:16.380" style="s2">disheartening yeah and yeah it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.030" end="01:14:19.380" style="s2">it&#39;s jarring given what Heather and I</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.380" end="01:14:20.790" style="s2">were doing trying to pass those tools on</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.380" end="01:14:22.290" style="s2">the people in taking great pleasure and</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.790" end="01:14:26.369" style="s2">watching them acquire that and wield</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.290" end="01:14:27.780" style="s2">them with ever more skill but sure</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.369" end="01:14:30.389" style="s2">though there has to be a parable that</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.780" end="01:14:33.239" style="s2">can teach us about this like there has</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.389" end="01:14:36.449" style="s2">to be a peril parable were like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.239" end="01:14:37.650" style="s2">know the child rejected the tools that</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.449" end="01:14:39.179" style="s2">the parents tried to give them or</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.650" end="01:14:40.500" style="s2">something along those lines yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.179" end="01:14:42.119" style="s2">sort of like sift through and try to</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.500" end="01:14:46.199" style="s2">predict what&#39;s gonna what&#39;s gonna be the</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.119" end="01:14:48.150" style="s2">outcome of this new pattern of behavior</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.199" end="01:14:49.590" style="s2">that we&#39;re seeing I agree there should</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.150" end="01:14:55.500" style="s2">be there should be a well-known story</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.590" end="01:14:59.429" style="s2">but I can&#39;t think yeah yeah um why am i</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.500" end="01:15:02.550" style="s2">blanking on the author of the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.429" end="01:15:04.260" style="s2">the masters house cannot be disassembled</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.550" end="01:15:06.329" style="s2">with the Masters tools oh I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.260" end="01:15:09.780" style="s2">that one you don&#39;t know that one I find</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.329" end="01:15:11.760" style="s2">this a very I see it periodically the</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.780" end="01:15:13.139" style="s2">masters house cannot be disassembled</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.760" end="01:15:16.829" style="s2">with the Masters tools because the</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.139" end="01:15:21.510" style="s2">master built it and so I have to say</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.829" end="01:15:24.840" style="s2">this was an idea that people wield</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.510" end="01:15:27.329" style="s2">mm-hmm and I can&#39;t make sense of it I</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.840" end="01:15:28.949" style="s2">can it sort of sounds right until you</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.329" end="01:15:29.969" style="s2">think about the implications and my</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.949" end="01:15:30.960" style="s2">feeling is</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.969" end="01:15:33.060" style="s2">well I just don&#39;t know what it means</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.960" end="01:15:38.280" style="s2">well it means that you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.060" end="01:15:40.650" style="s2">obviously a reference to to slavery okay</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.280" end="01:15:42.750" style="s2">the master sure has tools and if you</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.650" end="01:15:44.520" style="s2">want a dismantled slavery you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.750" end="01:15:47.160" style="s2">it with the tools that belong to the</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.520" end="01:15:49.290" style="s2">master feeling third it&#39;s absurd that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.160" end="01:15:51.690" style="s2">absurd it&#39;s not only a fundamental it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.290" end="01:15:53.699" style="s2">fallen would have ripped that apart it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.690" end="01:15:57.180" style="s2">the opposite of the beds absurd</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.699" end="01:15:58.650" style="s2">right that is like the literal Wow I</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.180" end="01:16:00.780" style="s2">hadn&#39;t heard that nobody&#39;s got better</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.650" end="01:16:02.820" style="s2">tools in the master right go with the</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.780" end="01:16:05.340" style="s2">master shed the master has the finest</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.820" end="01:16:06.930" style="s2">tools in town if you were gonna use</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.340" end="01:16:12.060" style="s2">tools to dismantle the Masters house</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.930" end="01:16:14.040" style="s2">those would be the ones I can&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.060" end="01:16:16.350" style="s2">I&#39;m blanking on it I used to know what</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.040" end="01:16:17.880" style="s2">like the back of my hand but not that I</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.350" end="01:16:20.900" style="s2">know the back of my head I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.880" end="01:16:23.820" style="s2">understood that expression but yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.900" end="01:16:26.070" style="s2">was thinking I&#39;m sure there are more</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.820" end="01:16:28.380" style="s2">implications for this statement because</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.070" end="01:16:32.730" style="s2">that&#39;s just I mean first of all the of</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.380" end="01:16:33.900" style="s2">the the audacity to assume that see this</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.730" end="01:16:36.120" style="s2">is the point this is the problem that I</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.900" end="01:16:39.060" style="s2">have this is the thing that frustrates</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.120" end="01:16:41.130" style="s2">me what is what is at the essence or</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.060" end="01:16:45.739" style="s2">what connects the master and the slave</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.130" end="01:16:48.239" style="s2">in this paradigm that we are we are</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.739" end="01:16:50.280" style="s2">talking about because in the book as a</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.239" end="01:16:52.080" style="s2">man liveth the author says be neither a</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.280" end="01:16:53.610" style="s2">master nor a slave and in the</p>

<p begin="01:16:57.810" end="01:17:02.699" style="s2">hated the worst in this world and that</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.210" end="01:17:04.980" style="s2">is the master and slave so almost like</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.699" end="01:17:07.140" style="s2">trying to promote this rejection of that</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.980" end="01:17:09.390" style="s2">paradigm as a starting point but anyway</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.140" end="01:17:12.989" style="s2">even if we were to take that paradigm as</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.390" end="01:17:14.160" style="s2">a starting point it&#39;s like what is what</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.989" end="01:17:16.830" style="s2">is at the base of these two categories</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.160" end="01:17:20.969" style="s2">is a human being and so this idea it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.830" end="01:17:24.810" style="s2">like it&#39;s so antithetical to its so</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.969" end="01:17:27.810" style="s2">fundamentally untrue because because on</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.810" end="01:17:32.219" style="s2">a on a sort of I don&#39;t know how to put</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.810" end="01:17:34.199" style="s2">this on a deeper level both of you are</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.219" end="01:17:35.940" style="s2">human being so both of you can exhibit</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.199" end="01:17:37.050" style="s2">certain qualities and certain behaviors</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.940" end="01:17:40.710" style="s2">that are either destructive or</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.050" end="01:17:44.000" style="s2">productive or moral or immoral right so</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.710" end="01:17:44.000" style="s2">this idea that like</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.450" end="01:17:48.930" style="s2">that one cannot even this goes back to</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.490" end="01:17:52.770" style="s2">the beginning of our conversation that</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.930" end="01:17:53.940" style="s2">one can&#39;t find the commonality or the</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.770" end="01:17:56.100" style="s2">common humanists between these two</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.940" end="01:17:57.600" style="s2">categories which would make a person</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.100" end="01:18:02.220" style="s2">realize that that statement is silly</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.600" end="01:18:03.420" style="s2">right is very dehumanizing actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.220" end="01:18:05.520" style="s2">because it says that the essence of what</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.420" end="01:18:07.350" style="s2">you are are these categories not the</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.520" end="01:18:10.170" style="s2">human being underneath because if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.350" end="01:18:12.450" style="s2">human being underneath then the slave</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.170" end="01:18:14.820" style="s2">could take those same tools and make</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.450" end="01:18:17.220" style="s2">something else right the point is not</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.820" end="01:18:20.610" style="s2">the tools it&#39;s the being that&#39;s using</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.220" end="01:18:22.770" style="s2">the tools and so this saying is regulus</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.610" end="01:18:25.190" style="s2">because it takes the autonomy away from</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.770" end="01:18:28.320" style="s2">the human being which is ironic because</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.190" end="01:18:29.820" style="s2">the categories are master and slave but</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.320" end="01:18:31.860" style="s2">this person does not come with the cat</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.820" end="01:18:33.420" style="s2">up with the category of a free person or</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.860" end="01:18:34.680" style="s2">a person who is free yeah all right the</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.420" end="01:18:36.720" style="s2">person who&#39;s free does not fall into</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.680" end="01:18:38.820" style="s2">either those categories a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.720" end="01:18:43.980" style="s2">percent a hundred percent agree with</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.820" end="01:18:44.700" style="s2">this and the question it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.980" end="01:18:47.970" style="s2">heartbreaking</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.700" end="01:18:50.130" style="s2">because I have the sense that you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.970" end="01:18:52.110" style="s2">let&#39;s take your example from the</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.130" end="01:18:55.620" style="s2">beginning of the conversation to people</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.110" end="01:18:59.250" style="s2">who find themselves moving together well</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.620" end="01:19:02.670" style="s2">on a dance floor sure they come to have</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.250" end="01:19:04.860" style="s2">some deep connection that isn&#39;t founded</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.670" end="01:19:07.020" style="s2">on the content of their conscious</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.860" end="01:19:08.280" style="s2">beliefs right okay and then their</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.020" end="01:19:12.050" style="s2">conscious beliefs emerge in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.280" end="01:19:17.220" style="s2">conversation afterwards sure right that</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.050" end="01:19:19.440" style="s2">experience reveals something about the</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.220" end="01:19:19.770" style="s2">very point you&#39;re making about the human</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.440" end="01:19:26.580" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.770" end="01:19:28.350" style="s2">versus the status right right I have the</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.580" end="01:19:30.210" style="s2">sense that this just isn&#39;t that hard and</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.350" end="01:19:33.480" style="s2">we&#39;re still not gonna succeed at it what</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.210" end="01:19:37.970" style="s2">do you mean it&#39;s not that hard that you</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.480" end="01:19:40.410" style="s2">know when when I was facing the</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.970" end="01:19:40.920" style="s2">protestors who became rioters at</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.410" end="01:19:44.990" style="s2">Evergreen</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.920" end="01:19:48.000" style="s2">mmm-hmm I kept having the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.990" end="01:19:49.650" style="s2">these people had you know let&#39;s put the</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.000" end="01:19:52.140" style="s2">bad actors aside there were some bad</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.650" end="01:19:54.330" style="s2">actors out of them but then there were a</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.140" end="01:19:56.730" style="s2">lot of people who were saying stuff like</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.330" end="01:19:57.540" style="s2">the Masters okay yes can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.730" end="01:20:01.110" style="s2">disassembled with</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.540" end="01:20:03.630" style="s2">masters tools and I had the sense you</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.110" end="01:20:06.780" style="s2">know what these guys need they need a</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.630" end="01:20:11.640" style="s2">really good college course that takes</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.780" end="01:20:16.110" style="s2">months that runs you through these well</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.640" end="01:20:18.840" style="s2">but the tragedies of a college coming</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.110" end="01:20:20.670" style="s2">apart over the fact that what the people</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.840" end="01:20:24.240" style="s2">who were tearing it apart needed was</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.670" end="01:20:26.850" style="s2">calling right looks like oh we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.240" end="01:20:29.850" style="s2">college here can&#39;t yeah can we not well</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.850" end="01:20:31.260" style="s2">I say use these buildings and the things</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.850" end="01:20:33.450" style="s2">that you&#39;re saying let&#39;s take the things</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.260" end="01:20:35.280" style="s2">that you&#39;re saying and let&#39;s start there</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.450" end="01:20:37.080" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s just start there we&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.280" end="01:20:39.240" style="s2">them as a premise and yeah see how well</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.080" end="01:20:41.250" style="s2">that premise stands up this is not that</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.240" end="01:20:43.980" style="s2">hard right right but it was impossible</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.250" end="01:20:45.390" style="s2">okay and so I guess maybe that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.980" end="01:20:48.810" style="s2">I&#39;m getting at is that I&#39;m a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.390" end="01:20:51.360" style="s2">heartbroken okay something that where</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.810" end="01:20:51.930" style="s2">the parameters slightly changed it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.360" end="01:20:54.630" style="s2">that hard</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.930" end="01:20:56.070" style="s2">it comes impossible so what&#39;s parameters</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.630" end="01:20:59.580" style="s2">needs would need to change in order for</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.070" end="01:21:03.230" style="s2">it to well you know you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.580" end="01:21:05.370" style="s2">something about conservatives and</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.230" end="01:21:09.260" style="s2">self-government I think was the term</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.370" end="01:21:11.820" style="s2">that you used there is a way in which</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.260" end="01:21:14.550" style="s2">yes there is a problem with the</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.820" end="01:21:17.790" style="s2">structures of authority people are sick</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.550" end="01:21:20.580" style="s2">and tired of being told that their</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.790" end="01:21:22.350" style="s2">system functions and if they just keep</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.580" end="01:21:24.510" style="s2">their head down and do their work they</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.350" end="01:21:26.340" style="s2">will end up in a decent place because</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.510" end="01:21:29.520" style="s2">they can see that that&#39;s not inherently</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.340" end="01:21:33.920" style="s2">true sure right so the frustration makes</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.520" end="01:21:37.410" style="s2">sense but the allergic reaction to all</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.920" end="01:21:42.330" style="s2">structures right as if it is the fact of</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.410" end="01:21:47.700" style="s2">the structures that is oppressing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.330" end="01:21:49.640" style="s2">wrong and so I guess my point is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.700" end="01:21:51.900" style="s2">very upset at the state of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.640" end="01:21:54.030" style="s2">university system I think the university</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.900" end="01:21:55.890" style="s2">system has abdicated responsibility for</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.030" end="01:21:58.350" style="s2">teaching and it&#39;s taken up some other</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.890" end="01:22:01.620" style="s2">kinds of jobs in order to pay the rent</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.350" end="01:22:03.990" style="s2">but its failure to teach has resulted in</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.620" end="01:22:05.700" style="s2">a lot of people who haven&#39;t learned and</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.990" end="01:22:07.500" style="s2">having not learned they aren&#39;t in a</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.700" end="01:22:09.600" style="s2">position to evaluate the quality of what</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.500" end="01:22:10.590" style="s2">they&#39;re asserting the system should look</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.600" end="01:22:12.930" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.590" end="01:22:14.700" style="s2">so they&#39;re saying patently absurd things</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.930" end="01:22:17.550" style="s2">about you know what the rules of society</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.700" end="01:22:20.130" style="s2">ought to be and you know we can&#39;t afford</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.550" end="01:22:23.460" style="s2">to try out their experiment right right</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.130" end="01:22:25.320" style="s2">it will be an absolute disaster so this</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.460" end="01:22:29.220" style="s2">has to be taught in the abstract rather</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.320" end="01:22:33.030" style="s2">than trying it okay so anyway I guess my</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.220" end="01:22:34.440" style="s2">point is look I don&#39;t think I think a</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.030" end="01:22:36.480" style="s2">lot of college professors don&#39;t do a lot</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.440" end="01:22:38.160" style="s2">of teaching and Isis isn&#39;t just college</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.480" end="01:22:40.860" style="s2">for yeah it&#39;s teachers that&#39;s crazy</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.160" end="01:22:45.240" style="s2">it&#39;s crazy good to think about to</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.860" end="01:22:50.910" style="s2">imagine yeah but what if what if it all</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.240" end="01:22:54.090" style="s2">depends on getting people calm down to</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.910" end="01:22:57.120" style="s2">step back and be systematic yeah okay</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.090" end="01:22:59.250" style="s2">wait what are you claiming yeah and then</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.120" end="01:23:01.500" style="s2">let&#39;s play it through well in order to</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.250" end="01:23:03.390" style="s2">get my feeling is that the reason why</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.500" end="01:23:05.280" style="s2">it&#39;s hard is because in order to get a</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.390" end="01:23:07.950" style="s2">student to be able to do that that</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.280" end="01:23:10.820" style="s2">student has to identify with that</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.950" end="01:23:14.700" style="s2">process and so and this is where</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.820" end="01:23:17.310" style="s2">identity in a more serious context can</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.700" end="01:23:21.360" style="s2">be discussed so like house what is this</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.310" end="01:23:22.860" style="s2">person&#39;s sense of self in the world how</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.360" end="01:23:25.560" style="s2">does this person conceive of him or</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.860" end="01:23:30.060" style="s2">herself this is a person know themselves</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.560" end="01:23:32.640" style="s2">really and having known oneself is now</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.060" end="01:23:35.520" style="s2">now being able to navigate the outside</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.640" end="01:23:37.560" style="s2">world and specifically in reference to</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.520" end="01:23:40.380" style="s2">the college campus for the purposes of</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.560" end="01:23:44.580" style="s2">this conversation so it may be a person</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.380" end="01:23:46.110" style="s2">is has to be raised in such a way or</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.580" end="01:23:49.620" style="s2">nurtured in such a way that they would</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.110" end="01:23:52.950" style="s2">want to or that they would be more</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.620" end="01:23:54.690" style="s2">likely to respond to that okay so I</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.950" end="01:23:58.140" style="s2">don&#39;t know this is perfect actually I</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.690" end="01:24:00.180" style="s2">was thinking about this this morning</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.140" end="01:24:03.870" style="s2">okay and preparing to talk to you about</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.180" end="01:24:07.830" style="s2">it okay it&#39;s a question I have about</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.870" end="01:24:10.470" style="s2">whether or not by theory of Enchantment</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.830" end="01:24:16.050" style="s2">you mean something that is analogous to</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.470" end="01:24:17.520" style="s2">an idea that motivated my teaching</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.050" end="01:24:20.370" style="s2">something I use to describe my own</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.520" end="01:24:22.830" style="s2">teaching to myself okay you have to give</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.370" end="01:24:24.060" style="s2">me a little leeway okay the word</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.830" end="01:24:26.310" style="s2">seduction</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.060" end="01:24:28.470" style="s2">it has a bad connotation it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.310" end="01:24:30.000" style="s2">inherently sure bad but it has a sexual</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.470" end="01:24:33.810" style="s2">connotation that doesn&#39;t belong in this</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.000" end="01:24:36.480" style="s2">conversation sure but I I felt when I</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.810" end="01:24:41.990" style="s2">was involved in teaching that good</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.480" end="01:24:44.190" style="s2">teaching involved a kind of intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.990" end="01:24:48.510" style="s2">seduction okay and what I mean by that</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.190" end="01:24:51.360" style="s2">is the way to get somebody to learn is</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.510" end="01:24:54.090" style="s2">not to take true things or things you</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.360" end="01:24:56.460" style="s2">think are true and put them on the board</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.090" end="01:24:59.490" style="s2">and make them read them and stuff like</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.460" end="01:25:02.850" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t work sure what does work</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.490" end="01:25:05.850" style="s2">is showing them here is something that</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.850" end="01:25:06.720" style="s2">you could have right and here is why you</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.850" end="01:25:09.060" style="s2">want it</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.720" end="01:25:11.010" style="s2">right and here is the path to get it</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.060" end="01:25:12.720" style="s2">sure and it&#39;s not necessarily going to</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.010" end="01:25:15.240" style="s2">be simple but the point is you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.720" end="01:25:17.490" style="s2">it for you right you&#39;re doing it so that</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.240" end="01:25:19.230" style="s2">at the end of this process you have a</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.490" end="01:25:21.720" style="s2">tool to wield that will serve you for</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.230" end="01:25:24.960" style="s2">the rest of your life yes right and if</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.720" end="01:25:27.180" style="s2">done well right if done in a way you</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.960" end="01:25:28.590" style="s2">know you do have to cultivate the trust</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.180" end="01:25:31.050" style="s2">of the people that you are teaching</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.590" end="01:25:32.370" style="s2">right right they really because if you</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.050" end="01:25:34.140" style="s2">just walk in there and you say that</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.370" end="01:25:37.590" style="s2">right they won&#39;t believe you right right</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.140" end="01:25:39.810" style="s2">they&#39;re too jaded right if you allow</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.590" end="01:25:41.730" style="s2">them to see your humanity which goes to</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.810" end="01:25:44.610" style="s2">what you were saying before allow them</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.730" end="01:25:45.440" style="s2">to see your humanity you show them that</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.610" end="01:25:46.590" style="s2">you are dealing with them</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.440" end="01:25:49.590" style="s2">straightforwardly</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.590" end="01:25:53.490" style="s2">yeah and then you place the thing on</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.590" end="01:25:55.740" style="s2">offer in my case it was evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.490" end="01:25:57.660" style="s2">toolkit that allows you to understand</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.740" end="01:25:59.310" style="s2">what is otherwise a very confusing</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.660" end="01:26:03.410" style="s2">predicament that you&#39;ve landed in as a</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.310" end="01:26:07.290" style="s2">human being okay that you will be more</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.410" end="01:26:08.730" style="s2">in control mm-hmm of your life right</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.290" end="01:26:10.500" style="s2">yeah you want to understand your love</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.730" end="01:26:13.920" style="s2">life and not be so confused by it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.500" end="01:26:15.990" style="s2">just so happens that love evolved in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.920" end="01:26:18.420" style="s2">context of evolution and that that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.990" end="01:26:20.310" style="s2">it&#39;s so confusing and there&#39;s a map yeah</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.420" end="01:26:23.520" style="s2">do you want it you know that yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.310" end="01:26:27.450" style="s2">so anyway theory of Enchantment I guess</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.520" end="01:26:30.330" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering whether or not your use of</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.450" end="01:26:33.330" style="s2">enchantment and my use of seduction or</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.330" end="01:26:34.530" style="s2">are these synonyms are close or do you</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.330" end="01:26:37.320" style="s2">mean something else I think that they</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.530" end="01:26:40.760" style="s2">are close I don&#39;t think they&#39;re synonyms</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.320" end="01:26:43.170" style="s2">I think that they are certainly related</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.760" end="01:26:45.240" style="s2">to each other</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.170" end="01:26:46.980" style="s2">enchantment so I picked the word in</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.240" end="01:26:48.510" style="s2">chairman because at the time I was doing</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.980" end="01:26:50.850" style="s2">this research paper that ended up being</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.510" end="01:26:52.830" style="s2">the catalyst for the startup and I was</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.850" end="01:26:55.290" style="s2">reading a book by Guy Kawasaki former</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.830" end="01:26:57.660" style="s2">marketing director of Apple who wrote a</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.290" end="01:26:59.460" style="s2">book called enchantment and enchantment</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.660" end="01:27:03.720" style="s2">he defines it as like the process by</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.460" end="01:27:04.800" style="s2">which you delight someone with a idea or</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.720" end="01:27:06.330" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a person or a thing</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.800" end="01:27:07.830" style="s2">whatever your delighting them to feel</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.330" end="01:27:10.470" style="s2">fundamentally delighted and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.830" end="01:27:12.210" style="s2">the similar to sort of like here&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.470" end="01:27:16.800" style="s2">map do you want it that&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.210" end="01:27:19.650" style="s2">delighting them in a way but I think the</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.800" end="01:27:21.870" style="s2">difference between the two is that well</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.650" end="01:27:23.880" style="s2">I guess one of the differences that</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.870" end="01:27:27.120" style="s2">comes to mind is that in your scenario</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.880" end="01:27:29.760" style="s2">the delight comes in the fact that the</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.120" end="01:27:32.250" style="s2">person is going out on an adventure to</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.760" end="01:27:34.080" style="s2">try to go obtain a thing right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.250" end="01:27:36.260" style="s2">where the delight comes from whereas in</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.080" end="01:27:40.950" style="s2">my curriculum the delight comes from</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.260" end="01:27:42.720" style="s2">simply recognizing yourself and certain</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.950" end="01:27:46.590" style="s2">truths about the world in things that</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.720" end="01:27:50.310" style="s2">you did not know contained or could</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.590" end="01:27:52.500" style="s2">resonate with you on that level so this</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.310" end="01:27:55.530" style="s2">this is great this is better than I okay</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.500" end="01:27:59.610" style="s2">it sounds to me like the distinction is</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.530" end="01:28:01.560" style="s2">one between delight and entice yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.610" end="01:28:02.370" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about is enticed yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.560" end="01:28:04.230" style="s2">talk about delight</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.370" end="01:28:07.260" style="s2">yeah yeah and I like both of these</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.230" end="01:28:09.960" style="s2">they&#39;re neighboring tool yeah and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.260" end="01:28:12.840" style="s2">yeah and it goes to something that I</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.960" end="01:28:14.670" style="s2">also came to believe I don&#39;t know when</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.840" end="01:28:19.110" style="s2">it actually dawned on me consciously but</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.670" end="01:28:21.420" style="s2">by the end of my teaching career I had</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.110" end="01:28:25.140" style="s2">come to believe that most of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.420" end="01:28:27.810" style="s2">obstacle to students acquiring a deep</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.140" end="01:28:28.830" style="s2">understanding of things was not about</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.810" end="01:28:31.470" style="s2">content</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.830" end="01:28:34.650" style="s2">okay it&#39;s about motivation okay their</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.470" end="01:28:37.620" style="s2">motivation well the teachers motivation</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.650" end="01:28:39.810" style="s2">sort of sets the course the teachers</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.620" end="01:28:41.190" style="s2">motivation is screwed up sure it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.810" end="01:28:43.500" style="s2">hard even if the students are well</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.190" end="01:28:46.800" style="s2">motivated for it to go anywhere positive</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.500" end="01:28:50.550" style="s2">but in general students are badly wired</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.800" end="01:28:51.090" style="s2">to acquire useful stuff okay the one</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.550" end="01:28:53.540" style="s2">thing II</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.090" end="01:28:56.880" style="s2">the really good students yeah tend to be</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.540" end="01:28:59.159" style="s2">wired to please the authority figure at</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.880" end="01:29:01.710" style="s2">the front of the room and so they end up</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.159" end="01:29:03.690" style="s2">inadvertently effectively gaming the</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.710" end="01:29:06.239" style="s2">system because they get good at getting</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.690" end="01:29:09.000" style="s2">a pat on the head from the teacher and I</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.239" end="01:29:11.340" style="s2">know from experience somebody who gets</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.000" end="01:29:12.599" style="s2">really good at that game right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.340" end="01:29:14.400" style="s2">getting straight A&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.599" end="01:29:16.139" style="s2">but what they&#39;ve learned is how to</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.400" end="01:29:17.659" style="s2">please that person and one of two things</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.139" end="01:29:20.909" style="s2">happens to them when they graduate</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.659" end="01:29:24.000" style="s2">either that person at the front of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.909" end="01:29:26.070" style="s2">room gets replaced by a boss right and</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.000" end="01:29:27.389" style="s2">now they&#39;ve become a cog because what</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.070" end="01:29:30.800" style="s2">they&#39;ve got right that is pleasing</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.389" end="01:29:33.510" style="s2">somebody who has authority of RAM or</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.800" end="01:29:34.710" style="s2">they can&#39;t figure out what to do right</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.510" end="01:29:35.909" style="s2">because the person at the front of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.710" end="01:29:38.699" style="s2">room was the source of their motivation</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.909" end="01:29:40.920" style="s2">right okay right and so yeah in some</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.699" end="01:29:43.170" style="s2">sense you have to if I&#39;ve run into a</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.920" end="01:29:45.719" style="s2">student who&#39;s very capable hmm but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.170" end="01:29:48.449" style="s2">not internally motivated mm-hmm that</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.719" end="01:29:50.849" style="s2">becomes my focus okay my point is look</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.449" end="01:29:52.679" style="s2">you got a hazard built into you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.849" end="01:29:54.510" style="s2">got everything you need to succeed sir</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.679" end="01:29:56.520" style="s2">but you&#39;ve got a hazard built into you</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.510" end="01:29:59.670" style="s2">which is that until you take over your</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.520" end="01:30:01.290" style="s2">own ability to direct your ship you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.670" end="01:30:04.380" style="s2">either gonna belong to somebody else or</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.290" end="01:30:05.909" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be adrift sure so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.380" end="01:30:07.530" style="s2">motivation is the key so anyway you</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.909" end="01:30:10.889" style="s2">could do this with delight and you can</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.530" end="01:30:15.530" style="s2">do this with entice they both work play</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.889" end="01:30:18.210" style="s2">on the motivate but the Buffy oh I see</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.530" end="01:30:20.760" style="s2">does it is it affected by the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.210" end="01:30:24.270" style="s2">it&#39;s the authoritarian saying here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.760" end="01:30:26.909" style="s2">road map you might want to try to follow</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.270" end="01:30:30.110" style="s2">it that&#39;s a really interesting meaning</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.909" end="01:30:32.190" style="s2">presumably anyone should be able to</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.110" end="01:30:34.349" style="s2">replace the role of the authoritarian</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.190" end="01:30:36.210" style="s2">and say it and if it&#39;s powerful if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.349" end="01:30:38.070" style="s2">enticing enough then the person will do</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.210" end="01:30:41.730" style="s2">it regardless of who&#39;s also a Rotarian</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.070" end="01:30:46.139" style="s2">staying it saying to do it is I really</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.730" end="01:30:49.230" style="s2">like that yeah I think it so we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.139" end="01:30:51.469" style="s2">playing with a model where you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.230" end="01:30:54.830" style="s2">bad actors who have taken advantage of a</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.469" end="01:30:57.150" style="s2">set of stories and rules that is</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.830" end="01:30:59.250" style="s2">essentially structured to be gamed but</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.150" end="01:31:02.719" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying it goes a step beyond</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.250" end="01:31:05.010" style="s2">that I think and that in effect we have</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.719" end="01:31:07.980" style="s2">predisposed people</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.010" end="01:31:10.290" style="s2">to follow bad leaders by telling them</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.980" end="01:31:14.970" style="s2">the key thing to do is to make somebody</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.290" end="01:31:17.100" style="s2">with power happy sure that fits for me</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.970" end="01:31:18.870" style="s2">sure I do think that that is a part of</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.100" end="01:31:20.460" style="s2">what&#39;s going on but but there are</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.870" end="01:31:23.000" style="s2">competing stories though that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.460" end="01:31:27.150" style="s2">because we also tell other stories</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.000" end="01:31:29.400" style="s2">culturally yes but the I think the thing</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.150" end="01:31:35.330" style="s2">that I find most frightening about the</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.400" end="01:31:37.680" style="s2">intersectional story is that it offers</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.330" end="01:31:42.090" style="s2">people are you know especially young</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.680" end="01:31:44.190" style="s2">people tend to be looking for the</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.090" end="01:31:46.620" style="s2">equivalent of a get-rich-quick scheme</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.190" end="01:31:48.510" style="s2">okay some rapid way that they can get to</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.620" end="01:31:51.500" style="s2">the place where they don&#39;t have to worry</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.510" end="01:31:54.540" style="s2">about money and sure any of the other</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.500" end="01:31:56.970" style="s2">difficult things to acquire in life and</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.540" end="01:32:00.120" style="s2">so somebody who&#39;s selling a story in</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.970" end="01:32:01.950" style="s2">which hey guess what you can find out</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.120" end="01:32:03.780" style="s2">where you are in a magical pecking order</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.950" end="01:32:06.870" style="s2">right here&#39;s the intersectional map</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.780" end="01:32:09.030" style="s2">right you&#39;re on it somewhere right find</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.870" end="01:32:11.040" style="s2">yourself right right now what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.030" end="01:32:12.990" style="s2">gonna do the intersectional map defines</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.040" end="01:32:15.330" style="s2">a future in which we&#39;re gonna turn the</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.990" end="01:32:16.980" style="s2">tables right right and so the people who</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.330" end="01:32:18.030" style="s2">were way ahead they&#39;re gonna be way</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.980" end="01:32:19.770" style="s2">behind because they don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.030" end="01:32:22.260" style="s2">intersectional points at all right right</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.770" end="01:32:24.590" style="s2">and so the fact is this is not likely to</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.260" end="01:32:27.810" style="s2">be very compelling to people with</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.590" end="01:32:29.400" style="s2">marginal sure intersectional credentials</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.810" end="01:32:32.370" style="s2">but there are a whole lot of people who</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.400" end="01:32:34.980" style="s2">have multiple axes on which they will</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.370" end="01:32:38.280" style="s2">see themselves as oppressed and the</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.980" end="01:32:41.160" style="s2">point is will huh if I sign up for this</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.280" end="01:32:43.200" style="s2">vision sure maybe it&#39;s next week that</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.160" end="01:32:45.450" style="s2">I&#39;m in a better position so there has</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.200" end="01:32:47.370" style="s2">just an alternative story that can</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.450" end="01:32:49.890" style="s2">compete with that framework and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.370" end="01:32:52.050" style="s2">turn a framework rather than story but</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.890" end="01:32:53.760" style="s2">yeah cuz intersectionality is</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.050" end="01:32:55.140" style="s2">fundamentally a story as you just said</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.760" end="01:32:57.510" style="s2">so there has to be another story that</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.140" end="01:32:59.430" style="s2">can go toe to toe with that story but I</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.510" end="01:33:00.900" style="s2">think I think you were there earlier in</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.430" end="01:33:02.550" style="s2">this conversation okay</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.900" end="01:33:04.890" style="s2">and I think the point is oh what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.550" end="01:33:08.130" style="s2">master of the slave that would argue</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.890" end="01:33:11.790" style="s2">that story no that&#39;s a good one and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.130" end="01:33:14.070" style="s2">relevant yeah but with the individual</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.790" end="01:33:16.110" style="s2">and collective oh oh because the point</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.070" end="01:33:17.680" style="s2">is that&#39;s our that intersectional story</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.110" end="01:33:20.770" style="s2">yeah is</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.680" end="01:33:24.400" style="s2">entirely collective sprite right right</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.770" end="01:33:25.990" style="s2">and that this is you know lots of people</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.400" end="01:33:28.270" style="s2">who have looked at this movement and</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.990" end="01:33:29.920" style="s2">been frightened by it have recognized</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.270" end="01:33:32.350" style="s2">that it involves a almost total</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.920" end="01:33:34.840" style="s2">deindividuation right right even the</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.350" end="01:33:36.700" style="s2">language which I understand its origin</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.840" end="01:33:40.150" style="s2">of it okay black and brown bodies sure</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.700" end="01:33:43.210" style="s2">that&#39;s yeah not a like it&#39;s very new</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.150" end="01:33:45.550" style="s2">it&#39;s very new relatively recent and I</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.210" end="01:33:46.960" style="s2">was hearing that in the 90s personally</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.550" end="01:33:49.180" style="s2">yeah I wasn&#39;t yeah I mean I think it</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.960" end="01:33:52.510" style="s2">comes from Tommy he&#39;s codes right um</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.180" end="01:33:54.340" style="s2">that would make sense make sense okay</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.510" end="01:33:56.710" style="s2">and I understand it I mean in fact in</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.340" end="01:33:58.630" style="s2">fact I even think his point yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.710" end="01:33:59.860" style="s2">understand it is right yeah right his</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.630" end="01:34:02.560" style="s2">point if I understand his point</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.860" end="01:34:05.740" style="s2">correctly his point is in order to</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.560" end="01:34:08.410" style="s2">oppress ultimately it comes down to</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.740" end="01:34:09.820" style="s2">control over somebody&#39;s body sure right</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.410" end="01:34:13.810" style="s2">sure that&#39;s how you impress somebody</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.820" end="01:34:17.560" style="s2">well hmm Baldwin might be a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.810" end="01:34:19.090" style="s2">meta and a couple of quotes from I mean</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.560" end="01:34:25.000" style="s2">this is I can&#39;t leave I&#39;m doing this but</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.090" end="01:34:27.190" style="s2">a couple of quotes from the Great</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.000" end="01:34:28.870" style="s2">Debaters Wow okay so the Great Debaters</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.190" end="01:34:32.200" style="s2">is based on with your story Denzel</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.870" end="01:34:34.720" style="s2">Washington plays this coach who coaches</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.200" end="01:34:38.350" style="s2">debaters it&#39;s during racial segregation</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.720" end="01:34:40.030" style="s2">it&#39;s a South the team in stop competing</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.350" end="01:34:41.920" style="s2">in Harvard and winning the entire like</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.030" end="01:34:44.710" style="s2">you that&#39;s what the movies about but</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.920" end="01:34:46.300" style="s2">this is incredible scene where this is</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.710" end="01:34:50.680" style="s2">one guy who&#39;s really smart really</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.300" end="01:34:52.780" style="s2">talented but also has problems with</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.680" end="01:34:53.830" style="s2">authoritarian figures and just lashing</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.780" end="01:34:55.840" style="s2">out because everything that was done to</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.830" end="01:35:00.700" style="s2">him and so Denzel Washington says to him</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.840" end="01:35:04.090" style="s2">in this monologue he explains to him how</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.700" end="01:35:06.370" style="s2">during slavery there was the development</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.090" end="01:35:08.410" style="s2">of Willie Lynch ISM which lets you what</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.370" end="01:35:12.370" style="s2">we now know as lynchings where the</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.410" end="01:35:14.680" style="s2">purpose was to brutally brutally destroy</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.370" end="01:35:17.860" style="s2">the black and brown body right</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.680" end="01:35:19.300" style="s2">physically destroy right so so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.860" end="01:35:25.020" style="s2">thomas equals this point that was the</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.300" end="01:35:27.490" style="s2">goal and he says that the goal was to</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.020" end="01:35:31.150" style="s2">keep them in line right so that they</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.490" end="01:35:34.720" style="s2">would work without questioning without</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.150" end="01:35:37.300" style="s2">protesting and so in that sense gave the</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.720" end="01:35:40.180" style="s2">body back and but they took the mind</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.300" end="01:35:42.910" style="s2">right so Denzel Washington says that was</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.180" end="01:35:45.070" style="s2">the goal keep the body take the mind and</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.910" end="01:35:48.090" style="s2">he says I am and every professor on this</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.070" end="01:35:52.150" style="s2">campus are here to help you take back</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.090" end="01:35:54.370" style="s2">keep or get back and keep your righteous</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.150" end="01:35:57.580" style="s2">mind because obviously you have lost it</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.370" end="01:35:59.410" style="s2">now I tell that story because not</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.580" end="01:36:01.600" style="s2">because what Coates is saying is it</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.410" end="01:36:03.840" style="s2">right I understand the essence of what</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.600" end="01:36:07.330" style="s2">he&#39;s saying but there has been this</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.840" end="01:36:10.510" style="s2">deeper thread I think within a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.330" end="01:36:12.490" style="s2">the ideas that have pulsated through the</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.510" end="01:36:14.500" style="s2">civil rights movement and the Harlem</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.490" end="01:36:17.320" style="s2">Renaissance movement which is that</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.500" end="01:36:20.410" style="s2">oppression is fundamentally about the</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.320" end="01:36:22.090" style="s2">spirit about the mind and it&#39;s not yes</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.410" end="01:36:24.940" style="s2">it&#39;s about the body but it&#39;s not simply</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.090" end="01:36:27.190" style="s2">about the body and so coaches mistake is</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.940" end="01:36:29.650" style="s2">in reducing the human being to the body</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.190" end="01:36:33.970" style="s2">when in fact there was this belief in a</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.650" end="01:36:36.750" style="s2">transcendent that the ultimate value lay</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.970" end="01:36:39.130" style="s2">in the mind and in human consciousness I</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.750" end="01:36:42.460" style="s2">know but I think it&#39;s relevant I know is</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.130" end="01:36:43.540" style="s2">it perfect challenges that framework it</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.460" end="01:36:46.180" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not to say that the</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.540" end="01:36:48.430" style="s2">framework isn&#39;t correct but it isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.180" end="01:36:50.230" style="s2">deepest truth yes the framework has a</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.430" end="01:36:52.900" style="s2">piece of the truth right isn&#39;t the truth</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.230" end="01:36:56.260" style="s2">right synonymous with it yes okay so</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.900" end="01:36:58.390" style="s2">this is great so the body ends up being</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.260" end="01:37:00.790" style="s2">oppressed yes it&#39;s not the entire point</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.390" end="01:37:03.970" style="s2">the intersectional movement D</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.790" end="01:37:07.600" style="s2">individuate it&#39;s allowed the minds have</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.970" end="01:37:09.190" style="s2">you taken they did they give away the</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.600" end="01:37:12.100" style="s2">Enlightenment and they gave away the</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.190" end="01:37:14.380" style="s2">mind right which is which is to give</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.100" end="01:37:16.270" style="s2">away the mind and the stories that they</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.380" end="01:37:18.270" style="s2">tell are these mind-numbing stories</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.270" end="01:37:20.950" style="s2">where achievements of an individual</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.270" end="01:37:23.410" style="s2">don&#39;t even exist they&#39;re a myth of white</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.950" end="01:37:27.370" style="s2">supremacy or something right right okay</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.410" end="01:37:29.650" style="s2">so your question then is they&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.370" end="01:37:31.270" style="s2">story which is there&#39;s a map you can</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.650" end="01:37:35.470" style="s2">find yourself on it and it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.270" end="01:37:38.140" style="s2">involve a reversal of oppression sure</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.470" end="01:37:39.490" style="s2">and so how are you gonna be in a world</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.140" end="01:37:40.360" style="s2">where we&#39;ve reversed depression how are</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.490" end="01:37:41.560" style="s2">you gonna be your probably gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.360" end="01:37:43.540" style="s2">better off than you are so this is a</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.560" end="01:37:44.769" style="s2">good story follow us sure right your</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.540" end="01:37:47.199" style="s2">question is what&#39;s the old</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.769" end="01:37:52.719" style="s2">native story right the alternative story</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.199" end="01:37:57.489" style="s2">I believe is actually and I have to say</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.719" end="01:38:00.789" style="s2">this is a story I have heard from I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.489" end="01:38:03.460" style="s2">heard it from black conservatives okay</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.789" end="01:38:05.980" style="s2">very regularly okay all right and it it</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.460" end="01:38:07.929" style="s2">has caught my attention because okay as</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.980" end="01:38:10.780" style="s2">I got in trouble for saying a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.929" end="01:38:12.099" style="s2">on Joe Rogan&#39;s program mm-hmm I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.780" end="01:38:14.880" style="s2">initially understand why there were</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.099" end="01:38:18.730" style="s2">black conservatives okay it seemed to me</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.880" end="01:38:20.230" style="s2">hard to imagine and as I&#39;ve encountered</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.730" end="01:38:22.480" style="s2">more and more of them I&#39;ve come to</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.230" end="01:38:23.079" style="s2">understand what the phenomenon isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.480" end="01:38:25.690" style="s2">it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.079" end="01:38:30.010" style="s2">deep meaning which I respect greatly but</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.690" end="01:38:32.260" style="s2">the the point is the empowerment of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.010" end="01:38:33.280" style="s2">individual hmm right these are the</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.260" end="01:38:36.909" style="s2">alternative story</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.280" end="01:38:39.309" style="s2">sure you can entice right right you can</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.909" end="01:38:41.199" style="s2">enchant right these are both mechanist</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.309" end="01:38:43.119" style="s2">but the point is do you want a tool that</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.199" end="01:38:44.139" style="s2">will make you more powerful mm-hmm well</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.119" end="01:38:46.269" style="s2">let me tell you about the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.139" end="01:38:48.610" style="s2">right the Enlightenment is that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.269" end="01:38:50.079" style="s2">the only tool but it&#39;s a major tool in</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.610" end="01:38:51.789" style="s2">that toolkit of becoming more powerful</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.079" end="01:38:56.079" style="s2">and having more control every life now</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.789" end="01:38:59.110" style="s2">here is the thing that I think when I</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.079" end="01:39:01.030" style="s2">talk to black conservatives and I hear</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.110" end="01:39:05.139" style="s2">them talking about personal</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.030" end="01:39:07.780" style="s2">responsibility right I think I know why</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.139" end="01:39:12.280" style="s2">this has become such a focus and it is</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.780" end="01:39:16.210" style="s2">because the ability to change the fate</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.280" end="01:39:19.300" style="s2">of the collective it&#39;s not great right</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.210" end="01:39:20.949" style="s2">right it&#39;s very hard to change the fate</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.300" end="01:39:23.949" style="s2">of a population on the other hand a</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.949" end="01:39:25.539" style="s2">person who decides to take charge of</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.949" end="01:39:28.630" style="s2">their future can have a tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.539" end="01:39:30.789" style="s2">impact on how far they get and how</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.630" end="01:39:33.369" style="s2">powerful they end up sure so the point</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.789" end="01:39:35.949" style="s2">is preaching personal responsibility to</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.369" end="01:39:38.710" style="s2">people actually works but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.949" end="01:39:40.090" style="s2">necessarily change than that outcome</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.710" end="01:39:41.920" style="s2">right right right</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.090" end="01:39:44.320" style="s2">it may be that you make yourself more</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.920" end="01:39:46.409" style="s2">powerful in somebody else loses you know</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.320" end="01:39:51.670" style="s2">say his name you don&#39;t know right right</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.409" end="01:39:55.929" style="s2">so the question then is as always how do</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.670" end="01:39:57.940" style="s2">you find the correct fraction right the</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.929" end="01:39:58.599" style="s2">intersectional story isn&#39;t totally wrong</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.940" end="01:40:03.300" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.599" end="01:40:05.770" style="s2">is you know there are patterns of self</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.300" end="01:40:08.500" style="s2">reinforcement where a distribution of</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.770" end="01:40:10.570" style="s2">power and well-being and wealth self</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.500" end="01:40:12.940" style="s2">reinforced sure such a pattern doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.570" end="01:40:14.280" style="s2">even need to think about race sure the</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.940" end="01:40:16.360" style="s2">extent that things weren&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.280" end="01:40:18.250" style="s2">distributed to begin with all you need</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.360" end="01:40:20.170" style="s2">is a pattern that reinforces right the</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.250" end="01:40:21.940" style="s2">existing distribution right that will</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.170" end="01:40:25.960" style="s2">continue indefinitely right</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.940" end="01:40:28.780" style="s2">so the question is how do you take the</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.960" end="01:40:31.000" style="s2">part of the story that is legitimate</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.780" end="01:40:35.829" style="s2">which is yeah we do have a chronic</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.000" end="01:40:38.560" style="s2">problem right and it does require that</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.829" end="01:40:41.020" style="s2">it be addressed on the other hand you as</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.560" end="01:40:43.510" style="s2">an individual would be a fool to</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.020" end="01:40:45.130" style="s2">surrender your mind as you say right to</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.510" end="01:40:46.420" style="s2">this process right right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.130" end="01:40:48.310" style="s2">place where you have the greatest chance</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.420" end="01:40:52.060" style="s2">all right you know beating the odds</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.310" end="01:40:54.940" style="s2">right and you know the mixture of those</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.060" end="01:40:56.320" style="s2">two messages is right what I think the</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.940" end="01:40:58.690" style="s2">universal message would be the</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.320" end="01:41:01.060" style="s2">recognition of the collective problem</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.690" end="01:41:05.079" style="s2">sure and the individual problem okay do</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.060" end="01:41:09.000" style="s2">you find that is present in anything in</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.079" end="01:41:13.540" style="s2">any story I find that it is present in</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.000" end="01:41:19.329" style="s2">individuals and tiny groups okay tiny</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.540" end="01:41:21.010" style="s2">groups well brings us back to Judaism it</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.329" end="01:41:22.900" style="s2">could be argued that Judaism is the</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.010" end="01:41:27.060" style="s2">story and I don&#39;t mean like the religion</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.900" end="01:41:30.730" style="s2">logically I mean the basic story of</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.060" end="01:41:32.650" style="s2">people enslaved in Egypt gone to the</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.730" end="01:41:34.540" style="s2">promised land that basic story has been</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.650" end="01:41:37.389" style="s2">it&#39;s no coincidence I think that that</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.540" end="01:41:40.860" style="s2">basic story has been sort of repurposed</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.389" end="01:41:44.110" style="s2">in different mediums and contemporary</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.860" end="01:41:46.119" style="s2">forms because it has both the individual</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.110" end="01:41:47.920" style="s2">and the collective element in it built</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.119" end="01:41:49.480" style="s2">within it but perhaps that&#39;s why people</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.920" end="01:41:50.860" style="s2">gravitate toward it or one of the</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.480" end="01:41:52.929" style="s2">reasons why people gravitate to what it</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.860" end="01:41:55.570" style="s2">is because it has that sort of balance</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.929" end="01:42:01.449" style="s2">to a certain extent yeah</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.570" end="01:42:06.489" style="s2">I like it and I you know there&#39;s a there</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.449" end="01:42:08.590" style="s2">is a deep connection that I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.489" end="01:42:10.430" style="s2">how far to go with here but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.590" end="01:42:15.440" style="s2">way in which</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.430" end="01:42:18.290" style="s2">if you put aside Richard Dawkins view of</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.440" end="01:42:21.440" style="s2">the way mimetic cultural transmission</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.290" end="01:42:23.870" style="s2">works in evolves and you accept what</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.440" end="01:42:28.190" style="s2">some of us see which is that these</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.870" end="01:42:30.200" style="s2">belief structures religions are in fact</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.190" end="01:42:33.050" style="s2">meme complexes that have served</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.200" end="01:42:35.930" style="s2">population is very proud of course they</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.050" end="01:42:37.160" style="s2">are right almost doesn&#39;t see it as</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.930" end="01:42:41.060" style="s2">Richard Dawkins I think at this point</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.160" end="01:42:43.550" style="s2">but that&#39;s a very I don&#39;t want to you</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.060" end="01:42:45.740" style="s2">know we don&#39;t have of course they are</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.550" end="01:42:46.880" style="s2">main complexes if by meme you mean when</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.740" end="01:42:49.000" style="s2">I think you mean by mean which are</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.880" end="01:42:52.490" style="s2">repeatable sort of like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.000" end="01:42:54.350" style="s2">transmittable yes there its heredity</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.490" end="01:42:56.000" style="s2">outside of the genome and you know I</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.350" end="01:42:57.500" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you know this but the</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.000" end="01:43:00.920" style="s2">concept of meme is Richard Dawkins</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.500" end="01:43:02.720" style="s2">concept yes I write that but when I met</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.920" end="01:43:06.220" style="s2">with him in October it was clear that he</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.720" end="01:43:09.470" style="s2">views mimetic evolution as a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.220" end="01:43:14.630" style="s2">side light what does that mean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.470" end="01:43:16.970" style="s2">minor fact oh rather than a thing the</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.630" end="01:43:18.920" style="s2">east central story yeah we&#39;re human</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.970" end="01:43:21.110" style="s2">beings and what does he think is the</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.920" end="01:43:23.720" style="s2">central story I think it&#39;s the things</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.110" end="01:43:26.690" style="s2">genes and you know there&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.720" end="01:43:31.070" style="s2">which we can steal man the Dawkins point</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.690" end="01:43:32.870" style="s2">I do think right you know I can explore</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.070" end="01:43:35.990" style="s2">this in greater depth some rough so you</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.870" end="01:43:37.580" style="s2">think the genes are in control sure</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.990" end="01:43:39.140" style="s2">right they are though I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.580" end="01:43:41.690" style="s2">that means but it means that the genes</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.140" end="01:43:43.580" style="s2">create a mind okay we serines can be</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.690" end="01:43:45.230" style="s2">transmitted they are uncharged sorry</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.580" end="01:43:48.950" style="s2">that is most unfortunate</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.230" end="01:43:52.910" style="s2">sure but sir but the point is yes the</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.950" end="01:43:54.350" style="s2">magic of humans is the meat right so the</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.910" end="01:43:57.500" style="s2">complex rights if you take the meme</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.350" end="01:43:59.720" style="s2">complex of this did your story for</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.500" end="01:44:01.730" style="s2">example you can find it in you know it</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.720" end="01:44:02.630" style="s2">just repeats itself in let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.730" end="01:44:05.120" style="s2">something contemporary</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.630" end="01:44:09.560" style="s2">oh the Lion King for example right or</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.120" end="01:44:13.340" style="s2">you know you know there&#39;s a reason why I</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.560" end="01:44:15.530" style="s2">Bob Marley gravitated toward the picking</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.340" end="01:44:17.150" style="s2">that story as a backdrop for music and</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.530" end="01:44:20.030" style="s2">sort of recreating it oh absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.150" end="01:44:22.460" style="s2">right and of course even in the black</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.030" end="01:44:23.690" style="s2">experience how that sort of overlays on</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.460" end="01:44:26.450" style="s2">to as a</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.690" end="01:44:28.670" style="s2">narrative right and which is a way to</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.450" end="01:44:31.340" style="s2">understand oneself if you can point back</p>

<p begin="01:44:46.160" end="01:44:51.560" style="s2">look back at that story and take that</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.660" end="01:44:53.480" style="s2">story and derive meaning from it and</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.560" end="01:44:56.270" style="s2">that is if their particular story right</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.480" end="01:44:57.560" style="s2">without that particular story it could</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.270" end="01:45:00.020" style="s2">have there could have been another</p>

<p begin="01:45:00.020" end="01:45:04.130" style="s2">particular as opposed to universal right</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.120" end="01:45:06.800" style="s2">it is not the that story is not the</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.130" end="01:45:08.780" style="s2">collective story of everyone it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.800" end="01:45:10.850" style="s2">particular story but that because of its</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.780" end="01:45:13.370" style="s2">particular Ness it was able to be taken</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.850" end="01:45:15.620" style="s2">and overlaid by people who also went</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.370" end="01:45:17.930" style="s2">through slavery right so now they</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.620" end="01:45:18.440" style="s2">understand now they can they can relate</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.930" end="01:45:20.300" style="s2">to that</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.440" end="01:45:22.280" style="s2">and a deeper love on a deeper level and</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.300" end="01:45:24.110" style="s2">create you know different forms of</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.280" end="01:45:26.150" style="s2">meaning and of course if you look at</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.110" end="01:45:29.360" style="s2">what black I would say black people do a</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.150" end="01:45:31.460" style="s2">gospel and music in general the gospel</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.360" end="01:45:33.260" style="s2">in particular especially songs that were</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.460" end="01:45:35.570" style="s2">that preceded gospel that were sung</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.260" end="01:45:37.970" style="s2">during slavery that took the language</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.570" end="01:45:41.390" style="s2">and the Liturgy of the Jewish story and</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.970" end="01:45:42.740" style="s2">sort of incorporated and it into what</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.390" end="01:45:46.100" style="s2">slaves at that time we&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.740" end="01:45:48.650" style="s2">as a means to overcome you know the</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.100" end="01:45:50.810" style="s2">situation I think that&#39;s an example of</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.650" end="01:45:55.280" style="s2">how something can still be particular</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.810" end="01:45:58.820" style="s2">but still affect in a positive way the</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.280" end="01:46:00.920" style="s2">whole of humanity oh it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.820" end="01:46:02.900" style="s2">beautiful and I love the Bob Marley</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.920" end="01:46:05.630" style="s2">example yeah now I hope I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.900" end="01:46:10.640" style="s2">get out of my depth here okay there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.630" end="01:46:12.290" style="s2">way yeah Bob Marley plays very much on</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.640" end="01:46:14.450" style="s2">some of the Jewish part of the story</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.290" end="01:46:17.720" style="s2">mhm very much on some of the Christian</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.450" end="01:46:22.850" style="s2">part of the story sure and there is a</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.720" end="01:46:25.040" style="s2">way in which Bob Marley corrects a piece</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.850" end="01:46:28.670" style="s2">of the Christian story and I actually</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.040" end="01:46:31.670" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting regard as malware</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.670" end="01:46:36.020" style="s2">okay now we&#39;re to keep oppressed people</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.670" end="01:46:38.000" style="s2">oppressed right the song</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.020" end="01:46:39.710" style="s2">get up stand up sure right yeah most</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.000" end="01:46:41.630" style="s2">people think great God will come from</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.710" end="01:46:44.030" style="s2">the sky right away everything and make</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.630" end="01:46:45.680" style="s2">everybody feel high great but if you</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.030" end="01:46:47.630" style="s2">know what life is worth you will look</p>

<p begin="01:46:52.940" end="01:46:56.360" style="s2">challenge a certain aspect of it</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.500" end="01:46:58.370" style="s2">absolutely challenges a certain aspect</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.360" end="01:47:00.200" style="s2">of Christianity and it to me</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.370" end="01:47:03.440" style="s2">it aleene&#39;s towards the Jewish version</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.200" end="01:47:07.070" style="s2">it does it does because Judaism isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.440" end="01:47:09.110" style="s2">overly fixated with afterlife exactly</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.070" end="01:47:11.630" style="s2">excited on the present thanks Zack doing</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.110" end="01:47:13.760" style="s2">mitzvahs now to bring in the press right</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.630" end="01:47:16.880" style="s2">at the same time however yes I will I</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.760" end="01:47:21.620" style="s2">will put a vote for this aspect of</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.880" end="01:47:25.100" style="s2">Christianity the fact of the idea of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.620" end="01:47:29.270" style="s2">afterlife yep within Christianity made</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.100" end="01:47:31.130" style="s2">it possible for black people to think to</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.270" end="01:47:36.710" style="s2">themselves while they were undergoing</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.130" end="01:47:39.470" style="s2">oppression that there is a say it there</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.710" end="01:47:42.740" style="s2">is a place outside of here mmm-hmm right</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.470" end="01:47:45.290" style="s2">there is a place beyond this realm that</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.740" end="01:47:49.040" style="s2">I am seeing and experiencing with my</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.290" end="01:47:51.770" style="s2">physical body right it the belief in the</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.040" end="01:47:53.870" style="s2">afterlife equips the mind or is a tool</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.770" end="01:47:59.150" style="s2">for the mind because it makes it it</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.870" end="01:48:00.650" style="s2">makes you able to sort of like withstand</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.150" end="01:48:02.060" style="s2">some of the blows that are happening in</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.650" end="01:48:03.680" style="s2">the present because what&#39;s important is</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.060" end="01:48:06.290" style="s2">not the present what&#39;s important is the</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.680" end="01:48:08.900" style="s2">future well in that way yeah does it not</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.290" end="01:48:11.330" style="s2">mirror dr. King&#39;s invocation of the arc</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.900" end="01:48:13.370" style="s2">of the moral universe being yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.330" end="01:48:15.290" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s same sort of right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.370" end="01:48:16.970" style="s2">inevitably going to cut right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.290" end="01:48:18.650" style="s2">inevitably going to cut it is long so</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.970" end="01:48:24.700" style="s2">anyway to go back to the meme complex</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.650" end="01:48:28.970" style="s2">yeah idea mm-hmm the thing that I the</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.700" end="01:48:31.640" style="s2">thing about memes and meme complex is</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.970" end="01:48:34.010" style="s2">that they enjoy the ability to recombine</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.640" end="01:48:37.160" style="s2">it&#39;s very much analogous to what happens</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.010" end="01:48:39.200" style="s2">with genes okay alright with two people</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.160" end="01:48:41.960" style="s2">mate they bring assurance together you</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.200" end="01:48:47.660" style="s2">get some new combination there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.960" end="01:48:49.610" style="s2">in which Christians mm-hmm if we take a</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.660" end="01:48:53.890" style="s2">phylogenetic view mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.610" end="01:48:58.040" style="s2">of these populations the Christians are</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.890" end="01:49:00.980" style="s2">in effect a species of Jews Jews</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.040" end="01:49:03.350" style="s2">effectively the ancestral okay yeah a</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.980" end="01:49:05.450" style="s2">much larger population has emerged from</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.350" end="01:49:11.650" style="s2">it yes right it dwarfs the Jewish</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.450" end="01:49:11.650" style="s2">population but so what I would say is</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.800" end="01:49:20.410" style="s2">Christians are they are phylogenetically</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.340" end="01:49:23.060" style="s2">Jewish okay modern Jews are in part</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.410" end="01:49:25.460" style="s2">culturally Christian okay they have</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.060" end="01:49:26.960" style="s2">actually adopted things from the New</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.460" end="01:49:29.000" style="s2">Testament that aren&#39;t in the Old</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.960" end="01:49:31.340" style="s2">Testament including them in their meme</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.000" end="01:49:33.340" style="s2">complex so for example monogamy mmm</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.340" end="01:49:35.810" style="s2">right so mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.340" end="01:49:38.960" style="s2">yeah and you know you can you can sort</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.810" end="01:49:41.450" style="s2">of say well Bob Marley is playing with</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.960" end="01:49:42.830" style="s2">the mixture of the Chiefs yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.450" end="01:49:44.140" style="s2">yeah I mean with the mixture of beliefs</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.830" end="01:49:46.550" style="s2">and to a particular population</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.140" end="01:49:49.520" style="s2">particularly oppressed population right</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.550" end="01:49:52.250" style="s2">that needed music right just sort of</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.520" end="01:49:56.480" style="s2">Reese crypt right they were and get them</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.250" end="01:50:00.400" style="s2">to look past the Christian obligation</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.480" end="01:50:03.290" style="s2">right just simply endure right right so</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.400" end="01:50:07.250" style="s2">Bob Marley is like somebody he&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.290" end="01:50:09.500" style="s2">a meme mixer okay in order to generate a</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.250" end="01:50:13.010" style="s2">more powerful story yeah in your sense</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.500" end="01:50:16.340" style="s2">of it this is a natural process right it</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.010" end="01:50:18.200" style="s2">has to happen you know it happens when</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.340" end="01:50:20.300" style="s2">people combine ideas and they jettison</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.200" end="01:50:22.040" style="s2">these sure opted those and they mix them</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.300" end="01:50:24.470" style="s2">and bring them in and sure so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.040" end="01:50:27.230" style="s2">there is a very powerful story to be</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.470" end="01:50:31.190" style="s2">understood if we figure out how these</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.230" end="01:50:32.690" style="s2">massive meme complexes do evolve what</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.190" end="01:50:34.370" style="s2">way it&#39;s similar to dreams in which ways</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.690" end="01:50:36.320" style="s2">it is dissimilar in one way it is</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.370" end="01:50:39.770" style="s2">subservient to genes it&#39;s gonna be a</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.320" end="01:50:41.780" style="s2">very important part of the story but in</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.770" end="01:50:43.970" style="s2">any case if we were to start looking at</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.780" end="01:50:46.640" style="s2">the world through that lens I believe we</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.970" end="01:50:48.800" style="s2">would have a great deal of power to</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.640" end="01:50:52.220" style="s2">understand patterns of history that are</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.800" end="01:50:54.290" style="s2">otherwise just simply anomalous okay</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.220" end="01:50:56.750" style="s2">because the because you will find a</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.290" end="01:50:57.670" style="s2">common story or which would be</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.750" end="01:51:00.680" style="s2">effectively Amin</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.670" end="01:51:03.290" style="s2">right because it will it will stop being</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.680" end="01:51:05.990" style="s2">difficult you know</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.290" end="01:51:08.840" style="s2">if the idea is well are you Christian or</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.990" end="01:51:11.330" style="s2">are you Jerry right right that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.840" end="01:51:13.670" style="s2">really good correct exactly it&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.330" end="01:51:16.700" style="s2">yeah you know is that a monkey or is it</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.670" end="01:51:18.560" style="s2">a primate yeah it&#39;s both right right</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.700" end="01:51:20.030" style="s2">yeah you know not every primate is a</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.560" end="01:51:21.770" style="s2">monkey but right every monkey is a</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.030" end="01:51:23.900" style="s2">primate right to the extent that</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.770" end="01:51:27.290" style="s2">Christianity is a very successful</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.900" end="01:51:29.150" style="s2">successful version of unionism that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.290" end="01:51:30.650" style="s2">important fact sure it says something</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.150" end="01:51:32.950" style="s2">about the way these two things will</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.650" end="01:51:35.680" style="s2">interrelate and to the extent that an</p>

<p begin="01:51:41.840" end="01:51:46.100" style="s2">and didn&#39;t work where the ancestors came</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.550" end="01:51:49.640" style="s2">from that&#39;s a that&#39;s a feature not a bug</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.100" end="01:51:51.470" style="s2">okay begs the question how Bob Marley</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.640" end="01:51:54.200" style="s2">then or why Bob Marley became so popular</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.470" end="01:51:55.190" style="s2">given what we just given how you just</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.200" end="01:51:57.530" style="s2">described what it was he was actually</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.190" end="01:52:00.560" style="s2">doing I think you answered it earlier</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.530" end="01:52:04.600" style="s2">okay and I think your point about the</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.560" end="01:52:08.060" style="s2">way pop culture interfaces with these</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.600" end="01:52:09.890" style="s2">ancient resonant threads mm-hmm but this</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.060" end="01:52:13.430" style="s2">is basically right yes we&#39;ve got lots of</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.890" end="01:52:15.050" style="s2">people playing with they say things they</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.430" end="01:52:17.360" style="s2">get a positive reaction sure they</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.050" end="01:52:19.700" style="s2">explore those things further sure Bob</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.360" end="01:52:22.460" style="s2">Marley was a particularly he was a</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.700" end="01:52:26.150" style="s2">genius who explored a particular</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.460" end="01:52:28.730" style="s2">quadrant that was very rich you know it</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.150" end="01:52:31.550" style="s2">didn&#39;t abandon mm-hmm the traditions of</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.730" end="01:52:34.580" style="s2">the past but it looked skeptically a</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.550" end="01:52:37.250" style="s2">part of it it embraced other parts its</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.580" end="01:52:38.630" style="s2">musically so compelling for instance</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.250" end="01:52:41.060" style="s2">that you would know far more as a</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.630" end="01:52:49.310" style="s2">musician for then I could tell you but</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.060" end="01:52:51.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which reggae is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.310" end="01:52:53.420" style="s2">know what to say it&#39;s very it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.080" end="01:52:56.870" style="s2">basic it reaches some yes very tribal</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.420" end="01:52:59.150" style="s2">yeah in the sense that it&#39;s I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.870" end="01:53:01.820" style="s2">think a lot of music that&#39;s like African</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.150" end="01:53:03.920" style="s2">or like the Caribbean like from the</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.820" end="01:53:04.700" style="s2">African Diaspora is like that it has</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.920" end="01:53:06.410" style="s2">that effect</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.700" end="01:53:08.510" style="s2">it tends have that effect on many people</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.410" end="01:53:10.280" style="s2">but there are such as African because</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.510" end="01:53:11.900" style="s2">there I found that their elements of</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.280" end="01:53:14.240" style="s2">African music that can be found in like</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.900" end="01:53:16.910" style="s2">Irish and Scottish music as well and you</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.240" end="01:53:18.650" style="s2">sort of saw it the mixture of those</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.910" end="01:53:20.750" style="s2">music origins in America to create</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.650" end="01:53:23.450" style="s2">American music anyway</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.750" end="01:53:24.680" style="s2">but yeah there so all of these this type</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.450" end="01:53:27.200" style="s2">of music that I&#39;m thinking about whether</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.680" end="01:53:30.710" style="s2">it&#39;s from Ireland or whether it&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.200" end="01:53:33.410" style="s2">Ghana it&#39;s like very much reminds you of</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.710" end="01:53:36.020" style="s2">like rootedness mm-hmm right and so I</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.410" end="01:53:37.820" style="s2">think that&#39;s why ultimately Marley was</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.020" end="01:53:38.840" style="s2">as popular because as he was because he</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.820" end="01:53:42.380" style="s2">was speaking to something that was</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.840" end="01:53:46.510" style="s2">fundamentally true and whether it</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.380" end="01:53:49.580" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to mean true in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.510" end="01:53:54.230" style="s2">sense that Sam Harris means when he says</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.580" end="01:53:57.770" style="s2">true right yep but it&#39;s a different kind</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.230" end="01:54:00.140" style="s2">of meaning but something for whatever</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.770" end="01:54:02.600" style="s2">reason or another fundamentally human</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.140" end="01:54:05.660" style="s2">beings are wired to resonate with right</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.600" end="01:54:08.300" style="s2">and are wired to respond to and perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.660" end="01:54:11.210" style="s2">we don&#39;t know the why of that story you</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.300" end="01:54:13.100" style="s2">know why that is what it is and why that</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.210" end="01:54:17.750" style="s2">is how we are wired but it is in fact</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.100" end="01:54:19.760" style="s2">how we are wired so at least it is</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.750" end="01:54:23.060" style="s2">interesting to say the least</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.760" end="01:54:24.710" style="s2">all right I have one final question I</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.060" end="01:54:29.630" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to phrase it okay but</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.710" end="01:54:32.240" style="s2">it&#39;s an idea that&#39;s been well thirty</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.630" end="01:54:34.250" style="s2">minutes and I don&#39;t know maybe not I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.240" end="01:54:37.430" style="s2">hoping so you&#39;re a musician you play</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.250" end="01:54:40.790" style="s2">guitar a little piano a real keyboard</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.430" end="01:54:42.590" style="s2">but yeah keyboards and string keyboards</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.790" end="01:54:44.420" style="s2">and string and I sing as well okay and</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.590" end="01:54:46.340" style="s2">it&#39;s worth noting that the guitar is</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.420" end="01:54:49.660" style="s2">originally an African instrument yes</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.340" end="01:54:53.770" style="s2">yeah worth noting okay so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.660" end="01:54:59.410" style="s2">rough idea okay something absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.770" end="01:55:02.480" style="s2">magical happened when European melodic</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.410" end="01:55:04.340" style="s2">sensibilities met African rhythmic</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.480" end="01:55:05.930" style="s2">sensibilities that&#39;s that&#39;s overly</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.340" end="01:55:06.560" style="s2">simplified sure let&#39;s just say in the</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.930" end="01:55:11.060" style="s2">New World</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.560" end="01:55:14.330" style="s2">sure jazz and all of its derivatives it</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.060" end="01:55:18.050" style="s2">was like a magic combination sure of</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.330" end="01:55:22.940" style="s2">things yeah and it unleashed my favorite</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.050" end="01:55:26.600" style="s2">of these traditions might be Cuban salsa</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.940" end="01:55:29.120" style="s2">okay which is in its own way kind of</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.600" end="01:55:30.650" style="s2">remained pure low happy</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.120" end="01:55:34.070" style="s2">because of the economic isolation of</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.650" end="01:55:36.260" style="s2">Cuba geralt of the the embargo but</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.070" end="01:55:37.760" style="s2">anyway something magic happened in the</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.260" end="01:55:40.910" style="s2">new world as a result of what the slave</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.760" end="01:55:42.440" style="s2">population brought and inevitably</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.910" end="01:55:44.530" style="s2">combined with the slave holding</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.440" end="01:55:47.210" style="s2">population those two musical traditions</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.530" end="01:55:49.340" style="s2">was lightning in a bottle when they when</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.210" end="01:55:51.860" style="s2">they met mm-hmm but here&#39;s the really</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.340" end="01:55:55.310" style="s2">interesting thing those same two</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.860" end="01:55:56.780" style="s2">traditions have met more than once okay</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.310" end="01:55:58.790" style="s2">all right they met in the new world and</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.780" end="01:56:00.770" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t know I call it once but</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.790" end="01:56:02.810" style="s2">basically there was some influx of</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.770" end="01:56:06.650" style="s2">slaves they brought musical traditions</p>
<p begin="01:56:02.810" end="01:56:09.340" style="s2">sure it happened but it&#39;s also now</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.650" end="01:56:14.230" style="s2">happened again mm-hmm in Africa right</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.340" end="01:56:17.090" style="s2">now what I&#39;m interested in is that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.230" end="01:56:20.180" style="s2">started listening to some of those</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.090" end="01:56:21.500" style="s2">African versions of this so you know if</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.180" end="01:56:24.260" style="s2">these were languages we would call it a</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.500" end="01:56:27.860" style="s2">Creole okay right so Creoles two</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.260" end="01:56:29.900" style="s2">languages they meet people who speak</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.860" end="01:56:31.520" style="s2">these two languages speak what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.900" end="01:56:33.890" style="s2">a pidgin which is not a full language</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.520" end="01:56:38.420" style="s2">but their children speak a Creole it was</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.890" end="01:56:39.950" style="s2">a full language that that is composed of</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.420" end="01:56:45.470" style="s2">the two or extreme languages but it is</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.950" end="01:56:48.680" style="s2">neither of them sure a musical Creole is</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.470" end="01:56:52.550" style="s2">the same thing okay but you know these</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.680" end="01:56:54.200" style="s2">artists like Habib Cote or Jane I</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.550" end="01:56:57.200" style="s2">encountered recently mm-hmm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.200" end="01:56:59.150" style="s2">interesting it reaches me even though</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.200" end="01:57:00.980" style="s2">it&#39;s not you know my tradition is a</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.150" end="01:57:03.080" style="s2">hybrid of the African sure and the</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.980" end="01:57:04.850" style="s2">European right I say sounds from rock</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.080" end="01:57:07.010" style="s2">and roll right that&#39;s that&#39;s where I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.850" end="01:57:10.040" style="s2">that&#39;s where my ear was schooled right</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.010" end="01:57:12.830" style="s2">but those I guess my point is every time</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.040" end="01:57:15.470" style="s2">you take two languages you make a Creole</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.830" end="01:57:18.500" style="s2">okay but if you take English and French</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.470" end="01:57:20.780" style="s2">and you Creole eyes it ten times you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.500" end="01:57:22.160" style="s2">get ten different Creole therapy you</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.780" end="01:57:24.110" style="s2">know this will be certain things that I</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.160" end="01:57:25.790" style="s2">will be analogous but there will be</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.110" end="01:57:27.440" style="s2">other things that are just video</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.790" end="01:57:30.200" style="s2">syncretic based on the particulars of</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.440" end="01:57:32.000" style="s2">the the hybridization event</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.200" end="01:57:34.430" style="s2">mm-hmm but I think this has happened</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.000" end="01:57:36.290" style="s2">musically and what what I&#39;m getting at</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.430" end="01:57:40.970" style="s2">is that there&#39;s a way in which the</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.290" end="01:57:41.720" style="s2">African Creole between European music</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.970" end="01:57:46.490" style="s2">and Afra</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.720" end="01:57:47.840" style="s2">can music is a second instance of what</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.490" end="01:57:51.920" style="s2">happened in the New World</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.840" end="01:57:56.600" style="s2">okay and it&#39;s very interesting to listen</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.920" end="01:57:59.770" style="s2">with a ear that arose in listening to</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.600" end="01:58:02.510" style="s2">the American the new world version of it</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.770" end="01:58:04.810" style="s2">it is very interesting to listen for the</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.510" end="01:58:07.430" style="s2">African version of it because basically</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.810" end="01:58:08.780" style="s2">it&#39;s another combination of the same two</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.430" end="01:58:10.460" style="s2">traditions right it isn&#39;t the same</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.780" end="01:58:11.840" style="s2">combination right and so it has some</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.460" end="01:58:12.920" style="s2">elements that are very familiar and some</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.840" end="01:58:16.130" style="s2">that are foreign right</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.920" end="01:58:21.890" style="s2">and I&#39;m wondering I&#39;ve seen this pattern</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.130" end="01:58:24.860" style="s2">are yeah well I mean there&#39;s one album</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.890" end="01:58:26.420" style="s2">called effets that everyone should</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.860" end="01:58:30.290" style="s2">listen to I just interviewed their</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.420" end="01:58:32.570" style="s2">bandleader for my podcast um anybody</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.290" end="01:58:35.840" style="s2">podcast yes the theory of Enchantment</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.570" end="01:58:40.370" style="s2">the theory even Sam the podcast yes but</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.840" end="01:58:43.600" style="s2">this band FA basically is based in San</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.370" end="01:58:47.510" style="s2">Juan Puerto Rico and it combines ancient</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.600" end="01:58:51.650" style="s2">like Aruban prayers with electronic</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.510" end="01:58:52.970" style="s2">drums almost so it&#39;s a it&#39;s it reminds</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.650" end="01:58:54.850" style="s2">me of what you were talking about and</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.970" end="01:58:57.680" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely contained elements</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.850" end="01:58:59.930" style="s2">contains elements of the old but the</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.680" end="01:59:01.490" style="s2">combination is what makes it new the</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.930" end="01:59:03.050" style="s2">type of combination that it is is what</p>
<p begin="01:59:01.490" end="01:59:04.850" style="s2">makes it new right because there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.050" end="01:59:06.980" style="s2">same things but it&#39;s not combined in the</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.850" end="01:59:09.740" style="s2">same way because things have changed</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.980" end="01:59:14.120" style="s2">obviously so and that has created a</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.740" end="01:59:15.860" style="s2">specific like new type of music that</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.120" end="01:59:17.780" style="s2">I&#39;ve never heard before but I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.860" end="01:59:20.660" style="s2">if I&#39;ve noticed that it&#39;s common it</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.780" end="01:59:21.760" style="s2">could it could be that I&#39;m not exposed</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.660" end="01:59:24.020" style="s2">to a lot of that type of music</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.760" end="01:59:26.600" style="s2">specifically or it could just be that I</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.020" end="01:59:28.640" style="s2">listen to a lot of old music so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.600" end="01:59:32.210" style="s2">listening to a lot of older stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.640" end="01:59:34.370" style="s2">still like speaks to me mm-hmm but I</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.210" end="01:59:36.860" style="s2">don&#39;t know I haven&#39;t I haven&#39;t seen it</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.370" end="01:59:39.140" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean it does exist okay</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.860" end="01:59:43.250" style="s2">cool what&#39;s the name of the album</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.140" end="01:59:44.960" style="s2">Etha IFE IFE all right cool there are</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.250" end="01:59:48.200" style="s2">definitely the best band I&#39;ve heard in</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.960" end="01:59:49.640" style="s2">the past probably 10 years Wow yeah</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.200" end="01:59:52.730" style="s2">that sounds pretty good I&#39;m definitely</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.640" end="01:59:54.659" style="s2">going to YouTube that check it out yeah</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.730" end="01:59:57.659" style="s2">cool all right</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.659" end="02:00:02.400" style="s2">all right final question are you are you</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.659" end="02:00:03.659" style="s2">hopeful am i hopeful yeah I mean I I am</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.400" end="02:00:06.210" style="s2">hopeful because I do believe that</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.659" end="02:00:09.330" style="s2">certain things are inevitable and I and</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.210" end="02:00:12.060" style="s2">I know for it&#39;s not just like the sort</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.330" end="02:00:14.190" style="s2">of of course it&#39;s long it&#39;s arduous you</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.060" end="02:00:16.500" style="s2">know this this arc that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.190" end="02:00:18.659" style="s2">talking about but you know what is also</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.500" end="02:00:20.460" style="s2">consistent is the hero&#39;s arc and the</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.659" end="02:00:22.560" style="s2">hero&#39;s journey which is a certain type</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.460" end="02:00:24.989" style="s2">of archetypal story pattern that is</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.560" end="02:00:27.510" style="s2">found in a lot of stories that we tell</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.989" end="02:00:30.060" style="s2">ourselves and because it&#39;s found in so</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.510" end="02:00:32.040" style="s2">many stories I am convinced that like</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.060" end="02:00:34.920" style="s2">more or less that&#39;s the story that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.040" end="02:00:37.080" style="s2">going to be able to empower individuals</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.920" end="02:00:38.219" style="s2">with healthy balance for the collective</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.080" end="02:00:40.949" style="s2">it&#39;s a story we&#39;ve been telling</p>
<p begin="02:00:38.219" end="02:00:42.780" style="s2">ourselves all along it may it may be</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.949" end="02:00:44.250" style="s2">that we have to present it in a new way</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.780" end="02:00:46.020" style="s2">similar to this new Creole that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.250" end="02:00:49.110" style="s2">created in Africa right but it will</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.020" end="02:00:50.460" style="s2">contain the same elements and we will</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.110" end="02:00:52.050" style="s2">recognize the element those elements</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.460" end="02:00:54.780" style="s2">which is precisely why we will buy the</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.050" end="02:00:57.420" style="s2">story and it&#39;s true that the story of</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.780" end="02:00:59.060" style="s2">like do this selfishly so you can gain</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.420" end="02:01:01.980" style="s2">power is also a very compelling story</p>
<p begin="02:00:59.060" end="02:01:03.780" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t have it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.980" end="02:01:05.460" style="s2">redemption there&#39;s no redemption in that</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.780" end="02:01:06.719" style="s2">story and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.460" end="02:01:10.739" style="s2">difference that&#39;s like the thing that</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.719" end="02:01:13.110" style="s2">separates the boys from the men does not</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.739" end="02:01:16.860" style="s2">have redemption in it I really like this</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.110" end="02:01:20.880" style="s2">idea and I do think that there it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.860" end="02:01:24.750" style="s2">simple to say that the the hero</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.880" end="02:01:26.250" style="s2">archetype story keeps being retold which</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.750" end="02:01:27.030" style="s2">I sometimes hear people say I did not</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.250" end="02:01:32.330" style="s2">hear you say that</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.030" end="02:01:36.380" style="s2">okay I think there is a manner in which</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.330" end="02:01:39.600" style="s2">the hero archetype story has to be</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.380" end="02:01:42.840" style="s2">reinvented for each generation mm-hm</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.600" end="02:01:45.449" style="s2">um you know that the Lord of the Rings</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.840" end="02:01:47.610" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s great story but it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.449" end="02:01:50.820" style="s2">not modern sure it&#39;s not up-to-date</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.610" end="02:01:54.980" style="s2">enough right it needed to be redone and</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.820" end="02:01:57.600" style="s2">I hope we do find that story for our</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.980" end="02:01:59.280" style="s2">cohort we&#39;re not of the same generation</p>
<p begin="02:01:57.600" end="02:02:01.230" style="s2">but you and I are seeing the same piece</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.280" end="02:02:02.639" style="s2">of history at the moment yeah I hope</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.230" end="02:02:05.310" style="s2">that we figure out the version of that</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.639" end="02:02:10.500" style="s2">story that causes</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.310" end="02:02:12.510" style="s2">people to realize I don&#39;t know that we</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.500" end="02:02:14.730" style="s2">can dance together yeah right that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.510" end="02:02:17.550" style="s2">really one people and yeah that the</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.730" end="02:02:22.350" style="s2">future in fact depends on us getting</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.550" end="02:02:23.040" style="s2">past the dangerous tribalism that have</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.350" end="02:02:25.950" style="s2">led us here</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.040" end="02:02:29.340" style="s2">yes well Haiti&#39;s a four-letter word but</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.950" end="02:02:31.950" style="s2">the future depends on love so that&#39;s</p>
