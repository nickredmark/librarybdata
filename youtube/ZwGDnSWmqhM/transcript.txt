Whenever I talk to other people how to do Future Authoring writing plan
 Usually encounter delays
 This is not surprising
 Because it is already difficult

 But the more problem is that they will think:
 "I don't know how to start writing"
 "I will do a bad job"
 "I don't like this job"
 "I want to be perfect"
 "Wait until I have time to do it"
 One reason you might not want to do it
 Not to mention there are five reasons
 So I suggest people
 Do something at will
 Even if there is only fragmentary time or a bad job
 Because you can do it
 I always tell my students when discussing master thesis with students
 Write a draft first, even if it is bad
 But we will have a short discussion first
 Because they don't think I really think like this
 Because that sounds cliché
 But not a cliché
 It's just like...
 You are a bad writer
 But if someone points a gun to your head and says:
 "You must complete your hundreds of pages of draft by next Monday"
 "Otherwise I will blow your head"
 "I don't care how bad you write"
 Then you will sit down and write obediently
 What i want to say is
 When you have a draft, you can modify it
 You can revise the draft repeatedly
 That's the most important and valuable and what you need
 You need a first draft of your own but not so good
 Jung has such a concept
 Developed from comedy
 Just
 "The liar is the pioneer of the savior"

 This is one thing i learned from
 It sounds abnormal
 Hard to believe this is true
 The catastrophe clown fool in satire
 The fool is the pioneer of the savior
 why?
 Because you are a fool in a new field
 So if you don’t want to be a fool
 You can't start a new job
 You can't start a new job, you won't make progress
 and so
 Willing to be a fool
 There is a way to change
 This is also a kind of humility
 If you are about to start your life
 Your first job can be bad
 You will get smarter as you move forward
 This is the point
 Something attracted you that's what we are going to say today
 Maybe the stars that Geppetto is looking forward to are completely wrong
 But at least that's the stars
 At least it appeared
 At least it made him move forward
 So you say when you are attracted to something
 Or interested in something
 Then you start to think should I do this
 the answer is
 "If I don't do it, there are other things I can do"
 "If it was a wrong decision?"
 This is the wrong idea!
 Don't worry you don't know anything yet
 You are just about to take a difficult step, aren't you
 You have to move, you can’t stay where you are
 I have seen many people
 They said: "I am 40 years old but I never knew what to do"
 This is not a good phenomenon
 That's bad
 You might think
 There is a form of literature reminiscent of those who are very depressed
 When they remember the past
 About the things they didn't do
 And the mistakes they committed
 This is also worth thinking about
 There is a kind of compensatory error
 This is a compensation you try after you make a mistake
 Actually you think: Okay, I want to do this
 But you are not very good at making a lot of mistakes
 It’s like: "What if I’m more focused?"
 "I shouldn't be this stupid anymore"
 You can learn from the results
 and so
 You follow your desire
 But you were like a blind man at first
 You are not sure where the end is, you are afraid to move forward
 But you decide to step out

 When you start to step out
 You can get shimmer and direction
 Because those past experiences will tell you
 When you push yourself out of the comfort zone

 Then you find that the direction you are going is wrong
 Ten steps forward
 Then you think "it doesn't seem to be here"
 "Not there, it should be here"
 You found Liu Yinghua bright another village

 You move on and you will find
 When you continue or change direction

 Like in the Egyptian desert
 You find that the brilliance you seek is also moving
 It's not a permanent thing
 When you move toward it, it moves with it, and it leads you forward.
 You would say: Am I moving towards an ideal country?
 The answer is: no, you don't know anything
 Only know when you reach the goal
 But you might have that amazing glance
 When you continue
 You will become more and more aware
 And this will be a continuous process

 Your move will look like this
 Interestingly
 All these transitions you face, the blow you face
 "Gosh! I'm in trouble"
 I seem to have died once, but recovered a little from it
 Like a phoenix on fire, reborn from every turn
 It's torture
 It's just like
 You have walked 20 miles
 But in fact you are only 3 miles ahead of your real goal
 Just 3 miles

 When you are still in place, you are in a regressive state
 You can't stand still
 Because the whole world moves forward
 If you stand still, you will be left behind
 If you don’t move forward, you will only regress



 And this is more in line with the Matthew effect:
 "Those who have everything will be awarded more"
 "Take everything from those who have nothing"
 This is a vigilance
 Don't stay where you are
 After you move forward hard
 Lessons learned at every turn

 Then you stop making such fatal mistakes
 Maybe you will find a more suitable direction in the end if you can realize
 This will already be your journey although not yet
 May be worse than this
 Or some flaws
 But it doesn't matter
 When you move forward
 You will find by yourself
 Maybe partly because the world is made up of information
 If you dig
 He will tell you something
 You will get and be ready
