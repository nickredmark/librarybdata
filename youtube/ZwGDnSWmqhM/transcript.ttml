<p begin="00:00:00.220" end="00:00:03.200" style="s2">Whenever I talk to other people how to do Future Authoring writing plan</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.320" end="00:00:04.500" style="s2"> Usually encounter delays</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.680" end="00:00:05.480" style="s2"> This is not surprising</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.660" end="00:00:06.700" style="s2"> Because it is already difficult</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.880" end="00:00:07.660" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:00:07.660" end="00:00:08.620" style="s2"> But the more problem is that they will think:</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.620" end="00:00:10.620" style="s2"> &quot;I don&#39;t know how to start writing&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.800" end="00:00:12.340" style="s2"> &quot;I will do a bad job&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.440" end="00:00:14.220" style="s2"> &quot;I don&#39;t like this job&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.220" end="00:00:16.180" style="s2"> &quot;I want to be perfect&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.180" end="00:00:18.600" style="s2"> &quot;Wait until I have time to do it&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.900" end="00:00:21.160" style="s2"> One reason you might not want to do it</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.220" end="00:00:23.440" style="s2"> Not to mention there are five reasons</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.440" end="00:00:25.080" style="s2"> So I suggest people</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.080" end="00:00:27.400" style="s2"> Do something at will</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.900" end="00:00:30.720" style="s2"> Even if there is only fragmentary time or a bad job</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.200" end="00:00:32.980" style="s2"> Because you can do it</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.140" end="00:00:36.160" style="s2"> I always tell my students when discussing master thesis with students</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.300" end="00:00:38.080" style="s2"> Write a draft first, even if it is bad</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.080" end="00:00:39.940" style="s2"> But we will have a short discussion first</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.940" end="00:00:42.000" style="s2"> Because they don&#39;t think I really think like this</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.180" end="00:00:44.375" style="s2"> Because that sounds cliché</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.375" end="00:00:46.945" style="s2"> But not a cliché</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.945" end="00:00:48.240" style="s2"> It&#39;s just like...</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.420" end="00:00:53.020" style="s2"> You are a bad writer</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.020" end="00:00:55.080" style="s2"> But if someone points a gun to your head and says:</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.220" end="00:00:59.280" style="s2"> &quot;You must complete your hundreds of pages of draft by next Monday&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.280" end="00:01:00.660" style="s2"> &quot;Otherwise I will blow your head&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.660" end="00:01:02.420" style="s2"> &quot;I don&#39;t care how bad you write&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.160" end="00:01:04.900" style="s2"> Then you will sit down and write obediently</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.900" end="00:01:06.120" style="s2"> What i want to say is</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.120" end="00:01:09.120" style="s2"> When you have a draft, you can modify it</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.220" end="00:01:11.980" style="s2"> You can revise the draft repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.980" end="00:01:14.220" style="s2"> That&#39;s the most important and valuable and what you need</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.220" end="00:01:17.060" style="s2"> You need a first draft of your own but not so good</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.680" end="00:01:20.000" style="s2"> Jung has such a concept</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.100" end="00:01:22.860" style="s2"> Developed from comedy</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.860" end="00:01:24.240" style="s2"> Just</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.240" end="00:01:26.240" style="s2"> &quot;The liar is the pioneer of the savior&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.240" end="00:01:26.940" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:01:26.940" end="00:01:29.640" style="s2"> This is one thing i learned from</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.640" end="00:01:32.240" style="s2"> It sounds abnormal</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.280" end="00:01:34.360" style="s2"> Hard to believe this is true</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.760" end="00:01:42.060" style="s2"> The catastrophe clown fool in satire</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.140" end="00:01:44.940" style="s2"> The fool is the pioneer of the savior</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.940" end="00:01:45.660" style="s2"> why?</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.660" end="00:01:47.780" style="s2"> Because you are a fool in a new field</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.980" end="00:01:49.960" style="s2"> So if you don’t want to be a fool</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.960" end="00:01:51.460" style="s2"> You can&#39;t start a new job</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.540" end="00:01:53.380" style="s2"> You can&#39;t start a new job, you won&#39;t make progress</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.380" end="00:01:54.140" style="s2"> and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.140" end="00:01:55.620" style="s2"> Willing to be a fool</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.720" end="00:01:57.660" style="s2"> There is a way to change</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.660" end="00:01:59.420" style="s2"> This is also a kind of humility</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:01.220" style="s2"> If you are about to start your life</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.220" end="00:02:02.980" style="s2"> Your first job can be bad</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.980" end="00:02:05.580" style="s2"> You will get smarter as you move forward</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.580" end="00:02:07.060" style="s2"> This is the point</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.140" end="00:02:09.260" style="s2"> Something attracted you that&#39;s what we are going to say today</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.480" end="00:02:13.580" style="s2"> Maybe the stars that Geppetto is looking forward to are completely wrong</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.580" end="00:02:15.020" style="s2"> But at least that&#39;s the stars</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.020" end="00:02:17.000" style="s2"> At least it appeared</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.000" end="00:02:19.540" style="s2"> At least it made him move forward</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.540" end="00:02:22.720" style="s2"> So you say when you are attracted to something</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.720" end="00:02:24.540" style="s2"> Or interested in something</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.540" end="00:02:26.540" style="s2"> Then you start to think should I do this</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.580" end="00:02:27.900" style="s2"> the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.020" end="00:02:30.360" style="s2"> &quot;If I don&#39;t do it, there are other things I can do&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.260" end="00:02:33.340" style="s2"> &quot;If it was a wrong decision?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.340" end="00:02:34.200" style="s2"> This is the wrong idea!</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.200" end="00:02:36.780" style="s2"> Don&#39;t worry you don&#39;t know anything yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.040" end="00:02:40.120" style="s2"> You are just about to take a difficult step, aren&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.120" end="00:02:43.840" style="s2"> You have to move, you can’t stay where you are</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.840" end="00:02:45.760" style="s2"> I have seen many people</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.760" end="00:02:49.160" style="s2"> They said: &quot;I am 40 years old but I never knew what to do&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.360" end="00:02:50.740" style="s2"> This is not a good phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.380" end="00:02:52.500" style="s2"> That&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.860" end="00:02:54.340" style="s2"> You might think</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.340" end="00:02:57.940" style="s2"> There is a form of literature reminiscent of those who are very depressed</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.945" end="00:03:00.785" style="s2"> When they remember the past</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.945" end="00:03:03.965" style="s2"> About the things they didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.965" end="00:03:06.905" style="s2"> And the mistakes they committed</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.905" end="00:03:09.880" style="s2"> This is also worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.880" end="00:03:12.680" style="s2"> There is a kind of compensatory error</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.680" end="00:03:16.120" style="s2"> This is a compensation you try after you make a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.120" end="00:03:17.960" style="s2"> Actually you think: Okay, I want to do this</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.960" end="00:03:20.820" style="s2"> But you are not very good at making a lot of mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.820" end="00:03:23.205" style="s2"> It’s like: &quot;What if I’m more focused?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.205" end="00:03:25.660" style="s2"> &quot;I shouldn&#39;t be this stupid anymore&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.660" end="00:03:29.060" style="s2"> You can learn from the results</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.060" end="00:03:30.780" style="s2"> and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.280" end="00:03:34.600" style="s2"> You follow your desire</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.720" end="00:03:37.060" style="s2"> But you were like a blind man at first</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.060" end="00:03:40.580" style="s2"> You are not sure where the end is, you are afraid to move forward</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.580" end="00:03:43.960" style="s2"> But you decide to step out</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.960" end="00:03:45.020" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:03:45.020" end="00:03:47.820" style="s2"> When you start to step out</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.880" end="00:03:50.460" style="s2"> You can get shimmer and direction</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.460" end="00:03:53.175" style="s2"> Because those past experiences will tell you</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.180" end="00:03:57.100" style="s2"> When you push yourself out of the comfort zone</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.100" end="00:03:58.100" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:03:58.105" end="00:04:01.425" style="s2"> Then you find that the direction you are going is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.440" end="00:04:03.340" style="s2"> Ten steps forward</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.340" end="00:04:05.640" style="s2"> Then you think &quot;it doesn&#39;t seem to be here&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.640" end="00:04:07.480" style="s2"> &quot;Not there, it should be here&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.480" end="00:04:10.075" style="s2"> You found Liu Yinghua bright another village</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.080" end="00:04:11.220" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:04:11.220" end="00:04:13.980" style="s2"> You move on and you will find</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.420" end="00:04:21.620" style="s2"> When you continue or change direction</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.620" end="00:04:22.120" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:04:22.220" end="00:04:25.600" style="s2"> Like in the Egyptian desert</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.600" end="00:04:29.020" style="s2"> You find that the brilliance you seek is also moving</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.080" end="00:04:30.960" style="s2"> It&#39;s not a permanent thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.960" end="00:04:34.040" style="s2"> When you move toward it, it moves with it, and it leads you forward.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.040" end="00:04:38.540" style="s2"> You would say: Am I moving towards an ideal country?</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.600" end="00:04:41.340" style="s2"> The answer is: no, you don&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:44.000" style="s2"> Only know when you reach the goal</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.000" end="00:04:45.920" style="s2"> But you might have that amazing glance</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.220" end="00:04:49.100" style="s2"> When you continue</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.300" end="00:04:52.640" style="s2"> You will become more and more aware</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.840" end="00:04:55.700" style="s2"> And this will be a continuous process</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.800" end="00:04:57.380" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:04:59.185" end="00:05:01.095" style="s2"> Your move will look like this</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.920" end="00:05:04.360" style="s2"> Interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.540" end="00:05:09.220" style="s2"> All these transitions you face, the blow you face</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.220" end="00:05:10.860" style="s2"> &quot;Gosh! I&#39;m in trouble&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:13.820" style="s2"> I seem to have died once, but recovered a little from it</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.820" end="00:05:16.620" style="s2"> Like a phoenix on fire, reborn from every turn</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:18.000" style="s2"> It&#39;s torture</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.000" end="00:05:20.740" style="s2"> It&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.740" end="00:05:24.400" style="s2"> You have walked 20 miles</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.400" end="00:05:27.140" style="s2"> But in fact you are only 3 miles ahead of your real goal</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.140" end="00:05:28.600" style="s2"> Just 3 miles</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.000" end="00:05:31.920" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:05:32.040" end="00:05:35.220" style="s2"> When you are still in place, you are in a regressive state</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.600" end="00:05:36.760" style="s2"> You can&#39;t stand still</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.280" end="00:05:39.520" style="s2"> Because the whole world moves forward</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.640" end="00:05:42.180" style="s2"> If you stand still, you will be left behind</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.340" end="00:05:46.720" style="s2"> If you don’t move forward, you will only regress</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.720" end="00:05:47.220" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:05:47.220" end="00:05:48.420" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:05:48.960" end="00:05:49.960" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:05:52.360" end="00:05:55.745" style="s2"> And this is more in line with the Matthew effect:</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.745" end="00:05:58.300" style="s2"> &quot;Those who have everything will be awarded more&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.440" end="00:06:01.500" style="s2"> &quot;Take everything from those who have nothing&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.520" end="00:06:03.000" style="s2"> This is a vigilance</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.160" end="00:06:05.360" style="s2"> Don&#39;t stay where you are</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.040" end="00:06:10.300" style="s2"> After you move forward hard</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.900" end="00:06:14.920" style="s2"> Lessons learned at every turn</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.920" end="00:06:16.520" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:06:16.520" end="00:06:19.000" style="s2"> Then you stop making such fatal mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.900" end="00:06:26.400" style="s2"> Maybe you will find a more suitable direction in the end if you can realize</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.400" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2"> This will already be your journey although not yet</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:29.300" style="s2"> May be worse than this</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.300" end="00:06:32.700" style="s2"> Or some flaws</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.700" end="00:06:34.420" style="s2"> But it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
