<p begin="00:00:15.200" end="00:00:22.880" style="s2">I&#39;ve really been trying to understand the underlying psychology of postmodernism and its relationship with neo-Marxism,</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.020" end="00:00:28.160" style="s2">and then the spread of that into the universities and the effect on the culture.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.320" end="00:00:32.740" style="s2">And what I would like to start with is a description of your understanding of that,</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.740" end="00:00:36.980" style="s2">because I&#39;ve presented to the people who are listening to me my understanding of it.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.980" end="00:00:43.360" style="s2">But I interviewed Stephen Hicks recently, and he wrote an interesting book called &quot;Explaining Postmodernism,&quot; which I liked quite a bit.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.360" end="00:00:47.620" style="s2">It&#39;s been criticized for being too right-wing, although I don&#39;t think he&#39;s right-wing at all.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.720" end="00:00:54.940" style="s2">I think maybe you could characterize him as middle-of-the-road conservative, but I would say he&#39;s more like a classic liberal.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.940" end="00:01:02.460" style="s2">But I&#39;m really curious about your views about, well, what— what Postmodernism is first of all.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.460" end="00:01:08.240" style="s2">I know you&#39;ve— you&#39;ve identified it with the— with the general tricksters Derrida and Lacan and Foucault.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.240" end="00:01:10.480" style="s2">And Foucault in particular you&#39;ve talked about.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.480" end="00:01:17.020" style="s2">But I&#39;d like to know what you think about postmodernism and also why you think it&#39;s been so attractive to people.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.020" end="00:01:25.140" style="s2">Well, my explanation is that there is no authentic 1960s point of view in any of the elite universities,</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.280" end="00:01:32.620" style="s2">but rather the most liberated minds of my generation of 1960 did not go on to graduate school.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.620" end="00:01:34.180" style="s2">I witnessed this with my own eyes.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.380" end="00:01:42.200" style="s2">I saw genuine Marxists, okay, at my college, which was the State University of New York at Binghamton, upstate New York, Harpur College,</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.200" end="00:01:48.820" style="s2">which had a huge cohort of very radical downstate New York Jews, okay, who—</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.820" end="00:01:52.100" style="s2">In fact, Harpur used to be called Berkeley East.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.100" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">I saw genuine passionate Marxists with my own eyes.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:01:58.620" style="s2">They were not word choppers.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.620" end="00:02:01.520" style="s2">They were not snide postmodernists, right?</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.520" end="00:02:04.540" style="s2">They were in-your-face aggressive.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.540" end="00:02:06.640" style="s2">They used the language of the people.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.640" end="00:02:09.220" style="s2">They had a populist and energy, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.220" end="00:02:12.092" style="s2">They dressed working class. They were nonmaterialistic, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.100" end="00:02:14.920" style="s2">These are people who lived by their own convictions.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.920" end="00:02:17.720" style="s2">They were against the graduate schools, all right?</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.720" end="00:02:23.860" style="s2">When I— When I, uh, went on to graduate school, and it became known that I was going to go to Yale,</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.860" end="00:02:29.800" style="s2">I was confronted by a leader of the radicals on campus, in broad daylight in front of everyone,</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.800" end="00:02:32.520" style="s2">who denounced me for— he said,</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.520" end="00:02:35.560" style="s2">&quot;Grad school is not where it&#39;s happening. You don&#39;t— You don&#39;t do that.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.700" end="00:02:38.300" style="s2">If you have to go to graduate school you should go to Buffalo.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.360" end="00:02:45.580" style="s2">Now, I had applied to SUNY Buffalo, because the great leftist critic Leslie Fiedler was there, who had a huge impact on me.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.580" end="00:02:50.680" style="s2">He&#39;s practically created identity politics, but without its present distortions, all right?</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.680" end="00:02:53.400" style="s2">And Norman Holland, the psychoanalytic critic was there.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.400" end="00:02:57.760" style="s2">I would have been very happy to have gone on to Buffalo, but I needed the library at Yale, so I continued on to Yale.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.760" end="00:03:05.180" style="s2">There were no radicals in the graduate schools, okay, from 1968 to &#39;72, when i was there.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.180" end="00:03:10.340" style="s2">Only one radical, Todd Gitlin, who went on to have a career success, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.520" end="00:03:17.920" style="s2">The actual radicals of the 1960s, okay, either went off— dropped out of college, or went off to create communes, right,</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.920" end="00:03:20.800" style="s2">or they were taking acid and destroyed their brains.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.820" end="00:03:22.700" style="s2">Now, I have also written about that,</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.700" end="00:03:29.140" style="s2">the destruction of the minds, okay, of the most talented members of my generation through LSD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.180" end="00:03:31.440" style="s2">It was going on all around me, right?</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.480" end="00:03:35.500" style="s2">So, what&#39;s happened is the actual legacy of the &#39;60s got truncated.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.500" end="00:03:44.180" style="s2">The idea that these post-structuralists and postmodernists are heirs of the 1960s revolution is an absolute crock, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.180" end="00:03:46.660" style="s2">What they represent, as Foucault shows—</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.660" end="00:03:53.560" style="s2">Foucault said, okay, that the biggest influence on his thinking, okay, was Samuel Beckett&#39;s &quot;Waiting for Godot,&quot; okay,</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.560" end="00:03:58.260" style="s2">which was a post-World-War-II play, written in Paris,</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.260" end="00:04:06.240" style="s2">that was about the disillusionment and nihilism experienced after Hitler went through, occupied France, right, and all of Europe was in ruins.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.240" end="00:04:09.060" style="s2">It had nothing to do with what—</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.060" end="00:04:13.300" style="s2">&quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; has nothing to do with the authentic legacy of the 1960s,</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.300" end="00:04:18.780" style="s2">which was about genuine multiculturalism, a movement toward India, toward Hinduism,</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.780" end="00:04:26.500" style="s2">a transformation of consciousness through psychedelics, which I did not take, but which I identify with totally through the music, etc., all right?</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.500" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">It was a turn toward the body.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:31.313" style="s2">It was a turn towards sensory experience, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.320" end="00:04:37.160" style="s2">Not this &quot;word-chopping&quot; thing, and this, like, cynical removal from actual experience, all right?</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.160" end="00:04:41.140" style="s2">That French import, okay, came in, okay, to the graduate schools.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.140" end="00:04:44.200" style="s2">It did not affect any genuine 1960s person.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.200" end="00:04:47.580" style="s2">The real 1960s revolution was about Jung.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.580" end="00:04:52.200" style="s2">It was about a way of seeing the cosmos in mythological terms, all right?</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.400" end="00:05:00.520" style="s2">And the Jungian contribution went on into the New Age movement of the 1970s, aside from the universities, all right?</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.520" end="00:05:04.700" style="s2">So, who took over the universities were these careerists, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.700" end="00:05:08.200" style="s2">I saw them with my own eyes. I saw what happened. I saw—</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.200" end="00:05:16.120" style="s2">I was at Yale when Derrida was being shipped over, okay, to address the, uh, you know, the students— the grad students and the faculty.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.120" end="00:05:20.300" style="s2">And I said to a fellow student, after hearing one of these guys speak—</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.300" end="00:05:24.500" style="s2">It wasn&#39;t Derrida. It was another one of the theorists.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.500" end="00:05:29.120" style="s2">I said, &quot;They are like high priests murmuring to each other.&quot; All right?</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.120" end="00:05:32.940" style="s2">This was an elitist form from the start, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.120" end="00:05:38.200" style="s2">It was not progressive. It was not revolutionary. It was reactionary.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.200" end="00:05:44.380" style="s2">It was a desperate attempt to hold on to what had happened before the 1960s sensory revolution.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.500" end="00:05:50.000" style="s2">But this postmodernist thing, okay, this trashing, okay, of the text,</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.060" end="00:05:56.600" style="s2">this— this encouragement, okay, of a superior and destructive attitude toward the work of art—</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.600" end="00:06:04.520" style="s2">We&#39;re going through it, okay, primly, with red pen in hand, finding all the evidence of sexism, check, racism, check, homophobia, check.</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.560" end="00:06:12.660" style="s2">That is not the empathic, emotional, okay, sensory-based, okay, revolution of the 1960s, right?</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.660" end="00:06:17.740" style="s2">I am sick and tired of these people claiming any kind of mantle from the 1960s. They&#39;re frauds.</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.740" end="00:06:23.940" style="s2">These people are— What happened in the 1970s was a collapse of the job market in academia, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.040" end="00:06:31.920" style="s2">All of a sudden, jobs were scarce, and this thing was there, the new and improved and shiny thing, okay, to be a theorist.</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.060" end="00:06:35.140" style="s2">And people seized on it, okay? It was institutionalized, all right?</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.140" end="00:06:38.400" style="s2">And it&#39;s an enormous betrayal of the 1960s.</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.400" end="00:06:42.900" style="s2">Okay so that- You touched on this idea of &quot;the destruction of the work of art&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.180" end="00:06:48.400" style="s2">You know, and one of the things I really liked about reading Nietzsche was his discussion of &quot;ressentiment&quot; right?</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.400" end="00:06:54.200" style="s2">-of resentment and it seems to me that tremendous amount of the motive power</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.200" end="00:06:59.400" style="s2">that drives the postmodernist- let&#39;s call It- it&#39;s not a revolution, uh-</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.500" end="00:07:05.109" style="s2">transformation seems to me to be driven by resentment about virtually anything that has any,</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.419" end="00:07:09.429" style="s2">well, what would you say... any merit of competence or aesthetic quality,</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.770" end="00:07:13.870" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s- It seems to me that that&#39;s partly rooted in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.180" end="00:07:20.000" style="s2">academic&#39;s disdain for the business world, which I think is driven by their relative economic inequality,</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.000" end="00:07:23.300" style="s2">because most people who are as intelligent as academics are,</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.300" end="00:07:28.570" style="s2">from a pure IQ point of view, make more money in the private sphere, and so I think that drives some of it.</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.570" end="00:07:35.200" style="s2">But there also seems to be this- There&#39;s a destruction, an aim for destruction of the  aesthetic quality of</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.200" end="00:07:43.600" style="s2">the literary or artistic work, its reduction to nothing but some kind of power game, and then surrounding that,</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.600" end="00:07:48.500" style="s2">the reduction of *everything* to something that approximates a power game, which I can&#39;t help but</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.500" end="00:07:53.500" style="s2">identifying with jealousy and resentment as a fundamental motivator.</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.500" end="00:07:55.300" style="s2">Does that seem reasonable to you?</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.300" end="00:08:00.579" style="s2">These professors who allege that art is nothing but an ideological movement by one elite,</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.210" end="00:08:09.900" style="s2">against the- against another group, these people are Philistines, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.000" end="00:08:13.900" style="s2">They&#39;re Philistines. They&#39;re Middlebrow, hopelessly Middlebrow.</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.900" end="00:08:17.200" style="s2">They have no sense of beauty. They have no sense of the aesthetic.</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.200" end="00:08:24.500" style="s2">Now, Marxism does indeed assert this, but Marxism tries to reconfigure the universe in terms of materialism.</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.500" end="00:08:28.500" style="s2">It sees- It does not recognize any kind of spiritual dimension.</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.600" end="00:08:34.700" style="s2">Now, I&#39;m an atheist, but i see the great world religions as enormous works of art,</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.700" end="00:08:39.700" style="s2">as the best way to understand the universe and a man&#39;s place in there.</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.700" end="00:08:44.900" style="s2">I find them enormously moving. They&#39;re like enormous poems, right?</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.900" end="00:08:50.700" style="s2">And what I have called for, the true revolution, okay, would have been to make the core curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.700" end="00:08:54.800" style="s2">of the world education, the *world*, okay, the great religions of the world.</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.000" end="00:09:01.000" style="s2">I feel that is the only way to achieve an understanding, and it&#39;s also a way to present the aesthetic,</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.000" end="00:09:10.000" style="s2">because i feel that that that the real sixties vision was about exultation, elevation, cosmic consciousness, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.000" end="00:09:16.500" style="s2">All of these things were rejected by these midgets, okay, intellectual midgets</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.500" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">who seized onto Lacan, Derrida and Foucault. It&#39;s a- my career has been in the art school, my entire career,</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:29.200" style="s2">beginning at Bennington college. So I represent a challenge to this from the perspective of Art.</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.600" end="00:09:37.700" style="s2">It is an absolute nonsense, okay, as post-Structuralism maintains, that reality is mediated by language, by words.</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.700" end="00:09:39.200" style="s2">Everything that we can know, including gender.</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.200" end="00:09:47.500" style="s2">It is absolutely madness, because I&#39;m teaching students whose majors are ceramics, ok, or dance,</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.500" end="00:09:54.300" style="s2">or who are jazz musicians, who understand reality in terms of the body, its sensory activation.</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.300" end="00:09:58.070" style="s2">So they- See, what happened was something was going on in the art world as well.</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.070" end="00:10:03.439" style="s2">I identify With Andy Warhol in pop art, okay? That was what was going on during my years in college.</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.780" end="00:10:08.500" style="s2">Everything about Andy Warhol was like, &quot;Wow! Admiration! Wow!&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.500" end="00:10:16.900" style="s2">What happened immediately after that in the arts, 1970&#39;s okay, was this collapse into a snide sort of post-Modernism also.</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.900" end="00:10:23.200" style="s2">This happened in the art world, and it was an utter misunderstanding of culture, it seems to me,</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.200" end="00:10:30.000" style="s2">by that movement in the art World. That Is, oppositional art, in my view, is dead, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.000" end="00:10:37.200" style="s2">-and what post-Modernism is, is a pathetic attempt to continue the old heroism of the Avant-garde.</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.200" end="00:10:41.300" style="s2">The Avant-garde was genuinely heroic from the early 19th Century, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.300" end="00:10:44.600" style="s2">We&#39;re talking about, you know, the corbeil, the realists, you know?</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.600" end="00:10:46.400" style="s2">We&#39;re talking about Monet and the Impressionists,</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.400" end="00:10:49.000" style="s2">people who have genuinely suffered for their radical ideas,</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.000" end="00:10:55.700" style="s2">and their innovations and so on, going right down to Picasso, and down to Jackson Pollock,</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.700" end="00:10:58.700" style="s2">who like was- who truly suffered for, you know, for his art.</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.700" end="00:11:03.800" style="s2">It was only after his death, okay, that suddenly the market was created for abstract art.</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.800" end="00:11:06.800" style="s2">Pop art killed The Avant-garde.</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.800" end="00:11:11.200" style="s2">The idea that the Avant-garde continues is an absolute delusion of the contemporary art world,</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.220" end="00:11:18.000" style="s2">which feels that it must attack, attack, attack- challenge, okay, the simplistic beliefs of the hoi polloi, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.000" end="00:11:20.340" style="s2">It&#39;s somehow the order- What? Excuse me, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.710" end="00:11:26.000" style="s2">From The Moment, okay, Andy Warhol went through and embraced the popular media,</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.000" end="00:11:32.300" style="s2">instead of having the opposition to it that serious artists have had, that was the end of Oppositional art, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.300" end="00:11:37.700" style="s2">So, we&#39;ve been going on now for 50 years: the post-modernism and academes hand-in-hand</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.700" end="00:11:44.000" style="s2">with the stupidity and infantilism that masquerades as, you know, as important art galleries everywhere,</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.300" end="00:11:48.500" style="s2">this incredible, incredible, you know, its mechanism of contemporary art,</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.500" end="00:11:51.809" style="s2">pushing things that are so hopelessly derivative,</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.120" end="00:11:57.179" style="s2">and with this idea that, once again, that the art world somehow superior view of reality,</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.179" end="00:12:00.300" style="s2">Authentic Leftism Is populist, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.300" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">It is based in working-class style, working-class language, working-class direct emotion,</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:08.300" style="s2">in an openness and brusqueness of speech, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.500" end="00:12:15.000" style="s2">-not this fancy, contorted jargon of the pseudo-leftist of academe, who are frauds.</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.000" end="00:12:21.000" style="s2">These people who manage to rise to the top at Berkeley, at Harvard, At Princeton, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.000" end="00:12:22.700" style="s2">How many of these people are radical?</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.700" end="00:12:27.000" style="s2">They are career people. They&#39;re corporate types, okay, who succeeded in-</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.000" end="00:12:31.000" style="s2">They *love* the institutional context. They know how to manipulate the bureaucracy,</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.000" end="00:12:35.300" style="s2">which has totally invaded and usurped academe everywhere, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.400" end="00:12:37.800" style="s2">These people are company-players.</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.900" end="00:12:42.000" style="s2">They could have done well in any field, okay? They love to sit on endless committees.</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.000" end="00:12:44.500" style="s2">They love bureaucratic regulation, and so on. There&#39;s not-</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.000" end="00:12:54.200" style="s2">Not one *Leftist* in American academia raised his or her voice against obscene growth of tuition costs,</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.200" end="00:12:57.000" style="s2">which have bankrupted a whole generation of young people.</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.000" end="00:13:04.300" style="s2">Not one voice to challenge that invasion by the bureaucrats, okay, absolute fascist bureaucrats, okay,</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.300" end="00:13:06.800" style="s2">with- who had a- They&#39;re like, uh,  cancerous, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.800" end="00:13:13.000" style="s2">There&#39;s so many of them, the faculty have completely lost any power in American Academia, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.000" end="00:13:15.000" style="s2">It&#39;s a scandal what has happened. I mean-</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.000" end="00:13:19.500" style="s2">And they deserve the present servitude that they&#39;re in right now, because they never protested, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.500" end="00:13:25.469" style="s2">When I- My first job at Bennington college, 1976 I was there, when there was an uprising by the faculty</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.469" end="00:13:31.480" style="s2">against encroachment by the board of trustees and the president, and It was a huge thing. It Was reported on</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.480" end="00:13:36.519" style="s2">The New York Times and so on and we pushed that president out and and there&#39;s not been a single</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.709" end="00:13:41.100" style="s2">uprising of that kind against encroachment by the trustees and by the administrations,</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.100" end="00:13:46.360" style="s2">and all these decades, passive slaves- Slaves! They *deserve* their slavery.</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.269" end="00:13:52.700" style="s2">Yep, I couldn&#39;t agree more. I&#39;ve thought the same thing about university professors for a long time.</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:56.000" style="s2">is that they get exactly what they deserve because they never stand up and say, &quot;no,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.000" end="00:14:02.949" style="s2">and the fact that- In the United States it&#39;s not quite as bad in Canada, i wouldn&#39;t say, but the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.410" end="00:14:07.000" style="s2">students have been essentially handed a bill of indentured servitude here</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.000" end="00:14:11.800" style="s2">for their student loans is absolutely beyond comprehension. You know, it seems to me that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.990" end="00:14:16.000" style="s2">bureaucracy has basically conspired to determine how to pick the pockets of</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.220" end="00:14:22.689" style="s2">The Students future earnings right and They do that By offering them an Extended adolescence With no quality control</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.120" end="00:14:30.309" style="s2">something Like That so it&#39;s a real Bargain with the devil and Antle the abandonment of any Kind of Education Actually in history and culture</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.589" end="00:14:32.828" style="s2">All right Think it&#39;s gone Along With It that is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.470" end="00:14:35.209" style="s2">Transformation into a cafeteria</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.209" end="00:14:41.169" style="s2">Kind of a Menu okay we can Pick This course or that Course of This course without any Kind of Guidance From the University about</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.170" end="00:14:46.209" style="s2">A central core curriculum That teaches you history and Chronology and Introduces you to the basics</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.759" end="00:14:53.469" style="s2">Because Oh yeah because our professors are such prima donnas they can Only teach in their little areas so we have this total</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.019" end="00:14:57.758" style="s2">Fragmentation okay the Great Art History Survey Courses are being abandoned</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.920" end="00:15:02.229" style="s2">Instead of Lincoln Because Why because graduate students are not trained to see the great</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.389" end="00:15:08.289" style="s2">Narratives or the net Wheel Because we are taught Now that Narratives are false okay so That&#39;s another issue that i&#39;d like to bring up</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.290" end="00:15:14.050" style="s2">Because One of The Things i cannot figure out is the alliance between the post modernists and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.449" end="00:15:18.699" style="s2">Neo-Marxists i can&#39;t Understand The Causal relationship There Because the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.519" end="00:15:21.758" style="s2">Tell me if you disagree with This okay because</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.339" end="00:15:24.139" style="s2">I&#39;m a Psychologist not a</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.139" end="00:15:30.188" style="s2">Sociologist and so I&#39;m dabbling in things that are outside of My Field Of expertise and There Is some danger in that but the center</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.189" end="00:15:36.909" style="s2">The Central post Modernist claim Seems to me that Because There&#39;s a Near infinite Number of Ways to interpret a complex set of</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.250" end="00:15:39.729" style="s2">Phenomena Which Which Actually happens to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.950" end="00:15:46.299" style="s2">That You can&#39;t make a case That Any of Those Modes of Interpretation are canonical and so if They&#39;re not canonical</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.330" end="00:15:48.740" style="s2">If that and if That</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.740" end="00:15:54.159" style="s2">Canonical Element Isn&#39;t Based in some Kind of Reality Then It Serves some Other Master and so the Master that it</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.380" end="00:16:00.520" style="s2">Hypothetically Serves for The post Modernists is nothing But Power Because That Seems to be everything that They believe in they don&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.590" end="00:16:03.189" style="s2">Competence They don&#39;t believe in Authority They don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.190" end="00:16:08.229" style="s2">Seem to believe in an objective World Because Everything is language mediated so it&#39;s an extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.660" end="00:16:12.760" style="s2">Cynical perspective That That Because There&#39;s an infinite Number of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.070" end="00:16:17.020" style="s2">interpretations none of Them are canonical You can attribute It everything to power and dominance</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.270" end="00:16:20.259" style="s2">okay so that Does that Seem like a Reasonable Summary of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.090" end="00:16:29.949" style="s2">Okay it&#39;s a Radical relativism Now but the strange Thing Is despite okay and so What Goes Along with that is the demolition of Grand</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.050" end="00:16:36.370" style="s2">Narratives and so That Would Be associated for Example with The rejection of Thinkers Like Jung and Eric Norman Because of Course Their</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.830" end="00:16:44.710" style="s2">Foundational Thinkers in relationship to the idea that there are embodied grand Narratives That&#39;s never Touched but Then</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.110" end="00:16:51.010" style="s2">Despite the fact that the grand narrative is Rejected There&#39;s a Neo Marxism That&#39;s Tightly Tightly allied With</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.200" end="00:16:55.450" style="s2">Post-Modernism That Also Seems to shade Into This strange identity Politics and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.210" end="00:17:02.289" style="s2">Two Things i don&#39;t understand the Causal relationship They&#39;re like The the skeptical part of me thinks That</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.780" end="00:17:09.849" style="s2">Post-Modernism Was a Was an Intellectual its Intellectual camouflage for the continuation of the Kind of Pathological</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.310" end="00:17:15.999" style="s2">Marxism That Produced the soviet union and that has no independent existence As an Intellectual field Whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.310" end="00:17:22.329" style="s2">but i still can&#39;t Understand How the post modernists can Make The no grand narrative claim</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.850" end="00:17:24.530" style="s2">But Then</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.530" end="00:17:27.099" style="s2">immerse Themselves in This grand narrative Without</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.800" end="00:17:35.349" style="s2">Anyone Pointing Out the evident contradictions like i don&#39;t understand that so what do you think about that well i can Only Speak about Literary</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.020" end="00:17:39.609" style="s2">professors Really and They Seemed to me almost Universally in the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.610" end="00:17:45.280" style="s2">To be very naive i they Seem to know nothing about Actual History political science or economics</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.530" end="00:17:49.359" style="s2">So it is simply an attitude They have an attitude it</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.790" end="00:17:53.629" style="s2">Marxism and become Simply a Badge By Which They telegraph Their</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.360" end="00:18:01.939" style="s2">Their Solidarity With a Working Class That They have nothing to do with i mean Easy and Generally nothing But contempt yes and the Thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.940" end="00:18:09.529" style="s2">Is that that the campus leftist are almost notorious for their for theirs Rather snobbish Treatment of Staff and They don&#39;t They don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.529" end="00:18:12.859" style="s2">Have Any rapport With The Actual Working Class members of The</p>

<p begin="00:18:24.419" end="00:18:29.839" style="s2">Who have Wandered into the english department and are products of a Time When</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.749" end="00:18:36.439" style="s2">During The The new criticism may wait When history of history and Psychology had Been Excluded right i Mean My</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.690" end="00:18:41.840" style="s2">Ambition okay Was i mean i love the New criticism okay as As a Style of Textual</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.940" end="00:18:44.840" style="s2">Analysis right and and that in the new criticism had</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.179" end="00:18:46.320" style="s2">Multiple Interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.320" end="00:18:52.189" style="s2">Okay that were possible okay and then They were encouraged in fact one of the one of the Great projects was made in max of</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.190" end="00:18:58.159" style="s2">Serious 20th Century Views When you had at Least Books i Adored them in college It was about Jane Austen or about you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.440" end="00:19:00.440" style="s2">Emily Bronte or about</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.869" end="00:19:08.449" style="s2">Wordsworth and They were collections of alternate views of The same Thing the idea that no alternate views and there was no</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.820" end="00:19:16.159" style="s2">Relativistic the situational Kind of an interpretive approach is nonsense okay i&#39;m but the point was we needed to restore</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.950" end="00:19:20.569" style="s2">History to literary Literary Study okay and we Needed to add</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.909" end="00:19:25.069" style="s2">Psychology to it because it was there was Great animus against freud and When i arrived in</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.320" end="00:19:31.700" style="s2">Graduate School in fact i actually went into the director of graduate studies and protested The way freud in Freudian were used as</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.009" end="00:19:36.679" style="s2">negative Terms Play in a Sneering Way by The Very Wasp professors right so we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.049" end="00:19:42.349" style="s2">Actually It Seemed Like we were moving there came in the Early 1970s Was a Great Period of Psycho</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.749" end="00:19:45.289" style="s2">Biography about Great about political Figures okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.809" end="00:19:52.368" style="s2">so i thought it&#39;s happening Let&#39;s Say and all of a Sudden It all Got Short-Circuited by This arrival You know of post structuralism and</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.679" end="00:19:56.089" style="s2">Post-Modernism in The in the in the 1970s right so i</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.760" end="00:19:59.200" style="s2">I feel i&#39;m an old Historicist, okay,</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.200" end="00:20:02.460" style="s2">not a new Historicist.  I having i think new Historicism is an absolute scam.</p>

<p begin="00:22:10.090" end="00:22:16.570" style="s2">Postmodernist Claim of Radical relativism then You completely demolish The idea That there our quality levels That are associated with Education</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.880" end="00:22:22.989" style="s2">Because Everything Becomes The same and That Seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable Justification for Maintaining Ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.170" end="00:22:26.829" style="s2">You Know like Foucault i Actually Found Him the most readable of the locka</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.230" end="00:22:31.780" style="s2">Derrida Foucault triad You can Read foucault i Read Madness and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.000" end="00:22:37.329" style="s2">Civilization and a Couple of His other Books and i thought They were Painfully obvious you know the idea That</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.610" end="00:22:41.979" style="s2">Mental disorder Is in part a Social Construct Is self-Evident to anybody</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.980" end="00:22:48.699" style="s2">Who has Even a Smattering of psychiatric training i Mean That the Real Narrow medical Types tend to to think of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.790" end="00:22:56.050" style="s2">Mental disorder Let&#39;s Say As something That might Be Purely Biological They have a pure disease Model But Nobody&#39;s Who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.330" end="00:22:58.480" style="s2">sophisticated Thinker ever Thinks That it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.700" end="00:23:04.990" style="s2">Bit Partly Because medicine Is a Brand of engineering Not a brand of science Because it&#39;s associated with Health and the</p>

<p begin="00:23:07.700" end="00:23:13.240" style="s2">Physiological Observation and socio-cultural Condition Everyone Knows That and so When i Read Madness and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.520" end="00:23:16.599" style="s2">Civilization i thought Well That&#39;s Not radical That&#39;s Just Bloody</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.970" end="00:23:24.699" style="s2">self-Evident But Well you Know Foucault&#39;s Admirers Actually Think that he began you know the entire Turn toward a Sort of Sociological</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.100" end="00:23:31.329" style="s2">you Know Grounding of Modern Psychology to social Psychology Was well well Launched in the 1920s for</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:36.640" style="s2">Examine The Levels of Ignorance of These People Who think foucault Is so original have not Read?</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.860" end="00:23:41.740" style="s2">Durkheim They&#39;ve Not Read Marks of Weber They&#39;ve never Read urban Goffman okay so in other Words Through to me</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.380" end="00:23:47.560" style="s2">Everything Is Foucault Seem obvious to me because i had Read the sources from Which he was Borrowing Without attribution</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.810" end="00:23:51.879" style="s2">So i mean Again i know these People i mean i mean in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.100" end="00:23:54.910" style="s2">Knew them in graduate school People Who went on to become these</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.400" end="00:23:57.290" style="s2">These Admirers of Foucault</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.290" end="00:24:03.849" style="s2">Lacan derrida and I know What Their training Was Their training Was Purely Within the english department That&#39;s all They ever Knew They never made</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.850" end="00:24:07.180" style="s2">Any Research Outside of That Right and so the idea so they</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.700" end="00:24:09.700" style="s2">Foucault is simply This is a Mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.950" end="00:24:17.110" style="s2">It&#39;s like a Little Tiny kit by Which they can approach everything in culture and Then and then They put the contortions of language the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.360" end="00:24:21.969" style="s2">Deliberate Labyrinth in Elitist language at The same time as pretending to be a leftist</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.100" end="00:24:26.800" style="s2">Okay this is one of the biggest Frauds Every practice so i got a Story to tell you That</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.870" end="00:24:30.500" style="s2">you Might Like Because i&#39;ve Thought a lot about that use of language you know because</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.809" end="00:24:35.989" style="s2">Language can Be Used as camouflage and so, Here&#39;s the Story i think i Got this from Robert Sapolsky?</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.720" end="00:24:38.990" style="s2">So he was talking about Zebras and</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.080" end="00:24:45.920" style="s2">Zebras Of Course have stripes and hypothetically That&#39;s associated with camouflage but it&#39;s it&#39;s not a straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.530" end="00:24:51.410" style="s2">Association Because Zebras are Black and White and They&#39;re on the veldt Along With the lions the lions are</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.480" end="00:24:58.339" style="s2">camouflage Because They are grass colored But the Bloody Zebras are Black and White you can See them like 15 miles away, so ok so</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.070" end="00:25:01.939" style="s2">Biologists Go Out to study Zebras and They&#39;re Like</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.130" end="00:25:06.619" style="s2">Making notes on a Zebra and They Watch It then they look down at Their notes and then They look up but they think oh?</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.590" end="00:25:10.340" style="s2">No, no, Which zebra i was looking at so</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.340" end="00:25:15.290" style="s2">The camouflage is Actually against The Heard Because of Zebras a Herd Animal not an individual and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.290" end="00:25:20.540" style="s2">The Black and White stripes break Up the animal against The herd so you can&#39;t identify It so this Was a</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.670" end="00:25:23.959" style="s2">Quandary for the Biologist so they did one of Two Things One Was</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.090" end="00:25:30.350" style="s2">drive a Jeep Up to the to the zebra Herd and use a dab of Red paint and Dab the horns of the zebra or</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.390" end="00:25:32.839" style="s2">tag It with an ear tag Like he used for cattle</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.660" end="00:25:35.660" style="s2">The Lions Would Kill it</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.179" end="00:25:38.040" style="s2">So as soon as it became</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.040" end="00:25:39.150" style="s2">identifiable The</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.150" end="00:25:40.280" style="s2">Predator Yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.280" end="00:25:46.219" style="s2">The predators Could organize Their Hunt Around That identify about animal That&#39;s Why you know there&#39;s the old Idea That</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.290" end="00:25:49.939" style="s2">Lions and predators Take Down the Weak animals but They don&#39;t They take down the</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.309" end="00:25:54.379" style="s2">identifiable animals so That&#39;s the Thing is if you stick your Damn hand up</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.540" end="00:26:00.829" style="s2">You Get Picked off by The predators and so One of The things that Academics seem to do is congregate together and herd-Like</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.050" end="00:26:05.300" style="s2">Entities and Then They share a language right and the language Unites them and</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.490" end="00:26:10.250" style="s2">Also Keeps Them as long as They share the same set of linguistic Tools Among Themselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.500" end="00:26:16.250" style="s2">They&#39;re they know that there isn&#39;t anybody in the in the coterie That&#39;s going to attack them or deeds</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.620" end="00:26:23.510" style="s2">Destabilize The entire herd and that Seems to me to account for that impenetrable use of language it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s Group</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.700" end="00:26:27.260" style="s2">Protection strategy and It has Absolutely nothing to do with the search for</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.630" end="00:26:32.449" style="s2">It&#39;s the Search for Security Within a System and not the desire to Expand the system</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.790" end="00:26:35.989" style="s2">But it&#39;S to me it&#39;s Blatantly Careerist Because It Was it was about</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.300" end="00:26:38.629" style="s2">Advancement and It was also about the claim that Somehow</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.759" end="00:26:45.088" style="s2">They have Like Special expertise This is a Special Technical language no One else can Understand That Only Only a Weekend But What&#39;s absurd about</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.089" end="00:26:46.059" style="s2">It absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.059" end="00:26:53.309" style="s2">Ludicrous all Right That These People These These American Academics who are imitating the contorted language of French</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.249" end="00:26:56.249" style="s2">Translations From The French okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.699" end="00:27:00.419" style="s2">When Lack Call is translated into into english Right There&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.729" end="00:27:05.879" style="s2">Contortion There okay he&#39;s what he was trying to do in french Was to break up okay the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.399" end="00:27:07.509" style="s2">Neoclassical</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.509" end="00:27:13.139" style="s2">Formulations That Descended From arras scene there Was something that Was going on there Was a Sabotage of The french language going on that Was?</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.269" end="00:27:17.429" style="s2">Necessary in france not Necessary in english We Have This long tradition of</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.649" end="00:27:21.958" style="s2">Poetry Going back to the shakespearean Chaucer We Have We Have our own language?</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.329" end="00:27:28.139" style="s2">Far more Vital Than That Than the french oh yeah the french constrain Their language all The time but my dear?</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.229" end="00:27:35.968" style="s2">Facility in Amateurism okay of American Academics trying to imitate okay a</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.549" end="00:27:38.369" style="s2">Chance a chinois</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.369" end="00:27:45.419" style="s2">okay When like Costumes something in france that is Actually not Necessary and Indeed wrong to be doing in english right the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.879" end="00:27:49.379" style="s2">Other Cynical Abandonment okay of the Great tradition of</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.719" end="00:27:56.279" style="s2">you Know of the english Departments i and iii i felt That the true Radicalism Was not about adding on other</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.679" end="00:27:58.149" style="s2">Departments okay so we have</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.149" end="00:28:04.289" style="s2">African-American Studies and You Know and and and Women&#39;s studies and so on the true radicalism would have Been Just to Shatter The</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.419" end="00:28:09.868" style="s2">Departmental structure That&#39;s What i wanted i feel that Was the authentic revolutionary Nineteen Sixties Thing to do right</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.049" end="00:28:13.978" style="s2">Tell It to blend all the literate literature studies studies Together okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.859" end="00:28:17.728" style="s2">to make Easier to make an interdisciplinary Kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.919" end="00:28:23.758" style="s2">Organization you Know closer to the british Model Where a person can Pursue related Subjects Overlapping Subjects</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.549" end="00:28:28.378" style="s2">These dip These Depart Mental Models okay are were to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.659" end="00:28:36.059" style="s2">Totalitarian to Begin With okay separating the language into fiefdom and and and What What this did to create the english What Women&#39;s studies Department</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.819" end="00:28:43.469" style="s2">Absolutely Out of The air Just Snap Your fingers and create Women Studies the english department had taken a Century to develop okay that Way?</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.469" end="00:28:48.299" style="s2">It Was a Huge argument okay within Within Within It right and all of a Sudden to create okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.580" end="00:28:49.610" style="s2">A department where they</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.610" end="00:28:55.630" style="s2">politicize agenda From The start and hey by People Without any training Whatever in that Field i Mean What should Be the what Should be</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.630" end="00:28:58.419" style="s2">The parameters of The field Which Would be the requirements of that Field How about Biology</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.909" end="00:29:01.268" style="s2">okay if you&#39;re going to be discussing gender that Should</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.269" end="00:29:06.849" style="s2">Have Been a Number One requirement okay as Part of Any Women&#39;s studies department or program but no okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.000" end="00:29:09.000" style="s2">It Was all Hands off It Was Just the</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.049" end="00:29:14.679" style="s2">Administrators Wanted To solve a public relations problem They had a Situation with Very Few Women Faculty</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.070" end="00:29:22.510" style="s2">Nationwide at a time When the women&#39;s movement had Just started up that spotlight of Attention Was Was on them they want They Needed Women</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.510" end="00:29:27.369" style="s2">Faculty Fast They Need to do with the with the women&#39;s subject on the agenda fast right so they Just like Poof</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.549" end="00:29:33.579" style="s2">Let There be Women studies okay and Now we&#39;ll Just hire some women and usually from english Departments you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.769" end="00:29:39.879" style="s2">Here and there and we&#39;ll Just Throw them together you invent it you Say What it is so That&#39;s Why women&#39;s studies Got</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.250" end="00:29:42.609" style="s2">Frozen At a Certain Point of ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.970" end="00:29:44.059" style="s2">okay of The Early</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.059" end="00:29:44.929" style="s2">1970s i was</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.929" end="00:29:52.929" style="s2">Already in Revolt From It okay i was a precursor in terms of My endorsement of feminism Before It before even Now was created Right</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.929" end="00:29:56.798" style="s2">But i couldn&#39;t yeah i couldn&#39;t even have a Conversation With Any of These Women They were?</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.169" end="00:30:01.449" style="s2">Hysterical about The subject of Biology They Knew nothing about Hormones and i i mean i i</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.669" end="00:30:02.809" style="s2">Probably Got in fistfights</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.809" end="00:30:04.309" style="s2">Over This They What People were so</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.309" end="00:30:10.658" style="s2">Convinced That Biology had nothing Whatever to do with gender differences see that also Seems to me to be related</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.659" end="00:30:14.679" style="s2">To the postmodern emphasis on power yeah Because There&#39;s a There&#39;s something?</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.990" end="00:30:20.589" style="s2">Terrible Underground Going on there that Is and i think this is the sort of Thing That Was Reflected in the soviet union</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.600" end="00:30:24.760" style="s2">Too and the especially in the 20s When there was this idea a Radical idea that You could</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.860" end="00:30:30.699" style="s2">Remake Human Beings Entirely Right Because They have no essential nature and so if your Fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.950" end="00:30:38.110" style="s2">Hypothesis is that nothing Exists Except Power and you believe That then that also Gives you the right in some sense to</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.510" end="00:30:41.829" style="s2">exercise Your Power at The Creation of the Kind of Humanity That Your</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.990" end="00:30:48.669" style="s2">Utopian Vision envisions and Then That has no that and that also Seems to me to justify the postmodern insistence That</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.919" end="00:30:50.419" style="s2">Everything is Only a Linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.419" end="00:30:56.379" style="s2">Construct It Again Goes down to the notion of Power Which derrida and Foucault and locke Our so bloody obsessed with and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.450" end="00:31:00.100" style="s2">so and It Seems to me what They&#39;re trying to do is to it to take all</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.300" end="00:31:05.159" style="s2">All the potential Power for the Creation of Human Beings to Themselves Without Any Bounding Conditions?</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.500" end="00:31:11.940" style="s2">Whatsoever right There&#39;s no History There&#39;s no biology There&#39;s and and everything Is a Fluid culture that can be</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.250" end="00:31:16.950" style="s2">Manipulated at Will and so i mean in canada there are terrible arguments Right Now about</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.500" end="00:31:24.750" style="s2">Biological essentialism Let&#39;s Say And One of The Things that Happened Which Was something i objected to precisely a Year ago is that the social</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.030" end="00:31:30.450" style="s2">constructionist view of Human Identity has Been Built now into canadian law so there&#39;s an insistence That</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.360" end="00:31:33.360" style="s2">Biological sex</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.460" end="00:31:37.710" style="s2">Gender Identity Gender Expression and Sexual Proclivity Very</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.080" end="00:31:39.490" style="s2">Independently With no causal</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.490" end="00:31:44.550" style="s2">Relationship Between Any of The levels and so That&#39;s in the law and not Only is It in the law it&#39;s being Taught</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.620" end="00:31:46.210" style="s2">Everywhere it&#39;s being taught in the armed Forces</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.210" end="00:31:51.419" style="s2">it&#39;s being taught in the police it&#39;s being taught to the Elementary School Kids and the Junior High school Kids and</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.820" end="00:31:53.820" style="s2">Underneath It all i see this terrible</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.430" end="00:31:59.460" style="s2">Striving for Arbitrary Power That&#39;s associated with This Crazy utopianism and and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.770" end="00:32:03.480" style="s2">but i still don&#39;t Exactly Understand It i don&#39;t like i don&#39;t Understand That</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.640" end="00:32:09.720" style="s2">What seems to be the hatred that motivates It that You see bubbling Up for Example in identity Politics and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.820" end="00:32:13.049" style="s2">in the desire to do nothing But Let&#39;s Say Demolish The</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.240" end="00:32:17.790" style="s2">Patriarchy It Kind of Reminds me and this is something else i wanted to talk to you about you know and</p>

<p begin="00:32:41.050" end="00:32:45.360" style="s2">Yes it&#39;s always Been staggering to me that that book hasn&#39;t had the impact that it Should</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.360" end="00:32:47.909" style="s2">Have had i Mean Young Himself in the preface to that book?</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.980" end="00:32:53.279" style="s2">Wrote that that Was the book that he wished that he would have Written it&#39;s Very Much associated With Young Symbols of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.560" end="00:32:58.110" style="s2">Transformation and It Was a Major influence on my book maps of Meaning Which Was an Attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.570" end="00:33:03.419" style="s2">Outline the universal Archetypes That are portrayed in the Kind of religious structures that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.490" end="00:33:09.840" style="s2">That You Put Forward but The thing that i really see happening and you can tell me what you think about this in annoyance book?</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.210" end="00:33:11.890" style="s2">Consciousness Which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.890" end="00:33:16.150" style="s2">Masculine symbolically Masculine for a Variety of Reasons Is is viewed as</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.730" end="00:33:18.440" style="s2">Rising Up</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.440" end="00:33:21.700" style="s2">Against The countervailing Force of Tragedy from an Underlying</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.370" end="00:33:29.319" style="s2">feminine symbolically feminine Unconsciousness Right and it&#39;s something That Can Always Be pulled back into that unconsciousness That Would Be the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:32.380" style="s2">Microcosm of That Would be The Freudian eatable mother</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.960" end="00:33:35.799" style="s2">Familial Dynamic Where the mother is so over</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.679" end="00:33:37.760" style="s2">protective and all-Encompassing</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.760" end="00:33:43.959" style="s2">That She Interferes with the development of The competence not Only of her sons but also of her Daughters of her Children in General and</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.000" end="00:33:45.890" style="s2">It seems to me that That&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.890" end="00:33:49.540" style="s2">Dynamic That&#39;s being Played Out in our society Right Now is that there&#39;s this and</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.610" end="00:33:53.140" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s related in some Way that i don&#39;t understand to this to this</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.419" end="00:34:00.579" style="s2">Insistence That all Forms of masculine Authority are nothing But Tyrannical Power so the Symbolic representation is</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.400" end="00:34:03.400" style="s2">Tyrannical Father With no</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.470" end="00:34:05.470" style="s2">Appreciation for the benevolent Father and</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.929" end="00:34:13.209" style="s2">Benevolent mother With no appreciation Whatsoever for the tyrannical mother right and That&#39;s that and because i thought of ideologies as</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.369" end="00:34:15.549" style="s2">Fragmentary Mythologies That&#39;s Where They Get Their</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.950" end="00:34:22.629" style="s2">Archetypal and Psychological Power Right and so in a Balanced representation You have the terrible mother and the great mother as?</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.060" end="00:34:25.040" style="s2">Knowing Been Laid Out so Nicely and</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.040" end="00:34:30.850" style="s2">You Have the terrible father and the Great Father so That&#39;S the fact that culture bangels you have to Death well it&#39;s also?</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.040" end="00:34:37.659" style="s2">Promoting you in developing you you have to see that as balanced and then You have the heroic and Adversarial individual but in the?</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.850" end="00:34:40.929" style="s2">Postmodern World and This Seems to be something That&#39;s increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.450" end="00:34:45.310" style="s2">Seeping Out into the culture at large you have nothing but the tyrannical father?</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.770" end="00:34:51.219" style="s2">nothing But The destructive Force of masculine consciousness and nothing but the benevolent</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.040" end="00:34:57.519" style="s2">Benevolent Great mother and It&#39;s a it&#39;s an appalling ideology and It Seems to me that it&#39;s sucking the vitality</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.310" end="00:35:04.449" style="s2">Which is Exactly What you would Expect symbolically it&#39;s sucking the Vitality of Our culture you see that with the increasing</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.359" end="00:35:06.650" style="s2">Demolition of</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.650" end="00:35:08.030" style="s2">Young men</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.030" end="00:35:12.550" style="s2">and Not Only Young men in terms of Their Academic performance Which like They&#39;re Falling Way behind</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.650" end="00:35:18.820" style="s2">in Elementary School Way behind in Junior High and Bailing Out of the universities like Mad and so and i</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.070" end="00:35:24.009" style="s2">Well The Public school Education become completely Permeated by This Kind of my anti male</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.470" end="00:35:29.519" style="s2">Propaganda i mean and i need to me public Schools are Just a form of imprisonment you Know right Now they&#39;re particularly</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.619" end="00:35:31.919" style="s2">Destructive to young men who have a Lot of physical Energy</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.920" end="00:35:38.039" style="s2">Now you know i identify as transgender gay Mic Myself away but i do not i do not</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.410" end="00:35:45.240" style="s2">require the entire world to alter itself okay to fit my particular The self-image i do believe in</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.579" end="00:35:52.919" style="s2">The Power of Hormones i believe that men Exist and Women Exist and They are biologically different i think that i think there is</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.470" end="00:35:55.000" style="s2">No cure for</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.000" end="00:36:01.019" style="s2">The Cultures ills Right Now Except If men Start standing opera in demanding That They be</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.299" end="00:36:04.889" style="s2">Respected As men okay okay so i got a question about That</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.990" end="00:36:11.069" style="s2">So so one of The Things we did a research Project a Year ago trying to figure out if there Was such a Thing as</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.069" end="00:36:15.149" style="s2">Political Correctness From a Psychometric perspective to find out if there the loose</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.819" end="00:36:17.819" style="s2">Aggregation of Beliefs Actually Clumped Together</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.950" end="00:36:24.480" style="s2">Statistically and We Actually Found two factors Which i won&#39;t go into but then we Looked at Things That predicted adherence to that That?</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.119" end="00:36:30.959" style="s2">Politically Correct Creed and There were a couple That were surprising one was being female Was a predictor</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.420" end="00:36:32.289" style="s2">The</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.289" end="00:36:38.278" style="s2">Personality attributes associated With Femininity so that Would Be Agreeableness and higher levels of negative emotion were also both</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.349" end="00:36:45.989" style="s2">independent predictors but so were symptoms of personality disorder Which i thought Was really important Because Part of What i see happening is That</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.480" end="00:36:50.639" style="s2">Like i think that Women whose relationship with men have has Been Seriously?</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.009" end="00:36:55.439" style="s2">Pathologized Cannot distinguish Between male Authority and competence and male</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.690" end="00:37:03.179" style="s2">Tyrannical Power Like They fail to differentiate because all They see is the oppressive male and then They may Have had Experiences that That?</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.809" end="00:37:10.349" style="s2">Their Experiences with men might have Been Rough enough so that That differentiation never occurred Because it has to occur</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.660" end="00:37:15.059" style="s2">And You have to have a Lot Of Experience with men and Good men do before that will occur?</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.309" end="00:37:23.099" style="s2">But It Seems to me that we&#39;re also increasingly dominated By a view of Masculinity That&#39;s Mostly Characteristic of Women who have terrible</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.410" end="00:37:29.430" style="s2">Personality disorders and Who are unable to have Healthy relationships with men Now but Here&#39;s the problem you know?</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.799" end="00:37:35.159" style="s2">This is something My Wife is pointed Out to she said well men are gonna have to stand up for Themselves but Here&#39;s the problem?</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.160" end="00:37:38.160" style="s2">I know how to stand up to a man Who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.960" end="00:37:40.050" style="s2">Whose</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.050" end="00:37:41.430" style="s2">Unfairly</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.430" end="00:37:48.020" style="s2">Trespassed Against me and the reason i know that is because the parameters for My resistance are quite well-Defined Which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.240" end="00:37:52.339" style="s2">We talk We argue we Push and then It Becomes physical</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.890" end="00:38:00.710" style="s2">Right Like If We Move Beyond The Boundaries of civil discourse we Know what the Next step is ok That&#39;s Forbidden in in</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.900" end="00:38:07.700" style="s2">Discourse with Women and so i don&#39;t think that men can control Crazy Women i don&#39;t they i really don&#39;t believe it i think That</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.700" end="00:38:13.970" style="s2">They have to Throw Their Hands up in in in in what in in it&#39;s not even disbelief</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.190" end="00:38:18.859" style="s2">It&#39;s that The cultural There&#39;s no step Forward That You can take Under Those Circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.200" end="00:38:22.460" style="s2">Because if the Man Is offensive enough and Crazy Enough The</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.130" end="00:38:26.750" style="s2">Reaction Becomes Physical Right Away or at Least The Threat is there and</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.970" end="00:38:31.550" style="s2">When men are talking to each Other in any serious Manner That Underlying Threat of</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.680" end="00:38:38.570" style="s2">Physicality is Always there especially if It&#39;s a real conversation and Keeps The Things civilized to some degree you know iF you&#39;re talking to a</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.570" end="00:38:43.669" style="s2">Man Who wouldn&#39;t fight with You under any Circumstances Whatsoever then you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.670" end="00:38:48.500" style="s2">To someone to whom you have absolutely no respect but i can&#39;t See any Way for Example</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.690" end="00:38:51.440" style="s2">There&#39;s a There&#39;s a Woman in in toronto Who&#39;s Been?</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.680" end="00:38:57.139" style="s2">Organizing This movement Let&#39;s Say Against me and some Other People who are gonna do a free speech</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.930" end="00:39:01.909" style="s2">Event and she Managed to organize quite effectively and She&#39;s quite?</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.880" end="00:39:07.339" style="s2">offensive You might Say She compared us to nazis for Example Which you know publicly</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.650" end="00:39:14.629" style="s2">Using The Swastika Which wasn&#39;t really something i was all That far in Depth but i i&#39;m defenseless against That Kind of female</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.970" end="00:39:16.970" style="s2">Insanity Because The</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.280" end="00:39:21.859" style="s2">Techniques That i would use against a Man Who was employing those tactics are Forbidden to me</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.020" end="00:39:28.159" style="s2">So i don&#39;t know like It seems to me that It isn&#39;t men that have to stand up and Say Enough of This even though</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.160" end="00:39:33.530" style="s2">That is What They Should do It Seems to me that it&#39;s same Women who have to stand up against Their Crazy</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.630" end="00:39:37.190" style="s2">sisters and Say Look enough of That enough man-Hating enough</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.589" end="00:39:42.559" style="s2">Pathology enough Bringing disgrace on us as a Gender But</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.930" end="00:39:47.570" style="s2">The problem there and then They&#39;ll Start My little tirade is that most of the Women i know</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.730" end="00:39:50.240" style="s2">Who are saying are Busy doing same Thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.779" end="00:39:55.008" style="s2">Right They&#39;re off They have Their career They have Their Family They&#39;re quite occupied and they don&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.009" end="00:40:01.519" style="s2">To have the time or maybe even the interest to go after Their Their Crazy Harpy sisters and so i don&#39;t see any</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.739" end="00:40:05.779" style="s2">regulating Force For That That terrible Femininity and It Seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.529" end="00:40:09.209" style="s2">Invading the culture and</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.209" end="00:40:13.428" style="s2">undermining The The masculine Power of the culture in a Way That&#39;s i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.619" end="00:40:16.788" style="s2">Fatal i really do Believe that i - i too believe these are</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.489" end="00:40:23.899" style="s2">Symptomatic of the decline of Western culture and We and it Will Just Go down flat i don&#39;t think People realize that you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.479" end="00:40:28.968" style="s2">Masculinity Still Exists okay in the World As a Code among Jihadists</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.309" end="00:40:36.258" style="s2">Okay and when you have passionate Masculinity okay circling the Borders like The huns and the Vandals during The roman empire</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.509" end="00:40:40.339" style="s2">That&#39;s what i see i see this culture rotting from Within okay and</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.039" end="00:40:45.049" style="s2">Disemboweling Itself Literally Now mile an Overview of Why we&#39;re having this problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.299" end="00:40:49.609" style="s2">and It comes from The fact that I&#39;m the product of an immigrant Family all four of My</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.219" end="00:40:52.489" style="s2">Grandparents and My mother were born in Italy</p>

<p begin="00:41:06.269" end="00:41:07.439" style="s2">The Agrarian era</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.439" end="00:41:14.899" style="s2">Where there was the World of men and the World of Women and the sexes had Very little to do with each Other</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.969" end="00:41:21.259" style="s2">Each had power and status in its own Realm Right and They Laughed at Each Other in in essence</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.569" end="00:41:27.738" style="s2">The Way the Women had enormous power in fact the old Women Ruled not the young Beautiful Woman Like Today but</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.959" end="00:41:33.109" style="s2">The Older You were the more you had control Over Everyone including the mating and marriage</p>

<p begin="00:45:12.350" end="00:45:16.360" style="s2">Reexamine okay this Business about your they may be we have to perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.610" end="00:45:19.059" style="s2">Accept some degree of tension and Conflict</p>

<p begin="00:45:25.970" end="00:45:31.390" style="s2">Disrespective Yeah how some how They&#39;re with their opinions When They Express them okay are not taking Seriously or or That</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.760" end="00:45:36.400" style="s2">Even Hillary Clinton Is complaining oh When your Woman write something online She&#39;s Attacked</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.830" end="00:45:41.469" style="s2">Immediately and Sorry Well Everyone&#39;s Attacked online What are you talking about the World is tough the World is</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.570" end="00:45:45.850" style="s2">Competitive okay identity Is Whole okay by conflict the idea That There&#39;s Been no</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.130" end="00:45:50.289" style="s2">Conflict That We Have to be in this back okay of approbation yes and</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.230" end="00:45:53.740" style="s2">That&#39;s the devouring Cycle That&#39;s right It&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.840" end="00:45:58.989" style="s2">Absolutely infantile and Mean It okay so a couple of Things there well the first Thing is is that the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.090" end="00:46:04.900" style="s2">AgreeaBleness trait That Divides men and Women most There&#39;s three Things that Divide Women and men most particularly from the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.120" end="00:46:10.779" style="s2">Psychrometric perspective One is that Women are more agreeable Than men and so that Seems to be the primary</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.970" end="00:46:18.520" style="s2">Maternal Dimension as far As i can Tell it&#39;s associated with a desire to avoid conflict but it&#39;s it&#39;s associated with interpersonal Closeness</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.070" end="00:46:21.699" style="s2">Compassion Politeness Women are reliably Hired</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.300" end="00:46:29.129" style="s2">Especially in the Scandinavian countries and in the countries where egalitarianism has progressed the farthest so That&#39;s where the difference is</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.800" end="00:46:33.509" style="s2">Maximized Which is one of the things James d&#39;Amour Pointed Out quite Correctly in His</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.760" end="00:46:38.999" style="s2">Infamous Google Memo okay women are higher and negative emotion so That&#39;s Anxiety and emotional Pain</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.240" end="00:46:43.139" style="s2">Now that difference is approximately the same size and again That</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.480" end="00:46:48.570" style="s2">Maximizes in egalitarian Societies Which is Extremely interesting and then The Biggest difference is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.760" end="00:46:53.790" style="s2">Difference in interest Between People and Things and so Women are more interested in people and men are more</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.860" end="00:46:57.779" style="s2">Interested in Things Which Goes Along quite Nicely with your car anecdote but</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.900" end="00:47:00.640" style="s2">The Thing about men</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.640" end="00:47:04.230" style="s2">Interacting With Men again is that It isn&#39;t That They respect each Other&#39;s Viewpoints</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.300" end="00:47:10.350" style="s2">That&#39;s not Exactly Right What happens with a Man and i know a Lot of men that i would regard is as</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.750" end="00:47:13.949" style="s2">Remarkably Tough People For One reason or another and</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.470" end="00:47:19.199" style="s2">Everything You do with them is a form of Combat Like if you want your viewpoint Taken Seriously</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.540" end="00:47:25.769" style="s2">Often you have to yell them down and like They&#39;re not gonna stop talking Unless you start talking over them you know and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.770" end="00:47:33.330" style="s2">Not like men are automatically Giving respect to other men Because that Just Doesn&#39;t Happen it&#39;s that the Combat is there and it&#39;s Expected and</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.640" end="00:47:34.840" style="s2">One of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.840" end="00:47:38.399" style="s2">and so this is part of The reason Why i think men are bailing out of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.470" end="00:47:44.520" style="s2">so much Of Academia and and maybe The Academic World in General and Maybe The World in General is That</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.740" end="00:47:50.280" style="s2">Men Actually don&#39;t have any Idea how to compete with Women Because the problem is is that if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.859" end="00:47:52.300" style="s2">Unleash Yourself</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.300" end="00:47:55.889" style="s2">Completely Then you&#39;re an absolute bully and There&#39;s no Doubt about that Because iF</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.320" end="00:47:57.400" style="s2">men unleash</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.400" end="00:48:03.510" style="s2">Themselves on other men that can Be Pretty Goddamn Brutal especially for the men that are really Tough and this so that Just Doesn&#39;t Happen</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.510" end="00:48:04.900" style="s2">With Women ever</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.900" end="00:48:11.220" style="s2">but so you can&#39;t unleash Yourself completely if you win you&#39;re a Bully if You lose While you&#39;re Just Bloody</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.320" end="00:48:14.279" style="s2">Pathetic so how the hell are you Supposed to play a game like That</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.440" end="00:48:18.060" style="s2">you Know so in i&#39;ve worked with lots of Women in law Firms in</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.520" end="00:48:24.989" style="s2">Canada For Example and and High achieving Women Like Really remarkable People i would Say and They&#39;re often</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.630" end="00:48:31.890" style="s2">Nonplussed i would Say By The attitude of the man in the law firm because They Would like to see everyone pulling together Because</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.040" end="00:48:36.929" style="s2">All Part of The same team Whereas the Manner like at Each Other&#39;s Throats in an in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.360" end="00:48:41.729" style="s2">Cooperative Way Because They want the law firm to succeed but They want</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.730" end="00:48:44.010" style="s2">To be the person Who&#39;s at the top of the success</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.200" end="00:48:49.560" style="s2">Hierarchy Right so and that that Doesn&#39;t Jive well with the more competitive or cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.840" end="00:48:53.009" style="s2">Ethos That&#39;s Part and parcel Of Agreeableness and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.500" end="00:48:58.530" style="s2">We don&#39;t really have any Idea how to integrate male and female Doormen Exactly Exactly</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.930" end="00:49:01.380" style="s2">Exactly Right This is Why i love this show</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.620" end="00:49:08.249" style="s2">a real Housewives me which is worse Than Mc scorns and Just Say It Just last night okay i was watching on an episode all</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.250" end="00:49:11.160" style="s2">Right Where the Women were at each Other okay at a Party and all in</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.470" end="00:49:12.070" style="s2">Recounting</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.070" end="00:49:17.429" style="s2">But i said this to you and but you Said this to me anyway and the men and God we Got together there and Said</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.430" end="00:49:22.560" style="s2">Well This is the way they communicate you know with each Other and you know Say in them you know men we men okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.710" end="00:49:27.570" style="s2">Just Will have a fist fight and we&#39;ll Em in ten minutes Later we&#39;re gonna have a beer at The bar Where they met next?</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.570" end="00:49:32.820" style="s2">To each Other and so i mean i have observed That Land Finland Yeah my Daughter My Daughter used to be really</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.460" end="00:49:36.840" style="s2">irritated about That Because she she like most People</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.080" end="00:49:40.080" style="s2">Was the target of feminine</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.870" end="00:49:45.419" style="s2">conspiratorial Bullying At Once She&#39;s no pushover My Daughter so this Wasn&#39;t like This Was a</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.550" end="00:49:48.060" style="s2">Continual Thing or that She Didn&#39;t know what to do about it but</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.430" end="00:49:49.810" style="s2">She had to observe</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.810" end="00:49:56.789" style="s2">These Girls conspiring Against her and then Blackening her name on on Facebook Which is part of It Part and parcel of The typical female</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.250" end="00:50:04.140" style="s2">Bullying routine Which is often reputation demolition Right That There&#39;s a Good editor on that and then She&#39;d Watch What Would Happen if</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.510" end="00:50:06.840" style="s2">My Brother or my son would have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.330" end="00:50:11.969" style="s2">Dispute with his friends you know and maybe They were drinking and there Was a dispute They&#39;d Have a fight and then The next day</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.970" end="00:50:16.169" style="s2">They were friends again and That&#39;s another Thing That strange is that like men have a Way of</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.480" end="00:50:23.010" style="s2">Bringing a conflict to a head and Resolving It right and that It isn&#39;t obvious to me that Women have that same?</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.500" end="00:50:28.890" style="s2">Perhaps You might Call It a Luxury but it&#39;s also the case that men don&#39;t know what to do when they get into a conflict</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.890" end="00:50:34.890" style="s2">With a Woman Because What the hell are you Supposed to do you know Mostly What you&#39;re supposed to do is avoid It and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.260" end="00:50:41.969" style="s2">Well i think you know i don&#39;t know whether the crosses into other countries but That there&#39;s a Certain Kind of Taunting and</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.319" end="00:50:47.778" style="s2">The Men Boys do with each Other That toughen them okay and where they don&#39;t they don&#39;t take Things Seriously but</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.880" end="00:50:53.390" style="s2">Girls Feelings Become Extremely Hurt if you Hear something like That it&#39;s Very Tough for you know again like Sarcastic</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.789" end="00:50:56.448" style="s2">Against her so i mean i do Feel that there are</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.579" end="00:51:01.429" style="s2">Profound differences Between The Sexes and in Terms of Emotions in Terms of communication patterns</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.529" end="00:51:04.669" style="s2">you Know my father used to say That he could never follow Women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.219" end="00:51:09.289" style="s2">Conversations he Said he said Women don&#39;t even finish Their Sentences They&#39;re there with Their Women?</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.900" end="00:51:12.170" style="s2">Understand immediately What the Other Woman is Saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.329" end="00:51:18.589" style="s2">And and you know in the way Women tend to be more interested in or have Been traditionally more interested in soap operas</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.719" end="00:51:20.958" style="s2">It&#39;s not Just The Women were home Without Jobs</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.229" end="00:51:23.479" style="s2">It&#39;s that Honestly i believe that Soap opera</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.609" end="00:51:27.558" style="s2">Does Reflect Does Mirror The Way Women talk to each Other They Say these</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.630" end="00:51:34.009" style="s2">Communication patterns have Been Built Up through Women in the World of Women okay Which Was It made sense there Was a Division of Labor</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.229" end="00:51:38.629" style="s2">Okay It wasn&#39;t Sexism against Women That There Was a Division of Labor The men went off</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.630" end="00:51:42.739" style="s2">to hunt and did the Dangerous Things the Women Stayed Around The hearth Because you had pregnant Women</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.839" end="00:51:46.818" style="s2">Nursing Women older Women okay They were cooking and so on so i feel that these</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.009" end="00:51:53.478" style="s2">Communication patterns That we&#39;re talking about have Been Built Up became over the centuries and then men had to toughen each Other</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.630" end="00:51:58.009" style="s2">okay too hard to go out in the hunting parties the native americans you know it would Be They could be gone for two weeks</p>

<p begin="00:58:33.350" end="00:58:36.879" style="s2">proposed although it&#39;S something That&#39;s probably Beyond my Power That</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.980" end="00:58:43.719" style="s2">What Should Happen is that the Universities the real content of The universities Should Be Stolen back from the universities Because They&#39;re not making Use</p>

<p begin="00:58:52.760" end="00:58:55.179" style="s2">Unsolvable problem but do you see</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.850" end="00:59:02.259" style="s2">Like All These People Who have these Postmodern neo-Marxist Agendas are completely embedded Inside the University</p>

<p begin="01:00:08.589" end="01:00:11.909" style="s2">Implicitly Accept a Hierarchy of quality right and That of Course</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.220" end="01:00:18.540" style="s2">Contradicts The Fundamental tenants of The Postmodern doctrine Which is that there are no Hierarchies of quality and you know you</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.730" end="01:00:20.589" style="s2">Talked a Little Bit earlier about the</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.589" end="01:00:24.389" style="s2">The idea that You Referred again to the idea that everything is</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.550" end="01:00:29.129" style="s2">Associated With Power and That&#39;s That&#39;s the Thing that i can&#39;t That That&#39;s the thing that i can&#39;t Help but</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.230" end="01:00:34.260" style="s2">associate with with a Kind of Personality Pathology Like You Know from a psychometric</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.569" end="01:00:39.119" style="s2">perspective The best predictors of Long-Term Success in our society are intelligence Iq</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.700" end="01:00:42.270" style="s2">Which you can Measure Very accurately and trait</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.609" end="01:00:43.599" style="s2">conscientiousness Which</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.599" end="01:00:49.469" style="s2">Actually Is a Real testament to the culture right Because What you hope is that the Smart People Who Work hard are the people who</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.470" end="01:00:54.959" style="s2">Advance no It isn&#39;t like They deserve It Exactly that isn&#39;t What i mean it&#39;s that if the culture is</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.599" end="01:01:01.139" style="s2">Harnessing The productive Power of individuals properly Then It Should differentially Reward People Who are smart and</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.329" end="01:01:06.119" style="s2">Conscientious Because They&#39;re going to do a bunch of Really interesting Work for the rest of Us and that That&#39;s Very well-Established</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.430" end="01:01:10.530" style="s2">Finding it&#39;s it&#39;s as Good as any finding in the social Sciences but</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.960" end="01:01:16.919" style="s2">despite that and despite the fact that everything Works Which is a Goddamn miracle of sorts There is This</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.680" end="01:01:20.129" style="s2">Consistent Story That We live in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.260" end="01:01:21.369" style="s2">Patriarchy That It&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.369" end="01:01:27.689" style="s2">oppressive That it&#39;S done nothing But Oppress Women since the Beginning of time Which is also something That Just Boggles my mind you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.760" end="01:01:31.079" style="s2">Like i know they have Sacrificed for Women and Children?</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.210" end="01:01:37.550" style="s2">Hakuna Their Lives okay for Thousands of Years You know yes there&#39;s Been Brutality but the brutality is the Minority</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.059" end="01:01:40.219" style="s2">okay yes This this is sick i</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.800" end="01:01:46.729" style="s2">Portrayal of Human History is nothing But male oppression and female victim inch i Mean This is a Way to</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.859" end="01:01:53.989" style="s2">To permanently ensure the infantilization of Women yes yes well and you Know there did you can Even make the case from a Purely logical</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.359" end="01:01:56.359" style="s2">Perspective so so Here&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.369" end="01:01:58.200" style="s2">Here&#39;s an interesting fact</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.200" end="01:02:01.129" style="s2">So most of The People Who abuse their Children</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.859" end="01:02:03.859" style="s2">were abused as Children</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.930" end="01:02:08.329" style="s2">But most of The People Who were abused as Children don&#39;t abuse their Children</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.000" end="01:02:14.179" style="s2">Right so if you look at the population of abusers They were all abused so you can Say abuse causes abuse</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.280" end="01:02:21.379" style="s2">But That&#39;s That&#39;s not a good idea because you have a specific Sample there right It&#39;s not a Random Sample What happens is that abuse?</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.540" end="01:02:28.249" style="s2">Dampens Out of Over the centuries It Doesn&#39;t propagate itself and That&#39;s obvious Because if there Was if the</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.589" end="01:02:31.699" style="s2">Hypothesis of Essential male Tyranny Was true it Would Spread</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.160" end="01:02:37.940" style="s2">Exponentially Through The Population in like three generations and There Wouldn&#39;t be an Exception at all and so What Happens is</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.010" end="01:02:42.709" style="s2">Even When there is a Tilt Towards Tyranny Let&#39;s Say in the family or even in the society That</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.380" end="01:02:48.920" style="s2">Regresses back to something That&#39;S far more Benign Very Very rapidly and you see this so</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.190" end="01:02:58.159" style="s2">One of the biggest Unexamined Issues Is the transition from the Great extended Family of old okay into the Nuclear Family and</p>

<p begin="01:07:15.640" end="01:07:19.739" style="s2">Yes okay because it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting to look at These Things from</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.020" end="01:07:21.220" style="s2">Obviously for multiple</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.220" end="01:07:27.809" style="s2">Perspectives Which is another Thing the ideologues don&#39;t do right Because for them everything Is one cause There&#39;s One That&#39;s how you can tell When</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.810" end="01:07:33.420" style="s2">You&#39;re Dealing With someone Who&#39;s ideologically Possessed is They Make everything attributable to a single cause like Power</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.670" end="01:07:38.220" style="s2">So but so one of the things That&#39;s Happened with the Nuclear Family That&#39;S quite interesting too is That</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.860" end="01:07:42.450" style="s2">Parents are older and They and They Have Fewer Children</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.030" end="01:07:47.460" style="s2">So you could imagine that that hothouse environment in some sense is being</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.220" end="01:07:50.279" style="s2">Exaggerated for a Bunch of Reasons One Is</p>

<p begin="01:07:55.870" end="01:08:01.399" style="s2">Right Because you&#39;re Not going to get another chance That&#39;s first of all you might Have had some Trouble having the Job to begin With?</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.829" end="01:08:07.639" style="s2">And you&#39;re not gonna get another chance so you&#39;ve Got all youR Eggs are in one basket so to speak and then of Course</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.160" end="01:08:09.000" style="s2">Children don&#39;t have?</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.000" end="01:08:15.439" style="s2">The Number of Siblings They used to have and one of The Things That&#39;s Really Useful about having siblings is that They Keep you in</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.440" end="01:08:20.239" style="s2">Your place right They Their Primary socialization agents and i Mean that can Be Brutal</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.580" end="01:08:24.979" style="s2">and That&#39;s Reflected Say in the story of Cain and Abel you know that that internal Household</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.049" end="01:08:30.979" style="s2">Dynamic with Siblings can Be can Really Become Murderous and That has to be kept under control but i think the the</p>

<p begin="01:08:35.910" end="01:08:41.749" style="s2">tolerating Any Jobs or Any or Any testing Any dominance Hierarchy testing of The sort that you Said that men do</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.910" end="01:08:46.279" style="s2">Part of That&#39;s The consequence of being Raised by older Parents Who have Excess Resources</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.680" end="01:08:54.349" style="s2">Who have no siblings because the child is then of course special and that specialness well there seems to be an inverse</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.630" end="01:08:56.630" style="s2">relationship Between that specialness</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.000" end="01:09:04.459" style="s2">That&#39;s protected and the person&#39;s Robustness and resilience and so and then That&#39;s caught into or not caught into That&#39;s That&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.940" end="01:09:12.799" style="s2">Pandered to by the universities Which insist upon setting up a situation where no one is ever offended by anything</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.410" end="01:09:17.029" style="s2">Any Of The time and That&#39;s something i also can&#39;t understand at All Because</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.400" end="01:09:21.949" style="s2">That&#39;s a Huge point you Just made okay because it&#39;s the upper Middle Class of the</p>

<p begin="01:12:55.080" end="01:13:00.020" style="s2">Generally is Playing With Other Children right Without It being Mediated also By Screens and</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.480" end="01:13:03.169" style="s2">Technology Because That&#39;s how they formulate Their identity and</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.330" end="01:13:07.970" style="s2">That&#39;s how They Learn to play Joint Games with other People and the parent is supposed to be there as a</p>

<p begin="01:28:20.679" end="01:28:26.038" style="s2">You Know moved into its present it&#39;s a System of ideology okay it has tended to</p>

<p begin="01:30:36.679" end="01:30:41.949" style="s2">To get married Women and Women With Children into the classroom the moment that happens</p>

<p begin="01:30:47.889" end="01:30:49.879" style="s2">I&#39;m not yet That many Women the</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.879" end="01:30:56.829" style="s2">Experience Of a Married person with a Family okay talking about gender But most of the Gender Stuff Will Be Laughed out of the Room</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.959" end="01:31:00.429" style="s2">okay if you had a real mother in there who had Experience in childbirth and</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.679" end="01:31:06.279" style="s2">Head Rate and It Was raising Boys and so on well i think That&#39;s That&#39;s also a You Know something That</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.379" end="01:31:13.629" style="s2">Has Led to this This This incredible art you Know artificiality and and hysteria okay feminist Rhetoric</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.229" end="01:31:22.688" style="s2">There&#39;s an There&#39;s another strange Element to that Which iS that on the one hand the The radical feminist Types That?</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.300" end="01:31:30.639" style="s2">Neo-Marxist Post Modernists are are Very Much Opposed to the patriarchy Let&#39;s Say and That&#39;s that uni-Dimensional</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.149" end="01:31:32.239" style="s2">Ideological</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.239" end="01:31:33.889" style="s2">Representation</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.889" end="01:31:38.918" style="s2">Perhaps The Word could be Applied to a Republican Rome and That&#39;s It okay well i mean maybe It could Be Applied</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.050" end="01:31:44.320" style="s2">Usefully to Certain Kinds of Tyranny but not to a society That&#39;s Actually Functional Victorian England</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.260" end="01:31:51.249" style="s2">Arguably okay but Other Than that it to use the word patriarchy in that in a Slapdash Way so amateurish</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.219" end="01:31:54.728" style="s2">Actually You Know Just Shows People Know nothing about History</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.800" end="01:31:58.719" style="s2">Whatever have You ever Read have done no reading so and so What Confuses me about?</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.230" end="01:32:02.739" style="s2">Is that despite the fact that the patriarchy is viewed as this</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.960" end="01:32:09.819" style="s2">essentially Evil Entity and That That&#39;s associated with The masculine energy That Built This oppressive structure the</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.160" end="01:32:12.369" style="s2">Antithesis of That Which Would Actually be</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.890" end="01:32:18.220" style="s2">Femininity as far As i can Tell Which is Tightly associated with care and with Child-rearing Is also</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.500" end="01:32:23.200" style="s2">Denigrated so it&#39;s like the only proper rule for Women to adopt is a</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.480" end="01:32:27.580" style="s2">Patriarchal Rule despite The fact that the patriarchy is something That&#39;s entirely Corrupt so the</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.800" end="01:32:33.250" style="s2">Hypothesis Seems to be that the patriarchy would be Just fine if Women Ran It so</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.770" end="01:32:39.220" style="s2">no changes it&#39;s Just that It Would Just be a transformation of Leadership and somehow that Would That Would</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.590" end="01:32:46.750" style="s2">Rectify The Fundamental problem even Though it&#39;s hypothetically Supposed to be structural okay so i&#39;m gonna close with something so</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.360" end="01:32:48.590" style="s2">you Know</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.590" end="01:32:52.779" style="s2">There are Elements in My Character That are optimistic you know i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.880" end="01:32:57.609" style="s2">Looked For Example i worked for a U.N. committee and on the relationship between economic</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.890" end="01:33:02.649" style="s2">Development and sustainability and i found out a Variety of Things That were very optimistic like the fact That</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.870" end="01:33:04.330" style="s2">you Know the U.N. set out</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.330" end="01:33:09.789" style="s2">To have Poverty Between 2000 and 2015 worldwide and Actually Hit that By about?</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.100" end="01:33:17.079" style="s2">2010 right so we&#39;re in that period of the fastest transformation of The bottom strata of the World&#39;s population into something approximating</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.570" end="01:33:24.970" style="s2">Middle Class That&#39;s ever occurred and There&#39;s all These Great Technological innovations on the horizon and and It Looks to me like Things could Go</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.310" end="01:33:29.229" style="s2">Extraordinarily Well If we Were Careful but I&#39;m not Optimistic and</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.420" end="01:33:35.200" style="s2">Maybe That&#39;S me i&#39;m pessimistic because i also see that There&#39;s five or six Things happening all of Which</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.510" end="01:33:37.400" style="s2">Appear at the level of</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.400" end="01:33:42.160" style="s2">Catastrophe that are all happening at The same time and so One of The things that i&#39;d like to ask you is like</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.680" end="01:33:44.979" style="s2">What do you see happening in the next 10 Years</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.110" end="01:33:49.540" style="s2">In in the universities or in culture at large and i Mean You Just Put Forward a proposal?</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.640" end="01:33:52.539" style="s2">For The Universities for The treatment of Women Which i think is a Very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.640" end="01:33:59.079" style="s2">One Because Women do have a different Timeframe Than men but like What the hell is the proper way Forward i&#39;ve Been</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.360" end="01:34:06.100" style="s2">Encouraging Young men to tell the truth and to take responsibility and There&#39;s a Huge Market for that message but but i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.410" end="01:34:09.609" style="s2">Convinced By Any Stretch of the imagination that it&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.010" end="01:34:14.679" style="s2">What like when you look Forward You Try to be optimistic What the hell do you see</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.109" end="01:34:18.369" style="s2">Well and in the largest you know scale</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.010" end="01:34:21.010" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned about the future</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.739" end="01:34:23.719" style="s2">Western culture Because</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.719" end="01:34:29.138" style="s2">As a Student of History It Looks, too much to me like ancient Rome okay which became Over Expanded</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.809" end="01:34:33.099" style="s2">Which became a It Was at The Mercy of a Bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.449" end="01:34:37.449" style="s2">Creep okay and</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.379" end="01:34:43.869" style="s2">and in the and roman identity eventually</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.269" end="01:34:50.409" style="s2">Got Blurred okay in its incorporation of so Many different cultures Which i first seems Like a Healthy Kind of</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.629" end="01:34:54.969" style="s2">multiculturalism But Eventually Over Expand and Simply Collapse of Its own Way but iii</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.489" end="01:35:02.168" style="s2">So i am concerned about the you know whether western culture is in a rapid decline i think It Would Be Very</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.300" end="01:35:08.079" style="s2">Easy Because We Are you know so interconnected and so Over complex Very easy you know to bring it to</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.269" end="01:35:12.159" style="s2">Ruin It Would Only Take One Major Natural disaster you know to do that</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.409" end="01:35:18.038" style="s2">But The Universities Themselves i Mean i think People are all of a Sudden in the united States much more</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.769" end="01:35:21.219" style="s2">attentive to issues of political Correctness</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.289" end="01:35:27.608" style="s2">Because of The the riots At Berkeley Which was the you know Which was the capital of free speech i mean i don&#39;t Mean the the</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.609" end="01:35:29.609" style="s2">Free speech movement Happened in the spring?</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.989" end="01:35:34.328" style="s2">before i entered college in 1964 It so one of the Great principles and</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.879" end="01:35:38.019" style="s2">Inspirational Stories of My entire Life Mario Savio is you know you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.469" end="01:35:44.768" style="s2">Assertion of The of The Supremacy of you know free thought and free speech these okay and i</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.050" end="01:35:46.550" style="s2">so i think that Perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.550" end="01:35:52.209" style="s2">You Know we might Just Have Turned a corner and but it&#39;s gonna take a Very Very long time for the university to be Reformed</p>
