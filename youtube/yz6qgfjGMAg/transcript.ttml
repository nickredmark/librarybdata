<p begin="00:00:20.880" end="00:00:25.529" style="s2">that you&#39;ve been on so a wait for people</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.850" end="00:00:26.699" style="s2">who don&#39;t know I think most people who</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.529" end="00:00:29.189" style="s2">watch the channel will kind of already</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.699" end="00:00:33.210" style="s2">be familiar with your work but awakening</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.189" end="00:00:36.630" style="s2">from the meaning crisis is now 40 42</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.210" end="00:00:38.010" style="s2">episodes 42 episodes maybe 43 or 44 by</p>

<p begin="00:00:38.010" end="00:00:43.710" style="s2">yes yeah but what I find what I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.820" end="00:00:46.079" style="s2">looking forward to exploring in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.710" end="00:00:47.280" style="s2">conversation is what comes next because</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.079" end="00:00:49.379" style="s2">I know that you&#39;ve got some really</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.280" end="00:00:51.149" style="s2">exciting and interesting ideas for what</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.379" end="00:00:54.140" style="s2">is going to happen next I think so</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.149" end="00:00:56.879" style="s2">but also what the journey has been like</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.140" end="00:00:58.859" style="s2">and I&#39;m reminded of a mutual friend of</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.879" end="00:01:01.469" style="s2">both of ours Peter Limburg talks about</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.859" end="00:01:03.780" style="s2">this kind of sending out mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.469" end="00:01:05.790" style="s2">artifacts into the world and seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.780" end="00:01:07.229" style="s2">comes back so we&#39;re sort of putting up a</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.790" end="00:01:08.670" style="s2">flag we&#39;re putting our stuff out in</p>

<p begin="00:01:08.670" end="00:01:13.020" style="s2">to watch it we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.320" end="00:01:15.299" style="s2">to resonate with anyone and then often</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.020" end="00:01:17.400" style="s2">it does and I think would you say that</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.299" end="00:01:21.119" style="s2">your work has resonated as well as you</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.400" end="00:01:24.330" style="s2">had hoped or expected or that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:25.860" style="s2">a tricky question I&#39;d hoped it resonated</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.330" end="00:01:28.500" style="s2">because and I had some reason to believe</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.860" end="00:01:31.950" style="s2">it would in some ways because of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.500" end="00:01:34.009" style="s2">response to you know that material in in</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.950" end="00:01:37.439" style="s2">classrooms and I had an earlier version</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.009" end="00:01:39.689" style="s2">you know Buddhism in Karzai that course</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.439" end="00:01:41.790" style="s2">and you know there was and that that had</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.689" end="00:01:46.229" style="s2">it had gotten a response beyond sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.790" end="00:01:51.720" style="s2">what I had expected but it&#39;s been more</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.229" end="00:01:53.310" style="s2">than I&#39;ve expected it&#39;s it&#39;s it it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.720" end="00:01:55.229" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to say it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.310" end="00:01:58.110" style="s2">intimidating at times</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.229" end="00:01:59.759" style="s2">I&#39;ll get you know I&#39;ll get email about</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.110" end="00:02:01.890" style="s2">people who are doing meetups and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.759" end="00:02:05.790" style="s2">watching this series literally from all</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.890" end="00:02:07.580" style="s2">around the world and that&#39;s been both</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.790" end="00:02:11.090" style="s2">very exciting and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.580" end="00:02:16.440" style="s2">also a little bit like challenging</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.090" end="00:02:18.270" style="s2">because you know I think seriously my</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.440" end="00:02:19.980" style="s2">responsibility to my students and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.270" end="00:02:22.140" style="s2">not quick I&#39;m sort of working out in my</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.980" end="00:02:24.810" style="s2">mind what&#39;s what is my what are my</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.140" end="00:02:26.370" style="s2">responsibilities now like for example</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.810" end="00:02:28.319" style="s2">just to give you a practical example I</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.370" end="00:02:30.120" style="s2">can&#39;t respond to every comment that</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.319" end="00:02:32.760" style="s2">comes at every video that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.120" end="00:02:35.910" style="s2">last I that would fill my days and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.760" end="00:02:36.980" style="s2">can&#39;t do that so but you know Newt I</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.910" end="00:02:40.739" style="s2">can&#39;t I don&#39;t want to just ignore</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.980" end="00:02:43.250" style="s2">comments so I&#39;m I&#39;m very much in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.739" end="00:02:46.500" style="s2">process of trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.250" end="00:02:49.769" style="s2">what what can I with integrity do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.500" end="00:02:51.570" style="s2">you know is satisfying the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.769" end="00:02:53.519" style="s2">responsibilities I should have two</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.570" end="00:02:55.440" style="s2">people who are devoting I understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.519" end="00:02:57.150" style="s2">this they&#39;re devoting often considerable</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.440" end="00:02:59.519" style="s2">time and attention to trying to follow</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.150" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">the work I&#39;m putting out so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.519" end="00:03:02.850" style="s2">something that&#39;s very much a work in</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:04.260" style="s2">progress for me right now for people</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.850" end="00:03:06.870" style="s2">maybe you haven&#39;t been sort of following</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.260" end="00:03:08.550" style="s2">it closely what&#39;s the overall frame</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.870" end="00:03:10.590" style="s2">what&#39;s the elevator pitch for awakening</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.550" end="00:03:11.850" style="s2">from the meaning crisis so the elevator</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.590" end="00:03:15.000" style="s2">pitch for awakening from the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.850" end="00:03:21.030" style="s2">crisis is the idea bringing together two</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.000" end="00:03:24.530" style="s2">sort of strands one is an idea that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.030" end="00:03:26.850" style="s2">human beings face perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.530" end="00:03:31.049" style="s2">with their existence because of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.850" end="00:03:33.030" style="s2">centrality to their existence of their</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.049" end="00:03:34.769" style="s2">ability to make meaning so at the core</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.030" end="00:03:36.959" style="s2">of our cognition or our ability to make</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.769" end="00:03:38.489" style="s2">meaning it&#39;s central to communication</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.959" end="00:03:41.310" style="s2">problem solving I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.489" end="00:03:42.900" style="s2">intelligence consciousness etc and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.310" end="00:03:45.480" style="s2">one of the main ideas is the very</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.900" end="00:03:47.370" style="s2">processes that makes our intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.480" end="00:03:49.590" style="s2">and that meaning making so adaptive also</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.370" end="00:03:51.870" style="s2">makes us perennially susceptible to self</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.590" end="00:03:54.150" style="s2">deceptive self-destructive behavior so</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.870" end="00:03:56.220" style="s2">cultures across historical contexts</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.150" end="00:03:59.459" style="s2">environmental contexts have generally</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.220" end="00:04:01.560" style="s2">put together sets of practices for</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.459" end="00:04:03.269" style="s2">intervening and helping to ameliorate</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.560" end="00:04:04.920" style="s2">some of these perennial problems of</p>

<p begin="00:04:04.920" end="00:04:09.660" style="s2">and then what you need in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.540" end="00:04:14.040" style="s2">that is you need that though that set of</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.660" end="00:04:16.349" style="s2">practices to be home within a world view</p>

<p begin="00:04:21.209" end="00:04:26.610" style="s2">paradigmatic work so that people know</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.669" end="00:04:28.830" style="s2">how to understand and judge and evaluate</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.610" end="00:04:30.750" style="s2">and pursue the cultivation of wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.830" end="00:04:34.069" style="s2">what I mean by wisdom is exactly those</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.750" end="00:04:37.550" style="s2">set of practices that help us to address</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.069" end="00:04:40.020" style="s2">the the the problems of self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.550" end="00:04:43.470" style="s2">the problem that&#39;s happened for us is</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.020" end="00:04:46.789" style="s2">that the worldview within which our</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.470" end="00:04:49.169" style="s2">wisdom traditions arose has been</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.789" end="00:04:51.090" style="s2">significantly undermined for a host of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.169" end="00:04:53.039" style="s2">very interconnected and complex</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.090" end="00:04:53.819" style="s2">historical reasons that have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.039" end="00:04:55.590" style="s2">things like the Protestant Reformation</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.819" end="00:04:58.949" style="s2">the emergence of the scientific</p>

<p begin="00:04:58.949" end="00:05:05.340" style="s2">separation of philosophy from a</p>

<p begin="00:05:05.340" end="00:05:09.300" style="s2">what it was in the ancient world with</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.599" end="00:05:11.639" style="s2">Socrates or Plato we get the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.300" end="00:05:13.650" style="s2">wisdom institutions like the monastic</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.639" end="00:05:15.599" style="s2">tradition within the West is destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.650" end="00:05:17.580" style="s2">because of the Protestant Reformation so</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.599" end="00:05:20.370" style="s2">for a whole host of historical reasons</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.580" end="00:05:23.130" style="s2">we have a worldview in which we as</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.370" end="00:05:24.840" style="s2">meaning makers don&#39;t belong and then we</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.130" end="00:05:26.550" style="s2">also and that worldview also doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.840" end="00:05:31.110" style="s2">tell it tells us how to get information</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.550" end="00:05:32.250" style="s2">and even if right even if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.110" end="00:05:35.279" style="s2">want to give sort of a broad reading</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.250" end="00:05:37.650" style="s2">side to tell us how to get knowledge but</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.279" end="00:05:41.159" style="s2">it really doesn&#39;t tell us how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.650" end="00:05:43.770" style="s2">cultivate wisdom again not meaning just</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.159" end="00:05:46.740" style="s2">some lofty ideal it&#39;s like no no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.770" end="00:05:49.020" style="s2">you know how things how these problems</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.740" end="00:05:50.610" style="s2">sink their teeth into people&#39;s lives and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.020" end="00:05:52.159" style="s2">shred them and and and so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.610" end="00:05:57.449" style="s2">happening is we don&#39;t have a worldview</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.159" end="00:05:59.669" style="s2">that homes even educates guides there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.449" end="00:06:02.190" style="s2">none of that paradigmatic homing for</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.669" end="00:06:04.110" style="s2">these practices and so people are bereft</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.190" end="00:06:06.180" style="s2">they don&#39;t know where to go for wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.110" end="00:06:09.029" style="s2">they pursue it often in an autodidactic</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.180" end="00:06:11.669" style="s2">matter they write they form sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.029" end="00:06:14.699" style="s2">pseudo religious responses to try and do</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.669" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">the work that has been lost and so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.699" end="00:06:17.849" style="s2">won&#39;t get into all of the symptom ology</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:20.310" style="s2">but there&#39;s all of these different</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.849" end="00:06:22.860" style="s2">things that you can see happening that</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.310" end="00:06:24.610" style="s2">are response to this so what the series</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.860" end="00:06:27.060" style="s2">is is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.610" end="00:06:30.280" style="s2">a historical analysis of how we lost</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.060" end="00:06:32.200" style="s2">that valorising worldview and that a</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.280" end="00:06:33.880" style="s2">cognitive scientific analysis about what</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.200" end="00:06:36.040" style="s2">is the meaning making machinery</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.880" end="00:06:37.450" style="s2">what is self-deception what are higher</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.040" end="00:06:39.580" style="s2">states of consciousness what is</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.450" end="00:06:42.190" style="s2">enlightenment what is wisdom what&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.580" end="00:06:45.850" style="s2">best cognitive scientific answer that</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.190" end="00:06:47.380" style="s2">and then can we use that to create what</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.850" end="00:06:50.020" style="s2">I call psycho technologies and</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.380" end="00:06:53.560" style="s2">communities and ecologies of them that</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.020" end="00:06:55.810" style="s2">can give us back the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.560" end="00:06:58.770" style="s2">wisdom and self transcendence and also</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.810" end="00:07:02.170" style="s2">connect us up to a world of you that</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.770" end="00:07:05.170" style="s2">valorizes homes legitimates and make</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.170" end="00:07:07.720" style="s2">sense of that set of practices so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.170" end="00:07:10.630" style="s2">what the series is all about and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.720" end="00:07:12.400" style="s2">just tying together that and the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.630" end="00:07:14.470" style="s2">supporting putting this out as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.400" end="00:07:15.880" style="s2">memetic transmission I know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.470" end="00:07:19.360" style="s2">connected with other people who are</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.880" end="00:07:22.990" style="s2">asking those kind of questions and what</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.360" end="00:07:25.720" style="s2">do you sense the answers might be where</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.990" end="00:07:27.190" style="s2">do you sense that are there projects in</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.720" end="00:07:29.230" style="s2">the works or are there people who are</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.190" end="00:07:32.950" style="s2">thinking about these and where do you</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.230" end="00:07:34.780" style="s2">think this conversation goes now yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.950" end="00:07:37.390" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot and and and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.780" end="00:07:41.020" style="s2">interesting and this was this was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.390" end="00:07:44.320" style="s2">aspect of the mimetic artifact that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.020" end="00:07:46.900" style="s2">unexpected and so I often refer to it as</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.320" end="00:07:48.430" style="s2">a gift the fact that I&#39;ve been put into</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.900" end="00:07:51.340" style="s2">contact with so many people who are</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.430" end="00:07:53.800" style="s2">putting as I&#39;d like to say really real</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.340" end="00:07:56.560" style="s2">time and talent and often their their</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.800" end="00:07:58.750" style="s2">personal finances into trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.560" end="00:08:02.140" style="s2">ecologies of practices and communities</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.750" end="00:08:05.010" style="s2">to home those practices and to provide a</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.140" end="00:08:08.950" style="s2">place of paradigmatic you know guidance</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.010" end="00:08:10.540" style="s2">so I you know I&#39;m talking I&#39;m regularly</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.950" end="00:08:14.140" style="s2">talking to people like Rafe Kelly and</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.540" end="00:08:17.350" style="s2">you know he&#39;s he just has done a retreat</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.140" end="00:08:19.060" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna be also talking to some of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.350" end="00:08:20.320" style="s2">his students what I want and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.060" end="00:08:22.060" style="s2">putting to get you know he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.320" end="00:08:23.980" style="s2">get movement practices like you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.060" end="00:08:26.290" style="s2">people who are like so he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.980" end="00:08:28.060" style="s2">expertise in parkour and he teaches</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.290" end="00:08:30.160" style="s2">people how to go out and do parkour in</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.060" end="00:08:32.470" style="s2">nature and then move that was integrate</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.160" end="00:08:33.640" style="s2">there were some mindfulness practices</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.470" end="00:08:35.650" style="s2">and then integrate that with some</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.640" end="00:08:37.090" style="s2">meditative practices and then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.650" end="00:08:37.950" style="s2">something like a circling practice you</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.090" end="00:08:39.570" style="s2">sit around a camp</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.950" end="00:08:42.450" style="s2">fire and then you talk and literally</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.570" end="00:08:44.310" style="s2">it&#39;s like a primordial you know campfire</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.450" end="00:08:45.780" style="s2">and you talk and but he also has</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.310" end="00:08:47.910" style="s2">lectures where he then tries to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.780" end="00:08:49.380" style="s2">integrate some of the cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.910" end="00:08:52.080" style="s2">and some of the history from the series</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.380" end="00:08:54.480" style="s2">explicitly into all of this and so you</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.080" end="00:08:56.460" style="s2">know I&#39;m talking with him and he&#39;s put</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.480" end="00:08:58.590" style="s2">he just put out an online course now or</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.460" end="00:09:00.420" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to make it available for</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.590" end="00:09:02.850" style="s2">people in general or I&#39;m talking to Mike</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.420" end="00:09:04.470" style="s2">man he runs a dojo and he wants he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.850" end="00:09:06.060" style="s2">trying to put together we meeting</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.470" end="00:09:07.470" style="s2">regularity and he&#39;s trying to put tear</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.060" end="00:09:10.680" style="s2">tear of the curriculum and he says I</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.470" end="00:09:13.410" style="s2">want to take this to adolescence I get</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.680" end="00:09:15.210" style="s2">these kids coming into the dojo and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.410" end="00:09:17.130" style="s2">he does martial arts like in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.210" end="00:09:19.200" style="s2">comprehensive sense it&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.130" end="00:09:21.330" style="s2">self-defense it&#39;s a philosophy a&#39;right</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.200" end="00:09:22.740" style="s2">it&#39;s a way of cultivating wisdom and he</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.330" end="00:09:24.900" style="s2">says I want to put together a curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.740" end="00:09:26.220" style="s2">a course I want to take their stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.900" end="00:09:29.010" style="s2">you&#39;re doing John which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.220" end="00:09:32.030" style="s2">admittedly often very abstract and how</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.010" end="00:09:35.810" style="s2">do we put it in two sets of lectures</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.030" end="00:09:38.970" style="s2">practices exercises for these kids so</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.810" end="00:09:41.430" style="s2">doing things like that or I get to meet</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.970" end="00:09:42.960" style="s2">right I get to well it&#39;s been on your</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.430" end="00:09:45.240" style="s2">channel I get to meet people like Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.960" end="00:09:47.880" style="s2">Hall and I you know and Internet into</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.240" end="00:09:50.370" style="s2">this you know you know Reagan we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.880" end="00:09:53.090" style="s2">we&#39;ve become friends and entering like</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.370" end="00:09:56.760" style="s2">into these regular discussions about ok</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.090" end="00:09:58.590" style="s2">what what he talks about you know game</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.760" end="00:10:01.320" style="s2">be and I talk about trying to break out</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.590" end="00:10:03.480" style="s2">of the cultural cognitive grammar we</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.320" end="00:10:06.180" style="s2">have and get a new one and like what</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.480" end="00:10:07.620" style="s2">okay let&#39;s stop I&#39;m never gonna stop</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.180" end="00:10:09.870" style="s2">theorizing because I&#39;m a scientist but</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.620" end="00:10:12.000" style="s2">not let&#39;s not just theorizing and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.870" end="00:10:14.850" style="s2">what does it look like to try and do</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.000" end="00:10:16.590" style="s2">that and so I&#39;ve also met guys and stalk</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.850" end="00:10:19.440" style="s2">the guy who invented circling right and</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.590" end="00:10:21.530" style="s2">so we are we&#39;re regularly getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:24.300" style="s2">together and and and and this is also</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.530" end="00:10:27.300" style="s2">because of you mentioned in Peter</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.300" end="00:10:30.330" style="s2">Lindbergh right it&#39;s like okay can we</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.300" end="00:10:31.770" style="s2">take these new emergent psycho tech and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.330" end="00:10:34.170" style="s2">I am really interested in guy&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.770" end="00:10:36.030" style="s2">because and this is the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.170" end="00:10:39.510" style="s2">very interested me is because guy has</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.030" end="00:10:41.550" style="s2">made it very clear and he and I we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.510" end="00:10:43.020" style="s2">pretty much daily communication about</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.550" end="00:10:44.640" style="s2">you know the deep hi daguerreian</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.020" end="00:10:47.450" style="s2">foundations the deep existential</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.640" end="00:10:49.860" style="s2">foundations of circling and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.450" end="00:10:50.730" style="s2">because I think I see if Heidegger is</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.860" end="00:10:52.860" style="s2">one of them</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.730" end="00:10:55.050" style="s2">prophets of the meaning crisis and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.860" end="00:10:57.510" style="s2">problem of nihilism so there&#39;s somebody</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.050" end="00:10:58.949" style="s2">taking Heidegger and Heidegger is not an</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.510" end="00:11:00.329" style="s2">easy to read like you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.949" end="00:11:03.209" style="s2">take Heidegger to the beach right</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.329" end="00:11:04.680" style="s2">and yet he&#39;s taking this very you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.209" end="00:11:07.230" style="s2">hired Heidegger is filled with</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.680" end="00:11:09.060" style="s2">neologisms and difficult often turgid</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.230" end="00:11:11.040" style="s2">prose and guys Trent has been</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.060" end="00:11:14.360" style="s2">translating that you know for decades</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.040" end="00:11:17.399" style="s2">now into this very successful practice</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.360" end="00:11:19.829" style="s2">for changing dialogue and discourse so</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.399" end="00:11:21.449" style="s2">you know and so we&#39;re all talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.829" end="00:11:23.550" style="s2">together and also my colleague and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.449" end="00:11:25.139" style="s2">co-author Christopher master Piero so</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.550" end="00:11:27.449" style="s2">we&#39;re getting together and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.139" end="00:11:30.990" style="s2">much this participant observation can we</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.449" end="00:11:32.130" style="s2">start to you like three is that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.990" end="00:11:34.889" style="s2">right word I don&#39;t want to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.130" end="00:11:38.100" style="s2">re-engineer maybe it&#39;s just engineer you</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.889" end="00:11:40.680" style="s2">know a as you know psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.100" end="00:11:42.959" style="s2">of communication they can and this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.680" end="00:11:44.220" style="s2">something that I see emerging it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.959" end="00:11:46.860" style="s2">rebel wisdom you know the whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.220" end="00:11:48.870" style="s2">collective intelligence thing what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.860" end="00:11:50.579" style="s2">psyche what is the psycho technology or</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.870" end="00:11:52.949" style="s2">maybe I think a better term for that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.579" end="00:11:55.170" style="s2">Jordans term Jordan Hall&#39;s term what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.949" end="00:11:57.029" style="s2">the matter sico technology that will tap</p>

<p begin="00:11:57.029" end="00:12:04.740" style="s2">distributed cognition and give us a</p>

<p begin="00:12:30.839" end="00:12:35.130" style="s2">really going on right now and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.730" end="00:12:36.959" style="s2">taking up a lot of my time and but</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.130" end="00:12:40.680" style="s2">that&#39;s not a complaint I was surprised</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.959" end="00:12:41.880" style="s2">by how much I well I was saying to my</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.680" end="00:12:45.180" style="s2">son the other day is like this has</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.880" end="00:12:47.220" style="s2">become a job like it like I like a thank</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.180" end="00:12:49.260" style="s2">you and so I mean part of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.220" end="00:12:52.529" style="s2">trying to figure out personally is how</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.260" end="00:12:54.870" style="s2">do i integrate that with my job as you</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.529" end="00:12:56.699" style="s2">know as as a professor at the University</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.870" end="00:12:58.709" style="s2">of Toronto but that&#39;s it that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.699" end="00:13:00.300" style="s2">interesting problem to have just to sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.709" end="00:13:02.730" style="s2">of zoom out a little bit a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.300" end="00:13:03.870" style="s2">is in I think that the kind of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.730" end="00:13:05.850" style="s2">context that we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.870" end="00:13:08.610" style="s2">and certainly that I&#39;m looking at all</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.850" end="00:13:11.700" style="s2">that I&#39;m bringing to it is this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.610" end="00:13:13.410" style="s2">the new atheist hegemony certainly</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.700" end="00:13:16.440" style="s2">culturally that I was aware of in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.410" end="00:13:19.020" style="s2">media and in the sort of wider yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.440" end="00:13:21.480" style="s2">the wider media landscape was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.020" end="00:13:23.460" style="s2">Richard Dawkins Sam Harris scientific</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.480" end="00:13:25.230" style="s2">rationalism and that seems to have been</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.460" end="00:13:27.029" style="s2">kind of broken and we&#39;re now in a place</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.230" end="00:13:28.740" style="s2">and I know that a lot of the people that</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.029" end="00:13:30.150" style="s2">we&#39;ve had on our channel and that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.740" end="00:13:33.180" style="s2">been talking to as well are looking at</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.150" end="00:13:36.570" style="s2">what the function that religions used to</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.180" end="00:13:38.880" style="s2">fill and what now can go in that into</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.570" end="00:13:40.350" style="s2">that whole yeah what I mean that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.880" end="00:13:44.730" style="s2">the big question at the moment I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.350" end="00:13:46.320" style="s2">isn&#39;t it I think so I mean I I tread</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.730" end="00:13:47.790" style="s2">that I think this is the ground that</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.320" end="00:13:53.790" style="s2">needs to be tread but I tread it very</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.790" end="00:13:55.860" style="s2">very carefully because well I mean part</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.790" end="00:13:57.930" style="s2">of the part of the people and talking to</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.860" end="00:13:59.640" style="s2">and that and I&#39;m better fitting</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.930" end="00:14:00.990" style="s2">immensely from the conversations are</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.640" end="00:14:03.390" style="s2">like people like Paul van der clay and</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.990" end="00:14:05.850" style="s2">Jonathan pazzo he&#39;s both of them have</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.390" end="00:14:07.680" style="s2">been on your channel and because I see</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.850" end="00:14:10.890" style="s2">them I mean Jonathan I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.680" end="00:14:13.440" style="s2">independently came to hit something very</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.890" end="00:14:16.140" style="s2">similar about zombies as you know a</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.440" end="00:14:17.490" style="s2">mythic representation of the mean crisis</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.140" end="00:14:19.980" style="s2">and he and I have been in conversation</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.490" end="00:14:21.750" style="s2">and you know and his work on symbolism I</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.980" end="00:14:23.339" style="s2">think is it is part of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.750" end="00:14:25.140" style="s2">talking about like trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.339" end="00:14:28.190" style="s2">the functionality of symbolism and</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.140" end="00:14:36.230" style="s2">that&#39;s something that I do some work on</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.190" end="00:14:41.100" style="s2">and so I I do think hmm I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.230" end="00:14:42.630" style="s2">what&#39;s needed is again I want to be very</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.100" end="00:14:43.230" style="s2">careful here I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.630" end="00:14:44.550" style="s2">dismissive</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.230" end="00:14:45.839" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to claim here&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.550" end="00:14:48.900" style="s2">don&#39;t want to come I don&#39;t want to claim</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.839" end="00:14:51.839" style="s2">that people in Christianity can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.900" end="00:14:53.880" style="s2">Christianity work as a place where they</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.839" end="00:14:55.740" style="s2">can tap into the traditions tap into an</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.880" end="00:14:57.000" style="s2">ecology and cultivate wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.740" end="00:14:58.680" style="s2">compassion I think that would be a false</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.000" end="00:15:03.150" style="s2">claim so I&#39;m not trying to make that</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.680" end="00:15:06.390" style="s2">claim but what I would say is I I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.150" end="00:15:09.060" style="s2">have suspicions I don&#39;t have conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.390" end="00:15:12.420" style="s2">but I have suspicions that with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.060" end="00:15:15.959" style="s2">demise of what I call the axial age that</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.420" end="00:15:17.040" style="s2">two worlds mythology as a way of trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.959" end="00:15:20.130" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.040" end="00:15:22.920" style="s2">understand to articulate processes of</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.130" end="00:15:25.290" style="s2">self-transcendence and wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.920" end="00:15:27.030" style="s2">cultivation as that two worlds mythology</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.290" end="00:15:30.030" style="s2">has collapsed under the weight of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.030" end="00:15:34.350" style="s2">history and mythology meaning the divine</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.030" end="00:15:35.940" style="s2">and yes now Gerald and so the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.350" end="00:15:37.650" style="s2">world we&#39;ve collapsed one into the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.940" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">scientific rationalist one yes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.650" end="00:15:42.330" style="s2">one land base yeah yeah so so if you if</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:44.070" style="s2">you think about what Charles Taylor&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.330" end="00:15:46.410" style="s2">talked about in the axial age we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.070" end="00:15:49.220" style="s2">the great dis embedding there was there</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.410" end="00:15:52.410" style="s2">was sort of a unified integrated cosmos</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.220" end="00:15:54.330" style="s2">and we&#39;re in which there wasn&#39;t any sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.410" end="00:15:55.920" style="s2">of difference in degree between the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.330" end="00:15:57.570" style="s2">Devon there&#39;s a tremendous difference in</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.920" end="00:16:00.120" style="s2">power but there isn&#39;t difference in kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.570" end="00:16:01.860" style="s2">between sort of the divine realm and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.120" end="00:16:03.900" style="s2">human or there&#39;s cut so it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.860" end="00:16:06.720" style="s2">paradoxical for the Pharaoh to be a God</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.900" end="00:16:10.190" style="s2">or for perc Uli&#39;s to become you know to</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.720" end="00:16:13.740" style="s2">ascend into God like you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.190" end="00:16:15.810" style="s2">but and what happens is I argue that</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.740" end="00:16:20.250" style="s2">that&#39;s because what&#39;s what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.810" end="00:16:21.960" style="s2">there is this right what it is is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.250" end="00:16:23.460" style="s2">different understanding of wisdom than</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.960" end="00:16:25.380" style="s2">the one we have that it&#39;s a pre axial</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.460" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">understanding in which the point of</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.380" end="00:16:31.620" style="s2">wisdom is to is to pick up on these</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:34.320" style="s2">these cycles and and this continuum and</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.620" end="00:16:36.210" style="s2">fit into it very well but with it with</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.320" end="00:16:38.760" style="s2">the advent of a lot of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.210" end="00:16:42.690" style="s2">technologies like alphabetic literacy</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.760" end="00:16:47.390" style="s2">and numeracy and and other things like</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.690" end="00:16:50.190" style="s2">that people get a sort of metacognition</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.390" end="00:16:51.990" style="s2">is your awareness of your own cognition</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.190" end="00:16:56.070" style="s2">they get it and they get an enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.990" end="00:16:57.540" style="s2">metacognitive awareness of of well of</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.070" end="00:16:59.190" style="s2">the water was mentioned in earlier of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.540" end="00:17:02.280" style="s2">the self-deceptive aspects of their own</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.190" end="00:17:03.810" style="s2">cognition and and then and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.280" end="00:17:06.270" style="s2">you get this sort of double awareness</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.810" end="00:17:07.920" style="s2">our cognition is really beset by</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.270" end="00:17:09.420" style="s2">self-deception but it&#39;s also really</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.920" end="00:17:10.980" style="s2">capable of self transcendence because</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.420" end="00:17:12.900" style="s2">those two are inter penetrating you</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.980" end="00:17:14.699" style="s2">can&#39;t have one without the other right</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.900" end="00:17:16.650" style="s2">and so the way to try and articulate</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.699" end="00:17:18.209" style="s2">that myth that mythologically is well</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.650" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a lower world in which were sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.209" end="00:17:21.480" style="s2">of encased in the illusion or the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.160" end="00:17:24.449" style="s2">decadence and then there&#39;s a other</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.480" end="00:17:26.520" style="s2">better world where where where things</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.449" end="00:17:29.430" style="s2">really are and we&#39;re we where we can</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.520" end="00:17:30.010" style="s2">really be and that the point of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.430" end="00:17:32.560" style="s2">is not</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.010" end="00:17:35.140" style="s2">into this world down here but to somehow</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.560" end="00:17:38.740" style="s2">ass and right and you and there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.140" end="00:17:41.260" style="s2">kinds of variations on that and I see I</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.740" end="00:17:43.630" style="s2">see a look and many of the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.260" end="00:17:46.090" style="s2">religions were born in that axial period</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.630" end="00:17:49.570" style="s2">and you know and that&#39;s the heritage</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.090" end="00:17:52.270" style="s2">from which Christianity emerges and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.570" end="00:17:55.180" style="s2">see I see Christianity is still embedded</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.270" end="00:17:57.220" style="s2">with that fundamental grammar that&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.180" end="00:17:58.780" style="s2">sort of solidified into the natural and</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.220" end="00:18:01.030" style="s2">the supernatural and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.780" end="00:18:05.500" style="s2">which is why you don&#39;t think like</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.030" end="00:18:08.410" style="s2">Jonathan and Paul that Christianity can</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.500" end="00:18:09.550" style="s2">be the vehicle because they effectively</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.410" end="00:18:11.710" style="s2">want to see Christianity kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.550" end="00:18:13.240" style="s2">rebooted yeah but you think that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.710" end="00:18:14.470" style="s2">lost that grammar fundamentally so we</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.240" end="00:18:15.910" style="s2">need something different is that yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.470" end="00:18:18.010" style="s2">mean that&#39;s that&#39;s the gist of my</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.910" end="00:18:19.450" style="s2">argument now I am being tentative about</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.010" end="00:18:20.800" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t say that I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.450" end="00:18:22.450" style="s2">don&#39;t think that I don&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.800" end="00:18:27.310" style="s2">regard that as a conclusive argument I</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.450" end="00:18:30.100" style="s2">have suspicions that right that like I</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.310" end="00:18:31.960" style="s2">you know I I want to say I&#39;m impressed</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.100" end="00:18:33.430" style="s2">by what they&#39;re doing and I want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.960" end="00:18:35.200" style="s2">watching and I want to keep talking to</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.430" end="00:18:37.240" style="s2">them and I want I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.200" end="00:18:39.220" style="s2">foreclose and say no it&#39;s impossible so</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.240" end="00:18:41.410" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that but what I say is I</p>

<p begin="00:18:41.410" end="00:18:47.980" style="s2">so bound to that grammar that as that</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.370" end="00:18:51.580" style="s2">grammar is being destroyed by these</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.980" end="00:18:53.770" style="s2">historical you know forces the history</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.580" end="00:18:55.660" style="s2">of philosophy the advent of science</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.770" end="00:18:58.120" style="s2">right all of these things that have</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.660" end="00:19:00.790" style="s2">reinvented us back into our bodies back</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.120" end="00:19:02.080" style="s2">into the physical world back into</p>

<p begin="00:19:02.080" end="00:19:08.410" style="s2">like where&#39;s deep lyrium bedded now and</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.390" end="00:19:12.850" style="s2">so I suspect that why many people are</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.410" end="00:19:18.460" style="s2">leaving and the nuns NO NES no organized</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.850" end="00:19:19.690" style="s2">religion is an increasingly growing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.460" end="00:19:21.280" style="s2">not been growing but the rate at which</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.690" end="00:19:23.350" style="s2">is growing is growing right you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.280" end="00:19:24.700" style="s2">it&#39;s an it&#39;s it&#39;s getting larger and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.350" end="00:19:25.990" style="s2">larger demographic group and it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.700" end="00:19:29.500" style="s2">to become the dominant group in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.990" end="00:19:33.670" style="s2">society right so I what I&#39;m surmising is</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.500" end="00:19:35.800" style="s2">for many people the the the organized</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.670" end="00:19:37.570" style="s2">religions because of the way they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.800" end="00:19:42.550" style="s2">bound to a grammar that just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.570" end="00:19:45.460" style="s2">jive that that&#39;s not an option for them</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.550" end="00:19:47.140" style="s2">but as you said and this is Nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.460" end="00:19:49.870" style="s2">point of the madmen in the marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.140" end="00:19:53.380" style="s2">you can&#39;t like just like trying to just</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.870" end="00:19:56.140" style="s2">oh well no more God right right the that</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.380" end="00:19:57.850" style="s2">the tremendous functionality that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.140" end="00:20:00.640" style="s2">because what religion did and this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.850" end="00:20:01.960" style="s2">one of Paul&#39;s great point right is it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.640" end="00:20:02.980" style="s2">religion does the kind of thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.960" end="00:20:05.910" style="s2">talking about here it gives this</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.980" end="00:20:08.920" style="s2">comprehensive ecology and tradition and</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.910" end="00:20:11.050" style="s2">dynamic self create correcting not</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.920" end="00:20:14.800" style="s2">perfectly self directing but what is you</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.050" end="00:20:17.590" style="s2">know this process forgiving people you</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.800" end="00:20:19.930" style="s2">know all of these psycho technologies of</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.590" end="00:20:22.570" style="s2">self transcendence and the cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.930" end="00:20:24.730" style="s2">of wisdom and it did it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.570" end="00:20:27.520" style="s2">was scaleable like for you know all</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.730" end="00:20:29.530" style="s2">aspects of society right and you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.520" end="00:20:30.760" style="s2">and you know also developmentally</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.530" end="00:20:32.650" style="s2">scalable you could teach it to adults</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.760" end="00:20:34.390" style="s2">and you can teach it to children and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.650" end="00:20:36.460" style="s2">like and so it gave you this</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.390" end="00:20:38.320" style="s2">comprehensive way of intervening in</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.460" end="00:20:40.840" style="s2">people&#39;s consciousness and their</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.320" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">cognition right and their character</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.840" end="00:20:48.550" style="s2">right and so you can just sort of oh</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:52.330" style="s2">well like just leave that space empty</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.550" end="00:20:57.220" style="s2">and so what I argue is the attempts we</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.330" end="00:20:58.870" style="s2">made to replace that in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.220" end="00:21:01.060" style="s2">with totalitarian ideologies what will</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.870" end="00:21:03.760" style="s2">create is our systems of ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.060" end="00:21:06.040" style="s2">totally will get that sort of totality</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.760" end="00:21:07.630" style="s2">of intervention but if they didn&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.040" end="00:21:09.520" style="s2">totality of an intervention one of my</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.630" end="00:21:11.530" style="s2">critiques is the these ideologies don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.520" end="00:21:14.440" style="s2">give people sets of practices other than</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.530" end="00:21:17.200" style="s2">political engagement or revolution or</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.440" end="00:21:19.540" style="s2">things like that so the totalizing was</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.200" end="00:21:22.360" style="s2">just a totalization of belief and</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.540" end="00:21:25.120" style="s2">control it wasn&#39;t actually giving what I</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.360" end="00:21:28.600" style="s2">would call like a comprehensive set of</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.120" end="00:21:30.400" style="s2">interventions so the the pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.600" end="00:21:32.350" style="s2">religious totalitarian ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.400" end="00:21:35.350" style="s2">drenched the world in Titanic blood</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.350" end="00:21:38.380" style="s2">because they they kept promising that</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.350" end="00:21:40.120" style="s2">right the secular equivalent of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.380" end="00:21:43.360" style="s2">other world the upper world the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.120" end="00:21:46.900" style="s2">supernatural world the the promised land</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.360" end="00:21:48.370" style="s2">the forthcoming paradise and not and but</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.900" end="00:21:49.660" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t actually deliver it</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.370" end="00:21:52.210" style="s2">because they couldn&#39;t actually promote</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.660" end="00:21:53.920" style="s2">the kind of transformation that I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.210" end="00:21:55.490" style="s2">is needed for addressing the perennial</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.920" end="00:21:58.130" style="s2">problems so</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.490" end="00:22:01.429" style="s2">they get violent because I think there</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.130" end="00:22:03.679" style="s2">was sort of frustration built into the</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.429" end="00:22:05.450" style="s2">heart of their machinery and they</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.679" end="00:22:06.799" style="s2">drenched the world in blood and they</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.450" end="00:22:09.309" style="s2">drenched the world and led to a carport</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.799" end="00:22:11.450" style="s2">wrong we&#39;re caught we&#39;re caught between</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.309" end="00:22:12.860" style="s2">for many of us I don&#39;t want to say all</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.450" end="00:22:14.510" style="s2">of us I&#39;m trying to I&#39;m trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.860" end="00:22:17.690" style="s2">very respectful here but for many of us</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.510" end="00:22:19.220" style="s2">increasingly so then the nostalgic</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.690" end="00:22:23.270" style="s2">return to the existing religions is not</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.220" end="00:22:24.710" style="s2">an option the pseudo religious political</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.270" end="00:22:27.140" style="s2">ideologies are not an option</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.710" end="00:22:31.850" style="s2">and so almost in a Jungian sense were</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.140" end="00:22:33.500" style="s2">stuck and so the idea is well we need we</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.850" end="00:22:35.870" style="s2">need something like we need something</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.500" end="00:22:40.309" style="s2">that&#39;s got the comprehensiveness the</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.870" end="00:22:45.350" style="s2">scalability of religion without right</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.309" end="00:22:50.149" style="s2">pinning us back into its it&#39;s code that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.350" end="00:22:53.419" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work in many ways or become the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.149" end="00:22:57.409" style="s2">I give a purely sort of political</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.419" end="00:22:59.149" style="s2">socio-political or SATs surrogate for</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.409" end="00:23:01.039" style="s2">that so that&#39;s what I call the religion</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.149" end="00:23:04.220" style="s2">of not religion and this is the this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.039" end="00:23:06.020" style="s2">the the work that this is an aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.220" end="00:23:08.809" style="s2">my work that both Jordan Hall and guys</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.020" end="00:23:11.029" style="s2">sent stock are very very interested in I</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.809" end="00:23:12.559" style="s2">think people like Paula and Jonathan are</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.029" end="00:23:14.390" style="s2">interested in it and I know they are</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.559" end="00:23:16.850" style="s2">because there&#39;s people in their audience</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.390" end="00:23:18.860" style="s2">that are commenting on this like Mary</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.850" end="00:23:21.940" style="s2">Cohen and others and they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.860" end="00:23:23.630" style="s2">interested in it because they do take I</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.940" end="00:23:26.330" style="s2">ultimately they&#39;re going to disagree</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.630" end="00:23:28.340" style="s2">with it of course but I they do think</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.330" end="00:23:30.399" style="s2">that this idea about getting really</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.340" end="00:23:32.870" style="s2">clear about the functionality of</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.399" end="00:23:34.789" style="s2">religion and that that&#39;s got to play an</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.870" end="00:23:35.809" style="s2">important part and responding to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.789" end="00:23:37.309" style="s2">meaning Krista they take that very</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.809" end="00:23:39.559" style="s2">seriously of which I&#39;m very appreciative</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.309" end="00:23:41.630" style="s2">yeah so this is really really focus on</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.559" end="00:23:43.730" style="s2">practice and I know that this is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.630" end="00:23:45.470" style="s2">where you&#39;re now turning your energy to</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.730" end="00:23:46.730" style="s2">at the end of the awakening from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.470" end="00:23:50.210" style="s2">meaning crisis like you&#39;re focusing very</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.730" end="00:23:52.640" style="s2">clearly on practice and the the in</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.210" end="00:23:57.590" style="s2">particular dialogic practices very much</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.640" end="00:23:59.029" style="s2">very much so yeah so what I what what</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.590" end="00:24:01.190" style="s2">I&#39;m doing is the follow-up series is</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.029" end="00:24:04.330" style="s2">called after Socrates the pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.190" end="00:24:07.490" style="s2">wisdom through authentic dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.330" end="00:24:08.760" style="s2">the idea behind this is and this was an</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.490" end="00:24:11.280" style="s2">idea that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.760" end="00:24:13.770" style="s2">that was sparked in dialogue with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.280" end="00:24:18.210" style="s2">Hall so it&#39;s exemplifying the very thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.770" end="00:24:20.220" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get a grip on which Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.210" end="00:24:21.750" style="s2">and I were talking I think was on one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.220" end="00:24:24.240" style="s2">the ones that&#39;s recorded for rebel</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.750" end="00:24:26.940" style="s2">wisdom and I&#39;m trying to understand his</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.240" end="00:24:29.730" style="s2">notion of coherence because he&#39;s he uses</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.940" end="00:24:33.480" style="s2">it to extend all right and I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.730" end="00:24:35.610" style="s2">okay I get that and he and I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.480" end="00:24:37.919" style="s2">say but like can we create some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.610" end="00:24:39.510" style="s2">bridging term between that notion and</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.919" end="00:24:41.790" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about because I know</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.510" end="00:24:44.520" style="s2">he&#39;s very interested and I&#39;m grateful</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.790" end="00:24:45.900" style="s2">for that very supportive of a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.520" end="00:24:50.580" style="s2">vocabulary and the grammar that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.900" end="00:24:53.309" style="s2">been introducing and so he said well</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.580" end="00:24:54.870" style="s2">this is it and he had one of those one</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.309" end="00:24:56.460" style="s2">of his moments the Jordanian moments</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.870" end="00:25:01.230" style="s2">where he does the that thing that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.460" end="00:25:03.540" style="s2">wonderful and he said what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.230" end="00:25:06.690" style="s2">about with coherence is a meta psycho</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.540" end="00:25:08.669" style="s2">technology and he said you know and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.690" end="00:25:13.860" style="s2">a meta psycho technology because that</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.669" end="00:25:15.750" style="s2">will help to sort of Shepherd right you</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.860" end="00:25:17.460" style="s2">know an ecology of psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.750" end="00:25:18.809" style="s2">because I talked about that what part of</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.460" end="00:25:20.490" style="s2">the functionality of what religions did</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.809" end="00:25:22.140" style="s2">is they gave us and I&#39;m using the word</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.490" end="00:25:24.660" style="s2">ecology is a very strong analogy right</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.140" end="00:25:27.179" style="s2">the the individual components are</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.660" end="00:25:30.059" style="s2">adopting self-organizing like organisms</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.179" end="00:25:32.549" style="s2">but they&#39;re also shaping a collective</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.059" end="00:25:34.200" style="s2">environment in a collective space in</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.549" end="00:25:36.059" style="s2">which there are checks and balances on</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.200" end="00:25:38.309" style="s2">the whole system so that&#39;s what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.059" end="00:25:40.080" style="s2">by an ecology and he says but you need</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.309" end="00:25:41.309" style="s2">something that sort of Shepherds that</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.080" end="00:25:43.500" style="s2">because you&#39;re gonna need to dispense</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.309" end="00:25:46.080" style="s2">with obsolete ones you&#39;re gonna need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.500" end="00:25:48.780" style="s2">engineer new ones you know and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.080" end="00:25:51.120" style="s2">gonna need to you know reorient them and</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.780" end="00:25:53.270" style="s2">and he said so you&#39;re gonna need a meta</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.120" end="00:25:56.820" style="s2">cyclic technology and I went oh my gosh</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.270" end="00:25:58.590" style="s2">yes and then it in my mind was ringing</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.820" end="00:26:02.929" style="s2">the idea well you know you need this</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.590" end="00:26:06.330" style="s2">meta psycho technology for tapping into</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.929" end="00:26:08.400" style="s2">activating an accessing and accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.330" end="00:26:09.720" style="s2">and exacting you know the collective</p>

<p begin="00:26:09.720" end="00:26:14.669" style="s2">but that needs to be coordinated with</p>

<p begin="00:26:16.650" end="00:26:20.560" style="s2">talking a lot about right now and</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.730" end="00:26:24.610" style="s2">remind me I&#39;d like to come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.560" end="00:26:27.400" style="s2">issue about you know sort of a broader</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.610" end="00:26:29.710" style="s2">notion of rationality of wisdom in in</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.400" end="00:26:31.560" style="s2">the post new atheist world because I</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.710" end="00:26:35.980" style="s2">think that&#39;s an important part of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.560" end="00:26:38.950" style="s2">but so you&#39;ve got and I thought okay so</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.980" end="00:26:40.150" style="s2">that and soon as I put those two</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.950" end="00:26:42.490" style="s2">together in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.150" end="00:26:45.520" style="s2">Jordan&#39;s notion of the meta site with</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.490" end="00:26:47.080" style="s2">technology and and what and there and</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.520" end="00:26:48.580" style="s2">you know there&#39;s the term from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.080" end="00:26:50.590" style="s2">Berlin paradigm some of the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.580" end="00:26:52.030" style="s2">scientists who do work on wisdom about</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.590" end="00:26:55.350" style="s2">wisdom as they met a heuristic I thought</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.030" end="00:26:58.540" style="s2">oh that we had that in the ancient world</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.350" end="00:27:01.270" style="s2">we had that in the ancient world and</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.540" end="00:27:03.730" style="s2">what we what we had and you can see it</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.270" end="00:27:06.570" style="s2">in exemplified in Socrates and in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.730" end="00:27:09.370" style="s2">Platonic dialogues is we had dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.570" end="00:27:10.890" style="s2">don&#39;t hear that don&#39;t hear that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.370" end="00:27:14.290" style="s2">hear that through the Galleon ears</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.890" end="00:27:16.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a what I want to talk about is</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.290" end="00:27:18.580" style="s2">something that&#39;s in some sense a</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.150" end="00:27:20.680" style="s2">precursor to Hegel&#39;s dialectic but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.580" end="00:27:22.030" style="s2">much more as you said and this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.680" end="00:27:24.930" style="s2">crucially the difference it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.030" end="00:27:27.820" style="s2">about practice it&#39;s not about a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.930" end="00:27:29.770" style="s2">logic for understanding world history</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.820" end="00:27:31.570" style="s2">and translating that into political</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.770" end="00:27:33.880" style="s2">activism that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.570" end="00:27:35.980" style="s2">about so what&#39;d you get what&#39;d you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.880" end="00:27:37.750" style="s2">in dialectic right which comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.980" end="00:27:43.480" style="s2">Socratic and Lanka&#39;s because you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.750" end="00:27:45.670" style="s2">this process by which these and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.480" end="00:27:48.760" style="s2">I said I&#39;m trying to I&#39;m in the midst of</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.670" end="00:27:50.830" style="s2">doing this it&#39;s so I&#39;m talking to people</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.760" end="00:27:53.050" style="s2">and I&#39;m doing a lot of participant</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.830" end="00:27:55.690" style="s2">observation on one hand and then doing a</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.050" end="00:27:58.900" style="s2">lot of research into you know dance</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.690" end="00:28:02.230" style="s2">Berbers work on the on how reason is</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.900" end="00:28:05.230" style="s2">probably ultimately dialogical in nature</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.230" end="00:28:08.110" style="s2">or how the way metacognition actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.230" end="00:28:11.170" style="s2">works etc so but here are the dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.110" end="00:28:13.030" style="s2">so if you look at sort of dialectic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.170" end="00:28:15.100" style="s2">it develops especially into the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.030" end="00:28:17.710" style="s2">Neoplatonic tradition there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.100" end="00:28:20.260" style="s2">horizontal dimension which is what you</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.710" end="00:28:22.570" style="s2">guys are exploring it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.260" end="00:28:24.490" style="s2">happens when we get people and instead</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.570" end="00:28:26.140" style="s2">of what Plato would call Philae and IKEA</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.490" end="00:28:28.090" style="s2">the pursuit of victory they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.140" end="00:28:30.280" style="s2">doing finally of Sofia what they want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.090" end="00:28:32.060" style="s2">do is they want to access the logos they</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.280" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">want to generate some emerge</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.060" end="00:28:37.610" style="s2">system between them that can tap into</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.200" end="00:28:40.250" style="s2">your term collective intelligence of</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.610" end="00:28:42.170" style="s2">distributed cognition and take that take</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.250" end="00:28:44.930" style="s2">us to places that we can&#39;t get to on our</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.170" end="00:28:46.700" style="s2">own and then what&#39;s going on right if</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.930" end="00:28:48.200" style="s2">you&#39;ve got all those dimensions is</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.700" end="00:28:51.080" style="s2">you&#39;re getting something like a flow a</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.200" end="00:28:53.090" style="s2">flow state in which all those dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.080" end="00:28:54.830" style="s2">are being optimized and coordinated when</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.090" end="00:28:57.200" style="s2">it&#39;s working and so I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.830" end="00:29:00.380" style="s2">understand what other dimensions how are</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.200" end="00:29:04.070" style="s2">they working and what I want to do is I</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.380" end="00:29:06.800" style="s2">want to get that I&#39;m like I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.070" end="00:29:08.510" style="s2">trying to do a historical and causing a</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.800" end="00:29:11.060" style="s2">scientific analysis of what was going on</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.510" end="00:29:14.120" style="s2">and in the ancient dialectic and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.060" end="00:29:16.910" style="s2">put it into dialogue and that is not a</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.120" end="00:29:18.770" style="s2">pond I mean that put it as a dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.910" end="00:29:20.420" style="s2">with all of these practices that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.770" end="00:29:22.100" style="s2">trying to access collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.420" end="00:29:25.220" style="s2">and I&#39;m trying to learn them from the</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.100" end="00:29:28.610" style="s2">inside as much as I can and see if we</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.220" end="00:29:31.430" style="s2">can engineer something that would do</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.610" end="00:29:35.060" style="s2">something like something like you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.430" end="00:29:37.190" style="s2">take circling and bring it bring into it</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.060" end="00:29:38.210" style="s2">something like Philae or Sofia like you</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.190" end="00:29:40.910" style="s2">see in the Platonic dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.210" end="00:29:43.160" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re circling but what the point</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.910" end="00:29:45.890" style="s2">of the circling is not just the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.160" end="00:29:48.280" style="s2">itself not just the community it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.890" end="00:29:51.500" style="s2">yeah but let&#39;s turn that what is wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.280" end="00:29:54.170" style="s2">what is it what is it well you know what</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.500" end="00:29:56.930" style="s2">is courage what is it what is meaning</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.170" end="00:30:00.020" style="s2">like bring it in to do that right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.930" end="00:30:03.890" style="s2">and and and and so wait and so bring in</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.020" end="00:30:06.530" style="s2">like the circling bring in aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.890" end="00:30:10.550" style="s2">what I would call far lia sophia bring</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.530" end="00:30:11.690" style="s2">in some of you know what you know what</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.550" end="00:30:13.100" style="s2">peter lindbergh talked about when you</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.690" end="00:30:16.730" style="s2">talked about the anti debate about</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.100" end="00:30:19.460" style="s2">trying to re craft argumentation so</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.730" end="00:30:22.580" style="s2">we&#39;re not pursuing Philae and okiya the</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.460" end="00:30:24.890" style="s2">love of victory but so that we we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.580" end="00:30:26.960" style="s2">you know we can afford this collective</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.890" end="00:30:31.790" style="s2">flow that generates this emergent</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.960" end="00:30:34.250" style="s2">dynamical system the logos that can be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.790" end="00:30:38.630" style="s2">place from which we can draw powerful</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.250" end="00:30:40.040" style="s2">insights so that we can start to get you</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.630" end="00:30:41.600" style="s2">know we don&#39;t have a good adjective here</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.040" end="00:30:43.420" style="s2">there I want to say practical but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.600" end="00:30:45.260" style="s2">not the right word but we can get really</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.420" end="00:30:47.900" style="s2">existentially transformative</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.260" end="00:30:50.450" style="s2">practical advice and guidance on how to</p>

<p begin="00:30:52.820" end="00:30:56.320" style="s2">technology that&#39;s what I want to do with</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.770" end="00:30:58.700" style="s2">this series the first half will be</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.320" end="00:31:00.740" style="s2">episodes on that historical calling</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.700" end="00:31:03.790" style="s2">scientific analysis of dialectic the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.740" end="00:31:06.500" style="s2">second half will be you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.790" end="00:31:08.900" style="s2">you know talking to people interviewing</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.500" end="00:31:11.960" style="s2">participant observation reporting on all</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.900" end="00:31:14.330" style="s2">of these emerging practices hmm</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.960" end="00:31:16.790" style="s2">how urgent a project he feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.330" end="00:31:18.770" style="s2">this this is at the moment well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.790" end="00:31:21.980" style="s2">two senses within which it&#39;s urgent one</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.770" end="00:31:23.960" style="s2">I think is as Kairos and I hear so many</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.980" end="00:31:25.820" style="s2">people on your channel talking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.960" end="00:31:27.830" style="s2">that and I take that very seriously III</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.820" end="00:31:29.480" style="s2">agree with that I there&#39;s a sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.830" end="00:31:32.210" style="s2">Kairos here there&#39;s a sense of a turning</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.480" end="00:31:34.190" style="s2">and and and there&#39;s a sense almost like</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.210" end="00:31:35.660" style="s2">in the biblical sense of death we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.190" end="00:31:37.460" style="s2">it we&#39;ve got to get our sensibilities</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.660" end="00:31:39.440" style="s2">really finely attuned to this turning so</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.460" end="00:31:43.940" style="s2">that we don&#39;t screw it up and we get it</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.440" end="00:31:45.980" style="s2">right right and and so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.940" end="00:31:47.590" style="s2">why this project is very urgent for me</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.980" end="00:31:50.960" style="s2">because I want to try and help that</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.590" end="00:31:53.480" style="s2">turning right but there&#39;s also this the</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.960" end="00:31:56.030" style="s2">urgency I take very seriously you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.480" end="00:31:59.570" style="s2">the fact that a lot of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.030" end="00:32:01.790" style="s2">are distressing a lot of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.570" end="00:32:04.280" style="s2">have been indicated as markers of</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.790" end="00:32:06.230" style="s2">general systems collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.280" end="00:32:09.110" style="s2">civilization collapse or seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.230" end="00:32:10.600" style="s2">accelerating you know we have I think we</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.110" end="00:32:12.890" style="s2">have just incontrovertible and a</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.600" end="00:32:14.540" style="s2">incontrovertible evidence of ecological</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.890" end="00:32:17.810" style="s2">degradation which is what you see when</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.540" end="00:32:20.450" style="s2">civilizations are you know close</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.810" end="00:32:23.270" style="s2">we definitely have we have political</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.450" end="00:32:26.320" style="s2">ossification stagnation and inability</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.270" end="00:32:31.640" style="s2">for institutions to solve our problems</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.320" end="00:32:36.680" style="s2">we have you know we have a breakdown of</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.640" end="00:32:38.450" style="s2">a shared worldview we have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.680" end="00:32:41.570" style="s2">indications that people are suffering</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.450" end="00:32:45.620" style="s2">existential and mental strain in ways</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.570" end="00:32:48.080" style="s2">that are accelerating a lot of stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.620" end="00:32:49.700" style="s2">talked about in in the symptomology of</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.080" end="00:32:52.820" style="s2">the meeting crisis and that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.700" end="00:32:54.290" style="s2">happening when we&#39;re we seem to in by</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.820" end="00:32:55.820" style="s2">many and this is you know Steven</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.290" end="00:32:57.370" style="s2">Pinker&#39;s thing by many of the measures</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.820" end="00:32:59.440" style="s2">we&#39;ve seemed we should be</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.370" end="00:33:00.910" style="s2">he seems to be sort of sort of like why</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.440" end="00:33:02.559" style="s2">aren&#39;t you just why are you just</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.910" end="00:33:05.890" style="s2">enjoying that where this is the golden</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.559" end="00:33:07.570" style="s2">time we&#39;ve never eradicated so much</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.890" end="00:33:10.030" style="s2">poverty in the world and reduce so much</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.570" end="00:33:14.230" style="s2">violence and but that&#39;s also a marker of</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.030" end="00:33:17.350" style="s2">a civilization that&#39;s about to tip and</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.230" end="00:33:19.630" style="s2">so all of these things you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.350" end="00:33:22.410" style="s2">I&#39;m wrong maybe he&#39;s right maybe the his</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.630" end="00:33:25.570" style="s2">graphs will continue to go right but I</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.410" end="00:33:27.070" style="s2">don&#39;t think I don&#39;t think I like part of</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.570" end="00:33:30.220" style="s2">the thing that I&#39;ve seen is just the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.070" end="00:33:32.830" style="s2">like I you know Jordan Peterson and my</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.220" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">work touched a nerve and other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.830" end="00:33:37.090" style="s2">work there&#39;s a you know about the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.240" end="00:33:40.150" style="s2">meaning quite touched a nerve I have so</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.090" end="00:33:42.850" style="s2">many people that write in and say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.150" end="00:33:46.270" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re putting into words what</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.850" end="00:33:47.860" style="s2">I&#39;ve been going through for years and</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.270" end="00:33:49.630" style="s2">right and they don&#39;t necessarily think</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.860" end="00:33:51.490" style="s2">you know agree with my salute my</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.630" end="00:33:53.530" style="s2">response or anything but it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.490" end="00:33:56.020" style="s2">that there was something going on there</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.530" end="00:33:58.300" style="s2">the same thing I was I was at a live Q&amp;A</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.020" end="00:34:01.390" style="s2">a couple days ago and people are coming</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.300" end="00:34:02.800" style="s2">up and yeah you know you have to take</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.390" end="00:34:04.600" style="s2">this properly but people are saying you</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.800" end="00:34:06.070" style="s2">know you sort of saved my life or</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.600" end="00:34:08.560" style="s2">something I think I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.070" end="00:34:10.179" style="s2">dismiss that I you don&#39;t want to you</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:11.800" style="s2">don&#39;t want to go the wrong way with it</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.179" end="00:34:13.720" style="s2">either but what they&#39;re trying what I</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.800" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">believe they&#39;re trying to say is this</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.720" end="00:34:18.669" style="s2">hat this is an urgent thing in my life</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.240" end="00:34:21.280" style="s2">and a life and a lot in the lives of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.669" end="00:34:23.590" style="s2">lot of people around me and you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.280" end="00:34:26.649" style="s2">you&#39;re bringing it to articulation in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.590" end="00:34:28.419" style="s2">powerful so for you know I think I pay</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.649" end="00:34:30.190" style="s2">attention to all these signs and I pay</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.419" end="00:34:31.510" style="s2">both the positive and the negative and</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.190" end="00:34:32.800" style="s2">like I say the video that Chris and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.510" end="00:34:34.810" style="s2">did on the symptom ology the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.800" end="00:34:36.909" style="s2">crisis we lay out that argument I take</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.810" end="00:34:39.010" style="s2">that all very seriously and I take the</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.909" end="00:34:40.870" style="s2">response that I&#39;m getting to my work and</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.010" end="00:34:42.760" style="s2">to and related work I think that all</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.870" end="00:34:44.649" style="s2">very seriously so not only do I sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.760" end="00:34:49.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a Kairos that we got to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.649" end="00:34:50.889" style="s2">right I think there&#39;s a threat that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.030" end="00:34:52.659" style="s2">imminent and if we don&#39;t do something</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.889" end="00:34:56.440" style="s2">about it we&#39;re going to be overtaken by</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.659" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">it given that sort of perspective why do</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.440" end="00:35:02.860" style="s2">you think that this con this particular</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:05.140" style="s2">piece about dialogue is the key response</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.860" end="00:35:08.080" style="s2">to that if we&#39;re if we are threatened</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.140" end="00:35:09.400" style="s2">why is that the right focus so I I want</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.080" end="00:35:10.200" style="s2">to be careful I&#39;m not claiming it&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.400" end="00:35:16.339" style="s2">kind of excuse</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.200" end="00:35:19.020" style="s2">thing to do my my way of doing a</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.339" end="00:35:23.880" style="s2">explaining why I think it&#39;s how it could</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.020" end="00:35:26.849" style="s2">play an important role is that I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.880" end="00:35:28.740" style="s2">that we have overwhelming historical and</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.849" end="00:35:31.079" style="s2">increasingly scientific evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.740" end="00:35:33.359" style="s2">people will undergo the significant</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.079" end="00:35:37.560" style="s2">transformations that are needed in order</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.359" end="00:35:40.260" style="s2">to address major threats like this right</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.560" end="00:35:42.359" style="s2">they will take serious hits to their</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.260" end="00:35:44.280" style="s2">standards of living they will take they</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.359" end="00:35:46.380" style="s2">they&#39;ll dildo they&#39;re willing to undergo</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.280" end="00:35:49.339" style="s2">sort of significant political and</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.380" end="00:35:52.140" style="s2">socio-economic experiment if they see</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.339" end="00:35:54.150" style="s2">lots of meaning making is going to come</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.140" end="00:35:55.470" style="s2">out of it but if they&#39;re in a meaning</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.150" end="00:35:57.660" style="s2">famine and they&#39;re in there in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.470" end="00:36:01.020" style="s2">scarcity mentality of meaning they also</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.660" end="00:36:03.210" style="s2">fire they lose they lose cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.020" end="00:36:04.920" style="s2">flexibility they lose the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.210" end="00:36:08.010" style="s2">insight they lose the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.920" end="00:36:11.520" style="s2">aspiration and transformation and right</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.010" end="00:36:15.060" style="s2">and and then they they they become in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.520" end="00:36:17.490" style="s2">very important sense rigid and and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.060" end="00:36:20.940" style="s2">they cling on to the other things that</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.490" end="00:36:25.440" style="s2">they would sacrifice if meaning was more</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.940" end="00:36:26.310" style="s2">apparent so if and I and yet and you and</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.440" end="00:36:28.230" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking about this we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.310" end="00:36:31.109" style="s2">mean meaning like in the Hallmark card</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.230" end="00:36:35.550" style="s2">oh that&#39;s a wonderful meaning we mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.109" end="00:36:38.990" style="s2">you know actual practices that will go</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.550" end="00:36:42.260" style="s2">into people&#39;s lives and give them</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.990" end="00:36:45.450" style="s2">responses to the perennial problems and</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.260" end="00:36:46.980" style="s2">facilitate them you know increasing</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.450" end="00:36:48.750" style="s2">their sense of connectedness to</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.980" end="00:36:50.880" style="s2">themselves to each other in the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.750" end="00:36:53.940" style="s2">that&#39;s what I mean when I say meaning</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.880" end="00:36:58.020" style="s2">and if we can give that to people I</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.940" end="00:37:02.160" style="s2">think then people are willing to go</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.020" end="00:37:03.839" style="s2">through that that the changes and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.160" end="00:37:05.880" style="s2">sacrifices that are going to be needed</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.839" end="00:37:07.319" style="s2">to address these other problems but</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.880" end="00:37:09.119" style="s2">that&#39;s again why we need the religion of</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.319" end="00:37:11.700" style="s2">no religion we need this can&#39;t be done</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.119" end="00:37:15.630" style="s2">on an individual ad hoc basis that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.700" end="00:37:17.609" style="s2">this the the collect the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.630" end="00:37:20.190" style="s2">collective intelligence is where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.609" end="00:37:22.870" style="s2">going to create as the religion of no</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.190" end="00:37:24.910" style="s2">religion that gives people this meaning</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.870" end="00:37:26.110" style="s2">right and gives them the functionality</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.910" end="00:37:27.520" style="s2">that will do that comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.110" end="00:37:30.700" style="s2">transformation of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.520" end="00:37:33.430" style="s2">cognition character and communitas that</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.700" end="00:37:36.490" style="s2">we&#39;re going to need if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.430" end="00:37:38.470" style="s2">solve to address these issues so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.490" end="00:37:40.750" style="s2">think of it as I wouldn&#39;t say like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.470" end="00:37:44.470" style="s2">the sole locus but I think if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.750" end="00:37:49.260" style="s2">get it if we don&#39;t address this then</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.470" end="00:37:52.540" style="s2">people people will not have the needed</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.260" end="00:37:55.900" style="s2">cognitive and existential resources to</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.540" end="00:37:58.180" style="s2">do what&#39;s going to be needed like I see</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.900" end="00:38:01.120" style="s2">it in my son&#39;s my older sons friends</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.180" end="00:38:03.250" style="s2">it&#39;s like they know that their standard</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.120" end="00:38:05.200" style="s2">of living isn&#39;t going to be right and</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.250" end="00:38:07.450" style="s2">they and they see and they&#39;re we they</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.200" end="00:38:11.170" style="s2">are really worried that their that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.450" end="00:38:13.810" style="s2">world is dying and and right and they</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.170" end="00:38:16.300" style="s2">get all that but yet they&#39;re like but</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.810" end="00:38:18.910" style="s2">they they&#39;re they&#39;re I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.300" end="00:38:21.010" style="s2">insulting but they&#39;re kind of fragile</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.910" end="00:38:22.120" style="s2">because they don&#39;t have they don&#39;t for</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.010" end="00:38:25.930" style="s2">lack of a better word they don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.120" end="00:38:28.030" style="s2">depth of wisdom right so their lives are</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.930" end="00:38:30.190" style="s2">already so caught up with these</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.030" end="00:38:32.830" style="s2">unaddressed perennial problems that they</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.190" end="00:38:34.870" style="s2">have very little left over to address</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.830" end="00:38:37.000" style="s2">these looming existential threats that</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.870" end="00:38:39.970" style="s2">they can&#39;t avoid acknowledging and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.000" end="00:38:42.430" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re often fragile and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.970" end="00:38:45.580" style="s2">really really feel for them in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.430" end="00:38:48.910" style="s2">profound way yeah I find that the focus</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.580" end="00:38:52.290" style="s2">on transformative conversation to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.910" end="00:38:55.360" style="s2">really really exciting and it&#39;s what so</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.290" end="00:38:56.890" style="s2">from the beginning of rebel wisdom I was</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.360" end="00:38:59.050" style="s2">sort of following like initially the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.890" end="00:39:00.580" style="s2">focus on Jordan Pederson and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.050" end="00:39:02.620" style="s2">talked about this before the eye but</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.580" end="00:39:04.750" style="s2">Jordan Peterson for me at his best with</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.620" end="00:39:06.310" style="s2">his lectures there&#39;s a kind of sense of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.750" end="00:39:08.410" style="s2">exploration and there&#39;s almost this</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.310" end="00:39:09.820" style="s2">sense of a dialogue with him with the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.410" end="00:39:10.960" style="s2">audience even though it&#39;s a monologue he</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.820" end="00:39:13.060" style="s2">sort of you don&#39;t know where he&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.960" end="00:39:15.100" style="s2">to go and there&#39;s an emergent quality to</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.060" end="00:39:17.380" style="s2">a lot of what he&#39;s saying and then a</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.100" end="00:39:19.240" style="s2">sense with the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.380" end="00:39:21.940" style="s2">when it was first announced and framed</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.240" end="00:39:23.830" style="s2">was around oh these are people who are</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.940" end="00:39:25.750" style="s2">going to have a conversation they might</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.830" end="00:39:27.820" style="s2">change their minds there&#39;s an aliveness</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.750" end="00:39:30.070" style="s2">and there was some of that in some of</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.820" end="00:39:32.230" style="s2">the talks but that was not really borne</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.070" end="00:39:36.190" style="s2">out like I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.230" end="00:39:37.900" style="s2">public example of what that</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.190" end="00:39:39.190" style="s2">a transformative conversation really</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.900" end="00:39:41.410" style="s2">looks like where we go in and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.190" end="00:39:43.210" style="s2">potentially change our minds but how can</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.410" end="00:39:45.310" style="s2">people have these kind of genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.210" end="00:39:46.990" style="s2">transformative conversations I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.310" end="00:39:48.460" style="s2">once you get a certain profile and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.990" end="00:39:51.369" style="s2">get identified with a certain position</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.460" end="00:39:52.810" style="s2">it&#39;s much harder to do that for example</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.369" end="00:39:55.990" style="s2">the new atheist position and sam harris</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.810" end="00:39:58.180" style="s2">but but this is where i think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.990" end="00:39:59.950" style="s2">our attention has gone to it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.180" end="00:40:02.980" style="s2">does a transformative conversation look</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.950" end="00:40:04.869" style="s2">like how do we do it and how can we get</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.980" end="00:40:06.040" style="s2">ourselves into that space because</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.869" end="00:40:09.010" style="s2">without it I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.040" end="00:40:09.869" style="s2">get to the truth I totally agree with</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.010" end="00:40:16.210" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.869" end="00:40:17.770" style="s2">and and part of it for me is is that III</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.210" end="00:40:19.089" style="s2">would say it&#39;s something more than just</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.770" end="00:40:20.170" style="s2">a transformative conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.089" end="00:40:22.329" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.170" end="00:40:24.010" style="s2">dialectic is bringing in sort of a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.329" end="00:40:26.200" style="s2">of different transformative psycho tech</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.010" end="00:40:28.060" style="s2">we&#39;re conversation is one of them but</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.200" end="00:40:29.140" style="s2">they&#39;re being coordinated in a way and</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.060" end="00:40:31.690" style="s2">so I&#39;m really interested in that because</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.140" end="00:40:35.170" style="s2">I one of the things I argue in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.690" end="00:40:36.790" style="s2">series is that the the we&#39;ve got to get</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.170" end="00:40:38.980" style="s2">below propositional knowing to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.790" end="00:40:40.210" style="s2">procedural and the perspectival and in</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.980" end="00:40:43.810" style="s2">the participatory if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.210" end="00:40:46.359" style="s2">actually get people to transform in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.810" end="00:40:50.650" style="s2">way they need to in order to meet what</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.359" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">Thomas Bjorkman calls the meta crisis so</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.650" end="00:40:57.869" style="s2">I agree with all of that I get and part</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.359" end="00:41:01.180" style="s2">of what I part of what I&#39;m excited about</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.869" end="00:41:04.329" style="s2">well I&#39;m excited about the fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.180" end="00:41:06.790" style="s2">know like it sorry it was recent and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.329" end="00:41:08.740" style="s2">had just a Titanic impact on all of us</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.790" end="00:41:10.599" style="s2">like those like there was a four-way</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.740" end="00:41:12.339" style="s2">thing between guy and Jordan and</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.599" end="00:41:14.440" style="s2">Christopher master Pietro and myself we</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.339" end="00:41:19.300" style="s2">recorded it and we all came away from</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.440" end="00:41:20.530" style="s2">that saying da da like Jordan said he</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.300" end="00:41:22.690" style="s2">was ringing and he had to have an app</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.530" end="00:41:24.130" style="s2">and guy was just saying he said you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.690" end="00:41:26.380" style="s2">I hope I never recover from that</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.130" end="00:41:29.290" style="s2">conversation what an amazingly beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.380" end="00:41:32.440" style="s2">thing to say I hope I never recover from</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.290" end="00:41:33.819" style="s2">that conversation and I just came I came</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.440" end="00:41:35.349" style="s2">I had to do I was supposed to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.819" end="00:41:37.720" style="s2">work after that I couldn&#39;t I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.349" end="00:41:40.510" style="s2">pacing around my apartment I was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.720" end="00:41:42.190" style="s2">right because it was we were not only</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.510" end="00:41:43.450" style="s2">talking because I had framed the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.190" end="00:41:46.000" style="s2">conversation I want to talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.450" end="00:41:48.880" style="s2">project of dialectic but I felt that at</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.000" end="00:41:51.339" style="s2">many points in that that dialogue we</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.880" end="00:41:53.650" style="s2">actually were exemplifying that what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.339" end="00:41:55.450" style="s2">talking about and and and if and and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.650" end="00:41:57.339" style="s2">and and it goes to the core of your</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.450" end="00:41:59.260" style="s2">thing what we law you know when we move</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.339" end="00:42:01.599" style="s2">from the platonic dialogue to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.260" end="00:42:03.760" style="s2">Aristotelian monologue we lost something</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.599" end="00:42:06.130" style="s2">and I&#39;m very well well of that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.760" end="00:42:08.890" style="s2">really well aware of that temptation I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.130" end="00:42:10.240" style="s2">a professor I get to stand up and do the</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.890" end="00:42:12.460" style="s2">monologue and I&#39;m doing it in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.240" end="00:42:15.190" style="s2">series but there was no monologue there</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.460" end="00:42:18.040" style="s2">at all like and you know and and the way</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.190" end="00:42:19.900" style="s2">like what was happening there they it</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.040" end="00:42:23.099" style="s2">was it in my opinion it&#39;s the logos</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.900" end="00:42:26.500" style="s2">there&#39;s this joint supervening</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.099" end="00:42:28.270" style="s2">authorship that you&#39;re participating in</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.500" end="00:42:30.040" style="s2">you know it&#39;s just possibly receiving</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.270" end="00:42:32.230" style="s2">but you&#39;re not make that&#39;s it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.040" end="00:42:34.630" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s participatory and transfer</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.230" end="00:42:38.740" style="s2">transformative in the participation and</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.630" end="00:42:40.630" style="s2">so just that for me was proof of concept</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.740" end="00:42:42.700" style="s2">that for me was proof of concept that</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.630" end="00:42:45.520" style="s2">this kind of thing is possible we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.700" end="00:42:48.250" style="s2">move from a monologue to a dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.520" end="00:42:51.400" style="s2">the dialogue can be doing work like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.250" end="00:42:53.710" style="s2">not just right and and it&#39;s fair to say</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.400" end="00:42:55.599" style="s2">this because guys responsive to this he</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.710" end="00:42:58.210" style="s2">I said like I understand what circling</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.599" end="00:42:59.859" style="s2">does for people on its own and I belong</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.210" end="00:43:04.210" style="s2">to a circling group now and I value it</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.859" end="00:43:07.349" style="s2">but but it I want we need dialectic yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.210" end="00:43:10.599" style="s2">I agree I think I think I I find it a</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.349" end="00:43:12.400" style="s2">bit repetitive film on YouTube I find a</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.599" end="00:43:14.049" style="s2">bit repetitive to just keep going back</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.400" end="00:43:16.270" style="s2">to okay the nature of the present moment</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.049" end="00:43:18.700" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay that&#39;s fine but where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.270" end="00:43:20.200" style="s2">the content where&#39;s the like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.700" end="00:43:22.359" style="s2">something we&#39;re really exploring as well</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.200" end="00:43:25.809" style="s2">at the moment with we&#39;re about to</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.359" end="00:43:27.099" style="s2">announce a whole we&#39;ve done a collective</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.809" end="00:43:29.109" style="s2">intelligent series we&#39;re about to</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.099" end="00:43:31.119" style="s2">announce an event where we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.109" end="00:43:32.710" style="s2">call it impossible conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.119" end="00:43:35.200" style="s2">we&#39;re going to use sort of serve the</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.710" end="00:43:37.540" style="s2">circling modality and then introduce hot</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.200" end="00:43:40.290" style="s2">topics hot cultural topics into it and</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.540" end="00:43:42.580" style="s2">then take people into like discussing</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.290" end="00:43:45.550" style="s2">gender or kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.580" end="00:43:48.190" style="s2">of immigration or whatever a topic that</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.550" end="00:43:49.810" style="s2">often will get heated and then ask</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.190" end="00:43:52.360" style="s2">people to come out of that again like</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.810" end="00:43:54.310" style="s2">almost like stop come out and now talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.360" end="00:43:55.900" style="s2">about like what I came up what happened</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.310" end="00:43:57.520" style="s2">so starting to get a kind of almost</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.900" end="00:44:00.040" style="s2">object relation to our own belief</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.520" end="00:44:02.410" style="s2">structures realizing okay I realize like</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.040" end="00:44:04.090" style="s2">I&#39;m holding that here I got much more</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.410" end="00:44:07.150" style="s2">upset than I expect it to be or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.090" end="00:44:09.100" style="s2">excellent so that that&#39;s where it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.150" end="00:44:12.160" style="s2">very similar to what I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.100" end="00:44:14.680" style="s2">very similar indeed introducing content</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.160" end="00:44:18.130" style="s2">to the kind of the we space practices I</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.680" end="00:44:21.010" style="s2">suppose yes introducing content but also</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.130" end="00:44:22.540" style="s2">yeah well as long as we explain what we</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.010" end="00:44:24.600" style="s2">mean by content I&#39;m not I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.540" end="00:44:26.590" style="s2">interested in just generating more</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.600" end="00:44:29.950" style="s2">propositions I&#39;m generating I have</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.590" end="00:44:34.960" style="s2">interests in generating insight right so</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.950" end="00:44:36.520" style="s2">that like again this why the template of</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.960" end="00:44:38.290" style="s2">the Socratic dialogues is so important</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.520" end="00:44:40.780" style="s2">to me and very often those dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.290" end="00:44:43.390" style="s2">will end what&#39;s really important that</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.780" end="00:44:45.940" style="s2">the work of like you know Gonzalez on</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.390" end="00:44:48.400" style="s2">this or especially Sarah rapid his book</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.940" end="00:44:50.080" style="s2">on this or Moore&#39;s book on there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.400" end="00:44:52.240" style="s2">Renaissance of all this happening right</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.080" end="00:44:54.250" style="s2">the dialogues will often end went out</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.240" end="00:44:55.930" style="s2">with aporia like you know I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.250" end="00:44:58.870" style="s2">the lysis where it&#39;s you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.930" end="00:45:00.790" style="s2">courage and you know he&#39;s and we all go</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.870" end="00:45:02.740" style="s2">to war all through this and it ends and</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.790" end="00:45:04.060" style="s2">nobody and you and if you just look at</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.740" end="00:45:06.550" style="s2">the propositions that look like well</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.060" end="00:45:07.750" style="s2">that was a waste of time but what</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.550" end="00:45:10.330" style="s2">happens at the end of the day you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.750" end="00:45:12.070" style="s2">to read get to pay attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.330" end="00:45:13.720" style="s2">drama because the drama is where play</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.070" end="00:45:15.180" style="s2">that&#39;s what Plato is using to try and</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.720" end="00:45:17.890" style="s2">point to the collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.180" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">because what happens in the drama is</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.890" end="00:45:23.260" style="s2">both the interlocutors with Socrates say</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:25.900" style="s2">we want we want our sons to come in and</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.260" end="00:45:28.120" style="s2">spend time with you and learned courage</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.900" end="00:45:31.120" style="s2">from you and you think what what what</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.120" end="00:45:32.710" style="s2">what happened because Socrates wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.120" end="00:45:34.390" style="s2">able to produce a definition of courage</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.710" end="00:45:36.250" style="s2">and what you do and this is drew</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.390" end="00:45:38.250" style="s2">Highlands point no home you go back and</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.250" end="00:45:41.650" style="s2">look what Socrates was doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.250" end="00:45:45.010" style="s2">he&#39;s exemplifying something that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.650" end="00:45:46.660" style="s2">be captured in a definition and so the</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.010" end="00:45:49.150" style="s2">self-awareness and the self-knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.660" end="00:45:50.620" style="s2">isn&#39;t just about well what are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.150" end="00:45:53.710" style="s2">right now in the present moment it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.620" end="00:45:55.210" style="s2">like oh look what we can do by coming</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.710" end="00:45:55.720" style="s2">into the present moment is we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.210" end="00:45:57.880" style="s2">discover</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.720" end="00:46:00.280" style="s2">how we&#39;re exemplifying the thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.880" end="00:46:01.869" style="s2">trying to understand and that can give</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.280" end="00:46:03.970" style="s2">us a kind of deep participatory</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.869" end="00:46:06.280" style="s2">transformative insight into what it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.970" end="00:46:10.690" style="s2">and that&#39;s where the recursive ad of</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.280" end="00:46:14.290" style="s2">things like circling can become the self</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.690" end="00:46:16.390" style="s2">awareness of exemplification that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.290" end="00:46:17.440" style="s2">kind of thing I see as a real puzzle and</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.390" end="00:46:19.420" style="s2">that&#39;s what was happening in that</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.440" end="00:46:20.890" style="s2">four-way discussion we were going we</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.420" end="00:46:22.660" style="s2">would step back and we&#39;d say something</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.890" end="00:46:24.359" style="s2">like you know what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.660" end="00:46:26.650" style="s2">vulnerability and what I say okay but I</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.359" end="00:46:30.250" style="s2">remember at one point I said okay but if</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.650" end="00:46:32.500" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to understand this like</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.250" end="00:46:34.900" style="s2">visit can we is there a way in which the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.500" end="00:46:37.720" style="s2">world is vulnerable because like an</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.900" end="00:46:40.330" style="s2">indictment guy literally sort of shifted</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.720" end="00:46:42.790" style="s2">around in his chair and he oh because it</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.330" end="00:46:46.119" style="s2">was like we&#39;re exemplifying this but</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.790" end="00:46:48.430" style="s2">what does it mean let&#39;s not just note it</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.119" end="00:46:50.560" style="s2">but what does it tell us about our</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.430" end="00:46:53.140" style="s2">attempts to connect to the world about</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.560" end="00:46:55.000" style="s2">the phenomenology of our ontology what</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.140" end="00:46:56.950" style="s2">does it tell us right now we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.000" end="00:46:57.810" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a moment here we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.950" end="00:47:01.050" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.810" end="00:47:04.750" style="s2">that&#39;s where instead of just noting</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.050" end="00:47:06.670" style="s2">right and we can we can we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.750" end="00:47:09.970" style="s2">do something like what was going on in</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.670" end="00:47:11.710" style="s2">dialectic so you mentioned before that</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.970" end="00:47:15.400" style="s2">we might come back to rationality of</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.710" end="00:47:17.950" style="s2">wisdom yeah yeah so this is this is part</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.400" end="00:47:20.560" style="s2">of my response to what you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.950" end="00:47:24.940" style="s2">about the the loss of the hegemony of</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.560" end="00:47:26.800" style="s2">the New Atheists and part of and this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.940" end="00:47:29.050" style="s2">actually the series of videos that are</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.800" end="00:47:30.820" style="s2">coming out right now though the section</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.050" end="00:47:35.109" style="s2">on sort of rationality and wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.820" end="00:47:36.760" style="s2">part of part of my critique of the new</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.109" end="00:47:39.430" style="s2">atheist is I think they have a very thin</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.760" end="00:47:42.940" style="s2">and truncated notion of rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.430" end="00:47:46.060" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get back to a notion of</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.940" end="00:47:49.330" style="s2">rationality that is clearly related as</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.060" end="00:47:51.040" style="s2">it was in the ancient world to wisdom we</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.330" end="00:47:53.849" style="s2">should be cultivating our best wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.040" end="00:47:55.930" style="s2">and rationality as we come into these</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.849" end="00:47:59.770" style="s2">dialogues and then those dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.930" end="00:48:02.859" style="s2">should be feeding back into taking us</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.770" end="00:48:04.869" style="s2">beyond where we can go on our own which</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.859" end="00:48:07.510" style="s2">is central to cultivate the cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.869" end="00:48:08.650" style="s2">of wisdom so I think those two that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.510" end="00:48:09.160" style="s2">part of what I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.650" end="00:48:11.349" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.160" end="00:48:13.599" style="s2">again what I mean by dialectic it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.349" end="00:48:16.420" style="s2">that&#39;s why and sometimes I try to get a</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.599" end="00:48:18.640" style="s2">term I&#39;m sort of playing with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.420" end="00:48:20.109" style="s2">neologism of just using the the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.640" end="00:48:22.510" style="s2">Greek as something that&#39;s beyond</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.109" end="00:48:25.539" style="s2">dialogue and dialectic like sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.510" end="00:48:27.309" style="s2">called a diya logos to emphasize the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.539" end="00:48:30.010" style="s2">generation of the logos and the logos is</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.309" end="00:48:31.299" style="s2">both something like I said that&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.010" end="00:48:34.150" style="s2">meta psycho technology but also</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.299" end="00:48:36.099" style="s2">something that I then internalize as I</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.150" end="00:48:38.920" style="s2">as I cultivate wisdom and the two are</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.099" end="00:48:41.470" style="s2">just well they&#39;re they&#39;re feeding into</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.920" end="00:48:44.500" style="s2">each other so the new series after</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.470" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">Socrates what do you hope to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.500" end="00:48:47.770" style="s2">through it</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.760" end="00:48:49.059" style="s2">do you gee I guess it sounds to me like</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.770" end="00:48:51.670" style="s2">you want to be kind of going on a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.059" end="00:48:53.079" style="s2">a journey yes during it where do you</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.670" end="00:48:57.490" style="s2">hope to be at the end of the twenty</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.079" end="00:48:59.829" style="s2">episodes so I one of my the Keystone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.490" end="00:49:01.150" style="s2">of my pedagogy is to put myself on to a</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.829" end="00:49:03.010" style="s2">journey of learning and then share that</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.150" end="00:49:07.240" style="s2">as opposed to just disseminating</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.010" end="00:49:12.160" style="s2">information and so that&#39;s where I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.240" end="00:49:16.569" style="s2">my best teaching happens and I&#39;m hoping</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.160" end="00:49:18.730" style="s2">and this is not again this is something</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.569" end="00:49:21.279" style="s2">that this is something I&#39;m aspiring to</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.730" end="00:49:23.829" style="s2">in Agnes coloured sense that I will be</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.279" end="00:49:28.950" style="s2">in the sense of I&#39;m going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.829" end="00:49:28.950" style="s2">different person at the end of this and</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.130" end="00:49:38.710" style="s2">I&#39;m hoping that dialectic and the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.410" end="00:49:40.270" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to explain it will be so</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.710" end="00:49:44.950" style="s2">first of all personally will be as</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.270" end="00:49:46.180" style="s2">central to my own spirituality for lack</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.950" end="00:49:49.770" style="s2">of a better word I don&#39;t like that word</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.180" end="00:49:52.420" style="s2">but that you know meditation is</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.770" end="00:49:53.890" style="s2">contemplation is Tai Chi Chuan is Alexio</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.420" end="00:49:54.760" style="s2">Devine is and there&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.890" end="00:49:56.890" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be part of this area</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.760" end="00:49:58.750" style="s2">there&#39;s an important thing between Lexi</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.890" end="00:50:01.720" style="s2">Oh Davina as a style of reading and</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.750" end="00:50:03.339" style="s2">dialectic that&#39;s also Oh Lexi Oh Davina</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.720" end="00:50:04.930" style="s2">oh so I talked about this in the serial</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.339" end="00:50:07.119" style="s2">exit Davina is a way of reading and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.930" end="00:50:09.220" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a practice now</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.119" end="00:50:13.569" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing I guess for about a year</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.220" end="00:50:16.750" style="s2">and I&#39;m starting to get a sense of if</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.569" end="00:50:18.190" style="s2">it&#39;s potential so when you read a text</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.750" end="00:50:20.260" style="s2">and Lexi Oh Davina and this is to try</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.190" end="00:50:21.590" style="s2">and get back to how we move to silent</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.260" end="00:50:23.090" style="s2">reading and we moved</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.590" end="00:50:24.860" style="s2">sort of propositional consumption is</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.090" end="00:50:26.420" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing with reading was before</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.860" end="00:50:29.120" style="s2">that people are reading communally and</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.420" end="00:50:32.930" style="s2">they&#39;re reciting and the point of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.120" end="00:50:35.990" style="s2">reading is to is to participate in an</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.930" end="00:50:37.790" style="s2">aspiration for transformation right and</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.990" end="00:50:41.390" style="s2">so what you do in Alexio Divina is you</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.790" end="00:50:46.220" style="s2">take a text and then you you you you</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.390" end="00:50:48.500" style="s2">read it aloud and then you basically go</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.220" end="00:50:51.590" style="s2">into something like a meditative state</p>

<p begin="00:53:36.990" end="00:53:40.650" style="s2">myself personally and that&#39;s what I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.339" end="00:53:43.470" style="s2">like to see the series doing like</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.650" end="00:53:46.680" style="s2">interpersonally hmm yeah I guess what</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.470" end="00:53:49.530" style="s2">I&#39;d say as well is that what what where</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.680" end="00:53:51.480" style="s2">is the where is the interaction point</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.530" end="00:53:53.210" style="s2">between this which can be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.480" end="00:53:56.250" style="s2">kind of abstract or a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.210" end="00:53:57.690" style="s2">intellectual and the mainstream and for</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.250" end="00:53:59.430" style="s2">me that feels like it&#39;s around</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.690" end="00:54:01.560" style="s2">impossible conversations is around</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.430" end="00:54:03.810" style="s2">difficult conversations becoming</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.560" end="00:54:06.599" style="s2">self-aware to how we are in conversation</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.810" end="00:54:09.270" style="s2">seems to be there&#39;s been a few books out</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.599" end="00:54:10.950" style="s2">recently peter Bogosian and James</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.270" end="00:54:13.170" style="s2">Lindsay wrote having possible</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.950" end="00:54:14.839" style="s2">conversations there&#39;s another couple of</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.170" end="00:54:16.920" style="s2">books coming out that I&#39;m aware of</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.839" end="00:54:19.050" style="s2">around the same thing like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.920" end="00:54:20.910" style="s2">have difficult conversations and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.050" end="00:54:22.349" style="s2">only way and that was actually one of my</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.910" end="00:54:23.730" style="s2">criticisms of their book is that it</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.349" end="00:54:25.740" style="s2">didn&#39;t really go into the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.730" end="00:54:27.450" style="s2">and into the interpersonal anywhere near</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.740" end="00:54:30.260" style="s2">enough it was more about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.450" end="00:54:32.520" style="s2">conversational techniques rather than</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.260" end="00:54:33.750" style="s2">becoming sort of deeply deeply aware of</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.520" end="00:54:35.550" style="s2">what we&#39;re bringing and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.750" end="00:54:37.410" style="s2">what&#39;s happening to us when we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.550" end="00:54:39.990" style="s2">dialogue with others but that feels</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.410" end="00:54:43.140" style="s2">absolutely essential as a kind of way</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.990" end="00:54:45.630" style="s2">through or a way of kind of diffusing</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.140" end="00:54:47.350" style="s2">some of the worst aspects of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.630" end="00:54:50.050" style="s2">kind of polarization and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.350" end="00:54:51.700" style="s2">the the culture wars that were that</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.050" end="00:54:53.260" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing is becoming much more aware</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.700" end="00:54:55.090" style="s2">of what we&#39;re bringing in what we&#39;re how</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.260" end="00:54:57.100" style="s2">we are in conversation I agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.090" end="00:54:59.140" style="s2">I mean part of part of what I&#39;m doing in</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.100" end="00:55:00.580" style="s2">in preparations I&#39;m going through a lot</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.140" end="00:55:04.060" style="s2">of the literature you referred to and</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.580" end="00:55:06.250" style="s2">like verbal Aikido and you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.060" end="00:55:07.180" style="s2">and nonviolent communication and trying</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.250" end="00:55:10.240" style="s2">to understand all of that</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.180" end="00:55:11.980" style="s2">and and I do agree with you that part of</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.240" end="00:55:13.690" style="s2">what we have to facilitate is impossible</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.980" end="00:55:15.850" style="s2">conversations but there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.690" end="00:55:17.350" style="s2">kinds of impossible conversations</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.850" end="00:55:18.430" style="s2">there&#39;s impossible conversations because</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.350" end="00:55:21.100" style="s2">we come in with different commitments</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.430" end="00:55:23.740" style="s2">and values right and I understand that</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.100" end="00:55:25.480" style="s2">and I acknowledge that we need to bring</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.740" end="00:55:27.460" style="s2">something like dialectic to bear on that</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.480" end="00:55:30.250" style="s2">but there&#39;s also other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.460" end="00:55:33.640" style="s2">impossible conversations where as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.250" end="00:55:35.320" style="s2">here and how do we get there it was like</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.640" end="00:55:37.570" style="s2">what I talked about when you know when</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.320" end="00:55:39.490" style="s2">there&#39;s a some episodes in the series</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.570" end="00:55:41.380" style="s2">where I talk about that Gnostic sense of</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.490" end="00:55:43.090" style="s2">being entrapped in a world and you could</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.380" end="00:55:44.890" style="s2">you don&#39;t know how to get oh you want to</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.090" end="00:55:46.360" style="s2">be there the kind of thing that people</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.890" end="00:55:50.140" style="s2">experience in therapy when they&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.360" end="00:55:52.090" style="s2">and it&#39;s important I shouldn&#39;t be doing</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.140" end="00:55:54.460" style="s2">this anymore but they keep and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.090" end="00:55:56.650" style="s2">stuck and it&#39;s kind of an impossibility</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.460" end="00:55:58.510" style="s2">for them is how do I get over there and</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.650" end="00:56:00.460" style="s2">part of what happens in therapy is</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.510" end="00:56:01.810" style="s2">another kind of impossible conversation</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.460" end="00:56:03.460" style="s2">where it&#39;s not that these people are</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.810" end="00:56:05.350" style="s2">coming in because they have conflicting</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.460" end="00:56:07.570" style="s2">values it&#39;s like we&#39;re here and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.350" end="00:56:09.040" style="s2">stuck and how do we get there and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.570" end="00:56:10.570" style="s2">think that&#39;s another important part</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.040" end="00:56:12.190" style="s2">another important kind of impossible</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.570" end="00:56:14.590" style="s2">conversation we need to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.190" end="00:56:16.570" style="s2">have because we have to get to somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.590" end="00:56:17.770" style="s2">else than where we are part of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.570" end="00:56:19.600" style="s2">going to be what you said part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.770" end="00:56:21.430" style="s2">like okay when we come in we&#39;ve got us</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.600" end="00:56:23.260" style="s2">somehow it reminds me of like the two</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.430" end="00:56:25.810" style="s2">parts of platonic and Hana Gargan we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.260" end="00:56:28.960" style="s2">got to reduce the interpersonal conflict</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.810" end="00:56:31.840" style="s2">in some you know some way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.960" end="00:56:36.070" style="s2">affording that that that right that</p>
