<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:02.000" style="s2">oh</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.630" end="00:00:22.189" style="s2">Hello, everyone. Thank you again for showing up, so</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.779" end="00:00:26.779" style="s2">tonight</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.909" end="00:00:31.129" style="s2">We&#39;re going to finish off the story of Noah and also</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.919" end="00:00:33.919" style="s2">the story of</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.930" end="00:00:35.880" style="s2">the Tower of Babel</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.880" end="00:00:38.389" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think that&#39;ll take very long and</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.090" end="00:00:41.090" style="s2">then we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.390" end="00:00:44.660" style="s2">turn to the abrahamic Stories and</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.680" end="00:00:49.519" style="s2">They&#39;re a very complex set of stories. They sit between</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.179" end="00:00:52.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.440" end="00:00:56.480" style="s2">Earliest stories in Genesis that I would say end with the tower of babel</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.480" end="00:01:00.829" style="s2">And then the stories of moses which are extraordinarily well-developed</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.640" end="00:01:04.669" style="s2">Abrahamic stories, there&#39;s a whole sequence of them</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.580" end="00:01:07.380" style="s2">multiple stories</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.380" end="00:01:09.380" style="s2">conjoined together and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.540" end="00:01:11.540" style="s2">There I found them very daunting</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.909" end="00:01:14.029" style="s2">they&#39;re very difficult to understand and</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.520" end="00:01:15.479" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.479" end="00:01:21.048" style="s2">I&#39;m going to stumble through them the best that I can I would say that&#39;s that&#39;s probably the best way to think about this because</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.720" end="00:01:23.460" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.460" end="00:01:26.360" style="s2">Have a narrative content. That&#39;s quite strange</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.299" end="00:01:29.299" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.689" end="00:01:36.559" style="s2">was reading a book while doing this called the disappearance of God that I found quite helpful, and</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.180" end="00:01:42.379" style="s2">the author of that book argues that</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.979" end="00:01:46.909" style="s2">one of the things that happens in the old testament is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.640" end="00:01:50.180" style="s2">God is very manifest at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.210" end="00:01:55.219" style="s2">in terms of personal appearances even and then that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.829" end="00:02:00.409" style="s2">proclivity fades away as the old testament develops, and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.850" end="00:02:04.469" style="s2">parallel development</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.469" end="00:02:11.119" style="s2">That it&#39;s maybe maybe causally linked. I&#39;m not exactly sure how to conceptualize it, but that appears to be causally linked is that?</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.390" end="00:02:14.390" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.670" end="00:02:21.920" style="s2">Stories about individuals become more and more well-developed so it says in it&#39;s as if as God fades away, so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.440" end="00:02:25.519" style="s2">the individual becomes more and more manifest and</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.569" end="00:02:31.969" style="s2">There&#39;s a statement in the old testament the location of which. I don&#39;t recall</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.610" end="00:02:37.099" style="s2">But I&#39;ll tell you about it in future lectures where God essentially tells</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.220" end="00:02:45.470" style="s2">Whoever he&#39;s speaking with and I don&#39;t remember who that is that he&#39;s going to disappear and let man essentially go his own way</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.860" end="00:02:51.289" style="s2">And see what happens not a complete disappearance, but maybe a transformations is something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.959" end="00:02:59.809" style="s2">Modern people regard more as a psychological phenomena rather than the sort of objective entity that God seems to be in</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.150" end="00:03:02.150" style="s2">the beginning of the biblical stories</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.760" end="00:03:04.970" style="s2">and so I&#39;ve been wrestling with that a lot because</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.790" end="00:03:07.790" style="s2">the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.069" end="00:03:11.988" style="s2">God, I got appears to Abraham multiple times and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.650" end="00:03:16.220" style="s2">that&#39;s not a concept that&#39;s easy for modern people to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.010" end="00:03:19.010" style="s2">to grasp in</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.590" end="00:03:20.970" style="s2">for us</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.970" end="00:03:24.199" style="s2">generally speaking apart from say issues of Faith</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.989" end="00:03:26.819" style="s2">God is it some?</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.819" end="00:03:28.049" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.049" end="00:03:32.119" style="s2">someone who makes himself personally manifest in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.819" end="00:03:34.819" style="s2">He doesn&#39;t appear to us</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.359" end="00:03:40.219" style="s2">That&#39;s I suppose why the question of belief is so paramount for modern people</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.220" end="00:03:46.789" style="s2">I presume that if God had within the habit of appearing to you you likely wouldn&#39;t have a problem with belief</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.790" end="00:03:52.280" style="s2">I mean it might be more complicated than that, but that&#39;s how it seems to me, and so when we read stories about</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.049" end="00:04:01.279" style="s2">God making himself manifest either to a nation say in the case of israel or to individuals</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.530" end="00:04:04.069" style="s2">It&#39;s not easy to understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.919" end="00:04:10.879" style="s2">It&#39;s not easy to understand why people would write stories like that if they thought like we thought and I mean it really it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.879" end="00:04:15.319" style="s2">That long ago that the Bible was written say from a biological perspective. It&#39;s really only yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.319" end="00:04:18.948" style="s2">It&#39;s a couple thousand years say four thousand years something like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.769" end="00:04:24.649" style="s2">That&#39;s not very long ago from a biological perspective, it&#39;s it&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.130" end="00:04:27.450" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.450" end="00:04:29.450" style="s2">the first thing I tried to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.610" end="00:04:34.500" style="s2">see if I could figure out how to understand that and so else the lecture once we finish the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.860" end="00:04:41.699" style="s2">remains of the story of Noah, I&#39;ll start the lecture with a with an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.640" end="00:04:48.090" style="s2">Situate the abrahamic stories in a context that might make them more accessible</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.430" end="00:04:50.760" style="s2">These two contexts that work for me to make them more accessible</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:54.730" style="s2">Let&#39;s conclude</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.730" end="00:04:56.470" style="s2">the Noah Story</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.470" end="00:04:58.739" style="s2">first however when we</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.680" end="00:05:01.660" style="s2">ended last time</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.660" end="00:05:07.109" style="s2">The ark had come to its resting place and Noah and his family had</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.410" end="00:05:10.360" style="s2">debarked</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.360" end="00:05:11.830" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.830" end="00:05:13.830" style="s2">so this is the stories of</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.380" end="00:05:17.159" style="s2">What occurs immediately after afterwards?</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.920" end="00:05:21.359" style="s2">it&#39;s a very short story, but I think it&#39;s it&#39;s very relevant for</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.030" end="00:05:23.170" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.170" end="00:05:27.689" style="s2">Of these stories the tower of babel is well very relevant for our current times and the sons of Noah</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.450" end="00:05:32.280" style="s2">That went forth of the ark were shem, and ham and Japheth and ham</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.130" end="00:05:35.130" style="s2">Is the father of Canaan?</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.040" end="00:05:41.670" style="s2">These are the three sons of Noah and of them was the whole Earth overspread and Noah began to be a husbandman</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.340" end="00:05:45.000" style="s2">and he planted a vine yard and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.610" end="00:05:49.740" style="s2">he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tent and</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.260" end="00:05:56.160" style="s2">Ham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren without?</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.430" end="00:06:01.980" style="s2">and shem and Japheth took a garment and laid upon both their shoulders and went backward and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.170" end="00:06:07.139" style="s2">Covered the nakedness of their father and their faces were backward and they saw not their fathers nakedness</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.840" end="00:06:10.769" style="s2">And Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.770" end="00:06:17.970" style="s2">had done unto him and he said curse had to be Canaan a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren and</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.540" end="00:06:25.829" style="s2">He said blessed shall be the lord. God of shem and Canaan Shall be his servant and God shall enlarge Japheth</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.830" end="00:06:29.069" style="s2">And he shall dwell in the tents of shem and Canaan Shall be his servant</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.620" end="00:06:36.389" style="s2">and Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years and all the days of Noah were 950 years and he died and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.870" end="00:06:41.310" style="s2">the whole Earth was of one language and of one speech okay, so</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:46.170" style="s2">I remember thinking about this story</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.710" end="00:06:49.710" style="s2">It&#39;s got to be 30 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.310" end="00:06:56.640" style="s2">And I think the meaning of the story stood out for me sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.060" end="00:07:04.170" style="s2">When you read complicated material sometimes a piece of it will stand out. It&#39;s for some reason. It&#39;s like it glitters</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.170" end="00:07:06.869" style="s2">I suppose that might be one way of thinking about it. It&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.480" end="00:07:08.530" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.530" end="00:07:14.640" style="s2">You&#39;re in sync with it, and you can understand what it means. I&#39;ve really experienced that reading the Dao. De Jing which is document</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.640" end="00:07:18.569" style="s2">I would really like to do a lecture on at some point because some of the verses</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.570" end="00:07:20.460" style="s2">I don&#39;t understand but others stand right out</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.460" end="00:07:24.540" style="s2">and I can understand them and I think I understood what this part of the story of Noah meant and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.610" end="00:07:30.060" style="s2">think it means you know we talked a little bit about what nakedness meant in the story of Adam and Eve and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.730" end="00:07:36.480" style="s2">The idea essentially was that to know yourself naked is to become aware of your vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.390" end="00:07:40.949" style="s2">the physical Your physical boundaries in time and space and</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:45.209" style="s2">Your your your physiological</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.060" end="00:07:48.060" style="s2">your fundamental physiological</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.130" end="00:07:52.109" style="s2">Insufficiencies as they mate might be judged by others, so there&#39;s biological</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.660" end="00:07:57.689" style="s2">Insufficiency that sort of built into you because you&#39;re a fragile Mortal vulnerable half insane creature</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.690" end="00:08:00.989" style="s2">And that&#39;s that&#39;s just an existential truth, and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.690" end="00:08:02.800" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.800" end="00:08:04.120" style="s2">merely as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.120" end="00:08:09.570" style="s2">Human being even with all those faults there are faults that you have that are particular to you that might be</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.729" end="00:08:11.250" style="s2">judged harshly by the group</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.250" end="00:08:13.559" style="s2">Well might be will definitely be judged</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.560" end="00:08:19.200" style="s2">Harshly by the group and so to become aware of your nakedness is to become self-conscious and and to and to</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.330" end="00:08:23.129" style="s2">Know your limits and to know your vulnerability, and that&#39;s what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.650" end="00:08:25.000" style="s2">revealed</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.000" end="00:08:29.880" style="s2">To ham when he comes across his father naked and so the question is</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.610" end="00:08:37.680" style="s2">What does it mean to see your father naked and it seems to me and especially in an inappropriate Manner like this it it?</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.500" end="00:08:40.500" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s as if</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.320" end="00:08:43.320" style="s2">ham</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.690" end="00:08:47.429" style="s2">He does the same thing that happens in the mesopotamian creation myth</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.890" end="00:08:51.900" style="s2">When when time out and absolute give rise to the first gods</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.989" end="00:08:55.379" style="s2">there there the father of the eventual</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.050" end="00:08:57.339" style="s2">deity of</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.339" end="00:08:58.959" style="s2">redemption Marduk</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.959" end="00:09:03.448" style="s2">they&#39;re very careless and noisy and they kill apps, ooh their father and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.639" end="00:09:08.068" style="s2">attempt to inhabit his corpse and that makes timeout enraged and so she</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.889" end="00:09:10.869" style="s2">Bursts Forth from The Darkness to</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.869" end="00:09:15.749" style="s2">To do them in it&#39;s like a precursor to the flood story or an analogue to the flood story</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.910" end="00:09:19.799" style="s2">And I see the same thing happening here with ham. Is that he&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.499" end="00:09:22.798" style="s2">insufficiently respectful of his father and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.529" end="00:09:27.568" style="s2">The question is exactly what does the father represent and you can say well there&#39;s there&#39;s?</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.179" end="00:09:33.809" style="s2">There&#39;s the father that you have and that&#39;s a human being that&#39;s the demand like other men a man among men</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.939" end="00:09:37.738" style="s2">but then there&#39;s the farther as such and that&#39;s the spirit of the father and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.290" end="00:09:43.439" style="s2">Insofar as you have a father you have both at the same time you have the personal father</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.079" end="00:09:46.109" style="s2">That&#39;s a man among other men</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.239" end="00:09:53.579" style="s2">just like anyone others father, but insofar as that man is your father that means that he&#39;s something different than just another person and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.160" end="00:09:56.079" style="s2">what he is is the</p>

<p begin="00:09:59.709" end="00:10:02.969" style="s2">to see that to take it to what to</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.459" end="00:10:07.919" style="s2">Disrespect that carelessly, maybe even he&#39;s like no one makes a mistake right? He?</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.819" end="00:10:12.539" style="s2">produces wine and gets himself drunk and you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.540" end="00:10:17.939" style="s2">you know if he sprawled out there for everyone to see it&#39;s hardly hams fault if he stumbles across them but</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.999" end="00:10:25.678" style="s2">The book is laying out a danger and the danger is that well maybe you catch your father at</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.929" end="00:10:28.169" style="s2">his most vulnerable moment and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.199" end="00:10:30.519" style="s2">disrespectful</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.519" end="00:10:36.149" style="s2">Then you transgress against the spirit of the father and if you transgress against the spirit of father and lose</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.639" end="00:10:44.008" style="s2">Spirit of the father and lose respect for the spirit of the father then that is likely to transform you into a slave</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.619" end="00:10:47.849" style="s2">That&#39;s a very interesting idea and I think it&#39;s particularly interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.639" end="00:10:56.308" style="s2">Maybe not particularly interesting, but it&#39;s it&#39;s particularly germane. I think to our current cultural situation because I think that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.459" end="00:11:01.318" style="s2">We&#39;re pushed constantly to see the nakedness of our father so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.679" end="00:11:05.639" style="s2">because of the intense criticism, that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.339" end="00:11:11.049" style="s2">Directed towards our culture and the patriarch of culture, so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.689" end="00:11:16.329" style="s2">we&#39;re constantly exposing its weaknesses and vulnerabilities and let&#39;s say nakedness and</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.259" end="00:11:24.459" style="s2">There&#39;s nothing wrong with criticism, but the thing about Criticism is the purpose of criticism is to separate the wheat from the chaff</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.069" end="00:11:27.069" style="s2">It&#39;s not to burn everything to the ground</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.470" end="00:11:32.529" style="s2">Right, it&#39;s to say well. We&#39;re going to carefully look at this we&#39;re going to carefully differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.529" end="00:11:35.229" style="s2">We&#39;re going to keep what&#39;s good and we&#39;re going to move away from what&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.230" end="00:11:39.550" style="s2">But the point of the Criticism isn&#39;t to identify everything is bad. It&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.129" end="00:11:45.219" style="s2">Separate what&#39;s good from what&#39;s bad so that you can retain. What&#39;s good and move towards it and</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.800" end="00:11:53.680" style="s2">And to be careless at that is deadly because you&#39;re inhabited by the spirit of the father right insofar as you&#39;re a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.079" end="00:11:59.349" style="s2">Construction which of course is something that the that the postmodern neo-Marxists are absolutely?</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.809" end="00:12:06.879" style="s2">emphatic about you&#39;re a cultural construction insofar as you&#39;re a cultural construction, then you&#39;re inhabited by the spirit of the father and to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.059" end="00:12:14.739" style="s2">Disrespectful towards that means to undermine the very structure that makes you not all of what you are certainly</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.050" end="00:12:16.420" style="s2">Certainly not all of what you are</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.420" end="00:12:23.139" style="s2">But a good portion of what you are insofar as you&#39;re a socialized cultural entity and if you pull out</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.929" end="00:12:30.189" style="s2">If you pull the foundation out from underneath that what do you have left you can hardly manage on your own?</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.860" end="00:12:35.289" style="s2">You know it&#39;s just not possible. You&#39;re a cultural creation. And</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.929" end="00:12:38.169" style="s2">so Ham makes this desperate</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.809" end="00:12:41.229" style="s2">error and is Careless about</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.009" end="00:12:49.959" style="s2">Exposing himself to the vulnerability of his father something like that. He doesn&#39;t without sufficient respect. And the judgment is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.959" end="00:12:57.279" style="s2">not only will he be a slave, but so will all of his descendants, and he&#39;s contrasted with the other two sons who I</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.550" end="00:13:04.809" style="s2">Suppose are willing to give their father the benefit of the doubt something like that, and so when they see him in a compromising position</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.139" end="00:13:09.039" style="s2">they handle it with respect and and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.949" end="00:13:11.949" style="s2">don&#39;t capitalize on it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.529" end="00:13:18.279" style="s2">Maybe that makes them strong. That&#39;s what it seems to me, and so I think that&#39;s what that story means</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.220" end="00:13:23.220" style="s2">It has something to do with respect</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.310" end="00:13:30.419" style="s2">you know and the funny thing about having respect for your culture, and I suppose that&#39;s partly why I&#39;m doing the biblical stories is because</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.970" end="00:13:33.329" style="s2">They&#39;re part of a they&#39;re part of my culture</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.240" end="00:13:38.010" style="s2">they&#39;re part of our culture perhaps, but they&#39;re certainly part of my culture and</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.100" end="00:13:41.100" style="s2">It seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.310" end="00:13:46.530" style="s2">it&#39;s worthwhile to treat that with respect to see what you can glean from it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.530" end="00:13:50.639" style="s2">And not kick it when it&#39;s down. Let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.910" end="00:13:53.910" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.620" end="00:14:05.340" style="s2">and so that&#39;s how the story of no ends you know and the thing too is Noah is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.430" end="00:14:11.789" style="s2">Pretty decent incarnation of the Spirit of the father that which I suppose is one of the things that makes hams</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.450" end="00:14:19.739" style="s2">Misstep more egregious is that I mean noah just built an ark and got everybody through the flood man</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.740" end="00:14:27.000" style="s2">You know it&#39;s not so bad, and so maybe the fact that he happened to drink too much wine one day wasn&#39;t enough to justify</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.520" end="00:14:29.200" style="s2">humiliating him and</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.200" end="00:14:33.150" style="s2">You know I don&#39;t think it&#39;s pushing the limits of symbolic interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.850" end="00:14:37.380" style="s2">To note on a daily basis that we&#39;re all contained in an ark</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.170" end="00:14:44.550" style="s2">Right, and that&#39;s the ark that you could think about that as the ark that&#39;s been bequeathed to us by our forefathers. That&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.820" end="00:14:49.410" style="s2">Tremendous infrastructure that we inhabit that we take for granted</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.960" end="00:14:51.640" style="s2">Because it works so well</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.640" end="00:14:57.689" style="s2">that protects us from things that we can&#39;t even imagine and we don&#39;t have to imagine because we&#39;re so well protected and</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.300" end="00:15:02.219" style="s2">So one of the things that&#39;s really struck me hard. I would say about the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.340" end="00:15:08.340" style="s2">Disintegration and corruption of the universities is the absolute ingratitude that goes along with that</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.070" end="00:15:10.570" style="s2">You know what?</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.570" end="00:15:15.809" style="s2">Criticism as I said it&#39;s a fine thing if it&#39;s done in the spirit in a proper spirit</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.810" end="00:15:21.030" style="s2">And that&#39;s the spirit of separating the wheat from the chaff, but it needs to be accompanied by gratitude</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.030" end="00:15:28.439" style="s2">And it does seem to me that anyone who lives in in the west in the western culture at this time</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.170" end="00:15:32.790" style="s2">in history and in this place and who hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.449" end="00:15:36.178" style="s2">simultaneously grateful for that is is</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.970" end="00:15:38.040" style="s2">half-blind</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.040" end="00:15:41.609" style="s2">at least because it&#39;s never been better than this and</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.160" end="00:15:48.299" style="s2">It could be so much worse and it&#39;s highly likely that it will be so much worse because for most of human history</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.359" end="00:15:51.359" style="s2">So much worse is the norm</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.019" end="00:15:55.019" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.389" end="00:16:00.389" style="s2">then there&#39;s this little story that</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.970" end="00:16:05.999" style="s2">Crops up that seems in some ways unrelated to everything that&#39;s gone before it</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.160" end="00:16:13.079" style="s2">But I think it&#39;s also an extremely profound little story it took me a long time to figure it out. It&#39;s the tower of babel</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.699" end="00:16:21.149" style="s2">and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of shinar and dwelt there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.209" end="00:16:25.828" style="s2">Noah&#39;s Descendants and the whole Earth was of one language and of one speech</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.439" end="00:16:31.498" style="s2">And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of shinar and they dwelt there</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.499" end="00:16:33.429" style="s2">And they said to one another</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.429" end="00:16:39.238" style="s2">Go let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime they head for mortar</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.899" end="00:16:47.668" style="s2">So they&#39;re establishing a city and they said go let us build a city and a tower whose top may reach</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.709" end="00:16:53.368" style="s2">Unto heaven and let us make a name lest. We be scattered abroad upon the face of the Earth</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.429" end="00:16:55.929" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.929" end="00:17:00.629" style="s2">the Lord came down to see the city in the tower which the children of men built and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.389" end="00:17:07.739" style="s2">The Lord said behold the people is one and they all have one language and now this they begin to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.959" end="00:17:11.849" style="s2">And now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.970" end="00:17:17.850" style="s2">Go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another&#39;s speech</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.389" end="00:17:25.349" style="s2">So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:32.638" style="s2">therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the Earth and</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.860" end="00:17:34.860" style="s2">From thence did the Lord scattered them abroad</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.529" end="00:17:37.529" style="s2">Upon the face of all the Earth</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.409" end="00:17:43.469" style="s2">It&#39;s a very difficult story to understand and it&#39;s on the face of it. It doesn&#39;t seem to show</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.470" end="00:17:49.680" style="s2">God in a very good light although that happens fairly frequently in the old testament as far as I can tell but</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.940" end="00:17:57.629" style="s2">You know the thing to do if you&#39;re reading in the spirit of the text let&#39;s say is to remember that</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.270" end="00:18:00.570" style="s2">It&#39;s God that you&#39;re talking about and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.080" end="00:18:04.080" style="s2">Even though you might think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.240" end="00:18:06.240" style="s2">He&#39;s appearing in a bad light</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.280" end="00:18:12.149" style="s2">Your duty as a reader. I suppose is to assume that you&#39;re wrong and that what he did was right</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.150" end="00:18:16.230" style="s2">And then you&#39;re supposed to figure out well, how could it possibly be right because the axiomatic</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.750" end="00:18:21.570" style="s2">Presupposition is that it&#39;s God and whatever he does is right, and you might say well, you can disagree with that</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.570" end="00:18:25.679" style="s2">And it&#39;s it&#39;s also the case that some of the people that God talks to in the old testament</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.930" end="00:18:33.029" style="s2">Actually disagree with him and convinced him to alter his actions, but the point still remains that it&#39;s God and if he&#39;s doing it then</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.820" end="00:18:35.820" style="s2">By definition. There&#39;s a good reason</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.510" end="00:18:44.310" style="s2">There&#39;s an idea much later that John Milton develops in in</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.180" end="00:18:46.560" style="s2">Paradise lost</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.560" end="00:18:49.080" style="s2">Which is an amazing poem</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.920" end="00:18:57.440" style="s2">And It&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s  a profound enough poem so that it&#39;s almost been incorporated into the biblical structure  I would say so</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.120" end="00:19:00.150" style="s2">the Corpus of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.690" end="00:19:03.690" style="s2">Post Milton</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.540" end="00:19:06.100" style="s2">was Saturated by</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.100" end="00:19:10.949" style="s2">the Miltonic stories of Satan&#39;s Rebellion none of us in the in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.080" end="00:19:16.980" style="s2">Biblical texts or it&#39;s only hinted at in very brief passages and Milton wrote his poem</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.400" end="00:19:24.749" style="s2">To justify the word the ways of God to man, which is quite an ambition really!</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.570" end="00:19:27.600" style="s2">It&#39;s an amazing profound ambition</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.600" end="00:19:30.600" style="s2">To try to produce something</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.780" end="00:19:32.640" style="s2">to produce a literary work</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.640" end="00:19:38.780" style="s2">That justifies being to human beings, because that&#39;s what Milton was trying to do, so one of my readers here</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.790" end="00:19:41.660" style="s2">Sent me a link the other day for viewers</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.250" end="00:19:46.770" style="s2">To a work of philosophy by an australian Philosopher whose name I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.100" end="00:19:50.100" style="s2">Who basically wrote a book saying that:</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.070" end="00:19:54.749" style="s2">being as such, human experience, is so corrupt and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.450" end="00:19:59.340" style="s2">Permeated by suffering that it would be better if it had never existed at all</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.150" end="00:20:02.280" style="s2">sort of the ultimate expression of Nihilism and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.950" end="00:20:10.229" style="s2">Goethe in in Faust his Mephistopheles who&#39;s a Satanic character obviously has that as a credo</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.510" end="00:20:13.229" style="s2">That&#39;s that Satan&#39;s fundamental motivation is</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.890" end="00:20:21.719" style="s2">His objection to creation itself is that creation is so flawed and so rife with suffering that it would be better if it had never</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.730" end="00:20:24.839" style="s2">existed at all and so that&#39;s his motivation for attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.810" end="00:20:28.649" style="s2">continue to Destroy it but in</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.320" end="00:20:31.320" style="s2">Milton&#39;s Paradise lost</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.600" end="00:20:36.930" style="s2">Satan is an intellectual figure, and you see that motif emerged very frequently by the way in</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.690" end="00:20:45.389" style="s2">popular culture, so for example in the lion king the figure of Skaar who&#39;s a Satanic figure is also hyper intellectual and</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.000" end="00:20:52.260" style="s2">That&#39;s very common that you know it&#39;s the evil scientist motif or the or the evil advisor to the king the same motif it</p>

<p begin="00:20:57.370" end="00:21:05.280" style="s2">Rationality like Satan is the highest angel in God&#39;s heavenly Kingdom. It&#39;s a psychological idea. You know that the most powerful</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.130" end="00:21:12.119" style="s2">Sub element of the human psyche is the intellect and and it&#39;s the thing that shines out above all</p>

<p begin="00:21:28.810" end="00:21:30.810" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn when he was writing the Gulag Archipelago</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.450" end="00:21:34.229" style="s2">had a warning about that with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.260" end="00:21:42.900" style="s2">totalitarian Ideology, and he said that the price of selling your god-given soul to the entrapments of</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.620" end="00:21:48.080" style="s2">human dogma was slavery and death essentially and</p>

<p begin="00:21:51.840" end="00:21:54.720" style="s2">in Milton&#39;s Paradise Lost Satan</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.580" end="00:21:56.890" style="s2">decides that</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.890" end="00:22:01.320" style="s2">He can do without the transcendent he can do without God and that&#39;s why he foments rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.100" end="00:22:09.240" style="s2">It&#39;s something like that and the consequence of that the immediate consequence from Milton&#39;s perspective was that as soon as Satan</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.850" end="00:22:13.080" style="s2">Decided that what he knew was sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.670" end="00:22:20.600" style="s2">That he could do without the transcendent which he might think about as the domain outside of what you know something like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.090" end="00:22:23.090" style="s2">immediately he was in hell and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.570" end="00:22:29.419" style="s2">When I read Paradise lost I was studying totalitarianism, and I thought you know the poet</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.450" end="00:22:32.720" style="s2">the true Poet like a prophet</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.390" end="00:22:35.390" style="s2">if someone who has</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.580" end="00:22:37.500" style="s2">intimations of the future</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.500" end="00:22:43.460" style="s2">and maybe that&#39;s because the poetic mind the philosophical or prophetic mind is a pattern detector and</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.710" end="00:22:48.769" style="s2">And there are people who can detect the underlying it&#39;s like the malady of a nation</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.530" end="00:22:54.889" style="s2">Melody is in song the song of a nation and can see how it&#39;s going to develop across the centuries you see this you see</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.890" end="00:23:01.249" style="s2">That Nietzsche because Nietzsche for example in the mid you know in 1860 or so. I mean he prophesied</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.250" end="00:23:07.400" style="s2">What was going to happen in the 20th century said that he said specifically that the spectre of Communism would kill</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.310" end="00:23:14.389" style="s2">Millions of people in the 20th century, it&#39;s amazing prophecy. He said that in the notes that became will to power and</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.060" end="00:23:21.919" style="s2">Dostoyevsky was of the same sort of mind someone who was in touch enough with the fundamental patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.010" end="00:23:27.410" style="s2">Human movement that they could extrapolate out into the future and see what was coming</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.570" end="00:23:32.749" style="s2">and I mean some people are very good at detecting patterns you know and and uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.020" end="00:23:36.020" style="s2">Milton, I think was of that, sort and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.630" end="00:23:37.710" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.710" end="00:23:44.869" style="s2">think he had intimations of what was coming as human rationality became more and more powerful and technology became more and more powerful and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.510" end="00:23:48.830" style="s2">Information was that we would produce systems that dispensed with God</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.710" end="00:23:55.999" style="s2">That were completely rational and completely total that would immediately turn everything they touched into something</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.990" end="00:23:59.940" style="s2">indistinguishable from Hell, and</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.940" end="00:24:01.940" style="s2">then Milton&#39;s warning was</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.100" end="00:24:04.100" style="s2">embodied in the poem is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.800" end="00:24:06.800" style="s2">the rational mind that</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.860" end="00:24:12.800" style="s2">Generates a production and then worships it as if it&#39;s absolute immediately occupies hell</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.420" end="00:24:17.420" style="s2">So what does that have to do with the tower of babel?</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.430" end="00:24:23.239" style="s2">we know it back into 2008 when the</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.450" end="00:24:26.450" style="s2">When we had that economic collapse?</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.090" end="00:24:29.659" style="s2">the strange idea emerged politically and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.179" end="00:24:32.569" style="s2">was the idea of too big to fail and</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.149" end="00:24:35.689" style="s2">I thought about that idea for a long time because I thought</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.659" end="00:24:42.139" style="s2">There&#39;s something deeply wrong with that is one of the things that made Marx wrong</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.649" end="00:24:50.479" style="s2">was Marx believed that capital would flow into the hands of fewer and fewer people and that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.659" end="00:24:56.179" style="s2">dissociation between the rich and the poor would become more extreme as capitalism developed and</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.919" end="00:25:05.239" style="s2">Like so many things that Marx said that&#39;s it&#39;s kind of true. It&#39;s kind of true in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.720" end="00:25:11.180" style="s2">The distribution of wealth and in fact a distribution of anything, that&#39;s produced</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.640" end="00:25:12.920" style="s2">Follows a Pareto</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.929" end="00:25:18.260" style="s2">Pattern and the Pareto Pattern basically is that a small proportion of people end up with the bulk of the goods</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.260" end="00:25:23.179" style="s2">And it isn&#39;t just money it&#39;s it&#39;s anything that people produce creatively</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.000" end="00:25:26.270" style="s2">ends up in that distribution and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.789" end="00:25:30.169" style="s2">That&#39;s actually the economists call that the Matthieu principle</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.169" end="00:25:32.159" style="s2">And they take that from a statement in the new testament</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.159" end="00:25:38.148" style="s2">and the statement is to those who have everything more will be given and from those who have nothing everything will be taken and</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.490" end="00:25:43.729" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s a map of the manner in which the world manifests itself where</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.010" end="00:25:49.279" style="s2">Human creative production is involved and the map seems to indicate that as you start to produce and you&#39;re successful</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.529" end="00:25:53.299" style="s2">The probability that you will continue to be successful or accelerate</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.520" end="00:25:58.429" style="s2">Increases as you&#39;re successful and as you fail the probability that you will fail starts to accelerate</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.500" end="00:26:03.169" style="s2">So if your progress to life looks like this or like this</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.960" end="00:26:10.189" style="s2">something like that and the reason that Marx was right was because he noted that as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.649" end="00:26:17.539" style="s2">Feature of the capitalist system the reason that he was wrong. Is that it&#39;s not a feature that&#39;s specific to a capitalist system</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.760" end="00:26:22.489" style="s2">it&#39;s a feature that&#39;s general to all systems of creative production that are known and</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.950" end="00:26:30.140" style="s2">so it&#39;s like a natural law and it&#39;s enough of a natural law by the way that the distribution of wealth can be modeled by</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.480" end="00:26:37.189" style="s2">Physical models using the same equations that govern the distribution of gas molecules in a vacuum, so it&#39;s a really profound</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.500" end="00:26:39.500" style="s2">It&#39;s a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.510" end="00:26:45.170" style="s2">profound observation about the world way the world lays itself out, and it&#39;s problematic because if</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.250" end="00:26:49.429" style="s2">resources accrue</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.180" end="00:26:53.180" style="s2">unfairly to a small minority of people</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.280" end="00:27:00.379" style="s2">and there&#39;s a natural law like element to that that has to be dealt with from a social perspective because if the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.140" end="00:27:07.309" style="s2">Inequality becomes too extreme then the whole system will destabilize and so you can have an intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.890" end="00:27:11.239" style="s2">discussion about how to mitigate the effects of</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:13.760" style="s2">the transfer of creative</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.460" end="00:27:17.059" style="s2">production into the hands of a small number of people</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.760" end="00:27:23.510" style="s2">Now the other reason however having said that the other reason that Marx was wrong. There&#39;s a number of them</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.150" end="00:27:26.299" style="s2">One is that even though</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.400" end="00:27:31.400" style="s2">creative products end</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.830" end="00:27:37.130" style="s2">Up in the hands of a small number of people it&#39;s not the same people consistently across time</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.130" end="00:27:40.459" style="s2">It&#39;s the same proportion of people, and that&#39;s not the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.190" end="00:27:45.500" style="s2">you know like imagine that there&#39;s water going down a drain and you say well look at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.020" end="00:27:51.289" style="s2">Spiral it&#39;s permanent, you think well the spiral is permanent, but the water Molecules aren&#39;t they&#39;re moving through it</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.320" end="00:27:54.380" style="s2">And it&#39;s the same in some sense with the pareto distribution</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.380" end="00:27:59.329" style="s2">is that there&#39;s a 1% and there&#39;s always a 1%, but it&#39;s not the same people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.020" end="00:28:03.199" style="s2">the stability of it differs from</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.410" end="00:28:05.070" style="s2">culture to culture</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.070" end="00:28:11.570" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot of movement in the upper 1% a tremendous amount of movement and one of the reasons for that movement is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.330" end="00:28:16.760" style="s2">things get large and then they get too large and then they collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.820" end="00:28:19.410" style="s2">so in</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.410" end="00:28:22.160" style="s2">2008 when the politicians said too big to fail</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.040" end="00:28:28.040" style="s2">They got something truly backwards as far as I can tell and that was</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.870" end="00:28:35.780" style="s2">With a reverse the statement was reversed it should have been so big it had to fail</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.450" end="00:28:41.120" style="s2">And that&#39;s what I think the story of the tower of babel is about it&#39;s it&#39;s a warning</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.150" end="00:28:44.010" style="s2">against the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.010" end="00:28:46.010" style="s2">expansion of the system</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.220" end="00:28:50.720" style="s2">Until it encompasses everything it&#39;s a warning against</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.840" end="00:28:53.840" style="s2">Totalitarian presumption so what happens for example</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.740" end="00:28:59.059" style="s2">When people set out to build the tower of babel as they want to build a structure that reaches to heaven</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.429" end="00:29:01.230" style="s2">right so the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.230" end="00:29:06.289" style="s2">It can it can it can replace it can replace the role of God</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.289" end="00:29:09.829" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that it can erase the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.020" end="00:29:14.719" style="s2">Earth and Heaven, and so there&#39;s a utopian kind of vision there as well as we can build a structure</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:18.319" style="s2">That&#39;s so large and encompassing that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.840" end="00:29:20.840" style="s2">That it can replace heaven itself</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.890" end="00:29:24.480" style="s2">That&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.480" end="00:29:31.579" style="s2">The fact that that doesn&#39;t work and that God objects to it is also extraordinarily interesting and it&#39;s an indication to me of the unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.860" end="00:29:38.659" style="s2">Profundity of these stories. It&#39;s like I think one thing we should have learned from the 20th century, but of course didn&#39;t was that</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.210" end="00:29:46.429" style="s2">There&#39;s something extraordinary dangerous about totalitarian utopian visions. That&#39;s something dostoevsky wrote about by the way in his great book</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.010" end="00:29:53.719" style="s2">Notes from Underground because Dostoevsky figured out by the early 1900&#39;s that there was something very very</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.059" end="00:30:01.459" style="s2">Pathological about a utopian vision of perfection that it was profoundly anti-human and and notes in notes from underground</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.460" end="00:30:07.909" style="s2">He demolishes the notion of utopia one of the things he says that I loved it&#39;s so Brilliant said imagine that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.309" end="00:30:11.298" style="s2">brought the Socialist utopia into being and</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.210" end="00:30:15.710" style="s2">dostoyevsky says and that human beings had nothing to do except</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.220" end="00:30:19.220" style="s2">eat</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.380" end="00:30:22.640" style="s2">Drink and busy themselves with the continuation of the species</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.000" end="00:30:28.459" style="s2">He said that the first thing that would happen under circumstances like that</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.860" end="00:30:30.090" style="s2">Would be that</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.090" end="00:30:35.510" style="s2">Human beings would go mad and break the system smash it just so that something unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.640" end="00:30:38.959" style="s2">And crazy could happen because human beings don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.809" end="00:30:45.499" style="s2">utopian comfort and certainty they want adventure and Chaos and uncertainty and</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.899" end="00:30:50.389" style="s2">so that the very notion of a utopia was anti-human because we&#39;re not built for</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.570" end="00:30:53.309" style="s2">static utopia</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.309" end="00:30:55.309" style="s2">we&#39;re built for a</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.679" end="00:30:57.949" style="s2">dynamic situation where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.340" end="00:31:04.279" style="s2">Demands placed on us and where there&#39;s the optimal amount of uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.110" end="00:31:10.979" style="s2">Well, we know what happened in the 20th century as a consequence of the widespread</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.830" end="00:31:13.830" style="s2">promulgation of utopian schemes and</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.440" end="00:31:16.440" style="s2">what happened was</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.570" end="00:31:23.610" style="s2">mayhem on a scale that had never been matched in the entire history of humanity, and that&#39;s really saying something because</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.320" end="00:31:28.890" style="s2">There was plenty of Mayhem before the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.890" end="00:31:34.619" style="s2">I guess there wasn&#39;t as much industrial clout behind it and so so early you</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.200" end="00:31:36.640" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.640" end="00:31:40.289" style="s2">so early in the biblical narrative you have a warning against Hubris and</p>

<p begin="00:32:08.980" end="00:32:15.779" style="s2">that counter movement has been developing, but it seems to me that it&#39;s also a tower of Babel phenomena is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.980" end="00:32:20.789" style="s2">And maybe this is most evident in the European economic community</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.210" end="00:32:26.010" style="s2">to bring all of that multiplicity under the</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.840" end="00:32:31.769" style="s2">What would you call it under the umbrella of a single unity is?</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.950" end="00:32:39.539" style="s2">To simultaneously erect a system where the top is so far from the bottom that the bottom has no connection to the top</p>

<p begin="00:32:46.559" end="00:32:51.449" style="s2">So that you have a place in them, and it seems to me perhaps. That&#39;s what&#39;s happened in</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.179" end="00:32:57.749" style="s2">in places like the EEC is that the distance between the typical citizen and the</p>

<p begin="00:33:04.120" end="00:33:06.120" style="s2">it&#39;s an element of</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.190" end="00:33:12.630" style="s2">destabilization in and of itself and so people revert back to say nationalistic identities because</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.570" end="00:33:15.570" style="s2">It&#39;s something that they can</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.690" end="00:33:18.580" style="s2">relate to</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.580" end="00:33:22.629" style="s2">If there&#39;s a there&#39;s a history there and a shared identity a genuine identity</p>

<p begin="00:33:38.480" end="00:33:41.709" style="s2">in in the egyptian creation myth</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.830" end="00:33:44.919" style="s2">the version I&#39;m most familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.010" end="00:33:47.900" style="s2">in the previous</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.900" end="00:33:50.980" style="s2">Creation myth the older one the Mesopotamian creation myth</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.980" end="00:33:53.960" style="s2">Mostly what you see</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.960" end="00:33:59.230" style="s2">Menacing humanity is Tiamat she&#39;s the dragon of Chaos and so that&#39;s nature. It&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.750" end="00:34:01.750" style="s2">It&#39;s really mother nature</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.850" end="00:34:03.850" style="s2">red in tooth and claw</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.520" end="00:34:06.520" style="s2">but by the time the egyptians come along</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.260" end="00:34:12.489" style="s2">It isn&#39;t only nature that threatens humanity</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.490" end="00:34:15.400" style="s2">it&#39;s the social structure itself and so the</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.890" end="00:34:21.219" style="s2">egyptians had two deities that represented the social structure and one was Osiris who was</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.500" end="00:34:27.429" style="s2">Like the spirit of the father. He was a great hero who established egypt, but became old and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.220" end="00:34:30.429" style="s2">Willfully blind and and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.190" end="00:34:32.630" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.630" end="00:34:35.769" style="s2">senile and he had an evil brother named Seth and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.440" end="00:34:40.000" style="s2">Seth was always conspiring to overthrow him and</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.330" end="00:34:42.530" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.530" end="00:34:49.749" style="s2">Osiris ignored him long enough Seth did overthrow chopped him into pieces and distributed all around the kingdom and</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.720" end="00:34:52.990" style="s2">His son Horus had to come back and fight</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.929" end="00:34:56.918" style="s2">Osiris his son Horus had to come back and defeat</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.919" end="00:34:59.859" style="s2">Seth to take the Kingdom back. That&#39;s how that story ends</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.860" end="00:35:05.110" style="s2">But the egyptians seem to have realized maybe because they had become bureaucratized to quite a substantial degree</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.600" end="00:35:08.380" style="s2">That it wasn&#39;t only nature that threatened</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.020" end="00:35:15.070" style="s2">Humankind it was also the proclivity of human organizations to become too large too unwieldy</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.710" end="00:35:20.830" style="s2">too deceitful and to willfully blind and therefore liable to collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.710" end="00:35:24.580" style="s2">Again, I see echoes of that in the story of the tower of babel</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.760" end="00:35:26.960" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.960" end="00:35:28.960" style="s2">It&#39;s a calling for</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.880" end="00:35:32.390" style="s2">A</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.390" end="00:35:34.390" style="s2">kind of humility of social engineering</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.319" end="00:35:39.219" style="s2">one of the other things I&#39;ve learned as a social scientist and</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.569" end="00:35:46.239" style="s2">I&#39;ve been warned about this by I would say great social scientists that</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.049" end="00:35:50.049" style="s2">You want to be very careful about</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.420" end="00:35:52.190" style="s2">doing large-scale</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.190" end="00:35:57.220" style="s2">experimentation with large scale systems because the probability that if you implement a</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.740" end="00:36:02.919" style="s2">Scheme in a large-scale social system that that scheme will have the result you intended is</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.799" end="00:36:08.439" style="s2">Negligible what will happen will be something that you don&#39;t intend and even worse</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.900" end="00:36:12.339" style="s2">something that works at counter purposes to your original intent and</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.160" end="00:36:15.970" style="s2">so and that makes sense because</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.579" end="00:36:18.969" style="s2">If you have a very very complex system</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.970" end="00:36:26.049" style="s2">And you perturb it the probability that you can predict the consequence of the perturbation is extraordinary low obviously</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.920" end="00:36:34.839" style="s2">If the system works though you think you understand it because it works and so you think it&#39;s simpler than it actually is and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.839" end="00:36:37.449" style="s2">Then you think that your model of it is correct</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.450" end="00:36:41.769" style="s2">and then you think that your manipulation of the model which produces</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.200" end="00:36:48.460" style="s2">The outcome you model will be the outcome that&#39;s actually produced in the world that doesn&#39;t work at all</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.150" end="00:36:52.150" style="s2">I Thought about that an awful lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.269" end="00:36:57.189" style="s2">thinking about how to remediate social systems because obviously they need</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.339" end="00:37:02.589" style="s2">Careful attention and adjustment, and it struck me that the proper</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.650" end="00:37:12.309" style="s2">strategy for implementing social change is to stay within your domain of competence and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.670" end="00:37:17.559" style="s2">Requires humility which is a virtue that is never</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.809" end="00:37:25.749" style="s2">Promoted in Modern culture. I would say it&#39;s it&#39;s a virtue that you can hardly even talk about</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.569" end="00:37:28.400" style="s2">but humility means</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.400" end="00:37:34.119" style="s2">You&#39;re probably not as smart as you think you are and you should be careful and so then the question might be well</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.369" end="00:37:39.788" style="s2">Ok you should be careful, but perhaps you still want to do good you want to make some positive changes?</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.789" end="00:37:45.279" style="s2">how can you be careful and do good and then I would say well you try not to step out the boundaries of your</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.440" end="00:37:47.740" style="s2">competence and you start small and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.170" end="00:37:53.230" style="s2">start with things that you actually could adjust that you actually do understand that you actually could fix I</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.660" end="00:37:56.589" style="s2">Mentioned to you at one point that one of the things carl jung said was that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.829" end="00:38:03.219" style="s2">Modern men don&#39;t see God because they don&#39;t look low enough. It&#39;s a very interesting Phrase and</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.980" end="00:38:05.980" style="s2">one of the things that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.410" end="00:38:08.359" style="s2">Promoting I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.359" end="00:38:10.359" style="s2">Online is the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.730" end="00:38:13.389" style="s2">You should restrict your attempts to fix things</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.050" end="00:38:17.050" style="s2">to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.440" end="00:38:20.390" style="s2">at hand</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.390" end="00:38:24.609" style="s2">So there&#39;s probably things about you that you could fix right things that you know that aren&#39;t right?</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.250" end="00:38:29.020" style="s2">Not anyone else&#39;s opinion your own opinion that aren&#39;t right you can fix them</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.020" end="00:38:32.679" style="s2">Maybe there&#39;s some things that you could adjust in your family that gets hard you</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.810" end="00:38:38.109" style="s2">Have to have your act together a lot before you can start to adjust your family because things can kick back on you really hard</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.109" end="00:38:42.609" style="s2">And you think well it&#39;s hard to put yourself together. It&#39;s really hard to put your family together</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.740" end="00:38:44.800" style="s2">Why the hell do you think you can put the world together?</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.680" end="00:38:51.909" style="s2">right because obviously the world is more complicated than you and your family and so if you if you&#39;re stymied in your attempts</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.910" end="00:38:54.879" style="s2">Even to set your own house in order which of course you are</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.099" end="00:38:59.169" style="s2">Then you would think that what that would do would be to make you very very leery about</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.990" end="00:39:03.250" style="s2">announcing your broad-scale plans for social revolution</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.450" end="00:39:12.700" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s a peculiar thing because that isn&#39;t how it works because people are much more likely to announce their plans for Broad-scale social revolution</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.700" end="00:39:16.000" style="s2">Than they are to try to set themselves straight or to set their family straight</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.000" end="00:39:21.939" style="s2">And I think the reason for that is that as soon as they try to set themselves straight or their families the system immediately</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.310" end="00:39:28.299" style="s2">kicks back at them right instantly whereas if they announced their plans for large-scale social revolution</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.150" end="00:39:31.150" style="s2">the lag between the</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.430" end="00:39:36.129" style="s2">announcement and the kickback is so long that. They don&#39;t recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.130" end="00:39:43.720" style="s2">there&#39;s any error there and so you know you can get away with being wrong if if nothing falls on you for a while, and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.510" end="00:39:46.510" style="s2">so and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.849" end="00:39:54.009" style="s2">An incitement to hubris because you can now see your your plans for large-scale social revolution and stand back</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.010" end="00:39:56.290" style="s2">And you don&#39;t get hit by lightning and you think well</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.290" end="00:40:02.529" style="s2">I might be right even though you&#39;re not you&#39;re seriously not right. I might be right and then you think well</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.960" end="00:40:10.389" style="s2">How wonderful is that especially if you could do it without any real effort, and I really do think fundamentally I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.390" end="00:40:17.170" style="s2">That&#39;s what the universities teach students now. That&#39;s what they teach them to do. I really believe that and I think it&#39;s absolutely appalling</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.830" end="00:40:21.009" style="s2">And I think it&#39;s horribly dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.610" end="00:40:26.110" style="s2">Because it&#39;s not that easy to fix things especially if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.830" end="00:40:29.830" style="s2">especially if you&#39;re not committed to it and</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.080" end="00:40:34.239" style="s2">I think you know if you&#39;re committed because what you try to do is you try to straighten out your own life first</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.880" end="00:40:39.999" style="s2">and that&#39;s enough like there&#39;s a I think it&#39;s a statement in the new testament that it&#39;s I think it&#39;s in the new testament that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.000" end="00:40:42.610" style="s2">More difficult to rule yourself than to rule the city</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.400" end="00:40:47.710" style="s2">And that&#39;s not a metaphor. It&#39;s like all of you. Who&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.680" end="00:40:50.680" style="s2">announcements to yourself about</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.840" end="00:40:57.009" style="s2">Changing your diet and going to the gym every January know perfectly well how difficult it is to regulate your own</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.470" end="00:41:01.509" style="s2">impulses and to bring yourself under the control of some</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.170" end="00:41:05.170" style="s2">What would you say?</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.450" end="00:41:07.450" style="s2">well-structured and</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.150" end="00:41:09.650" style="s2">ethical</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.650" end="00:41:11.390" style="s2">attentive</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.390" end="00:41:13.370" style="s2">structure of values</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.370" end="00:41:20.559" style="s2">it&#39;s extraordinarily difficult and so people don&#39;t do it and instead they wander off, and I think they create towers of Babel and</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.500" end="00:41:25.450" style="s2">the story indicates well those things collapse under their own weight and</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.090" end="00:41:28.090" style="s2">everyone goes their own Direction I</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.780" end="00:41:31.780" style="s2">Think I see that happening</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.240" end="00:41:34.240" style="s2">with the LGBT community I</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.850" end="00:41:42.460" style="s2">think because one of the things I&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s very interesting because the community is in some sense, it&#39;s not a community but</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.210" end="00:41:49.419" style="s2">That&#39;s a technical error, but it&#39;s it&#39;s composed of outsiders. Let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.780" end="00:41:55.390" style="s2">what you notice across the decades is that the acronym list keeps growing and</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.180" end="00:42:02.079" style="s2">I think that&#39;s because there&#39;s an infinite number of ways to be an outsider and so once you open the door</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.420" end="00:42:06.129" style="s2">to the construction of a group that&#39;s characterized by</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.970" end="00:42:12.819" style="s2">Failing to fit into the group then you immediately create a category that&#39;s infinitely</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.160" end="00:42:21.160" style="s2">expandable and so I don&#39;t know how long the acronym list is now it depends on which acronym list you consult but I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.620" end="00:42:26.649" style="s2">lists of 10 or more acronyms and one of the things that&#39;s happening is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.410" end="00:42:30.129" style="s2">The Community is starting to fragment in</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.770" end="00:42:34.360" style="s2">Its in its interior because there is no unity</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.910" end="00:42:38.830" style="s2">once you put a sufficient plurality under the</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.410" end="00:42:41.090" style="s2">sheltering</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.090" end="00:42:43.269" style="s2">structure of a single umbrella say</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.930" end="00:42:48.940" style="s2">the disunity starts to appear within and I think that&#39;s also uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.480" end="00:42:54.219" style="s2">It&#39;s a manifestation of the same issue that this particular story is dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.360" end="00:43:05.620" style="s2">So that ends. I would say the most archaic stories in the in the bible</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.370" end="00:43:10.719" style="s2">There&#39;s something about the flood story and and also the tower of babel</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.720" end="00:43:14.590" style="s2">I think they outline the two fundamental dangers that beset Mankind one is</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.470" end="00:43:17.470" style="s2">the probability that</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.530" end="00:43:22.090" style="s2">Blindness and sin will produce a natural catastrophe or entice one</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.910" end="00:43:30.730" style="s2">That&#39;s something modern people are very aware of in principle right because we&#39;re all hyper concerned about environmental degradation and catastrophe and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.460" end="00:43:33.460" style="s2">That&#39;s the continual</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.280" end="00:43:39.159" style="s2">Reactivation of an archetypal idea in our in our unconscious minds that there&#39;s something about the way</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.160" end="00:43:42.580" style="s2">we&#39;re living that&#39;s unsustainable and that will create a</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.310" end="00:43:47.799" style="s2">catastrophe it&#39;s so interesting because people believe that firmly and deeply and</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.920" end="00:43:53.530" style="s2">But they don&#39;t see the relationship between that and the archetypal stories because it&#39;s the same story</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.910" end="00:44:02.320" style="s2">Overconsumption greed all of that is producing an unstable state and nature will rebel and take us down</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.930" end="00:44:06.370" style="s2">You hear that every day in every newspaper and every TV station?</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.710" end="00:44:14.530" style="s2">It&#39;s broadcast to you constantly so that idea is presented in in Genesis in the story of Noah and then the other</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.710" end="00:44:19.870" style="s2">Warning that exists in the stories one is Beware of Natural Catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.870" end="00:44:24.399" style="s2">That&#39;s produced as a consequence of blindness and greed will say the other is</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.119" end="00:44:27.119" style="s2">Beware of</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.099" end="00:44:30.099" style="s2">social structures that overreach</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.710" end="00:44:36.339" style="s2">Because they&#39;ll also produce fragmentation and disintegration, and so it&#39;s quite remarkable. I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.579" end="00:44:40.778" style="s2">With at the close of the story of the tower of babel?</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.539" end="00:44:43.539" style="s2">we&#39;ve got both of</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.759" end="00:44:46.629" style="s2">the permanent existential dangers that</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.720" end="00:44:49.720" style="s2">present themselves to humanity</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.059" end="00:44:52.059" style="s2">already identified</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.680" end="00:45:01.029" style="s2">At the end of the story of Adam and eve. There&#39;s like a fall into history</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.700" end="00:45:06.339" style="s2">Right so in one way history begins with the fall, but there&#39;s like a second fall</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.339" end="00:45:09.008" style="s2">I think with the flood and the tower of Babel and</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.529" end="00:45:15.639" style="s2">history and even more real sense begins now it begins with this story of Abraham and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.220" end="00:45:17.839" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.839" end="00:45:23.078" style="s2">We&#39;re no longer precisely in the realm of the purely mythical. That would be another way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.150" end="00:45:28.389" style="s2">We have identifiable person who&#39;s part of an identifiable tribe is doing identifiable things</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.390" end="00:45:33.099" style="s2">We&#39;re in the realm of history and so history begins twice in the old testament I</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.009" end="00:45:36.459" style="s2">suppose it begins again after moses as well, but</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.940" end="00:45:44.349" style="s2">We&#39;ve moved out of the domain of the purely mythical into the realm of history with with the emergence of the stories about abraham</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.619" end="00:45:47.200" style="s2">This is from aldous huxley</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.200" end="00:45:49.629" style="s2">So the first thing that that I want to talk about in</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.789" end="00:45:54.099" style="s2">relationship to the abrahamic stories is this idea of the experience of God because</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.829" end="00:45:59.469" style="s2">Abraham although quite identifiable as an actual individual is</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.589" end="00:46:07.449" style="s2">Also, characterized by this peculiarity and the peculiarity is that God manifests himself to Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.660" end="00:46:11.259" style="s2">Both as a voice and but also as a presence</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.839" end="00:46:18.818" style="s2">The stories never describe exactly how god manifests himself except now and then he comes in the form of an angel</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.039" end="00:46:20.749" style="s2">That&#39;s fairly concrete</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.749" end="00:46:25.209" style="s2">But it&#39;s a funny thing that the author of or authors of the abrahamic story</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.999" end="00:46:27.499" style="s2">seems to take</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.640" end="00:46:30.400" style="s2">The idea that God would make an appearance</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.760" end="00:46:34.520" style="s2">more or less for granted and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.180" end="00:46:36.840" style="s2">It&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.849" end="00:46:42.129" style="s2">I think the part of the reason that I&#39;ve struggled so much with the abrahamic stories is because it&#39;s so hard to get a handle</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.130" end="00:46:44.200" style="s2">on that and to understand what that might mean and</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.599" end="00:46:48.099" style="s2">So I&#39;m going to hit it from a bunch of different perspectives and let&#39;s see if we can</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.739" end="00:46:50.739" style="s2">Come up with some</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.650" end="00:46:57.430" style="s2">Understanding of it the first thing I&#39;ll do is tell you a story about a female</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.700" end="00:47:02.739" style="s2">Neurologist whose name escapes me at the moment. She wrote a book called my stroke of insight</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.950" end="00:47:06.039" style="s2">Jill Bolte I think is her name and</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.130" end="00:47:09.130" style="s2">She was a harvard-trained</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.890" end="00:47:11.890" style="s2">She was she had she had</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.559" end="00:47:17.199" style="s2">medical training from Harvard in Neuropsychological function and knew a lot about hemispheric specialization</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.809" end="00:47:21.819" style="s2">we talked a little bit about hemispheric specialization before one of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.609" end="00:47:26.588" style="s2">Ways of conceptualizing the difference between the two hemispheres is that the left hemisphere?</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.839" end="00:47:33.278" style="s2">Operates in known territory and the right hemisphere operates in unknown territory. That&#39;s one way of thinking about or the left hemisphere operates</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.799" end="00:47:40.119" style="s2">in the orderly domain and the right hemisphere operates in the chaotic domain or the left hemisphere operates in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.430" end="00:47:45.609" style="s2">Domain of detail and the right hemisphere operates in the domain of the large picture</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.950" end="00:47:50.289" style="s2">It&#39;s something like that now people differ in their neurological wiring, so those are</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.140" end="00:47:53.259" style="s2">Over generalizations, but that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.259" end="00:47:55.869" style="s2">we live with that for the time being it&#39;s certainly not an</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.940" end="00:48:02.499" style="s2">overgeneralization to point out that you do in fact have two hemispheres and that their structures differ and if the connections between them are cut</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.499" end="00:48:08.859" style="s2">Which could happen for example if you had surgery for intractable epilepsy that each hemisphere would be capable of housing its own consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.650" end="00:48:15.129" style="s2">That&#39;s been well documented by a neural neural neurologist in Gazzaniga</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.380" end="00:48:20.410" style="s2">Who did and Sperry who did split brain experiments must be 30 years ago now?</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.229" end="00:48:22.460" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.460" end="00:48:26.259" style="s2">And we know that the right in the left hemisphere are specialized for different</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.390" end="00:48:32.140" style="s2">Functions the right hemisphere for example seems to be more involved in the generation of negative emotion and the left hemisphere more</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.719" end="00:48:38.109" style="s2">Involved in the generation of positive emotion an approach so the right hemisphere stops you and the left hemisphere moves you forward</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.779" end="00:48:40.130" style="s2">anyways</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.130" end="00:48:41.539" style="s2">Jill</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.540" end="00:48:43.880" style="s2">Bolte I hope I&#39;ve got that right</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.600" end="00:48:46.340" style="s2">had a stroke</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.340" end="00:48:47.310" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.310" end="00:48:53.239" style="s2">Maintained consciousness during the stroke and analyzed it while it was happening and she was able</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.880" end="00:48:55.880" style="s2">while it was happening to</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.340" end="00:48:59.690" style="s2">hypothesize about what part of her brain was being destroyed and</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.210" end="00:49:05.779" style="s2">what so she had a congenital blood vessel malformation and had an aneurysm and</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.330" end="00:49:08.330" style="s2">It just about killed her</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.150" end="00:49:11.150" style="s2">but she said that</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.220" end="00:49:13.220" style="s2">It affected her left hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.980" end="00:49:20.480" style="s2">And she said that she experienced a sense of divine unity as a consequence of the stroke</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.120" end="00:49:27.229" style="s2">because the left hemisphere function was disrupted and destroyed and so she became a right hemisphere dominant and</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.200" end="00:49:32.659" style="s2">her experience of that was the dissolution of the specific ego into the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.810" end="00:49:40.789" style="s2">Absolute consciousness something like that now that&#39;s only a case study, and you don&#39;t want to make too much of case studies</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.790" end="00:49:43.790" style="s2">But there is an overwhelming amount of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.580" end="00:49:47.569" style="s2">that those two kinds of consciousness exist</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.210" end="00:49:49.710" style="s2">one being</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.710" end="00:49:51.710" style="s2">your consciousness of you as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.990" end="00:49:56.090" style="s2">localized and specified being and the other being</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.210" end="00:49:58.380" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.380" end="00:50:00.180" style="s2">capacity to experience</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.180" end="00:50:04.639" style="s2">oceanic dissolution and the sense of the cosmos being one</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.120" end="00:50:10.549" style="s2">Now why we have those capacities for different conscious</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.370" end="00:50:12.450" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.450" end="00:50:16.369" style="s2">Is very difficult to understand. I mean part of me thinks that</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.950" end="00:50:19.609" style="s2">Maybe we have a generic human brain</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.760" end="00:50:23.300" style="s2">it&#39;s the brain of the species and</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.850" end="00:50:25.850" style="s2">Allied with that we have a specific</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.860" end="00:50:30.950" style="s2">individual brain and one is the left hemisphere and the other is the right hemisphere the left hemisphere being the</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.050" end="00:50:36.650" style="s2">specific individual brain and usually it&#39;s on and working because you obviously have to take care of yourself as a</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.230" end="00:50:39.740" style="s2">specific entity and not as a generalized</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.290" end="00:50:46.130" style="s2">Cosmic phenomena, it&#39;s hard to dice celery when you&#39;re a generalized cosmic phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.380" end="00:50:51.229" style="s2">Right so you have to be more pointed than that but but look let&#39;s make no mistake about it</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.960" end="00:50:55.730" style="s2">The fact that those different states of consciousness exists is not</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.190" end="00:51:01.709" style="s2">Disputable they can be elicited in all sorts of ways and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.499" end="00:51:08.579" style="s2">I&#39;m going to read you something that Aldous Huxley wrote about this back, I think, in 1956 this was after he</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.799" end="00:51:13.918" style="s2">Started his experimentation with mescaline</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.039" end="00:51:21.389" style="s2">The psychedelics were introduced into western culture in the 1950s in a whole bunch of different ways psilocybin mushrooms</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.759" end="00:51:25.019" style="s2">LsD. I was discovered right at the end of World War two</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.869" end="00:51:27.869" style="s2">Was discovered by accident actually?</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.390" end="00:51:35.039" style="s2">laboratory Sandoz labs the guy who discovered it Albert Hofmann had spilled some on his hands you can absorb it through your skin and</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.619" end="00:51:42.778" style="s2">He was biking home and had the world&#39;s first LSD trip which was somewhat of a shock to him and then to the entire world</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.499" end="00:51:47.728" style="s2">Huxley who was a great literary figure, a real genius</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.539" end="00:51:51.569" style="s2">experimented with mescaline in the late fifties and</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.390" end="00:51:58.169" style="s2">He wrote a book called the doors of perception which had a huge impact on the emerging psychedelic culture both on</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.419" end="00:52:05.879" style="s2">The East coast at Harvard and on the West coast with Ken Kesey and his merry pranksters the people who popularized LSD</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.880" end="00:52:09.900" style="s2">That&#39;s all documented in a book called the electric Kool-Aid acid test; Which I would highly recommend</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.329" end="00:52:14.609" style="s2">It&#39;s Tom Wolfe it&#39;s a brilliant book on the east coast it was timothy leary</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.609" end="00:52:20.788" style="s2">I had timothy leary&#39;s old job at Harvard. So that was kind of cool. You know in a warped way</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.309" end="00:52:23.728" style="s2">So I met people there who knew him</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.489" end="00:52:28.468" style="s2">Who didn&#39;t think much of them also, but who did know him but</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.109" end="00:52:33.028" style="s2">Huxley had this mescaline experience, and it transported him to this</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.089" end="00:52:35.369" style="s2">alternative consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.369" end="00:52:41.728" style="s2">And he said that during his mescaline experience that the entire world glowed from within like if there was an inner light</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.890" end="00:52:46.409" style="s2">like a paradisal inner light and that everything was deeply meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.140" end="00:52:53.609" style="s2">Symbolically suggestive and overwhelming and beautiful and timeless so he had an experience of divine</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.249" end="00:52:59.579" style="s2">Eternity I suppose is the most straightforward way to to put that and we know perfectly well that</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.009" end="00:53:05.998" style="s2">the psychedelic drugs that all share the same chemical structure they interact with the brain chemical called Serotonin</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.609" end="00:53:08.529" style="s2">Which is a very very fundamental?</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.529" end="00:53:11.039" style="s2">Neurotransmitter they all have approximately the same</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.249" end="00:53:14.210" style="s2">range of effects</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.210" end="00:53:16.069" style="s2">Although those effects are very</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.069" end="00:53:20.979" style="s2">There&#39;s a very large multitude of effects that sort of exist underneath that umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.180" end="00:53:25.180" style="s2">Huxley was</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.079" end="00:53:32.829" style="s2">staggered by his mescaline experience he he didn&#39;t really know what to make of it, and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.470" end="00:53:36.129" style="s2">the common experience of people who have</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.950" end="00:53:39.819" style="s2">exceptionally profound psychedelic experiences and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.640" end="00:53:44.410" style="s2">Tell you some documentation about that in a moment, but he spent quite a long time</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.050" end="00:53:51.009" style="s2">Trying to come to grips with what this might mean from an intellectual perspective and huxley had a great brain</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.010" end="00:53:54.879" style="s2">I mean someone was going to wrestle with the problem like that. He was a good candidate</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.880" end="00:53:57.790" style="s2">He must have had a verbal IQ of 180. I mean he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.460" end="00:54:05.349" style="s2">his books are incredibly literate Incredible credible mastery of language and complexity of characterization and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.960" end="00:54:07.960" style="s2">intellectual Discourse really remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.260" end="00:54:14.199" style="s2">So this is what Huxley had to say after his mescaline experience he talked about heaven and hell</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.200" end="00:54:18.369" style="s2">and he talked about that in reference to bad trips essentially because</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.920" end="00:54:24.430" style="s2">it was known by that point that a Psychedelic experience could transport you to an</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.770" end="00:54:27.729" style="s2">Ecstatic domain of Divine revelation</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.730" end="00:54:34.689" style="s2">but could take you to the worst imaginable place as well huxley was very interested in why you would even have the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.000" end="00:54:39.520" style="s2">Experiences like that and which I think is a very good question and it&#39;s completely unanswered question</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.520" end="00:54:44.079" style="s2">I mean, we don&#39;t know much about consciousness and we know even less about psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.079" end="00:54:49.298" style="s2">I would say they are an absolute mystery. I don&#39;t think we understand them in the least</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.630" end="00:54:56.109" style="s2">Huxley did a good job of starting to at least map out the mysteries of the terrain he said like the earth of a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.109" end="00:55:02.769" style="s2">Years ago our mind still has its darkest Africa&#39;s its unmapped Borneo&#39;s and Amazonian basin in</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.170" end="00:55:07.030" style="s2">Relation to the Fauna of these regions. We are not yet zoologists</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.460" end="00:55:12.010" style="s2">We are mere naturalist sand collectors of specimens the fact is unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.010" end="00:55:14.559" style="s2">But we have to accept it we have to make the best of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.559" end="00:55:23.379" style="s2">However, lowly the work of the collector must be done before we can proceed to the higher scientific tasks of classification analysis experiment and theory</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.380" end="00:55:29.320" style="s2">Making like the giraffe and the duck-billed platypus the creatures inhabit these remoter regions of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.380" end="00:55:32.240" style="s2">Are exceedingly improbable.</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.240" end="00:55:34.959" style="s2">Nevertheless they exist they&#39;re facts of observation</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.570" end="00:55:40.630" style="s2">And as such they cannot be ignored by anyone who is honestly trying to understand the world in which he lives</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.920" end="00:55:48.490" style="s2">when psychiatrists started to study LSD that</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.460" end="00:55:53.649" style="s2">was mostly in the late 50s and running forward from that they thought about</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.560" end="00:56:02.409" style="s2">The drug as a psychedelic which was a chemical substance that would induce psychosis, but that turned out to not be true</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.930" end="00:56:05.560" style="s2">not with the psychedelics because</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.680" end="00:56:08.680" style="s2">schizophrenics were given LSD and</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.230" end="00:56:11.230" style="s2">The schizophrenics reported that</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.480" end="00:56:14.649" style="s2">while the experience experience was certainly</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.350" end="00:56:19.180" style="s2">extraordinarily strange, it wasn&#39;t like being schizophrenic and</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.730" end="00:56:26.709" style="s2">then it was found later that if you gave schizophrenics amphetamines that made them worse in fact you can induce a</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.170" end="00:56:31.270" style="s2">Paranoid psychosis in a normal person by overdosing them with amphetamines</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.400" end="00:56:35.170" style="s2">So whatever the hallucinogens are the psychedelics are doing</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.360" end="00:56:41.020" style="s2">It&#39;s not the same thing as mania and it&#39;s not the same thing as schizophrenia not at all</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.490" end="00:56:45.490" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.930" end="00:56:57.659" style="s2">So you can&#39;t just write the experience off as an induced psychosis, whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.170" end="00:57:03.029" style="s2">Independent of its utility or lack thereof it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.510" end="00:57:06.510" style="s2">Now can be induced by drugs</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.450" end="00:57:11.849" style="s2">Can be induced by deprivation right? I mean there are accounts throughout history of people</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.640" end="00:57:14.640" style="s2">putting themselves in Extreme</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.650" end="00:57:21.389" style="s2">Physiological situations in order to induce transformations of consciousness fasting is one of the routes to doing that</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.090" end="00:57:24.090" style="s2">Dancing is another route</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.190" end="00:57:31.679" style="s2">Isolation prolonged periods of isolation will also do it now you could say that exposing yourself to any of those in excess</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.860" end="00:57:34.780" style="s2">produces a state that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.780" end="00:57:36.780" style="s2">indistinguishable from illness and</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.960" end="00:57:43.679" style="s2">That there&#39;s no reason to assume that the phenomena that are associated with illness have any</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.080" end="00:57:47.680" style="s2">Utility Whatsoever although, it&#39;s interesting to me that</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.460" end="00:57:56.480" style="s2">A Disrupted consciousness can Produce coherent experiences. It&#39;s not exactly what you expect</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.489" end="00:57:59.540" style="s2">It was just an illness you know if you develop say a high fever</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.640" end="00:58:02.470" style="s2">your experience</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.470" end="00:58:09.300" style="s2">Isn&#39;t transcendent and coherent its fragmented and pathologized and and the difference</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.300" end="00:58:11.430" style="s2">I think is quite distinct although</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.430" end="00:58:15.539" style="s2">We don&#39;t only we don&#39;t have to only speculate about that because there&#39;s been enough experimental work done</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.540" end="00:58:18.660" style="s2">Now with hallucinogens and psychedelics to indicate that</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.150" end="00:58:24.269" style="s2">The notion that what they produce is something that&#39;s only akin to Pathology is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.820" end="00:58:26.050" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.050" end="00:58:31.540" style="s2">It&#39;s not a matter of opinion at this point in the sequence of scientific and historical</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.540" end="00:58:33.920" style="s2">Investigation in fact there was a large-scale study done</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.560" end="00:58:40.620" style="s2">Ten Years ago? five years ago? of two hundred thousand people who had experimented with pSychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.620" end="00:58:47.000" style="s2">And they were mentally and physically healthier than people who hadn&#39;t on virtually every parameter they examined in</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.320" end="00:58:49.320" style="s2">fact the rate of</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.380" end="00:58:54.280" style="s2">Flashbacks, you&#39;ve heard of LSD flashbacks mostly a hypothetical phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.300" end="00:59:00.460" style="s2">But the rate of self-reported flashbacks was higher among the non psychedelic users than among the psychedelic users</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.400" end="00:59:07.540" style="s2">so that was very interesting was a huge study now it might be you could say that those who had experimented with</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.760" end="00:59:14.709" style="s2">Psychedelics were prone to be healthier to begin with but he that still contradicts the Pathology argument</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.710" end="00:59:18.520" style="s2">So it doesn&#39;t matter either way the Pathology argument is contradicted</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.280" end="00:59:21.280" style="s2">now,</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.110" end="00:59:27.489" style="s2">oh I did put that in it was Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.430" end="00:59:30.610" style="s2">This is what she said about her stroke I</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.280" end="00:59:36.550" style="s2">Remember that first day of the stroke with terrific bittersweetness in the absence of the normal functioning of my left</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.770" end="00:59:44.380" style="s2">Orientation association area my perception of my physical boundaries was no longer limited to where my skin met air. I felt like a genie</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.080" end="00:59:47.380" style="s2">Liberated from its bottle it&#39;s good metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.860" end="00:59:52.959" style="s2">The energy of my spirit seemed to flow like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.210" end="00:59:56.980" style="s2">Euphoria the absence of Physical Boundary was one of glorious bliss</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.410" end="01:00:04.899" style="s2">Recently this Dr. Roland Griffith I</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.010" end="01:00:13.060" style="s2">met him once at a conference in San Francisco surprised surprised a</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.600" end="01:00:20.829" style="s2">Conference on awe and this was just when he was embarking on his experiments with psilocybin which were the first experiments on</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.620" end="01:00:23.620" style="s2">hallucinogens that were permitted by the</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.020" end="01:00:30.640" style="s2">National Institute of Mental Health in some three four decades he had to be very careful to</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.920" end="01:00:38.350" style="s2">Lay out the scientific protocols so that the ethics committees would approve the experiments and so that the federal funding agencies would</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.570" end="01:00:42.340" style="s2">also allow the experiments to go through he started to experiment with</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.460" end="01:00:45.440" style="s2">psilocybin and</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.440" end="01:00:48.010" style="s2">He&#39;s found a number of and published a number of very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.970" end="01:00:56.260" style="s2">Results one was that a single psilocybin trip</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.530" end="01:00:59.090" style="s2">and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.090" end="01:01:01.090" style="s2">specified trip because</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.100" end="01:01:06.160" style="s2">Sometimes when people take psilocybin out the doses that griffith uses. They don&#39;t have a psychedelic experience</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.100" end="01:01:14.140" style="s2">Most people who take the dose do but not everyone those who take the dose and don&#39;t have the mystical experience don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.350" end="01:01:20.259" style="s2">Experience the consequences of taking the drug and the consequences can be quite profound</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.510" end="01:01:26.590" style="s2">So one consequence is that if you have the mystical experience that&#39;s associated with psilocybin ingestion</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.410" end="01:01:29.410" style="s2">You&#39;re liable to</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.110" end="01:01:35.410" style="s2">Represent that to others and yourself as one of the two or three most experienced important experiences of your entire life</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.440" end="01:01:41.470" style="s2">So that would be at the same level as the birth of your child or your marriage</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.540" end="01:01:45.999" style="s2">let&#39;s say assuming that those were transcendent experiences, but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.360" end="01:01:51.400" style="s2">But that&#39;s how people describe them so that&#39;s that&#39;s very interesting in and of itself</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.720" end="01:01:55.010" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.010" end="01:02:00.850" style="s2">the next thing that griffith another thing that griffith reported was that one year after a</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.000" end="01:02:06.100" style="s2">Psilocybin dose a single psilocybin dose profound enough to induce a mystical experience</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.770" end="01:02:08.210" style="s2">the trait</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.210" end="01:02:12.339" style="s2">openness of the participants had increased one standard deviation</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.470" end="01:02:19.809" style="s2">Which is a tremendous amount and so it looked like one dose produced a permanent neurological and psychological transformation now</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.810" end="01:02:22.299" style="s2">You know I&#39;m not saying that that&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.940" end="01:02:26.739" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that because I don&#39;t think that openness is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.880" end="01:02:35.229" style="s2">Untroubled blessing, but it&#39;s certainly a testament to the unbelievable potency of the of the drugs</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.990" end="01:02:41.260" style="s2">There&#39;s about a 10% chance by the way with psilocybin ingestion of a trip to hell</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.260" end="01:02:49.030" style="s2">and so that&#39;s certainly something very much worth considering when you&#39;re thinking about the potential effects of this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.820" end="01:02:51.820" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.320" end="01:03:01.660" style="s2">so the the mystical experience produced by psilocybin is rated by people as the most profound among the most profound experience of their life as</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.910" end="01:03:03.940" style="s2">life-Changing it produces permanent personality</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.520" end="01:03:08.590" style="s2">transformations eighty-five percent success in smoking cessation with a single dose</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.740" end="01:03:17.290" style="s2">Right that&#39;s another thing that griffiths demonstrated now that is mind boggling because there are chemical treatments for smoking cessation</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.340" end="01:03:21.640" style="s2">bupropion is one it</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.000" end="01:03:27.010" style="s2">Reduces craving to some degree, but its success rate is</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.650" end="01:03:29.650" style="s2">Nowhere Near 85%</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.990" end="01:03:32.500" style="s2">certainly not with a single dose and</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.380" end="01:03:34.910" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.910" end="01:03:41.470" style="s2">We don&#39;t understand how it can be that that occurs, but it&#39;s nicely documented by griffiths team in this</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.339" end="01:03:46.899" style="s2">Experiment he gave psilocybin to people who are dying of cancer</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.820" end="01:03:54.099" style="s2">cancer patients often develop Chronic clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.710" end="01:04:02.589" style="s2">Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease depression and anxiety in cancer patients aldous huxley took LSD on his deathbed by the way</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.320" end="01:04:06.489" style="s2">so the idea that there was something about</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.790" end="01:04:10.359" style="s2">psychedelic substances that could</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.050" end="01:04:19.599" style="s2">Buffer people against the catastrophes of mortality is an idea. That&#39;s as old as experimentation with the drug itself</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.780" end="01:04:28.419" style="s2">the effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life threatening diagnosis and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.329" end="01:04:31.329" style="s2">unsurprisingly</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.880" end="01:04:42.740" style="s2">I don&#39;t really know if it&#39;s reasonable to describe the emotional state of people diagnosed with cancer of uncertain Prognosis or</p>

<p begin="01:04:47.300" end="01:04:51.939" style="s2">You know you know what I mean is that if you go to the doctor and he tells you that you have intractable</p>

<p begin="01:04:53.930" end="01:04:59.139" style="s2">The normative response is to be rather upset and anxious about that and so it</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.630" end="01:05:04.270" style="s2">One of the things that bothers me about clinical psychiatry and clinical psychology is the automatic</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.700" end="01:05:09.460" style="s2">Presupposition that even overwhelming states of negative emotion are properly categorized as depression</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.460" end="01:05:15.429" style="s2">I don&#39;t think you&#39;re depressed when you get a cancer diagnosis. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the right way to think about it</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.430" end="01:05:17.200" style="s2">I think that you have a big problem</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.200" end="01:05:23.560" style="s2">And it&#39;s not surprising that you&#39;re overwhelmed by negative emotion and to think about that as a psychiatric malfunction is a major error</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.140" end="01:05:25.819" style="s2">but anyways</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.819" end="01:05:28.179" style="s2">It&#39;s a side issue with regards to this study</p>

<p begin="01:09:03.120" end="01:09:07.220" style="s2">Mediated the effect of psilocybin dose on therapeutic outcomes. What that means is that</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.069" end="01:09:09.450" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.450" end="01:09:14.539" style="s2">When researchers were trying to look at a causal relationship between drug ingestion and the positive outcome</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.569" end="01:09:23.569" style="s2">The causal relationship was drug ingestion mystical experience positive outcome it wasn&#39;t drug ingestion positive outcome there had to be the experience</p>

<p begin="01:09:32.730" end="01:09:39.020" style="s2">Maybe some people needed a higher dose who knows because people vary tremendously in their sensitivity to pharmaceutical substances</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.630" end="01:09:45.980" style="s2">Now why am I telling you all this well? I&#39;m telling you for a variety of reasons one is the first is</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.740" end="01:09:48.740" style="s2">Make no mistake about it</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.020" end="01:09:56.419" style="s2">human beings have the capacity for forms of consciousness that are radically unlike our normative forms of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.210" end="01:10:00.799" style="s2">the evidence that those alternative forms of consciousness are</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.980" end="01:10:03.090" style="s2">purely</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.090" end="01:10:10.370" style="s2">Pathological which is the simplest explanation right?  You perturb the system it produces Pathology that&#39;s negative that is the simplest explanation</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.710" end="01:10:12.600" style="s2">the Evidence for that is</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.600" end="01:10:14.600" style="s2">weak at Best</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.610" end="01:10:17.480" style="s2">Leaving out the bad trip issue which which is non-trivial</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.150" end="01:10:24.949" style="s2">the empirical evidence as it accrues in fact seems to suggest that the consequence of mystical</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.170" end="01:10:29.089" style="s2">positive mystical experiences associated with psychedelic intake is</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.670" end="01:10:34.790" style="s2">overwhelmingly positive even in extreme situations, and you really can&#39;t find a more extreme situation than</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.239" end="01:10:38.239" style="s2">uncertain Cancer diagnosis with</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.969" end="01:10:43.099" style="s2">Concomitant and depression and anxiety like I mean that&#39;s not as bad as it gets</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.100" end="01:10:49.699" style="s2">But it&#39;s kind of in the ballpark and so the fact that even under circumstances like that. There is the overwhelming</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.310" end="01:10:54.350" style="s2">Probability that the experience would be positive because that&#39;s another thing you wouldn&#39;t expect you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.840" end="01:10:59.690" style="s2">Even from some of the earlier earliest discussions about psychedelic use that were put forth by people</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.330" end="01:11:02.330" style="s2">including Timothy Leary</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.699" end="01:11:06.289" style="s2">Describing the importance of set right so that the early experimenters</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.050" end="01:11:08.489" style="s2">noted that</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.489" end="01:11:10.519" style="s2">if you had a psychedelic experience</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.520" end="01:11:16.850" style="s2">and you were in a bad state or in a bad place that that was one of the precursors to a bad trip that the</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.850" end="01:11:19.249" style="s2">negative emotion that you entered the</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.800" end="01:11:26.750" style="s2">experience with could be magnified tremendously by the by the chemical substance and so that it was necessary to</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.239" end="01:11:31.879" style="s2">be somewhere safe to be around people that you trust to be in a familiar environment to get all the</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.670" end="01:11:40.549" style="s2">Variables that you couldn&#39;t control under control, but here is a situation where that isn&#39;t what&#39;s happening at all because people have this</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.670" end="01:11:44.960" style="s2">cancer diagnosis of cancer diagnosis of unspecified outcome</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.960" end="01:11:52.520" style="s2">And they still the vast majority of them had a positive experience and the positive experience experience had long lasting positive consequences</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.070" end="01:11:55.070" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.290" end="01:11:57.290" style="s2">so the case that</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.330" end="01:12:00.319" style="s2">the transcendent experience is not real</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.050" end="01:12:03.000" style="s2">That&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.000" end="01:12:09.920" style="s2">It&#39;s real. now, We don&#39;t know what that means because it actually challenges to some degree our concepts of what two dudes real</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.950" end="01:12:14.210" style="s2">But it&#39;s certainly well within the realm of normative human experience</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.730" end="01:12:19.489" style="s2">So it&#39;s part of the human capacity and you know there&#39;s been other neurological experiments too. There&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.130" end="01:12:25.370" style="s2">there&#39;s a researcher Canadian researcher if I remember correctly who invented something he called the God helmet and</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.920" end="01:12:33.259" style="s2">It used Electromagnetic stimulation brain stimulation to induce mystical experiences now</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.260" end="01:12:38.210" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember what part of the brain. He was shutting off or activating with that particular Gadget, but</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.690" end="01:12:43.069" style="s2">And you know there&#39;s also. There&#39;s all sorts of other</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.340" end="01:12:47.569" style="s2">indications of this sort of thing that have cropped up in other</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.110" end="01:12:51.290" style="s2">domains of the Neurological literature for example</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.170" end="01:12:55.580" style="s2">It&#39;s very common for people who are epileptic to have</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.400" end="01:12:58.400" style="s2">religious experiences as</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.410" end="01:13:04.099" style="s2">part of the prodrome to the actual seizure that was the case with dostoyevsky for example who had</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.160" end="01:13:09.349" style="s2">Incredibly intense religious experiences that would culminate an epileptic seizure</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.350" end="01:13:15.109" style="s2">and he said that they were of sufficient quality that he would give up his whole life to have had them and</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.570" end="01:13:17.570" style="s2">the funny thing too is that</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.610" end="01:13:21.770" style="s2">In my reading of dostoevsky at least is that I think that</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.320" end="01:13:26.270" style="s2">epileptic seizures and the associated mystical experiences were part of what made him a</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.030" end="01:13:28.340" style="s2">Transcendently Brilliant author</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.340" end="01:13:35.870" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that he would have broken through into the domains of insight that he possessed without those strange neurological experiences</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.450" end="01:13:41.300" style="s2">And it was certainly not the case that his epilepsy or the experiences that were associated with it</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.360" end="01:13:48.680" style="s2">Produced what you might describe as an impairment in his cognitive functions quite the contrary at least that&#39;s how it looks to me</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.099" end="01:13:55.099" style="s2">here&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.349" end="01:13:57.290" style="s2">Here&#39;s another something worth considering</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.290" end="01:14:01.639" style="s2">And I don&#39;t know how important it is but it might be really important it depends on how important</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.639" end="01:14:05.509" style="s2">This is something that carl jung said so depends on how important jung is</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.179" end="01:14:08.179" style="s2">now freud</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.429" end="01:14:12.019" style="s2">Established the field of psychoanalysis and with it</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.690" end="01:14:14.690" style="s2">investigation I would say</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.210" end="01:14:21.080" style="s2">Rigorous investigation into the contents of the unconscious a modern psychologists and psychiatrists like to</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.530" end="01:14:26.389" style="s2">What would you say? denigrate freud, but I think there&#39;s a reason for that</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.389" end="01:14:27.570" style="s2">I think that freud&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.570" end="01:14:34.909" style="s2">Fundamental insights were so profound and so valuable that they got immediately absorbed into our culture and now they seem self-evident and so that all</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.909" end="01:14:36.909" style="s2">That&#39;s left of freud is his errors</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.110" end="01:14:41.150" style="s2">You know because we believed everything else. We believe all the profound things he discovered</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.190" end="01:14:46.159" style="s2">We just take them for granted and so we don&#39;t believe the things that he said that weren&#39;t quite on the money</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.159" end="01:14:49.009" style="s2">And that&#39;s all we credit with him with now</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.050" end="01:14:55.369" style="s2">But he was certainly the first person who brought up the idea of the unconscious in a in a rigorous manner</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.369" end="01:15:01.639" style="s2">And he was the first person to do a rigorous examination of dreams the interpretation of dreams is a great book</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.639" end="01:15:07.609" style="s2">it&#39;s well worth reading and he was the first person to note that people were in some sense inhabited by</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.340" end="01:15:12.830" style="s2">subpersonalities that had a certain degree of autonomy and and and independent life</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.170" end="01:15:16.580" style="s2">Brilliant observation the cognitive psychologists haven&#39;t caught up with that at all yet</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.460" end="01:15:27.859" style="s2">Jung was profoundly affected by freud jung was profoundly affected by Nietzsche and by freud those were his two main intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.280" end="01:15:32.090" style="s2">Influences, I don&#39;t think one more than the other</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.830" end="01:15:36.949" style="s2">He split with freud on the religious issue</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.199" end="01:15:40.219" style="s2">That was what caused the disruption in their relationship</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.219" end="01:15:45.919" style="s2">And I think it&#39;s an extremely interesting historical occurrence and it might be of profound significance</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.099" end="01:15:53.599" style="s2">freud believed that the fundamental myths of the human being was the Oedipal myth, and the Eda pole myths</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.420" end="01:16:00.770" style="s2">From a broader perspective is a failed hero story, so the Oedipal myth is the myth of a man who?</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.409" end="01:16:03.769" style="s2">Develops who grows up, but then</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.469" end="01:16:05.830" style="s2">accidentally</p>

<p begin="01:16:14.120" end="01:16:18.939" style="s2">There&#39;s a there&#39;s a warning about human development gone wrong in that story</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.940" end="01:16:23.080" style="s2">and I think that freud put his finger on it extraordinarily well because</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.540" end="01:16:30.100" style="s2">human beings have a very long period Of dependency and one of the things that you do see in clinical practice is that</p>

<p begin="01:16:34.010" end="01:16:41.139" style="s2">Associated with their inability to break free of their family like they&#39;re consumed by the family drama right they can&#39;t get Beyond</p>

<p begin="01:16:46.400" end="01:16:51.850" style="s2">That&#39;s equivalent symbolically speaking you might say to the idea of being too close to your mother of</p>

<p begin="01:16:54.590" end="01:16:58.630" style="s2">Improperly specified and that happens far more often than anyone would like to think</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.900" end="01:17:02.050" style="s2">As I said freud thought it was a universal</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.770" end="01:17:05.210" style="s2">but Jung</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.210" end="01:17:11.439" style="s2">See he had a different idea and his idea was that it wasn&#39;t the failed hero story. That was the universal human myth</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.480" end="01:17:19.089" style="s2">it was the successful hero story, and that&#39;s a big difference like it&#39;s seriously a big difference because</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.090" end="01:17:22.120" style="s2">the successful Hero&#39;s story is</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.670" end="01:17:26.290" style="s2">Remembering sleeping beauty you may remember this in the disney movie</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.630" end="01:17:31.930" style="s2">The Evil queen traps the prince in a dungeon, and she&#39;s not going to let him out till he&#39;s old right</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.930" end="01:17:37.570" style="s2">And so there&#39;s this comical scene where she&#39;s down in the dungeon. He&#39;s all in chains, and she&#39;s laughing at him</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.090" end="01:17:41.170" style="s2">telling him what his future is going to be like it&#39;s quite evil and</p>

<p begin="01:17:43.400" end="01:17:49.420" style="s2">Paints this wonderful picture of him being freed in like 80 years and hobbling out of the castle on his his horse</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.420" end="01:17:56.020" style="s2">That&#39;s old it can barely stand up in him with Grey hair and you know she and she recites this story of his eventual</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.540" end="01:18:03.729" style="s2">Triumphant departure from the castle as a old and decrepit man and she has a great laugh about it, and it&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.730" end="01:18:08.439" style="s2">You know it&#39;s a real punchy story. It&#39;s really something wonderful for children. That&#39;s story and</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.730" end="01:18:12.730" style="s2">he gets free of the of</p>

<p begin="01:18:18.730" end="01:18:26.020" style="s2">It&#39;s the positive aspect of the feminine that frees him from the dungeon, so it&#39;s very interesting and very accurate from a psychological perspective</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.020" end="01:18:32.379" style="s2">it&#39;s the negative element of the feminine that encapsulates him in the dungeon and suppose development of the feminine would freeze him and</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.750" end="01:18:37.119" style="s2">and then he has a the queen the evil queen is not very happy when he</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.430" end="01:18:44.139" style="s2">Escapes, you may remember that she stands on top of her castle tower and starts to spin off Cosmic Sparks</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.230" end="01:18:45.980" style="s2">I mean, she&#39;s quite the creature</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.980" end="01:18:52.689" style="s2">enveloped in flame, and then she turns into a dragon and she then the prince has to fight with her in order to</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.930" end="01:18:57.849" style="s2">Make contact with sleeping beauty and and awaken her from her</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.520" end="01:19:02.409" style="s2">comatose existence as her unconscious existence and</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.510" end="01:19:11.409" style="s2">That&#39;s a brilliant, It&#39;s a brilliant representation of a successful hero myth. He</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.710" end="01:19:14.710" style="s2">He doesn&#39;t end up</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.140" end="01:19:21.520" style="s2">staying in an unholy relationship with his mother let&#39;s say he escapes and</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.250" end="01:19:26.319" style="s2">then conquers the worst thing that can be imagined and</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.050" end="01:19:34.420" style="s2">Is Noble by that and not as a consequence, He&#39;s able to wake the slumbering feminine from its coma and</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.420" end="01:19:36.880" style="s2">That&#39;s a Jungian story</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.880" end="01:19:42.520" style="s2">And that&#39;s the story that he juxtaposed against freud see freud thought of religious phenomena</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.890" end="01:19:48.550" style="s2">As part of an occult tide that would be they would drown rational rationality</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.620" end="01:19:51.880" style="s2">that&#39;s why freud was so dominant Lee anti-religious and</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.490" end="01:19:54.490" style="s2">Jung thought no</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.890" end="01:20:00.039" style="s2">It&#39;s not the case you&#39;re throwing the baby out with the bathwater. There&#39;s something profound and</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.890" end="01:20:05.289" style="s2">Central to the Hero myth and Jungian Clinical work</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.930" end="01:20:09.700" style="s2">is essentially the awakening of the hero myth in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.090" end="01:20:14.469" style="s2">analysand in the in the client or in the patient to</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.720" end="01:20:21.010" style="s2">conceptualize yourself as that which can confront Chaos and triumph and that that&#39;s associated with an</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.290" end="01:20:25.030" style="s2">ennobling of the of consciousness and the establishment of</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.940" end="01:20:29.199" style="s2">proper positive relationships between male and female and</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.890" end="01:20:32.890" style="s2">You know I&#39;m a skeptical person</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.310" end="01:20:35.830" style="s2">I&#39;m a very very skeptical person and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.800" end="01:20:40.089" style="s2">Tried with every trick. I have to put a</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.640" end="01:20:46.780" style="s2">Lever underneath Jung story and lift it up and and disrupt it and I I can&#39;t do it I</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.360" end="01:20:50.920" style="s2">Think he was right and that freud was wrong. I mean I have great respect for freud</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.920" end="01:20:56.440" style="s2">I think he got the program problem diagnosed very very nicely and in my clinical work I</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.720" end="01:21:03.220" style="s2">See the phenomena that freud described emerged continually constantly that the best if you&#39;re interested in that</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.530" end="01:21:06.069" style="s2">There&#39;s a documentary you should watch. I may have mentioned it before</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.070" end="01:21:09.220" style="s2">I think it&#39;s the best documentary ever made certainly the best one</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.220" end="01:21:11.220" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever seen it&#39;s called crumb</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.360" end="01:21:18.790" style="s2">And it&#39;s about an underground cartoonist Robert crumb who who is part of a hippie movement and although he hated hippies</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.430" end="01:21:24.399" style="s2">He was part of the hippie movement in the 60s in San Francisco and started the entire underground comic</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.700" end="01:21:29.109" style="s2">What? culture that manifested itself eventually in in</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.780" end="01:21:31.780" style="s2">graphic novels, there&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.120" end="01:21:33.530" style="s2">significant figure</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.530" end="01:21:38.079" style="s2">from the perspective of popular art and a very very intelligent man and</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.300" end="01:21:42.909" style="s2">Also, I would say a hero although a very bent and depraved and warped one</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.670" end="01:21:51.370" style="s2">Someone very acutely aware of his own shadow and the documentary outlines his attempts to escape from his</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.010" end="01:21:54.010" style="s2">absolutely dreadful mother and</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.590" end="01:21:57.520" style="s2">The failure of his two brothers to do the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.620" end="01:21:58.520" style="s2">one of whom</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.520" end="01:22:04.479" style="s2">Ended up as a street beggar in San Francisco the other who drank furniture polish and died six months after the documentary was produced</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.730" end="01:22:06.730" style="s2">It&#39;s an unbelievably shocking</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.250" end="01:22:09.250" style="s2">documentary it&#39;s the only piece of</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.340" end="01:22:13.630" style="s2">Film that I&#39;ve ever seen that captures</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.300" end="01:22:19.509" style="s2">Freudian Pathology I&#39;ve never seen anything because you can&#39;t see it. Generally unless you&#39;re in a clinical</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.120" end="01:22:25.809" style="s2">Situation unless you know the details of someone&#39;s lives the personal intimate details you cannot communicate it</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.000" end="01:22:27.590" style="s2">but the</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.590" end="01:22:29.000" style="s2">documentarist who made the film</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.000" end="01:22:35.169" style="s2">Who&#39;s Robert zwigoff if I remember correctly was a friend of the crumbs and so he got access in a way that no one else?</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.170" end="01:22:39.609" style="s2">Would have and they were also very forthright and forthcoming about their situation in general</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.610" end="01:22:45.460" style="s2">I would highly recommend that it&#39;s it&#39;s a real punch if you want to know how a rapist thinks</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.040" end="01:22:51.309" style="s2">Like if actually want to know because maybe you don&#39;t want to know in fact you probably don&#39;t want to know</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.190" end="01:22:54.190" style="s2">Right because do you really want to know that?</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.590" end="01:23:00.849" style="s2">Because the understand that means to put yourself in that position and to understand it if you really want to know how a serial sexual</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.070" end="01:23:05.289" style="s2">Predator thinks and why if you watch crumb and you pay attention?</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.020" end="01:23:07.820" style="s2">you&#39;ll know and</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.820" end="01:23:12.309" style="s2">That&#39;s only a tiny bit of what the film has to offer. It&#39;s really quite remarkable</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.599" end="01:23:16.599" style="s2">anyways</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.949" end="01:23:22.029" style="s2">Jung split with freud on the issue of</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.539" end="01:23:29.709" style="s2">Beautiful story as the fundamental myth of humankind and on the issue of the validity</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.559" end="01:23:32.679" style="s2">of the religious Viewpoint and</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.170" end="01:23:39.849" style="s2">Jung came down heavily on the side of the validity of the religious Viewpoint and he established that in a book called symbols of</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.159" end="01:23:45.339" style="s2">Transformation which was written in 1914 and that&#39;s the book that broke that produced the break</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.559" end="01:23:48.339" style="s2">permanent split with freud and that book I</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.070" end="01:23:52.000" style="s2">Would say that books actually been written three times</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.179" end="01:23:56.979" style="s2">it was written as symbols of four times written in symbols of transformation which jung</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.200" end="01:24:04.260" style="s2">extensively revised when he was all and then it was rewritten in his innocence by a student of Jung&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.260" end="01:24:10.560" style="s2">Erich Neumann who is also something someone I would really recommend Erich Neumann I think is Jung&#39;s greatest student and</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.100" end="01:24:15.560" style="s2">He wrote two books. He wrote one called the origins and history of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.650" end="01:24:19.719" style="s2">Which is a description of the development of consciousness out of unconsciousness</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.630" end="01:24:24.849" style="s2">Using the hero myth as a...</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.849" end="01:24:31.209" style="s2">what would you say? as a as an interpretive Skeleton, so Neumann viewed the hero myth as</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.760" end="01:24:36.520" style="s2">The dramatized story of the emergence of human consciousness out of the surrounding</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.949" end="01:24:43.719" style="s2">Unconsciousness in which it was embedded the struggle for consciousness the struggle of consciousness upward towards the light like a lotus flower</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.030" end="01:24:49.210" style="s2">Struggles up through the muck and and the water to to lay itself on the surface of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.309" end="01:24:55.268" style="s2">Water and bloom and reveal the Buddha which is of course what the lotus flower does from the symbolic perspective?</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.000" end="01:24:57.889" style="s2">for Neumann</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.889" end="01:25:03.039" style="s2">The Hero&#39;s story was the story of the development success development of consciousness and the origins of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.710" end="01:25:06.129" style="s2">The origins and history of consciousness is a great book</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.130" end="01:25:08.630" style="s2">interestingly</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.630" end="01:25:10.750" style="s2">Camille Paglia wrote read</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.719" end="01:25:14.439" style="s2">The origins and history of consciousness. She&#39;s one of the few</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.469" end="01:25:22.689" style="s2">Mainstream intellectuals that I&#39;ve ever encountered who read that and commented on it and she believed that it would be sufficient</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.960" end="01:25:30.580" style="s2">antidote to postmodern denigration of literature, she thought it was that powerful of work and I</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.119" end="01:25:34.329" style="s2">Believe that I I think it&#39;s a remarkable</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.969" end="01:25:40.899" style="s2">Book carl jung wrote the foreword to that book and he said in the foreword that it was the book that he wished he would</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.900" end="01:25:44.679" style="s2">Have written so sort of like Jung he. Wrote I don&#39;t remember how many volumes</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.400" end="01:25:50.949" style="s2">dozens of very thick difficult volumes was like Neumann was able to</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.270" end="01:25:56.020" style="s2">What? Distill those into a single</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.449" end="01:25:57.670" style="s2">volume statement</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.670" end="01:26:02.859" style="s2">And so I would also say if you&#39;re interested in Jung the best book to read is the origins and history of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.860" end="01:26:07.659" style="s2">It&#39;s the best intro into into the Jungian world seems very difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.869" end="01:26:15.069" style="s2">very difficult to understand it requires a real shift of perspective in order to understand what he&#39;s talking about and</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.219" end="01:26:18.219" style="s2">Neumann wrote another book called the great mother</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.860" end="01:26:22.029" style="s2">Which is a little bit more specialized in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.030" end="01:26:26.920" style="s2">but it&#39;s also extremely interesting because it flashes out the archetype of Chaos and</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.530" end="01:26:31.389" style="s2">It&#39;s representation as feminine. It&#39;s a brilliant book as well, and</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.210" end="01:26:34.569" style="s2">highly worth Highly worth reading both those books</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.320" end="01:26:38.320" style="s2">anyways</p>

<p begin="01:27:21.200" end="01:27:27.110" style="s2">but at the same time I was writing this book that became maps of meaning and sorry split my time and graduate student school between</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.110" end="01:27:29.299" style="s2">these two endeavors one very</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.120" end="01:27:35.660" style="s2">Specifically neurological and pharmacological and really biologically based on the other very</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.450" end="01:27:39.200" style="s2">Abstract religious symbolic psychoanalytic</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.900" end="01:27:42.679" style="s2">The complete opposite, but I could see that the two things</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.440" end="01:27:45.440" style="s2">overlapped really nicely and there was a number of</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.080" end="01:27:48.620" style="s2">Scientists at the time that were also drawing the same</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.440" end="01:27:50.940" style="s2">conclusions the same</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.940" end="01:27:58.730" style="s2">Relationship between the biology and the psychoanalysis jacques panksepp who wrote a book called effective neuroscience which is a great classic is</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.220" end="01:28:01.369" style="s2">one of those people who who saw the</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.100" end="01:28:06.950" style="s2">relationship between the Neurobiology of emotion and motivation and the psychoanalytic insights</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.890" end="01:28:10.760" style="s2">Never became a mainstream view but I think it&#39;s too complex</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.760" end="01:28:17.300" style="s2">I think that bridging the gap between the biology and and the symbolic is too much for people generally speaking</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.300" end="01:28:22.790" style="s2">You know it was certainly virtually too much for me because I got quite ill when I was a graduate student I think</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.980" end="01:28:24.260" style="s2">for a variety of reasons</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.260" end="01:28:28.429" style="s2">I also like with glug party three nights a week, and so that probably had something to do with it, but</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.600" end="01:28:35.270" style="s2">But working on those two things simultaneously was also rather exhausting now</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.000" end="01:28:37.110" style="s2">Jung</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.110" end="01:28:39.799" style="s2">Was a tremendously insightful clinician</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.800" end="01:28:42.020" style="s2">And he was a strange person introverted visionary</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.480" end="01:28:50.449" style="s2">High in introversion very very very very very high in openness like off-the-charts and also God only knows what his IQ was I mean</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.610" end="01:28:52.670" style="s2">Every time I read you it&#39;s like reading Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.670" end="01:28:57.319" style="s2">It&#39;s terrifying because you know he&#39;s so damn smart that he can think up</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.480" end="01:29:03.980" style="s2">Answers to questions that you don&#39;t even it&#39;s not like you don&#39;t understand the answers they never conceptualized the damn questions</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.980" end="01:29:07.520" style="s2">It&#39;s really something to read someone like that right who says well</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.520" end="01:29:13.969" style="s2">Here&#39;s the mystery and you think wow I never thought of that as a mystery and here&#39;s the solution. It&#39;s like okay. That&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.040" end="01:29:18.060" style="s2">That&#39;s something you know and he could read Greek and he could read</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.510" end="01:29:26.369" style="s2">He read all the ancient... He read a very large variety of ancient languages and was very familiar with the entire corpus of</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.730" end="01:29:30.930" style="s2">astrological thought and of alchemical thought and of</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.050" end="01:29:39.839" style="s2">classic literature and biblical stories, and I mean educated in a way that no one is educated now and</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.540" end="01:29:47.519" style="s2">So he&#39;s very daunting person to encounter and terrifying absolutely terrifying his book ion</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.520" end="01:29:49.520" style="s2">which is the second volume of</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.260" end="01:29:55.320" style="s2">it&#39;s the second volume of Volume 9 which is the archetypes of the collective unconscious that damn book is just</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.540" end="01:29:59.189" style="s2">Absolutely terrifying because jung is one of these visionaries who can see?</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.440" end="01:30:05.370" style="s2">Way underneath the social structures and look at patterns that are developing across for in Jung&#39;s case across</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.560" end="01:30:13.050" style="s2">Thousands of years and lays them out and so that&#39;s a really that&#39;s really something to to encounter ion is a terrifying book</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.130" end="01:30:17.020" style="s2">anyways one</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.020" end="01:30:21.600" style="s2">Question might be well because I read Jung and I think how the hell did he know these things how could he figure these things?</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.600" end="01:30:24.990" style="s2">Out I can&#39;t understand how he could possibly know these things</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.020" end="01:30:28.020" style="s2">Well, here&#39;s a partial answer</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.380" end="01:30:31.060" style="s2">Jung</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.060" end="01:30:38.310" style="s2">Was a visionary and so what that means as far as I can tell and like we could do a little quick survey here</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.310" end="01:30:40.310" style="s2">How many of you think you think in words?</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.350" end="01:30:43.350" style="s2">Put up your hands. Do you think in words?</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.980" end="01:30:48.240" style="s2">Ok so it looks like what about pictures. How many of you think in pictures?</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.960" end="01:30:54.990" style="s2">Ok so that&#39;s interesting how many of you think that&#39;s about half and half by the way probably a few err on the word side</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.990" end="01:30:56.990" style="s2">How many of you think in pictures and words?</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.300" end="01:31:02.039" style="s2">Ok and so alright, so it was Roughly 1/3 in each category</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.040" end="01:31:06.570" style="s2">But that&#39;s also something that I really haven&#39;t encountered any research on</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.270" end="01:31:09.720" style="s2">from the neuropsychological perspective, it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.390" end="01:31:15.149" style="s2">Well, do you think in pictures or do you think in words and and is that actually a reliable distinction?</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.150" end="01:31:17.150" style="s2">I think I think in words</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.530" end="01:31:22.649" style="s2">Most of the time, but I can think in pictures like if I&#39;m trying to build something I can think in pictures very</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.200" end="01:31:26.399" style="s2">Almost instantaneously, but it isn&#39;t my natural mode of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.500" end="01:31:30.700" style="s2">I&#39;m hyper verbal and so my natural mode of thinking is to think everything through in words</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.070" end="01:31:36.999" style="s2">But I know my wife isn&#39;t like that. She thinks and images and then has to translate them into words and so</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.910" end="01:31:41.170" style="s2">Anyways, you was very literate, and he could really think in words</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.170" end="01:31:46.929" style="s2">but he could really think in images also talking to my wife quite extensively like her the</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.570" end="01:31:50.979" style="s2">intensity of her visualization vastly exceeds mine</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.050" end="01:31:54.849" style="s2">So for example if I close my eyes and then try to imagine the crowd in front of me</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.850" end="01:32:02.170" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty low resolution and vague and not brilliantly colored and vivid you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.390" end="01:32:05.140" style="s2">Like I&#39;m seeing through a glass darkly. Let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.140" end="01:32:08.559" style="s2">I can&#39;t bring images to mind with that with spectacular clarity</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.560" end="01:32:12.100" style="s2">but my wife is very good at that and you seem to be absolutely a</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.880" end="01:32:18.519" style="s2">Genius at that kind of thinking and he had a lot of visionaries in his family history as well</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.520" end="01:32:21.910" style="s2">So I don&#39;t know to what degree there&#39;s a hereditary component of that</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.910" end="01:32:27.550" style="s2">And I don&#39;t know to what degree that&#39;s actually like a neurological specialization. I presume it would be associated with</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.940" end="01:32:30.940" style="s2">the trait Openness</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.310" end="01:32:35.530" style="s2">Distinguishes itself differentiates itself into interesting ideas and interest in aesthetics</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.530" end="01:32:41.800" style="s2">And my suspicion are is that the people who are more interested in aesthetics are the visionary types the ones that think in images.</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.990" end="01:32:45.099" style="s2">Anyways Jung could really think in images and he could imagine</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.890" end="01:32:51.309" style="s2">beings and I had a client once who was a lucid dreamer and</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.950" end="01:32:56.110" style="s2">How many of you had lucid dream? So you know you&#39;re dreaming? Well you well you&#39;re okay many</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.510" end="01:33:03.760" style="s2">That&#39;s that phenomena wasn&#39;t really even even identified as a phenomena until the end of the 19th century</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.760" end="01:33:05.300" style="s2">There was a book written about it that</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.300" end="01:33:10.719" style="s2">freud tried to get his hands on but couldn&#39;t because it was a very rare book and then there was a</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.180" end="01:33:14.019" style="s2">researcher about 30 years ago who started to study lucid dreams</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.030" end="01:33:18.940" style="s2">But anyways, I had a client who was a lucid dreamer and one of the things she could do was</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.580" end="01:33:22.180" style="s2">Ask her dream characters what</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.850" end="01:33:26.289" style="s2">Information they were trying to convey and they would tell her.</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.870" end="01:33:34.360" style="s2">So that was very interesting; and one of the consequences of that was I don&#39;t have this story completely right in my memory</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.360" end="01:33:35.990" style="s2">But it&#39;s close enough</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.990" end="01:33:42.019" style="s2">She was afraid of a very large number of things and in her dream. I think it was a gypsy</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.630" end="01:33:49.279" style="s2">Standing by a wagon told her that if she was going to be successful in university</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.710" end="01:33:53.029" style="s2">that she would have to visit the slaughterhouse and</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.730" end="01:33:58.520" style="s2">That was something that was way beyond her capacity of tolerate she was a vegetarian</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.560" end="01:34:01.939" style="s2">she couldn&#39;t stand the sight of raw meat even and so and</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.369" end="01:34:09.709" style="s2">She was very oppressed and depressed and anxious because of the slaughterhouse nature of existence and so her dream</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.900" end="01:34:11.900" style="s2">focused on that and</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.210" end="01:34:17.689" style="s2">One of the consequences of that because the slaughterhouse was out of the question as a clinical intervention</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.300" end="01:34:19.380" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.380" end="01:34:21.380" style="s2">Took her to an embalming</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.440" end="01:34:25.339" style="s2">Right because because I asked her I asked her what what?</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.219" end="01:34:33.709" style="s2">What might be equivalent to that and so she suggested that and you know exposure therapy is a hallmark of Clinical psychology?</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.710" end="01:34:38.779" style="s2">right one of the things you do with people as a clinician is you find out what they&#39;re afraid of and</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.239" end="01:34:45.709" style="s2">You gradually and voluntarily expose them to that and that cures them and that&#39;s associated with the hero myth, right?</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.710" end="01:34:48.290" style="s2">It&#39;s exactly the same thing. It&#39;s like. There&#39;s a dragon</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.690" end="01:34:53.179" style="s2">It&#39;s stopping you because there&#39;s lots of dragons most of them aren&#39;t stopping you. You can ignore them</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.179" end="01:34:56.899" style="s2">You don&#39;t have to just go you know slash away it randomly</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.060" end="01:35:01.249" style="s2">You&#39;re not supposed to be fighting dragons that aren&#39;t in your way, but if they are in your way</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.250" end="01:35:04.129" style="s2">You can&#39;t ignore them and then you decompose them into sub dragons</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.130" end="01:35:08.210" style="s2">And you have people you know take them on and as they take them on</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.550" end="01:35:12.320" style="s2">They dispense with the dragon and they gain the power of the drag. It&#39;s like a video game</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.199" end="01:35:17.839" style="s2">Actually a video game is like that. That&#39;s why people like the video games. Well, that&#39;s right, right?</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.840" end="01:35:23.810" style="s2">There&#39;s a reason that you absorb power when you overcome things when you play a video game. It&#39;s not like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.360" end="01:35:27.349" style="s2">Intrinsic to the video game structure, that&#39;s an archetypal idea</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.960" end="01:35:30.739" style="s2">Anyways, we went and saw an embalmbng which was a very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.489" end="01:35:34.489" style="s2">experience and</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.860" end="01:35:35.909" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.909" end="01:35:42.078" style="s2">quite quite useful for her because she knew what she could tolerate after that and it was a hell of a lot more than she</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.079" end="01:35:44.869" style="s2">Thought she could tolerate and so that&#39;s very useful to know</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.619" end="01:35:48.469" style="s2">Back to Jung</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.469" end="01:35:56.198" style="s2">He&#39;s a visionary thinker now my client. I said she could lucid dream, and she could ask her dream</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.050" end="01:35:58.340" style="s2">characters</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.340" end="01:36:02.679" style="s2">What they wanted and what they were trying to communicate to her so that was pretty interesting</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.960" end="01:36:05.349" style="s2">That happens spontaneously had nothing to do with me</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.530" end="01:36:09.280" style="s2">I mean, I&#39;m interested in dreams and many of my clients are great dreamers</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.280" end="01:36:14.500" style="s2">Especially the creative ones because I think it&#39;s a hallmark of creativity to have vivid dreams and to be able to remember them</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.989" end="01:36:19.178" style="s2">But that was a faculty that was natural to her</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.929" end="01:36:22.820" style="s2">Jung</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.820" end="01:36:25.119" style="s2">Had this other client at One time at one point</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.849" end="01:36:28.449" style="s2">And she had a variety of fears and she had this dream that</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.150" end="01:36:31.480" style="s2">She told me and she was walking down a beach</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.270" end="01:36:35.559" style="s2">And on the side of the beach up a dune a small dune</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.869" end="01:36:40.419" style="s2">there was this old man with a snake a big python, and there&#39;s a crowd around him and</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.780" end="01:36:43.780" style="s2">she was walking by the</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.969" end="01:36:47.828" style="s2">Snake handler and the snake in the crowd and she didn&#39;t want to have anything to do with them</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.829" end="01:36:49.829" style="s2">he was sort of showing people the snake and</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.389" end="01:36:54.519" style="s2">She told me that dream, and I thought well. You know you probably need to go see that snake</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.489" end="01:36:57.139" style="s2">and so I</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.139" end="01:37:00.759" style="s2">Relaxed hers quasi hypnotic technique, and it&#39;s very straightforward</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.940" end="01:37:03.940" style="s2">Hypnosis is generally nothing but</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.250" end="01:37:09.489" style="s2">pronounced relaxation well you have to be susceptible to hypnosis to actually fall into a hypnotic trance as a</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.590" end="01:37:12.159" style="s2">Consequence of being relaxed I just relaxed her</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.159" end="01:37:17.049" style="s2">I had her breathe deeply and pay attention to different parts of her body and just relax her muscles</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.329" end="01:37:22.808" style="s2">One by one essentially so that she could concentrate and then I told her we play with the dream a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.570" end="01:37:29.860" style="s2">It&#39;s a Jungian technique said well, so call the dream image to mind which she could do quite well said okay</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.860" end="01:37:33.549" style="s2">So let&#39;s let&#39;s explore it. It&#39;s like pretend. It&#39;s like pretend play</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.099" end="01:37:41.078" style="s2">You know if you&#39;re a kid in your pretend playing you don&#39;t exactly direct the game right you you play the game?</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.389" end="01:37:45.098" style="s2">So it&#39;s partly your direction obviously because you&#39;re the player</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.099" end="01:37:47.059" style="s2">But the thing also happens spontaneously</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.059" end="01:37:53.288" style="s2">Out of its own accord and you can think about that as a dialogue between the conscious mind in the unconscious mind in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.289" end="01:37:58.509" style="s2">It&#39;s a developmental dialogue. It&#39;s not a fun game. If you just direct it. It&#39;s only a fun game if</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.030" end="01:38:03.780" style="s2">you&#39;re inviting and something is well as a consequence the same thing that happens when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.420" end="01:38:09.119" style="s2">You&#39;re engaged in some kind of artistic or literary production if it&#39;s all top down</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.489" end="01:38:12.598" style="s2">You know if you&#39;re forcing it then it&#39;s Propaganda</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.599" end="01:38:17.699" style="s2">It&#39;s empty what you want to sort of put yourself in a receptive state of mind in an imaginative state of mind</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.699" end="01:38:19.859" style="s2">And it&#39;s sort of half you in half</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.980" end="01:38:22.570" style="s2">Nature itself</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.570" end="01:38:29.219" style="s2">Manifesting itself in your creative imagination, and that was the sort of state that we were striving for, and she, I</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.520" end="01:38:35.069" style="s2">Asked her when she was in relaxed. I said well, what do you think about the snake handler and she said well?</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.070" end="01:38:40.049" style="s2">He&#39;s probably a Charlatan and he&#39;s just their turn to impress the crowd and to show off and she was afraid to go up there</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.050" end="01:38:43.320" style="s2">Because she thought people would push her towards the snake and she&#39;d have to touch it</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.320" end="01:38:48.719" style="s2">And so there was a fear of the crowd issue going on there too, and I said well, just look go up there</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.750" end="01:38:53.699" style="s2">About do it under these conditions. Is that you know if people get pushy</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.699" end="01:38:56.729" style="s2">What are you going to tell them and so we figured out something said look?</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.340" end="01:38:59.080" style="s2">Just tell them that</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.080" end="01:39:00.250" style="s2">You know you want to</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.250" end="01:39:05.790" style="s2">look at the snake at your own pace and that you don&#39;t need any encouragement or help and it would be good if you</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.980" end="01:39:08.759" style="s2">Were just left alone so that enabled her to defend yourself</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.820" end="01:39:11.909" style="s2">so she was afraid that the crowd would push her to do something that</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.010" end="01:39:14.880" style="s2">She didn&#39;t want to do that was part of the theme of the dream</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.040" end="01:39:15.810" style="s2">So anyway</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.810" end="01:39:16.239" style="s2">she</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.239" end="01:39:18.159" style="s2">Eventually climbed the dune in her imagination</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.159" end="01:39:22.529" style="s2">And went into the crowd and the crowd turned out to be quite welcoming and not hostile and not pushy</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.690" end="01:39:27.029" style="s2">Which isn&#39;t what you&#39;d expect right because the you&#39;d think the crowd would have,</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.730" end="01:39:34.139" style="s2">Reacted in accordance with her fears since it was her fantasy, but that&#39;s the thing about fantasies. They have this autonomous quality</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.389" end="01:39:39.449" style="s2">But the crowd was welcoming and not hostile and it turned out that the snake handler wasn&#39;t a Charlatan</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.820" end="01:39:42.659" style="s2">He was just an old guy who had this snake and he was out there</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.880" end="01:39:46.589" style="s2">just showing it to people because he thought it was a cool thing and and</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.929" end="01:39:52.469" style="s2">And that maybe it was good for people to come and look at a snake and so she got close enough to the snake to</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.469" end="01:39:54.219" style="s2">touch it and so</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.219" end="01:39:59.279" style="s2">So I&#39;m telling you that because I want you to understand a bit more about what jung was trying to do and so</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.590" end="01:40:01.590" style="s2">He wrote these books</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.739" end="01:40:07.859" style="s2">notebooks that haven&#39;t been published yet called the black books and the black books are the</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.349" end="01:40:10.769" style="s2">documentation of his experiments with his imagination</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.320" end="01:40:12.670" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.670" end="01:40:18.840" style="s2">What he would do is he dream like a child daydreams. He regained that faculty although</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.840" end="01:40:21.569" style="s2">I think with Jung it was a faculty that had never really disappeared and</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.900" end="01:40:28.139" style="s2">he had figures of imagination that came to him that he could speak with and</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.420" end="01:40:35.819" style="s2">He spoke with these figures of imagination and documented that over a very long period of time, and that was originally that was</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.340" end="01:40:38.340" style="s2">eventually</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.550" end="01:40:44.489" style="s2">Distilled into a book called the red book which was published about three or four years ago</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.490" end="01:40:47.760" style="s2">and it was a book that jung regarded as the</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.660" end="01:40:52.740" style="s2">Central source from which all his inspiration</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.710" end="01:40:55.390" style="s2">emerged</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.390" end="01:40:58.320" style="s2">it was sort of the way it looks to me is that</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.410" end="01:41:04.860" style="s2">we embody a lot of information in our action right and our action has</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.500" end="01:41:11.070" style="s2">Developed as a consequence of imitating other people and not only the people the people around us</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.070" end="01:41:16.650" style="s2">But of course the people around us imitated the people who came before them and those people imitated the people who came before them</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.650" end="01:41:24.239" style="s2">And so on so far back that it&#39;s as far back as you can go and so you embody these patterns of behavior that are</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.430" end="01:41:31.139" style="s2">Extremely informative that you don&#39;t understand that are a consequence of collective imitation across the centuries and so then those</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.240" end="01:41:37.349" style="s2">patterns can become manifest as figures of the imagination and those figures of</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.780" end="01:41:41.280" style="s2">imagination are the distillation of patterns of behavior and</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.220" end="01:41:43.540" style="s2">so as</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.540" end="01:41:51.240" style="s2">The distillation of patterns of behavior they have content and it&#39;s not you that content. It&#39;s you could even think about it as content</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.240" end="01:41:52.380" style="s2">That&#39;s evolves although</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.380" end="01:41:54.100" style="s2">It&#39;s culturally transmitted this</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.100" end="01:42:00.809" style="s2">content that&#39;s evolved and so these figures of the imagination can reveal the structure of reality to you and</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.330" end="01:42:06.120" style="s2">That&#39;s what happened with jung, and that&#39;s what he described in the red book, and that was what permeated his</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.970" end="01:42:08.650" style="s2">psychology, A</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.650" end="01:42:10.650" style="s2">Psychology that was based on the presupposition</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.050" end="01:42:16.769" style="s2">That the fundamental archetypal structures of religious belief were not</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.380" end="01:42:19.859" style="s2">pathological not deceitful not</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.680" end="01:42:27.420" style="s2">Protective in some delusional sense against the fear of death, but quite the contrary the very stories that in</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.930" end="01:42:30.479" style="s2">enabled us to move forward as</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.210" end="01:42:34.770" style="s2">confident human beings in the face of Chaos itself</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.950" end="01:42:39.539" style="s2">And it&#39;s conceivable. I think perhaps probable</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.810" end="01:42:42.810" style="s2">That nothing more important</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.420" end="01:42:47.219" style="s2">Conceptually happened in the 20th century than that</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.190" end="01:42:50.190" style="s2">Because it was the first time</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.440" end="01:42:52.300" style="s2">post enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.300" end="01:42:54.300" style="s2">that a rapprochement between</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.640" end="01:42:56.640" style="s2">the intellect and the underlying</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.430" end="01:42:59.430" style="s2">religious archetypal sub structure</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.890" end="01:43:06.390" style="s2">Occurred you have in the capacious intellect of young the same thing happened to some degree with Piaget</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.030" end="01:43:10.949" style="s2">the religious domain and the factual domain were brought back together and</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.460" end="01:43:15.060" style="s2">the fact of Jung&#39;s enduring and</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.790" end="01:43:20.729" style="s2">Increasing popularity and influence, I would say is a direct consequence of that now</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.980" end="01:43:26.880" style="s2">some of his work was spun off into the new age and</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.550" end="01:43:31.380" style="s2">And the new age is a very optimistic and naive movement</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.510" end="01:43:36.780" style="s2">It&#39;s predicated on the idea that you can do nothing say, but follow your bliss and that will take you</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.450" end="01:43:41.970" style="s2">Ever higher to enlightenment, and that&#39;s not the Jungian idea at all</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.180" end="01:43:45.180" style="s2">the Jungian idea is that</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.000" end="01:43:49.320" style="s2">What you most need will be found where you least want to look</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.470" end="01:43:52.410" style="s2">So there&#39;s this story king arthur</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.410" end="01:43:58.079" style="s2">There&#39;s this story of king arthur that they&#39;re all in a round table right king arthur and his knights. They&#39;re all equals. They&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.630" end="01:44:02.189" style="s2">superordinate, but they&#39;re all equals and they go off to look for the holy Grail and</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.740" end="01:44:08.610" style="s2">The holy Grail is the container of the redemptive substance whatever that is</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.460" end="01:44:13.650" style="s2">It might be the cup that christ used at the last supper might be</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.320" end="01:44:20.429" style="s2">Chalice that was used to capture his blood on the cross right when he was pierced by a sword the stories differ</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.500" end="01:44:22.950" style="s2">But that&#39;s the holy grail and the holy grail is lost</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.950" end="01:44:28.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the redemptive substance and the knights of king arthur go off to search for the holy Grail and</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.420" end="01:44:30.220" style="s2">But they don&#39;t know where to look</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.220" end="01:44:34.260" style="s2">So where do you look when you don&#39;t know where to look for something you need?</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.260" end="01:44:36.760" style="s2">desperately</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.760" end="01:44:38.530" style="s2">But have lost</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.530" end="01:44:42.749" style="s2">well each of the knights goes into the forest at the point of the Darkest to him and</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.870" end="01:44:46.289" style="s2">That&#39;s Jungian psychoanalysis in a nutshell</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.140" end="01:44:54.269" style="s2">It&#39;s like that which you fear and avoid that&#39;s what you hold in contempt that which disgusts you and that you avoid</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.880" end="01:44:57.269" style="s2">That&#39;s the Gateway to what you need to know</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.330" end="01:45:01.229" style="s2">There&#39;s nothing new age about that. That&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.010" end="01:45:10.079" style="s2">Now Jung when he started this endeavor, He started with this this is part of the notebooks from the black book he said</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.100" end="01:45:14.100" style="s2">He wrote my soul</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.140" end="01:45:19.829" style="s2">For my soul. Where are you? Do you hear me? I speak I call you are you there?</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.680" end="01:45:22.680" style="s2">I&#39;ve returned I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.780" end="01:45:29.189" style="s2">Here again, I&#39;ve Shaken the dust of all the lands from my feet, and I&#39;ve come to you. I am with you</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.920" end="01:45:32.549" style="s2">After long years of long wandering I have come to you again</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.890" end="01:45:37.890" style="s2">for the Jungians the</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.930" end="01:45:41.760" style="s2">Hero&#39;s journey is a journey within and and I think that that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.850" end="01:45:44.020" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.020" end="01:45:49.170" style="s2">Bias of introverts to believe that the Hero&#39;s journey isn&#39;t only an inward Journey</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.170" end="01:45:55.799" style="s2">I think that it can be an outward journey too because I don&#39;t think it matters where you confront the unknown whether it&#39;s within or</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.800" end="01:46:01.679" style="s2">Without what matters is whether or not you confront the unknown. That&#39;s what matters</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.300" end="01:46:09.479" style="s2">But he found that what he had ignored</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.810" end="01:46:15.720" style="s2">Was an undiscovered part of himself so that might be something that was equivalent to huxley&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.660" end="01:46:19.160" style="s2">Notion that there were tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.440" end="01:46:25.340" style="s2">Tremendous Potential breath in the realm of human Conscious experience and Huxley was influenced to some degree by Jung</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.160" end="01:46:32.960" style="s2">now Jung knew of Huxley&#39;s experiments and had commented on psychedelic use and he said something like</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.580" end="01:46:35.880" style="s2">Beware of wisdom you did not earn and</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.210" end="01:46:44.010" style="s2">Jung was very good at stating things very profoundly very simply and that&#39;s a very intelligent piece of advice Beware of</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.560" end="01:46:46.560" style="s2">Wisdom you did not earn he wrote a paper</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.170" end="01:46:53.729" style="s2">If you&#39;re interested in this sort of thing he wrote a paper be called the relations between the ego and the unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.890" end="01:46:59.639" style="s2">Which is an absolute masterwork, but completely incomprehensible unless you know what it unless you know what it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.639" end="01:47:04.439" style="s2">And what it&#39;s about is the danger of what he called ego inflation</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.440" end="01:47:08.429" style="s2">And so one of the things that can happen as a consequence of a revelatory experience is</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.159" end="01:47:11.159" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.170" end="01:47:16.349" style="s2">Division between the individual ego and and and what would you call it?</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.989" end="01:47:18.989" style="s2">So hard to come up with a word that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.659" end="01:47:21.659" style="s2">somehow naive or</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.790" end="01:47:23.790" style="s2">or cliched</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.610" end="01:47:31.290" style="s2">To erase the relationship the boundary between the specific consciousness of the ego and the more generalized</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.139" end="01:47:33.340" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.340" end="01:47:36.480" style="s2">And more generalized consciousness as such is</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.119" end="01:47:44.339" style="s2">A dangerous thing to do because you can start to equate yourself your specific self with that more generalized</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.010" end="01:47:51.030" style="s2">consciousness as such and Jung thought about that is it something akin to a psychotic inflation and</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.820" end="01:47:59.579" style="s2">the paper relations between the ego and the unconscious is a document that tells you how to avoid that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.650" end="01:48:04.650" style="s2">playing in this kind of realm and</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.770" end="01:48:07.360" style="s2">one of the</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.360" end="01:48:09.659" style="s2">Injunctions is to keep your feet on the ground</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.840" end="01:48:16.079" style="s2">He thought that was what partly what happened to Nietzsche was that Nietzsche wasn&#39;t grounded enough in life</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.079" end="01:48:22.649" style="s2">He wasn&#39;t grounded enough in Day-To-day rituals and routines and the mundane now you could debate whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.650" end="01:48:27.389" style="s2">That&#39;s the case whether or not that&#39;s a reasonable argument, but that was still what Jung believed</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.869" end="01:48:30.869" style="s2">Okay, so why am I telling you all this?</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.219" end="01:48:38.129" style="s2">I&#39;ll finish with this from December 1913 onward jung carried on in the same procedure</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.829" end="01:48:41.249" style="s2">Deliberately evoke a fantasy in a waking state</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.250" end="01:48:47.790" style="s2">And then entering into it as a drama these fantasies may be understood as a type of dramatized thinking in pictorial form in</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.460" end="01:48:53.669" style="s2">Retrospect he recalled that his scientific question was to see what took place when he switched off consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.579" end="01:48:56.579" style="s2">the example of dreams indicated the</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.650" end="01:48:58.320" style="s2">existence of background activity</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.320" end="01:49:05.219" style="s2">And he wanted to give this a possibility of emerging just as one does when taking mescaline. These journals are jung&#39;s contemporary?</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.590" end="01:49:13.410" style="s2">Contemporaneous clinical ledger to his most difficult experiment or what later describes as a voyage of discovery to the other pole of the world?</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.140" end="01:49:16.169" style="s2">You&#39;ll believe that we were dreaming all the time</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.960" end="01:49:22.800" style="s2">but that during waking life the pressure of external images was such that the</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.830" end="01:49:30.570" style="s2">Unconscious fantasy imagery was or that the fantasy imagery was of insufficient magnitude to be conscious</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.570" end="01:49:34.199" style="s2">But that we were always situated in a dream in relationship to the world</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.020" end="01:49:37.020" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.140" end="01:49:46.140" style="s2">When we started talking about</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.650" end="01:49:55.469" style="s2">The creation of the universe at the beginning of the genesis stories, I spent quite a long time setting the stage for the stories because</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.650" end="01:50:01.139" style="s2">There&#39;s no point in having a conversation about the God who gives rise to being</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.690" end="01:50:07.380" style="s2">Unless you have some sense of what that might conceivably mean to the modern mind, and I felt the same way about</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.590" end="01:50:11.849" style="s2">the Abrahamic stories is I couldn&#39;t get a handle on them</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.670" end="01:50:15.780" style="s2">Until I could understand and articulate more clearly</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.480" end="01:50:18.370" style="s2">What it might mean?</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.370" end="01:50:21.390" style="s2">how a modern person might understand a</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.380" end="01:50:26.369" style="s2">direct experience of God in the first question would be</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.130" end="01:50:30.839" style="s2">is such a thing possible and the answer to that seems to be a</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.780" end="01:50:35.729" style="s2">Qualified yes, first of all it&#39;s a universal human experience. That&#39;s a very strange thing</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.130" end="01:50:43.589" style="s2">It&#39;s not something that people have made up as freud might have it as a defense against death. It&#39;s not a tenable hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.590" end="01:50:49.709" style="s2">it&#39;s a realm of potential experience now that experience doesn&#39;t necessarily have to have the</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.230" end="01:50:53.669" style="s2">Judeo-Christian content that we&#39;ve been discussing quite the contrary there are</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.460" end="01:51:00.360" style="s2">Manifestations of this these alternative forms of consciousness all over the world that take on their own peculiar forms although</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.360" end="01:51:01.620" style="s2">They&#39;re patterned to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.620" end="01:51:07.169" style="s2">that&#39;s like the hero myth for example of myth of the fight against the dragon seems to be unbelievably widespread and</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.420" end="01:51:09.420" style="s2">So it&#39;s not as if it&#39;s random</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.120" end="01:51:15.180" style="s2">Sorry, I should just see what time it is here</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.750" end="01:51:26.149" style="s2">But there&#39;s not much point in having a discussion about what happens to abraham</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.820" end="01:51:32.779" style="s2">Unless you can conceptualize it in terms that are amenable to modern skeptical consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.880" end="01:51:34.880" style="s2">So we can establish the proposition that</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.429" end="01:51:37.340" style="s2">Mystical experience is not only possible It&#39;s quite common</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.160" end="01:51:45.760" style="s2">and It&#39;s inducible in a variety of ways and the manner in which it&#39;s inducible is reliable and there&#39;s no evidence as well that it&#39;s pathological</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.989" end="01:51:51.829" style="s2">In fact there&#39;s a fair bit of evidence that the patterns of behavior that are associated with the mystical experience are</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.080" end="01:51:55.069" style="s2">core elements of proper Human adaptation in the world</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.239" end="01:52:26.158" style="s2">The abrahamic stories open up with a manifest God now I&#39;m going to read you some things from Friedman who wrote the disappearance of God</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.059" end="01:52:33.059" style="s2">He was trying to look at the underlying structure of the stories now. You know Friedman noted that</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.909" end="01:52:36.689" style="s2">The books in the old testament were written by a lot of different people</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.389" end="01:52:44.969" style="s2">At very different times and then they were sequenced by other people for reasons that we don&#39;t exactly understand</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.270" end="01:52:48.929" style="s2">But there&#39;s still an underlying narrative</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.929" end="01:52:56.069" style="s2">There&#39;s multiple underlying narrative unities despite the fact of that rather arbitrary sequencing, and that&#39;s a strange thing</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.710" end="01:52:58.710" style="s2">You know I guess you could say</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.809" end="01:53:03.659" style="s2">If you had a collection of ancient books and you were trying to put them together you&#39;d try to put them together in some way</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.659" end="01:53:05.349" style="s2">that made sense</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.349" end="01:53:11.609" style="s2">right and it wouldn&#39;t make sense unless you stumbled across some kind of underlying narrative that allowed you to order them and</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.920" end="01:53:17.040" style="s2">So it&#39;s not entirely surprising that that they&#39;re ordered in a manner that&#39;s comprehensible, but</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.739" end="01:53:20.549" style="s2">Friedman&#39;s comments on the Underlying narrative structure</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.030" end="01:53:23.710" style="s2">part of it was</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.710" end="01:53:29.790" style="s2">well, we&#39;ll go through this the books of the old testament were composed by a great many authors according to both traditional religious views in</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.790" end="01:53:35.459" style="s2">Modern Critical scholarship the phenomenon of the diminishing apparent presence of God across so many stories</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.710" end="01:53:39.779" style="s2">Through so many books by so many authors spread over so many centuries is</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.270" end="01:53:43.859" style="s2">Consistent enough to be striking impressive and ultimately mysterious</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.760" end="01:53:48.510" style="s2">But the hiding of the divine face is only half the story</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.550" end="01:53:53.279" style="s2">There&#39;s another development also extending across the course of the entire narrative of the Hebrew Bible</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.679" end="01:53:57.598" style="s2">which we must see before we can appreciate the full force of this phenomena and</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.000" end="01:54:02.399" style="s2">before we can pose a solution to the mystery of this of how this happened gradually from</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.530" end="01:54:08.190" style="s2">Genesis to Ezra and Esther there is a transition from Divine to human responsibility for life on Earth</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.639" end="01:54:13.409" style="s2">the story begins in Genesis with God in complete control of the creation</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.409" end="01:54:19.589" style="s2">But by the end humans have arrived at a stage at which in all apparent ways they have responsibility for the fate of the world</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.650" end="01:54:22.650" style="s2">the first two human beings</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.099" end="01:54:31.259" style="s2">Adam and Eve. Take little responsibility themselves they do not design or build anything when they&#39;re embarrassed over there nudity</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.260" end="01:54:36.690" style="s2">They do not make clothes they cover themselves with leaves. It&#39;s God who makes their first clothing for them</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.260" end="01:54:39.430" style="s2">Noah</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.430" end="01:54:44.039" style="s2">By no means a fully developed personality Noah is not an everyman either broadly speaking</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.080" end="01:54:47.309" style="s2">He reflects a step Beyond Adam and eve in human character and responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.420" end="01:54:50.620" style="s2">Abraham</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.620" end="01:54:57.030" style="s2">Beyond the counts of Divine commands that abraham does carry out the narrative also includes a variety of stories in Which abraham</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.310" end="01:55:00.930" style="s2">Acts on his own initiative he divides land with his nephew lot</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.930" end="01:55:05.639" style="s2">He battles kings he takes concubines he argues with his wife Sarah on two occasions</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.640" end="01:55:10.470" style="s2">he tells kings that Sarah is his sister out of fear that they will kill him to get his wife and</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.630" end="01:55:15.059" style="s2">He arranges in son&#39;s marriage in the place of the single story of Noah&#39;s drunkenness</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.060" end="01:55:17.640" style="s2">There are in the case of Abraham the stories of man&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.520" end="01:55:22.620" style="s2">The Abraham section thus develops the personality and character of a man a man</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.780" end="01:55:29.340" style="s2">To a new degree in biblical narrative while picturing in him a new degree of responsibility it is not just that Abraham is kind lured</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.410" end="01:55:34.170" style="s2">Kinder gentler More Intrepid more ethical or a better debater than his ancestor, Noah?</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.540" end="01:55:41.460" style="s2">Rather both the Noah and the Abraham stories are pieces of a development of an increasingly stronger stance of humans relative to the deity</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.710" end="01:55:46.379" style="s2">Before the story is over humans will become a great deal stronger and bolder than abraham</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.170" end="01:55:57.170" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what that means you know</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.050" end="01:56:01.050" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.060" end="01:56:03.810" style="s2">It isn&#39;t it is certainly the case that</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.360" end="01:56:08.460" style="s2">the individual exists in the Modern world the differentiated</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.830" end="01:56:14.759" style="s2">Self-Aware self conscious individual and it&#39;s certainly the case that that wasn&#39;t the case at some point in the past and</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.920" end="01:56:16.920" style="s2">So it&#39;s the case that there&#39;s been a development</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.020" end="01:56:19.350" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you could call it a progression</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.350" end="01:56:25.410" style="s2">But a development of the autonomous individual over some span of historical time now</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.410" end="01:56:29.780" style="s2">We don&#39;t know how long that&#39;s been but my suspicions are it hasn&#39;t been that long</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.420" end="01:56:32.420" style="s2">I mean,</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.940" end="01:56:35.940" style="s2">I read once</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.429" end="01:56:44.219" style="s2">about a neolithic ceremony that involved the particular placement of a bear skull in a cave, and then I read that and</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.100" end="01:56:50.069" style="s2">They had found these placements in caves that were at least 25,000 years old</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.070" end="01:56:50.570" style="s2">And then I read that they found caves in Japan among the Ainu</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.570" end="01:56:54.090" style="s2">who were</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.219" end="01:56:59.129" style="s2">the indigenous inhabitants of Japanese territory and Rather Archaic people who</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.230" end="01:57:04.049" style="s2">Had the same ceremony with the bear and that put the skull in the same orientation</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.330" end="01:57:09.899" style="s2">And place in caves and that that tradition remained unbroken for about 25,000 years</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.900" end="01:57:11.190" style="s2">And you think:</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.190" end="01:57:15.060" style="s2">Well is it possible for an oral or ritual tradition to remain unbroken for?</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.310" end="01:57:20.609" style="s2">Spans of tens of thousands of years and the answer to that is not only is it possible. It&#39;s actually the norm</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.370" end="01:57:22.900" style="s2">because like</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.900" end="01:57:27.779" style="s2">One Chimpanzee is like the next chimpanzee right in the in the progression in the biological</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.060" end="01:57:33.719" style="s2">Progression if you took a chimpanzee troop now, and he went back 25,000 years and you looked at a chimpanzee troop</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.719" end="01:57:35.879" style="s2">It&#39;d be the same thing. There&#39;s no historical progression</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.550" end="01:57:38.940" style="s2">That&#39;s how you can tell the chimps really don&#39;t have culture</p>
<p begin="01:57:39.400" end="01:57:45.779" style="s2">Because it&#39;s bigger it could even accrete one one thousandth of a percent of culture transmissible culture per generation</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.270" end="01:57:48.989" style="s2">It wouldn&#39;t take more than about a million years before</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.989" end="01:57:49.989" style="s2">They&#39;d have a whole civilization</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.989" end="01:57:57.839" style="s2">And they don&#39;t they&#39;re the same as they were and so the continuity the stability and unchanging nature of the species</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.350" end="01:58:03.179" style="s2">Essentially speaking is the rule that the variant is us</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.880" end="01:58:06.390" style="s2">It&#39;s like what the hell happened after the last ice age</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.030" end="01:58:09.030" style="s2">fifteen thousand years ago</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.030" end="01:58:11.030" style="s2">We went from Tribal</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.320" end="01:58:16.650" style="s2">Uniform stable to whatever the hell. We are now it&#39;s this transition from</p>
<p begin="01:58:18.370" end="01:58:23.400" style="s2">Generic to specific, it&#39;s something like that, and I can&#39;t help but think that that&#39;s reflective in this text</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.400" end="01:58:27.239" style="s2">and it has something to do with this transition of consciousness from</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.540" end="01:58:34.830" style="s2">From what from possession by the Generic divine to dominance by the specific individual?</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.840" end="01:58:37.949" style="s2">It&#39;s something like that. Is that a neurological transformation?</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.950" end="01:58:43.829" style="s2">is that what this is a record of being that we don&#39;t know one of the things young said about God because</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.290" end="01:58:49.320" style="s2">Humans relationship with God as an object of belief is very complex</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.400" end="01:58:53.040" style="s2">He in his technical writing</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.040" end="01:58:57.000" style="s2">He always talks about the image of God he never talks about God he talks about the image of God</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.280" end="01:59:04.949" style="s2">He said that the image of God dwells within that&#39;s not the same thing as God dwelling within right we could mean all of these</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.860" end="01:59:11.819" style="s2">Capacities that we have for transcended consciousness could be a byproduct of biological evolution they could have no reflection</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.820" end="01:59:16.590" style="s2">They could have no relationship whatsoever to an actual transcendent reality</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.660" end="01:59:22.079" style="s2">There&#39;s no way of telling the transcendent reality seems to manifest itself as an element of experience</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.080" end="01:59:24.870" style="s2">But that doesn&#39;t mean that it has in reality outside of the subjective</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.270" end="01:59:29.219" style="s2">even if it&#39;s even if it exists as it is it clearly does but</p>

<p begin="01:59:48.670" end="01:59:50.170" style="s2">Force and</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.170" end="01:59:52.409" style="s2">that the old testament documents that</p>

<p begin="01:59:57.430" end="02:00:00.750" style="s2">Descriptive fantasy and that that&#39;s what&#39;s going on in the book and that</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.440" end="02:00:05.250" style="s2">so the cosmos is under the control of</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.670" end="02:00:11.849" style="s2">Generic Deity to begin with something like that and then that control shifts to</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.480" end="02:00:15.480" style="s2">localized identifiable</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.880" end="02:00:18.569" style="s2">increasingly personal and detailed individuals</p>

<p begin="02:00:24.630" end="02:00:31.730" style="s2">Then there&#39;s this working out of what it would mean to be a fully developed individual, and that&#39;s what these stories. They&#39;re...</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.400" end="02:00:35.660" style="s2">They&#39;re like prototype, they&#39;re attempts to...</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.060" end="02:00:42.950" style="s2">To bring about the proper mode of being right and so Abraham is a is a manifestation about because he enters into a covenant with</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.950" end="02:00:48.019" style="s2">God he&#39;s selected by God or enters into a partnership with God. It&#39;s not exactly obvious. God</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.110" end="02:00:52.640" style="s2">provides him with forward motion and intuition and</p>
<p begin="02:00:53.640" end="02:01:00.439" style="s2">Leads them towards a successful mode of being and it&#39;s complex successful mode of being cuz Abraham is a very complex life</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.440" end="02:01:03.050" style="s2">There&#39;s plenty of ups and downs right it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="02:01:14.670" end="02:01:20.300" style="s2">And moses for example kills someone and so these people that the biblical people are very</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.820" end="02:01:26.479" style="s2">Genuine individuals, but they&#39;re given with all their faults right with all their sins with all their deceit</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.480" end="02:01:31.730" style="s2">They&#39;re still put forth as potential modes of proper models of potential</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.130" end="02:01:35.150" style="s2">proper being in the world and the entire corpus of the</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.850" end="02:01:40.910" style="s2">Bible seems to be nothing but an attempt to keep throwing up variants of the</p>

<p begin="02:01:48.330" end="02:01:53.840" style="s2">of course from a Christian perspective that culminates in the figure of christ as the redemptive word and that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="02:02:05.640" end="02:02:07.640" style="s2">well, that&#39;s my attempt to</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.220" end="02:02:13.010" style="s2">provide proper context for the understanding of the abrahamic stories</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.010" end="02:02:18.050" style="s2">And so hopefully with that context we can move forward</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.750" end="02:02:20.250" style="s2">being able to</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.250" end="02:02:26.419" style="s2">swallow the camel so to speak of the initial presence of God in the stories and</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.210" end="02:02:30.470" style="s2">So we&#39;ll return to all of that next week</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.530" end="02:02:51.429" style="s2">Let&#39;s wait one second. Okay till people</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.250" end="02:02:53.560" style="s2">Have an opportunity to leave</p>
<p begin="02:02:53.560" end="02:02:57.100" style="s2">I would very much like to ask the people who are asking the questions</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.320" end="02:03:02.620" style="s2">To take a few seconds before they ask the question and make sure that the mic is positioned properly</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.989" end="02:03:09.279" style="s2">So that everyone can hear you because people keep writing and complaining that while they&#39;re very happy with the questions</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.280" end="02:03:14.530" style="s2">And I would say the questions have been a very high caliber so far, but they&#39;re not very happy that they can&#39;t hear them</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.570" end="02:03:19.929" style="s2">So I know that you know you&#39;re obviously nervous and in a hurry when you want to ask you a question</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.929" end="02:03:21.860" style="s2">but take a second or two to</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.860" end="02:03:25.420" style="s2">Set the mic up properly and make sure that everyone can hear you and so</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.440" end="02:03:27.480" style="s2">Have a way at it.</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.660" end="02:03:28.520" style="s2">&quot;Hello Dr. Peterson&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:03:28.700" end="02:03:30.100" style="s2">Hey, there we go</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.100" end="02:03:36.640" style="s2">&quot;Tonight, I&#39;d like to ask you about two different psychological disorders the first being Borderline personality disorder</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.060" end="02:03:39.060" style="s2">so two lectures ago</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.710" end="02:03:43.480" style="s2">Somebody asks you about it, and you gave a very sparse answer</p>
<p begin="02:03:43.480" end="02:03:47.799" style="s2">I can&#39;t remember exactly what you said, but it seemed like it was uh</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.800" end="02:03:54.850" style="s2">It would there was too much complexity to just answer it right there and then and then somebody else also acts</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.949" end="02:03:56.949" style="s2">Asked you about the same disorder in</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.409" end="02:04:04.989" style="s2">your patreon livestream recently and when they when they asked you that you kind of you kind of Stopped for a moment and</p>
<p begin="02:04:05.510" end="02:04:08.409" style="s2">Something I don&#39;t know something kind of flicked on in your head</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.510" end="02:04:12.159" style="s2">It seemed like and you and you thought for a couple seconds</p>
<p begin="02:04:12.159" end="02:04:14.159" style="s2">And then you said you know what I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.239" end="02:04:21.369" style="s2">That I can answer that right now because just - it&#39;s just too bloody complex, and I was wondering just like</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.489" end="02:04:29.889" style="s2">Many young men have gravitated towards your lectures. Do you think that there&#39;s something about this particular disorder that</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.670" end="02:04:37.089" style="s2">There&#39;s something about people with this particular disorder that might gravitate to your insights and your lectures&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.730" end="02:04:44.919" style="s2">Okay, okay, so now I would say probably no to the second one, but I could comment more about Borderline personality disorder</p>
<p begin="02:04:44.920" end="02:04:48.009" style="s2">I think I have enough mental energy to do that tonight, so</p>
<p begin="02:04:49.310" end="02:04:50.900" style="s2">technically speaking</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.900" end="02:04:55.420" style="s2">It&#39;s often considered the female variant of antisocial personality disorder</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.510" end="02:04:58.840" style="s2">So it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s classified</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.880" end="02:05:05.179" style="s2">or it&#39;s classified in the domain of externalizing disorders acting out disorders and</p>
<p begin="02:05:05.790" end="02:05:07.790" style="s2">I think what happens,</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.099" end="02:05:12.709" style="s2">We don&#39;t understand Borderline personality disorder very well, and it&#39;s characterized by</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.800" end="02:05:15.800" style="s2">Tremendous impulsivity</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.810" end="02:05:20.810" style="s2">Radical confusion of identity</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.540" end="02:05:24.919" style="s2">and then this pattern of idealization of</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.739" end="02:05:27.739" style="s2">people with whom the</p>
<p begin="02:05:28.679" end="02:05:30.679" style="s2">person afflicted with the disorder is</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.679" end="02:05:36.199" style="s2">Associating with radical idealization of those people and then radical devaluation of them</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.199" end="02:05:39.829" style="s2">and then there&#39;s another theme that sort of weaves along with it, which is</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.380" end="02:05:42.380" style="s2">the proclivity of</p>
<p begin="02:05:42.810" end="02:05:47.449" style="s2">people with Borderline personality disorder to presume that they will be abandoned and</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.060" end="02:05:52.279" style="s2">then to act in a manner that makes such abandonment virtually certain and</p>
<p begin="02:05:53.429" end="02:05:55.429" style="s2">So it&#39;s a very complicated</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.400" end="02:05:58.400" style="s2">disorder, but that I</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.800" end="02:06:00.800" style="s2">Think gets at the Crux of it</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.590" end="02:06:07.310" style="s2">One of the things that&#39;s interesting about people with Borderline personality disorder in my experience. Is that they&#39;re often</p>
<p begin="02:06:08.190" end="02:06:10.190" style="s2">quite intelligent and</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.070" end="02:06:13.820" style="s2">You you see in the person with Borderline personality</p>
<p begin="02:06:14.460" end="02:06:18.889" style="s2">Disorder something like the waste or the squandering of tremendous potential</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.040" end="02:06:22.040" style="s2">they seem capable of</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.590" end="02:06:24.949" style="s2">thinking through the Nature of their problems and</p>
<p begin="02:06:25.530" end="02:06:30.679" style="s2">analyzing it and discussing it but not capable whatsoever of implementing any solutions and</p>
<p begin="02:06:41.530" end="02:06:45.090" style="s2">Technically, there&#39;s no relationship between IQ and conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="02:06:46.270" end="02:06:48.220" style="s2">It&#39;s very weird</p>
<p begin="02:06:48.220" end="02:06:51.599" style="s2">because if you read the neuropsychological literature and you</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.510" end="02:06:57.239" style="s2">Read about the functions of the prefrontal Cortex. They&#39;re usually conceptualized in intellectual terms and</p>
<p begin="02:06:57.940" end="02:07:01.560" style="s2">they&#39;re associated with planning and strategizing and so forth and</p>
<p begin="02:07:04.690" end="02:07:08.819" style="s2">That&#39;s what conscientiousness is is planning and strategizing and implementation?</p>
<p begin="02:07:08.820" end="02:07:16.260" style="s2">But the correlation between IQ and conscientiousness is zero and so as the correlation between working memory and conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="02:07:16.690" end="02:07:18.250" style="s2">zero and Zero</p>
<p begin="02:07:18.250" end="02:07:24.899" style="s2">Is a very low correlation right? I mean really it&#39;s hard to find things in psychology that are correlated at zero</p>
<p begin="02:07:25.900" end="02:07:28.950" style="s2">Things tend to be correlated to some degree. They tend to be interrelated</p>
<p begin="02:07:30.520" end="02:07:38.069" style="s2">the Borderline seems to be able to strategize and to abstract but not to be able to implement and</p>
<p begin="02:07:39.070" end="02:07:44.130" style="s2">And so this the intellect per se seems to be functional</p>
<p begin="02:07:44.130" end="02:07:47.160" style="s2">But it&#39;s not embodied in action</p>
<p begin="02:07:48.220" end="02:07:50.220" style="s2">It&#39;s very so it can be</p>
<p begin="02:07:50.440" end="02:07:54.210" style="s2">frustrating to be associated with someone who has borderline personality disorder because</p>
<p begin="02:07:54.490" end="02:08:00.479" style="s2">They can tell you what the problem is and even tell you what the solution might be but there&#39;s no implementation</p>
<p begin="02:08:03.100" end="02:08:05.789" style="s2">So maybe something went wrong developmentally</p>
<p begin="02:08:05.800" end="02:08:12.390" style="s2">We don&#39;t know exactly how these sorts of things come about the other thing that seems to be characteristic of Borderline people with Borderline personality</p>
<p begin="02:08:12.820" end="02:08:17.640" style="s2">disorder is that they they remind me very much of people who are 2 years old and</p>
<p begin="02:08:18.190" end="02:08:20.190" style="s2">in some Manner like</p>
<p begin="02:08:20.680" end="02:08:22.120" style="s2">people with Borderline personality</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.120" end="02:08:27.629" style="s2">Disorder can have temper tantrums in fact they often do and we know now and then you see a temper tantrum</p>
<p begin="02:08:27.629" end="02:08:33.260" style="s2">And they&#39;re usually thrown by two-year-olds right most people go out of temper tantrums by the time they&#39;re about three</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.360" end="02:08:39.580" style="s2">They&#39;re very rare at four it. Which is a good thing because if they&#39;re still there at four that is not a good diagnostic predictor</p>
<p begin="02:08:40.200" end="02:08:44.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a actually good diagnostic predictor, but it&#39;s not the kind that you want and</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.700" end="02:08:52.259" style="s2">You know it&#39;s funny the way that we respond to two-year-old temper tantrums because the two-Year-old will throw themselves on the ground</p>
<p begin="02:08:52.710" end="02:08:57.570" style="s2">beat their hands and their legs on the floor and scream and yell and turn red or even blue</p>
<p begin="02:08:57.570" end="02:09:02.279" style="s2">I saw a child once who was capable of holding his breath during a temper tantrum until he turned blue</p>
<p begin="02:09:02.560" end="02:09:08.519" style="s2">Which was really an impressive feat you should try that right? It&#39;s really hard is you really have to work at it and</p>
<p begin="02:09:09.430" end="02:09:15.090" style="s2">You see that in adult borderlines. They&#39;ll have temper tantrums, and the funny thing is when a two-year-old does it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:09:15.090" end="02:09:17.020" style="s2">It&#39;s you know, it&#39;s little</p>
<p begin="02:09:17.020" end="02:09:18.040" style="s2">off-putting</p>
<p begin="02:09:18.040" end="02:09:20.280" style="s2">but when an adult does it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:09:20.770" end="02:09:27.450" style="s2">Completely bloody terrifying and it happens very frequently with borderlines, and so I would also say to some degree</p>
<p begin="02:09:27.970" end="02:09:32.880" style="s2">they didn&#39;t get properly socialized between that critical period Of development between two and four and you</p>
<p begin="02:09:33.190" end="02:09:36.240" style="s2">See the same thing with adult males who grow up to the anti-social</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.610" end="02:09:43.049" style="s2">Because a large proportion of adult males who grow up to be antisocial are aggressive as children as two-year-Olds</p>
<p begin="02:09:43.660" end="02:09:46.200" style="s2">So there&#39;s a small proportion of two-Year-olds who are quite aggressive</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.200" end="02:09:52.019" style="s2">They&#39;ll kick and hit and bite and steal if you put them with other two-year-olds it&#39;s about five percent of the of the Male&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.270" end="02:09:56.610" style="s2">Smaller fraction of the females, but most of them are socialized by the time, they&#39;re four</p>
<p begin="02:09:56.740" end="02:10:02.880" style="s2">but there&#39;s a small percentage who aren&#39;t and they tend to stay antisocial and they tend to turn into long term offenders and</p>
<p begin="02:10:03.160" end="02:10:09.510" style="s2">then attend the devel the critical period for socialization development seems to be between two and four and it seems to be mediated by</p>
<p begin="02:10:10.180" end="02:10:15.240" style="s2">pretend play and Rough-and-Tumble play and those sorts of mechanisms, and if it isn&#39;t instantiated by the age of four</p>
<p begin="02:10:15.970" end="02:10:21.150" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t happen, and it doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s addressable now there are</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.480" end="02:10:29.610" style="s2">dialectic behavioural therapies that have been developed for people with borderline personality disorder, and they&#39;re purported to be successful, but</p>
<p begin="02:10:31.510" end="02:10:34.380" style="s2">&quot;Okay, thank you. If I may so the second</p>
<p begin="02:10:35.140" end="02:10:37.740" style="s2">Psychological disorder I want to ask you about is psychopathy</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.260" end="02:10:40.260" style="s2">So you&#39;ve mentioned that</p>
<p begin="02:10:40.450" end="02:10:47.400" style="s2">Psychopaths tend to switch from dominance Hierarchy to dominance Hierarchy because people get tired of their shenanigans. They have to move on to fresh people</p>
<p begin="02:10:48.400" end="02:10:49.630" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="02:10:49.630" end="02:10:55.650" style="s2">Psychopaths also tend to be very low in conscientiousness, and you said that when you see some of these protesters</p>
<p begin="02:10:56.200" end="02:10:58.030" style="s2">at your speeches</p>
<p begin="02:10:58.030" end="02:11:00.030" style="s2">some of the men in particular,</p>
<p begin="02:11:00.220" end="02:11:01.810" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="02:11:01.810" end="02:11:09.149" style="s2">Clinical intuition tells you that there&#39;s something seriously pathological about them and I was wondering if you would suspect</p>
<p begin="02:11:09.489" end="02:11:11.489" style="s2">That some of these men might be</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.619" end="02:11:16.589" style="s2">Psychopathic as...&quot; well some of them likely are but I don&#39;t know if a higher proportion of the ones who show up at</p>
<p begin="02:11:16.690" end="02:11:18.389" style="s2">Protests and sort of creep me out</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.389" end="02:11:23.549" style="s2">Or I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a higher proportion of people like that at the protests or not</p>
<p begin="02:11:23.550" end="02:11:24.239" style="s2">I mean</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.239" end="02:11:31.678" style="s2">I suspect in general that regardless of the protest the proportion of people who have personality disorders among</p>
<p begin="02:11:31.960" end="02:11:36.029" style="s2">Protesters is higher than the proportion of people who have personality disorders in the general</p>
<p begin="02:11:36.159" end="02:11:42.239" style="s2">Population because you just expect that you just expect that kind of acting out behavior. I&#39;m not believe me</p>
<p begin="02:11:42.239" end="02:11:46.138" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that all protest is associated with personality disorder. I&#39;m not saying that at all</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.210" end="02:11:48.070" style="s2">There&#39;s plenty of reason for protest</p>
<p begin="02:11:48.070" end="02:11:50.369" style="s2">But some of the reason for protests are</p>
<p begin="02:11:50.829" end="02:11:56.159" style="s2">Credible reasons and some of them aren&#39;t credible reasons that -- &quot;I was just thinking that like the social justice</p>
<p begin="02:11:56.320" end="02:11:59.880" style="s2">Hierarchy so to speak would be one of the last that these</p>
<p begin="02:12:00.429" end="02:12:03.719" style="s2">Confusing--&quot;, that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a different issue. You know there are</p>
<p begin="02:12:04.869" end="02:12:09.149" style="s2">There are analysis of the dangers of agreeableness, so agreeable</p>
<p begin="02:12:09.150" end="02:12:12.119" style="s2">This is a personality trait that underlies the radical</p>
<p begin="02:12:12.550" end="02:12:17.460" style="s2">Egalitarian ethos because agreeable people want everything to be shared equally and it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="02:12:17.460" end="02:12:24.210" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a good ethos for a small group for a family because family is kind of a communist system in some sense</p>
<p begin="02:12:24.210" end="02:12:27.719" style="s2">Right it&#39;s like you want the food to be divided up equally among the children</p>
<p begin="02:12:28.179" end="02:12:30.989" style="s2">clearly and you want all the children sort of regardless of their</p>
<p begin="02:12:31.329" end="02:12:35.789" style="s2">Inherent abilities to have the same opportunities and perhaps even the same outcomes</p>
<p begin="02:12:35.860" end="02:12:39.869" style="s2">So I think agreeableness which is associated at least in part with maternal</p>
<p begin="02:12:40.389" end="02:12:45.299" style="s2">Maternal the Maternal Instinct let&#39;s say maternal patterns of Behavior. I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.059" end="02:12:48.059" style="s2">It&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="02:12:48.250" end="02:12:49.630" style="s2">first Pass</p>
<p begin="02:12:49.630" end="02:12:55.859" style="s2">Motivational approximation to a localized familial ethic I think it&#39;s a catastrophe at larger scales</p>
<p begin="02:12:55.860" end="02:13:00.569" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it scales at all. I actually think that&#39;s why we evolved conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="02:13:01.210" end="02:13:07.619" style="s2">Because conscientiousness is the principle that allows larger scale organizations to exist agreeableness won&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="02:13:08.260" end="02:13:09.489" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="02:13:09.489" end="02:13:13.019" style="s2">Conscientiousness is a mystery right we don&#39;t have a neurological model</p>
<p begin="02:13:13.719" end="02:13:15.719" style="s2">We don&#39;t have a conceptual model</p>
<p begin="02:13:15.760" end="02:13:22.230" style="s2">We don&#39;t have an animal model. We don&#39;t have a pharmacological model, and we really only have one way of assessing it which is</p>
<p begin="02:13:22.960" end="02:13:25.589" style="s2">self and other reports of personality proclivity</p>
<p begin="02:13:26.679" end="02:13:28.329" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="02:13:28.329" end="02:13:29.769" style="s2">anyways</p>
<p begin="02:13:29.769" end="02:13:34.739" style="s2">The problem with agreeableness. This has been modeled a game theorist is that a</p>
<p begin="02:13:35.679" end="02:13:40.709" style="s2">Population of cooperative people can be dominated by a single shark</p>
<p begin="02:13:42.969" end="02:13:47.819" style="s2">So agreeable this is insufficient as a principle because it opens itself up to</p>
<p begin="02:13:51.840" end="02:13:53.980" style="s2">you call that manipulation and</p>
<p begin="02:13:54.580" end="02:13:55.620" style="s2">&quot;infiltration?&quot;</p>

<p begin="02:14:02.040" end="02:14:08.060" style="s2">Manipulation let&#39;s let&#39;s leave it at that to manipulation and and and and exploitation. That&#39;s the other thing</p>
<p begin="02:14:09.070" end="02:14:10.239" style="s2">exploitation</p>
<p begin="02:14:10.240" end="02:14:12.240" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="02:14:12.820" end="02:14:14.820" style="s2">&quot;Thank you&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:14:18.880" end="02:14:24.660" style="s2">&quot;Hi, Dr. Peterson. I had one quick comment and a question so my comment was about your idea of but</p>
<p begin="02:14:25.269" end="02:14:31.289" style="s2">Subpersonalities as one-eyed monsters now. There&#39;s the idea of multiple personality or split personality disorder</p>
<p begin="02:14:31.289" end="02:14:34.169" style="s2">It&#39;s controversial as to whether or not it exists</p>
<p begin="02:14:34.170" end="02:14:40.559" style="s2">But there&#39;s some research recent research that suggests that you may actually have multiple personalities</p>
<p begin="02:14:41.019" end="02:14:45.748" style="s2">That use different parts of the brain so they have differential access to the hippocampus. They have their own memories</p>
<p begin="02:14:46.840" end="02:14:48.369" style="s2">They can</p>
<p begin="02:14:48.369" end="02:14:54.779" style="s2">they use the brain differently, but that seems to be an exaggeration of sub personalities</p>
<p begin="02:14:55.179" end="02:14:57.179" style="s2">Which is quite interesting.</p>
<p begin="02:14:57.429" end="02:14:59.429" style="s2">The question I had was about</p>
<p begin="02:14:59.800" end="02:15:01.920" style="s2">So you talked about Jung and how</p>
<p begin="02:15:03.699" end="02:15:07.768" style="s2">You should confront that which you don&#39;t want to confront the most</p>
<p begin="02:15:07.769" end="02:15:14.279" style="s2">so you&#39;re most afraid or disgusted by that you&#39;ve the most resistance to arm, so but we were talking about psychedelics and</p>
<p begin="02:15:14.590" end="02:15:16.590" style="s2">in the experience of hell, so</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.079" end="02:15:21.058" style="s2">at least some of the people I&#39;ve talked to they describe negative trips as</p>
<p begin="02:15:21.789" end="02:15:23.819" style="s2">an experience of a</p>
<p begin="02:15:25.360" end="02:15:27.659" style="s2">constant fear prolonged fear and</p>
<p begin="02:15:28.389" end="02:15:30.099" style="s2">some of the most</p>
<p begin="02:15:30.099" end="02:15:35.819" style="s2">Dramatic and personalized fear that they&#39;ve ever experienced; so shouldn&#39;t negative on</p>
<p begin="02:15:36.489" end="02:15:38.489" style="s2">psychedelic trips</p>
<p begin="02:15:38.619" end="02:15:43.679" style="s2">Elicit the kind of concentration that Jung thought you should engage them?&quot; Could be.</p>
<p begin="02:15:44.739" end="02:15:47.098" style="s2">Could could well be you know it</p>
<p begin="02:15:49.090" end="02:15:51.090" style="s2">It&#39;s conceivable that...</p>
<p begin="02:15:55.630" end="02:15:57.630" style="s2">I read this strange book once that</p>
<p begin="02:15:58.119" end="02:16:03.719" style="s2">made the claim that what was in the ark of the covenant was a mixture that was made from</p>
<p begin="02:16:04.539" end="02:16:06.539" style="s2">Amanita Muscaria mushrooms</p>
<p begin="02:16:07.400" end="02:16:09.460" style="s2">And that&#39;s not as far-fetched as you might think</p>
<p begin="02:16:10.000" end="02:16:14.460" style="s2">Because there&#39;s a mycologist an amateur mycologist named Gordon Wasson</p>
<p begin="02:16:15.120" end="02:16:16.520" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="02:16:16.539" end="02:16:20.909" style="s2">Established, credibly, the notion that it was Amanita Muscaria</p>
<p begin="02:16:21.519" end="02:16:25.559" style="s2">potions that was the soma of the Rig veda and</p>
<p begin="02:16:26.439" end="02:16:29.159" style="s2">so it&#39;s a strange idea but</p>
<p begin="02:16:30.550" end="02:16:35.099" style="s2">it&#39;s not an idea that&#39;s completely outside of the realm of possibility and</p>
<p begin="02:16:37.630" end="02:16:39.159" style="s2">the Amanita</p>
<p begin="02:16:39.159" end="02:16:46.709" style="s2">Muscaria is the fly agaric in the red mushroom with white dots, and it&#39;s used in shamanic rituals in Cross Asia</p>
<p begin="02:16:47.260" end="02:16:48.429" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="02:16:48.429" end="02:16:52.738" style="s2">It&#39;s apparently not toxic in its dried form although that is not a recommendation</p>
<p begin="02:16:54.189" end="02:16:56.908" style="s2">You know this is serious serious and dangerous</p>
<p begin="02:16:59.229" end="02:17:01.229" style="s2">speculation and material</p>
<p begin="02:17:01.929" end="02:17:05.009" style="s2">One of the things that the priests had to do</p>
<p begin="02:17:07.029" end="02:17:12.179" style="s2">before they commune with what was ever in the ark of the covenant was purify themselves and</p>
<p begin="02:17:13.239" end="02:17:15.599" style="s2">So one possibility is that?</p>
<p begin="02:17:16.269" end="02:17:18.040" style="s2">the bad</p>
<p begin="02:17:18.040" end="02:17:20.040" style="s2">psychedelic experience is a</p>
<p begin="02:17:21.189" end="02:17:22.779" style="s2">Involuntary</p>
<p begin="02:17:22.779" end="02:17:25.049" style="s2">Confrontation with what you would describe as the shadow</p>
<p begin="02:17:25.719" end="02:17:27.580" style="s2">It&#39;s like so</p>
<p begin="02:17:27.580" end="02:17:29.229" style="s2">Beware of</p>
<p begin="02:17:29.229" end="02:17:31.229" style="s2">experimenting with</p>
<p begin="02:17:33.010" end="02:17:37.559" style="s2">substances that produce divine revelations if you&#39;re in a serious state of disorder</p>
<p begin="02:17:37.559" end="02:17:42.539" style="s2">And I do think that is what happens to people is that they encounter?</p>
<p begin="02:17:43.960" end="02:17:46.500" style="s2">Everything about them that&#39;s chaotic and out of place.</p>
<p begin="02:17:46.500" end="02:17:52.400" style="s2">And some people get trapped in that and they can&#39;t get beyond it and that&#39;s because there&#39;s so much of it</p>
<p begin="02:17:53.040" end="02:17:55.040" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="02:17:55.179" end="02:17:57.179" style="s2">But we don&#39;t know enough to know</p>
<p begin="02:17:58.689" end="02:18:00.689" style="s2">so</p>

<p begin="02:18:17.920" end="02:18:21.750" style="s2">How are you?&quot; I&#39;m not too bad you got a question?</p>
<p begin="02:18:24.580" end="02:18:29.219" style="s2">&quot;That&#39;s the question. No I&#39;ve got a real question. I got a great question you&#39;re going to like this one, okay?</p>
<p begin="02:18:29.219" end="02:18:34.829" style="s2">It&#39;s about inspiration because you talk about inspiration quite a bit in this lecture series and also I wanted to point out</p>
<p begin="02:18:34.960" end="02:18:36.960" style="s2">you have a I guess a</p>
<p begin="02:18:37.300" end="02:18:43.520" style="s2">45-minute Armchair discussion, which you have a video of one paragraph of Nietzsche&#39;s Beyond good and evil</p>

<p begin="02:18:55.080" end="02:19:00.620" style="s2">And you&#39;re inspired and that inspires you to I guess do your work that you do..?</p>
<p begin="02:19:01.240" end="02:19:03.240" style="s2">I encountered, I guess a similar</p>

<p begin="02:19:34.660" end="02:19:42.539" style="s2">but itself is the in conclusiveness inherent in it the bounds it comes up against and that yet yearn for the</p>

<p begin="02:21:13.650" end="02:21:18.179" style="s2">but christ comes back with a sword coming out of his mouth and he comes back as a judge and he</p>
<p begin="02:21:19.090" end="02:21:23.190" style="s2">Divides the damned from the redeemed and most are damned and some are redeemed</p>
<p begin="02:21:23.190" end="02:21:29.249" style="s2">It&#39;s very very harsh Jung believed that the figure of christ in the gospels was too agreeable</p>
<p begin="02:21:29.680" end="02:21:34.470" style="s2">To merciful to tilted towards mercy and that that called out for a counter</p>
<p begin="02:21:34.630" end="02:21:39.089" style="s2">position and that the counter position of judgment very interesting hypothesis</p>
<p begin="02:21:39.399" end="02:21:45.028" style="s2">But then but then there&#39;s this this melding of the two ideas that the judge and the redeemer are the same thing</p>
<p begin="02:21:46.000" end="02:21:47.229" style="s2">Okay</p>
<p begin="02:21:47.229" end="02:21:48.520" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="02:21:48.520" end="02:21:51.720" style="s2">This young man told me that his life lacked</p>
<p begin="02:21:52.359" end="02:21:59.818" style="s2">Purpose and direction and meaning and that he was nihilistic until he started he read &quot;zen in the art of motorcycle maintenance&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:22:00.729" end="02:22:02.490" style="s2">Which is a book I actually like quite a bit</p>
<p begin="02:22:02.490" end="02:22:07.649" style="s2">I&#39;ve read it three times at different decades of my life and one of the things that&#39;s very interesting about that book is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:22:07.649" end="02:22:11.759" style="s2">an examination of the idea of quality of the idea that there are</p>
<p begin="02:22:12.160" end="02:22:19.589" style="s2">Qualitative distinctions between things and that we have an instinct to make qualitative distinctions and so a qualitative distinction is</p>
<p begin="02:22:20.300" end="02:22:23.880" style="s2">Simply this is better than that which is a judgment</p>
<p begin="02:22:24.480" end="02:22:26.480" style="s2">Okay, now what ratzinger is</p>
<p begin="02:22:27.960" end="02:22:29.960" style="s2">hypothesizing is that</p>
<p begin="02:22:30.160" end="02:22:34.919" style="s2">The person in enough you know how you the idea of the modern idea is you&#39;re supposed to accept yourself</p>
<p begin="02:22:35.040" end="02:22:42.179" style="s2">I think that&#39;s an insane idea by the way really I think I can&#39;t think of a more nihilistic idea than that you&#39;re already ok</p>
<p begin="02:22:42.430" end="02:22:43.290" style="s2">It&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="02:22:43.290" end="02:22:45.980" style="s2">You&#39;re not and the reason you&#39;re not is could you could be way more?</p>
<p begin="02:22:46.060" end="02:22:50.560" style="s2">Than you are so what do you want to be you want to be ok as you are or do you want to strive</p>
<p begin="02:22:50.860" end="02:22:52.860" style="s2">towards what&#39;s better? and</p>
<p begin="02:22:53.229" end="02:22:55.050" style="s2">This young man this australian</p>
<p begin="02:22:55.050" end="02:22:58.740" style="s2">he said that the reason that &#39;zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance&#39; had such a</p>
<p begin="02:22:59.109" end="02:23:04.259" style="s2">Impact on him was because he wasn&#39;t happy with his current mode of being right he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:23:04.779" end="02:23:07.499" style="s2">Consider the Manner in which he conducted himself</p>
<p begin="02:23:08.109" end="02:23:10.109" style="s2">sufficient and the fact that</p>
<p begin="02:23:11.140" end="02:23:17.100" style="s2">The author of Zen and, it was Persik laid out the notion that you could make qualitative distinctions,</p>
<p begin="02:23:17.100" end="02:23:22.720" style="s2">And there really was a difference between good things and bad things or great things and evil things, it gives you direction</p>
<p begin="02:23:23.580" end="02:23:27.700" style="s2">it gives you gives you the possibility of moving upward and</p>
<p begin="02:23:28.540" end="02:23:31.169" style="s2">Ratzinger is pointing out at least to some degree that</p>
<p begin="02:23:31.510" end="02:23:36.630" style="s2">Human beings are insufficient in and of themselves and need the movement upward and so they need to</p>
<p begin="02:23:36.850" end="02:23:40.979" style="s2">conceptualize something like the highest good and then to strive for that and</p>
<p begin="02:23:41.800" end="02:23:44.490" style="s2">The thing is is that there isn&#39;t any difference</p>
<p begin="02:23:45.069" end="02:23:48.599" style="s2">between conceptualizing the good and being judged</p>
<p begin="02:23:49.021" end="02:23:50.160" style="s2">because if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="02:23:50.160" end="02:23:56.180" style="s2">conceptualize the good and move towards it what you have to do is separate from yourself all those things that aren&#39;t good and</p>
<p begin="02:23:56.400" end="02:24:00.829" style="s2">leave them behind and that&#39;s where the redeemer and the judge are the same thing and</p>
<p begin="02:24:01.440" end="02:24:03.260" style="s2">One of the things that&#39;s really appalling</p>
<p begin="02:24:03.260" end="02:24:08.690" style="s2">I think about our modern world is that we&#39;re rejecting the notion of qualitative distinctions</p>
<p begin="02:24:08.690" end="02:24:15.020" style="s2">You say well, we don&#39;t want to hurt anybody&#39;s feelings by saying that one thing is better than another it&#39;s like okay fair enough</p>
<p begin="02:24:15.020" end="02:24:20.140" style="s2">It&#39;s not fun to be cast off with the damned. That&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="02:24:20.320" end="02:24:25.120" style="s2">But if people are in fact insufficient in their present condition</p>
<p begin="02:24:25.820" end="02:24:29.280" style="s2">Which seems to be the case; I mean try finding someone who isn&#39;t?</p>
<p begin="02:24:29.640" end="02:24:36.700" style="s2">Then if you deny the possibility of qualitative distinction because you want to promote a radical</p>
<p begin="02:24:37.050" end="02:24:43.940" style="s2">egalitarianism then you remove the possibility of redemption because there&#39;s no movement towards the good and it seems to me that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:24:44.160" end="02:24:46.789" style="s2">Catastrophe to sacrifice the good for</p>
<p begin="02:24:48.391" end="02:24:55.250" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s a catastrophe to sacrifice the good for the equal; because for us to be equal would be mean as far as I can</p>
<p begin="02:24:55.250" end="02:24:58.910" style="s2">tell that we would all be equally unredeemed and miserable and</p>
<p begin="02:24:59.460" end="02:25:01.460" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="02:25:05.280" end="02:25:08.209" style="s2">&quot;He also mentioned in the previous paragraph</p>
<p begin="02:25:08.311" end="02:25:14.450" style="s2">I believe that even in the case when you experience the human life at its fullest that it&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="02:25:14.670" end="02:25:18.350" style="s2">Beautiful as its most meaningful you have a deep I guess</p>
<p begin="02:25:19.141" end="02:25:23.600" style="s2">Understanding that you have something to be thankful for you need to thank somebody for that</p>
<p begin="02:25:23.601" end="02:25:25.851" style="s2">It&#39;s not based entirely on your own merit and that</p>
<p begin="02:25:26.490" end="02:25:31.249" style="s2">Points you towards something else and also, and-&quot; I don&#39;t think that you can have a profoundly positive</p>
<p begin="02:25:32.220" end="02:25:33.630" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="02:25:33.630" end="02:25:36.530" style="s2">You know in the best sense without that accompanying it</p>
<p begin="02:25:37.050" end="02:25:42.080" style="s2">That&#39;s a feeling of being blessed. It&#39;s something like that. Yeah. That&#39;s a good oh</p>
<p begin="02:25:43.710" end="02:25:45.740" style="s2">Wait hold it. I&#39;m going to stop you</p>
<p begin="02:25:45.740" end="02:25:52.159" style="s2">Okay, because I&#39;m going to ask this person, but I would like to say that those were remarkably good questions</p>
<p begin="02:25:52.740" end="02:25:54.740" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="02:26:00.200" end="02:26:03.009" style="s2">&quot;Dr. Peterson, thank you for the wonderful lecture</p>
<p begin="02:26:04.280" end="02:26:06.339" style="s2">given your working definition of truth and</p>
<p begin="02:26:07.250" end="02:26:13.660" style="s2">And let&#39;s say within the abrahamic religious tradition would you say that the more perhaps</p>
<p begin="02:26:14.200" end="02:26:16.200" style="s2">mystical sects and denominations</p>
<p begin="02:26:16.600" end="02:26:19.100" style="s2">which place more emphasis on the</p>
<p begin="02:26:20.280" end="02:26:23.240" style="s2">transcendental experience of God also on this experience</p>
<p begin="02:26:24.320" end="02:26:27.669" style="s2">as opposed to the more fundamentalist, Orthodox</p>
<p begin="02:26:28.460" end="02:26:30.460" style="s2">literalist which perhaps</p>
<p begin="02:26:30.620" end="02:26:32.700" style="s2">Emphasize that what I&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="02:26:35.360" end="02:26:41.800" style="s2">Moral policing of behaviors&quot; yeah? &quot;would you say that the former is more true than the latter?&quot; no. &quot;and--&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:26:42.520" end="02:26:50.280" style="s2">no. and and okay, sorry continue. &quot;And B: could the former in some ways serve as an antidote to</p>
<p begin="02:26:50.500" end="02:26:52.600" style="s2">extremists literalism, Jihadism</p>
<p begin="02:26:53.900" end="02:26:59.020" style="s2">Fundamentalism?&quot; okay, so yes to the second part, but the first part it&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="02:26:59.271" end="02:27:03.400" style="s2">We did some research on this a while back because we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="02:27:04.070" end="02:27:07.179" style="s2">the different religious proclivities of liberals and conservatives and</p>
<p begin="02:27:08.180" end="02:27:13.180" style="s2">Liberals like if you&#39;re liberal it means you&#39;re high in openness and low in conscientiousness, and if you&#39;re conservative</p>
<p begin="02:27:13.180" end="02:27:19.480" style="s2">Then you&#39;re high and conscientiousness and low and openness and that the liberals are spiritual and the conservatives are dogmatic</p>
<p begin="02:27:20.210" end="02:27:22.210" style="s2">but it&#39;s best to think of those as</p>
<p begin="02:27:23.030" end="02:27:25.600" style="s2">partners, right? because the</p>
<p begin="02:27:26.391" end="02:27:33.641" style="s2">spiritual mystical end is where the revelations Emerge and the renewal, but that&#39;s where there&#39;s Chaos and and</p>
<p begin="02:27:34.340" end="02:27:37.810" style="s2">Discord as well, because what&#39;s new disrupts what&#39;s stable</p>
<p begin="02:27:37.811" end="02:27:39.110" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="02:27:39.110" end="02:27:40.880" style="s2">What&#39;s new has to be turned into...</p>
<p begin="02:27:40.880" end="02:27:43.210" style="s2">It has to be integrated into what&#39;s stable</p>
<p begin="02:27:43.210" end="02:27:47.620" style="s2">And so you need both those poles and of course if the dogmatists get the upper-hand then everything</p>
<p begin="02:27:47.840" end="02:27:54.580" style="s2">turns into a Tyranny of stone that that&#39;s egypt in the old testament, but if the if the if the</p>
<p begin="02:27:55.340" end="02:27:59.170" style="s2">Mystics get the upper hand then everything floats off the earth into some</p>
<p begin="02:27:59.780" end="02:28:03.699" style="s2">impractical ether that is equally counterproductive, and so there has to be a</p>
<p begin="02:28:04.311" end="02:28:06.040" style="s2">dialogue between those different poles</p>
<p begin="02:28:06.040" end="02:28:09.339" style="s2">And I think you see that in the distribution of human temperament</p>
<p begin="02:28:09.460" end="02:28:15.790" style="s2">You know the conscientious types there they tend to be orderly the orderly types tend to tend towards kind of a right-wing</p>
<p begin="02:28:16.430" end="02:28:23.260" style="s2">Totalitarianism that&#39;s their proclivity when they when they when things get out of hand especially if they&#39;re low in openness, that&#39;s a danger</p>
<p begin="02:28:24.350" end="02:28:25.910" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="02:28:25.910" end="02:28:29.499" style="s2">You see the same thing with the people who are too open and not conscientious at all</p>
<p begin="02:28:29.540" end="02:28:35.800" style="s2">They&#39;re dreaming all the time, but they never do anything. There&#39;s never anything implemented and that that&#39;s bad. That&#39;s a bad thing</p>
<p begin="02:28:36.700" end="02:28:43.680" style="s2">So I don&#39;t think that you can say that like- the dogmatic structure is necessary because that perpetuates the system and the revelatory</p>
<p begin="02:28:43.900" end="02:28:49.700" style="s2">Element is necessary because that renews it when renewal is necessary and there has to be a continual dialogue between those elements</p>
<p begin="02:28:50.000" end="02:28:56.950" style="s2">So that neither of them fall prey to their own particular form of Pathology that&#39;s one of the problems with the current political</p>
<p begin="02:28:58.250" end="02:29:00.250" style="s2">What would you call it?</p>
<p begin="02:29:00.560" end="02:29:05.319" style="s2">Polarization that&#39;s occurring across the west is that the right and the left and are talking to each other anymore.</p>
<p begin="02:29:05.540" end="02:29:07.749" style="s2">That&#39;s a very bad thing because the left will</p>
<p begin="02:29:08.390" end="02:29:11.050" style="s2">wander into a pit and fail without</p>
<p begin="02:29:12.439" end="02:29:18.879" style="s2">boundaries and the right will enclose itself in smaller and smaller spaces until it can&#39;t move without the left and</p>
<p begin="02:29:19.069" end="02:29:25.959" style="s2">One of the reasons that democracy works is because it makes people talk; or allows them to talk you can have it either way</p>
<p begin="02:29:26.600" end="02:29:28.600" style="s2">but it&#39;s in its bits because</p>
<p begin="02:29:29.540" end="02:29:31.540" style="s2">Every virtue has its vice</p>
<p begin="02:29:32.120" end="02:29:38.679" style="s2">right and so a meta virtue is something like the amalgamation of singular virtues into something that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:29:39.020" end="02:29:43.960" style="s2">Transcendent structure that has more to do with the harmony of virtues rather than with any given virtue</p>
<p begin="02:29:44.479" end="02:29:51.969" style="s2">even though I think that freedom of speech is the clearest manifestation of that harmony of virtues, so and</p>
<p begin="02:29:52.609" end="02:29:58.568" style="s2">&quot;So all could be a lubricant for the beginning of this discussion. Do you think between the liberals and conservatives?&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:30:04.000" end="02:30:06.000" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how to answer that</p>
<p begin="02:30:08.980" end="02:30:15.660" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t follow immediately from your from your initial presupposition, so the awe experience is a different issue</p>
<p begin="02:30:15.660" end="02:30:17.600" style="s2">&quot;[Unintelligible]&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:30:17.600" end="02:30:19.600" style="s2">Yeah, we&#39;ll be able</p>
<p begin="02:30:20.060" end="02:30:27.820" style="s2">Yes, &quot;at least exposing conservatives to some form of that experience could it be if we requisite for a more productive dialogue?&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:30:31.060" end="02:30:36.540" style="s2">See I mean in it in in in the church in church ceremony let&#39;s say a classical church ceremony</p>
<p begin="02:30:36.800" end="02:30:42.280" style="s2">There&#39;s some intermingling of both right you mean you think about a church ceremony that takes place in the Gothic cathedral</p>
<p begin="02:30:42.500" end="02:30:47.500" style="s2">We&#39;ve certainly got the dogma and they&#39;re under and the relatively rigid rule structure</p>
<p begin="02:30:47.630" end="02:30:50.769" style="s2">but at the same time that&#39;s aligned with intense beauty and</p>
<p begin="02:30:51.170" end="02:30:55.719" style="s2">In the architectural forms in the in the light that&#39;s streaming in through the stained-glass</p>
<p begin="02:30:55.970" end="02:31:03.940" style="s2">windows and the music and I mean the Gothic cathedrals are forests right it&#39;s a stone forest with sunlight streaming in through the Trees and</p>
<p begin="02:31:04.670" end="02:31:07.450" style="s2">It&#39;s a balance between structure light there are absolutely</p>
<p begin="02:31:07.940" end="02:31:08.980" style="s2">unbelievable structures</p>
<p begin="02:31:08.980" end="02:31:14.379" style="s2">And they speak of the transcendent but but inside that there&#39;s a structure and so it</p>
<p begin="02:31:14.660" end="02:31:19.690" style="s2">Seems that in order for the religious impulse to be balanced properly there has to be a reasonable</p>
<p begin="02:31:20.930" end="02:31:28.059" style="s2">dialogue even in practice between the mystical awe-inspiring transcendent and the dogmatic yeah either of those can</p>
<p begin="02:31:28.400" end="02:31:33.159" style="s2">Can go as either those goes astray without the other if you&#39;re too dogmatic. Do you need aw?</p>
<p begin="02:31:35.090" end="02:31:41.530" style="s2">likely yes, because that would show you that there&#39;s something beyond your own presuppositions, so</p>
<p begin="02:31:43.130" end="02:31:48.370" style="s2">So awe, I should tell you something interesting about awe as a as a physiological phenomena</p>
<p begin="02:31:48.370" end="02:31:50.620" style="s2">You know how you&#39;re listening to music and you get chills?</p>
<p begin="02:31:51.680" end="02:31:56.620" style="s2">Some people experience that more than others open people experience that more or music is a pretty</p>

<p begin="02:32:11.200" end="02:32:14.980" style="s2">It&#39;s the same thing like that that chill is your hair standing on end</p>
<p begin="02:32:14.980" end="02:32:20.900" style="s2">And that&#39;s this that&#39;s sensation you get in the presence of a meta predator</p>
<p begin="02:32:20.908" end="02:32:23.400" style="s2">It&#39;s something like that and so the awe</p>

<p begin="02:32:34.840" end="02:32:41.099" style="s2">piloerection that you see in prey animals when they&#39;re confronted by a predator and of course that would be if you are a rabbit</p>
<p begin="02:32:41.100" end="02:32:45.420" style="s2">You can bloody well believe that you see a wolf and it would inspire. Awe that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="02:32:45.420" end="02:32:51.449" style="s2">I mean if a wolf that was 20 feet high came bounding in here, man, you&#39;d feel awe so</p>
<p begin="02:32:52.180" end="02:32:55.769" style="s2">Yeah, that will convince you that there&#39;s something that you still need to know</p>

<p begin="02:33:00.310" end="02:33:02.109" style="s2">last question</p>
<p begin="02:33:02.109" end="02:33:04.379" style="s2">&quot;Perfect timing. Hi, Dr. Peterson</p>
<p begin="02:33:04.380" end="02:33:09.420" style="s2">My name is Gary, and I&#39;m a clinical and counseling master student right now and so one of the key ideas</p>
<p begin="02:33:09.540" end="02:33:11.660" style="s2">That&#39;s been surfacing time and time again in your</p>
<p begin="02:33:12.300" end="02:33:14.300" style="s2">Lectures is the idea that</p>
<p begin="02:33:14.350" end="02:33:16.619" style="s2">Phenomenology is structured and flows</p>
<p begin="02:33:17.350" end="02:33:19.350" style="s2">mythologically and</p>
<p begin="02:33:20.109" end="02:33:22.679" style="s2">the way that plays out is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:33:23.920" end="02:33:28.259" style="s2">supposing effectively just pay attention to what comes up kind of</p>
<p begin="02:33:28.869" end="02:33:32.489" style="s2">naturally and you can locate the chaotic elements in your experience and</p>
<p begin="02:33:32.920" end="02:33:37.170" style="s2">Prod at them with whatever degree of Necessity you think so</p>
<p begin="02:33:37.930" end="02:33:39.960" style="s2">trying to situate this within the clinical</p>
<p begin="02:33:40.720" end="02:33:42.720" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="02:33:43.000" end="02:33:45.000" style="s2">We can conceptualize</p>
<p begin="02:33:46.119" end="02:33:50.459" style="s2">Psychotherapy as a kind of guided journey just as you touched on in this lecture</p>
<p begin="02:33:51.460" end="02:33:56.399" style="s2">Where it&#39;s more of a meta journey in a sense a meta heroic journey if I don&#39;t know how you want to think about it</p>
<p begin="02:33:56.439" end="02:33:57.790" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="02:33:57.790" end="02:34:03.359" style="s2">Just for those of us who are interested in kind of grounding and implementing these ideas within?</p>
<p begin="02:34:04.060" end="02:34:05.470" style="s2">psychotherapeutic practice</p>
<p begin="02:34:05.470" end="02:34:08.550" style="s2">What should we watch out for in the process itself?</p>
<p begin="02:34:09.159" end="02:34:15.659" style="s2">What comes up? What should we be afraid of or fearful of or cautious about or what should we tend towards that&#39;s my question&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:34:17.529" end="02:34:19.948" style="s2">Well, I think one of it</p>
<p begin="02:34:21.369" end="02:34:24.509" style="s2">One of the people who I&#39;ve read that&#39;s had the biggest</p>
<p begin="02:34:25.810" end="02:34:28.529" style="s2">Impact on me as a Clinician was carl Rogers</p>
<p begin="02:34:30.230" end="02:34:34.760" style="s2">And the reason for that is that carl Rogers put tremendous emphasis on listening.</p>
<p begin="02:34:35.400" end="02:34:42.470" style="s2">Like it&#39;s almost impossible to overestimate how useful it is to listen to your clients like you need a meta</p>
<p begin="02:34:42.750" end="02:34:44.750" style="s2">Scheme in some sense and</p>
<p begin="02:34:45.000" end="02:34:50.150" style="s2">The meta Scheme, I think is laid out in the sermon on the mount. It&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="02:34:51.330" end="02:34:53.450" style="s2">orient yourself and your client</p>
<p begin="02:34:54.511" end="02:34:56.511" style="s2">Towards the good</p>
<p begin="02:34:56.580" end="02:35:00.770" style="s2">The client has to conceptualize what that might be you can serve as a guide</p>
<p begin="02:35:00.771" end="02:35:06.650" style="s2">But it has to come from that person because one of the things that you want to find out from your client is okay</p>
<p begin="02:35:06.660" end="02:35:08.370" style="s2">What&#39;s wrong?</p>
<p begin="02:35:08.370" end="02:35:10.370" style="s2">they have to tell you and</p>
<p begin="02:35:10.771" end="02:35:18.021" style="s2">What would not having something wrong look like like what is it if you could have what you wanted and that and that...</p>
<p begin="02:35:18.330" end="02:35:23.900" style="s2">That would be good. What would that look like okay? So that establishes your star, right? It&#39;s like Geppetto</p>
<p begin="02:35:24.511" end="02:35:28.400" style="s2">Establishing the relationship with the star at the beginning of pinocchio. Here&#39;s what we&#39;re aiming at</p>
<p begin="02:35:28.950" end="02:35:30.710" style="s2">Okay, so now you&#39;ve got that schema</p>
<p begin="02:35:30.710" end="02:35:31.771" style="s2">Here&#39;s what we&#39;re aiming at</p>
<p begin="02:35:31.771" end="02:35:37.700" style="s2">now you might say you might think well now that what happens to the client is they meet their dragons along the way and</p>
<p begin="02:35:37.980" end="02:35:40.159" style="s2">The dragons would be well now</p>
<p begin="02:35:40.160" end="02:35:40.910" style="s2">You know what you want,</p>
<p begin="02:35:40.910" end="02:35:47.209" style="s2">And there are things in your way and some of those things might many of those things are going to be intensely practical</p>
<p begin="02:35:47.210" end="02:35:49.170" style="s2">But they&#39;re practical/</p>
<p begin="02:35:49.170" end="02:35:54.140" style="s2">Psychological so like so maybe someone is has a job and they would like to move forward in the job</p>
<p begin="02:35:54.141" end="02:35:56.141" style="s2">But they&#39;re terrified of speaking in public</p>
<p begin="02:35:56.280" end="02:35:59.270" style="s2">Well, you know is that a psychological problem or a practical problem?</p>
<p begin="02:35:59.880" end="02:36:00.620" style="s2">It&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="02:36:00.620" end="02:36:04.579" style="s2">It&#39;s also a real problem in many positions unless you can speak fluently</p>
<p begin="02:36:04.860" end="02:36:09.409" style="s2">Publicly you&#39;re you&#39;re going to hit a ceiling and you&#39;re not going to go anywhere and so</p>
<p begin="02:36:10.021" end="02:36:13.551" style="s2">For the person to move towards that goal</p>
<p begin="02:36:14.820" end="02:36:18.560" style="s2">Then they have to confront the obstacles that manifest themselves</p>
<p begin="02:36:18.960" end="02:36:23.160" style="s2">Within that framework and part of your job as a clinician is to identify the obstacles</p>
<p begin="02:36:23.250" end="02:36:28.459" style="s2">And to discriminate them from things they don&#39;t have to worry about right part of it is</p>
<p begin="02:36:28.891" end="02:36:31.341" style="s2">you know you can&#39;t just run around and try to</p>
<p begin="02:36:31.891" end="02:36:37.761" style="s2">Combat all the Chaos in the world some of it is your Chaos and a bunch of it isn&#39;t and the Chaos</p>
<p begin="02:36:37.761" end="02:36:41.300" style="s2">That&#39;s yours is the Chaos that emerges as you move towards a necessary goal</p>
<p begin="02:36:41.460" end="02:36:46.740" style="s2">And so partly what you&#39;re doing by listening to your client is to help them cut their dragons down to size</p>
<p begin="02:36:46.940" end="02:36:51.940" style="s2">You know because what will happen if you start to talk to somebody about public speaking and you really talk to them</p>
<p begin="02:36:51.940" end="02:36:57.780" style="s2">Is that you decompose the problem into a set of maybe 20 subproblems like well</p>
<p begin="02:36:57.800" end="02:37:01.250" style="s2">Do you know exactly how to give a speech? What&#39;s your theory of</p>
<p begin="02:37:02.250" end="02:37:07.700" style="s2">Public speaking? Do you know how to look at people when you&#39;re talking? Do you know how to speak loudly enough?</p>
<p begin="02:37:07.700" end="02:37:10.939" style="s2">so that people can hear you? do you have a philosophy of</p>
<p begin="02:37:11.790" end="02:37:17.660" style="s2">Public speaking? you know all those things are necessary in order to do it properly you need to decompose that with the client and then to</p>
<p begin="02:37:17.850" end="02:37:23.899" style="s2">Make those problems you have to decompose them to the point where they can be met by a practical solution</p>
<p begin="02:37:23.910" end="02:37:28.249" style="s2">and then you have to guide the person through the implementation of the practical solution and</p>
<p begin="02:37:30.029" end="02:37:32.209" style="s2">Mostly you do that by by listening</p>
<p begin="02:37:32.520" end="02:37:36.200" style="s2">It&#39;s like the what you need to be is the person who helps the person</p>
<p begin="02:37:36.510" end="02:37:39.380" style="s2">That you&#39;re working with orient themselves towards a better future</p>
<p begin="02:37:39.590" end="02:37:44.719" style="s2">That&#39;s the compact you and I are in this space at this time to make things better</p>
<p begin="02:37:45.840" end="02:37:48.529" style="s2">first of all we have to decide what better would look like and</p>
<p begin="02:37:49.080" end="02:37:51.439" style="s2">Second we need a strategy and third</p>
<p begin="02:37:51.439" end="02:37:52.200" style="s2">we need to</p>
<p begin="02:37:52.200" end="02:37:55.549" style="s2">Once we have that we&#39;re going to see the obstacles and some of those are going to be</p>
<p begin="02:37:55.680" end="02:37:59.180" style="s2">Psychological and some of them are going to be practical and we&#39;re going to engage in joint</p>
<p begin="02:37:59.790" end="02:38:02.899" style="s2">problem-solving of whatever, sort is necessary in order to</p>
<p begin="02:38:04.529" end="02:38:10.669" style="s2">Minimize the impact of those problems or to gain from the problems and dream analysis can be extremely useful for that by the way</p>
<p begin="02:38:11.010" end="02:38:17.540" style="s2">It&#39;s even more useful for helping the person identify what the goal is because that&#39;s often difficult for people. It&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="02:38:17.540" end="02:38:18.529" style="s2">I know that something&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="02:38:18.529" end="02:38:24.289" style="s2">But I don&#39;t know what I want. sometimes people get so stuck there that they just can&#39;t get they just can&#39;t get out of it</p>
<p begin="02:38:25.080" end="02:38:27.379" style="s2">So and then what would you watch out for?</p>
<p begin="02:38:29.279" end="02:38:33.229" style="s2">&quot;Phenomenologically. The way it shows up, The way, It&#39;s experienced&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:38:34.560" end="02:38:38.450" style="s2">Well, I would say the clinician one of the things that you should watch out for is resentment</p>
<p begin="02:38:39.300" end="02:38:43.040" style="s2">So there&#39;s a there&#39;s a couple of rules of thumb that I think are useful</p>
<p begin="02:38:43.200" end="02:38:47.450" style="s2">Don&#39;t do anything for your clients that they can do for themselves and don&#39;t do them any favors?</p>
<p begin="02:38:48.720" end="02:38:50.899" style="s2">Now I think you can step</p>
<p begin="02:38:51.810" end="02:38:54.319" style="s2">Beyond the confines of your role</p>
<p begin="02:38:55.410" end="02:38:57.410" style="s2">carefully now and then</p>
<p begin="02:38:59.350" end="02:39:01.180" style="s2">to show that</p>
<p begin="02:39:01.180" end="02:39:07.859" style="s2">There&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s a more human connection than the merely contractual. I think that&#39;s very useful but</p>
<p begin="02:39:09.069" end="02:39:12.929" style="s2">Their problems are not your problems you do not have any right to their problems</p>
<p begin="02:39:12.930" end="02:39:17.250" style="s2">And so you have to maintain that detachment because otherwise you can steal their destiny</p>
<p begin="02:39:17.380" end="02:39:22.229" style="s2">You don&#39;t want to be the person that solves their problems because you steal their destiny when you do that</p>
<p begin="02:39:22.359" end="02:39:26.189" style="s2">You want to be someone with whom they can figure things out for themselves?</p>
<p begin="02:39:26.260" end="02:39:32.550" style="s2">And so there can be hubris in being a clinician because you can be the problem solver and that elevates you to a position</p>
<p begin="02:39:32.979" end="02:39:35.818" style="s2">You elevate yourself to that position. You&#39;ll fall flat on your face</p>
<p begin="02:39:35.890" end="02:39:40.920" style="s2">You&#39;ll hurt your clients and things will kick back on you very very hard because what the hell. Do you know?</p>
<p begin="02:39:41.560" end="02:39:42.580" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="02:39:42.580" end="02:39:49.769" style="s2">Nothing because that person is very complicated and they need to they need to sort themselves out and but you can be a facilitator</p>
<p begin="02:39:49.960" end="02:39:51.960" style="s2">For that, but that&#39;s all you should be</p>
<p begin="02:39:52.479" end="02:39:54.929" style="s2">And so you have to watch that you have to watch over</p>
<p begin="02:39:55.689" end="02:40:02.339" style="s2">becoming over and k over ly entangled so you have to maintain your detachment in the best sense, and you have to not overstep your</p>
<p begin="02:40:02.890" end="02:40:07.170" style="s2">It&#39;s easy to become hubristic when the person is looking to you for the answers</p>
<p begin="02:40:07.630" end="02:40:13.469" style="s2">It&#39;s like you might you don&#39;t have the answers although you might be able to find help the person find their way</p>
<p begin="02:40:13.990" end="02:40:16.259" style="s2">That&#39;s what you do with everyone. You love - right?</p>
<p begin="02:40:16.260" end="02:40:22.800" style="s2">I mean, you don&#39;t provide them with the answers because then they become little clones of you and</p>
<p begin="02:40:23.649" end="02:40:30.059" style="s2">unhappy bitter resentful and Angry little clones of you because you usurped their destiny and</p>
<p begin="02:40:30.819" end="02:40:32.819" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="02:40:32.830" end="02:40:38.519" style="s2">the same thing applies within familiar Arrangements or friendships all about it, so</p>
