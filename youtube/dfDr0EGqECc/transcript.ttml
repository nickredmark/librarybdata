<p begin="00:00:24.150" end="00:00:36.030" style="s2">opener Andrew yeah that&#39;s one heck of an</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.710" end="00:00:38.129" style="s2">opener well well I don&#39;t know what to</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.030" end="00:00:40.350" style="s2">say about that except that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.129" end="00:00:43.140" style="s2">right question and I think that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.350" end="00:00:45.149" style="s2">question that is it&#39;s the question that</p>

<p begin="00:00:47.670" end="00:00:51.840" style="s2">that&#39;s vectoring me through my work with</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.140" end="00:00:55.070" style="s2">John and my all of the work that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.840" end="00:00:58.890" style="s2">that I&#39;m absorbed in that has to do with</p>

<p begin="00:01:01.050" end="00:01:06.210" style="s2">of time and the meaning crisis all of</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.660" end="00:01:08.820" style="s2">that work for me is in a way can be</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.210" end="00:01:12.650" style="s2">formulated within the question what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.820" end="00:01:12.650" style="s2">my divine double because I think that</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.830" end="00:01:17.610" style="s2">that&#39;s the unfortunately it&#39;s kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.170" end="00:01:22.530" style="s2">elliptical question for me right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.610" end="00:01:24.479" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s paving it&#39;s paving the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.530" end="00:01:26.159" style="s2">path of my pursuit but it&#39;s it&#39;s paving</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.479" end="00:01:27.799" style="s2">it precisely because it&#39;s unanswered I</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.159" end="00:01:30.659" style="s2">think that it has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.799" end="00:01:34.380" style="s2">espousal of vocation in the classic and</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.659" end="00:01:36.439" style="s2">religious sense of the term and I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.380" end="00:01:42.810" style="s2">that it has to do with understanding</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.439" end="00:01:48.030" style="s2">with with knowing myself in a in a mode</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.810" end="00:01:50.430" style="s2">of ongoing disclosure that that that</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.030" end="00:01:52.259" style="s2">beckons me further into the world such</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.430" end="00:01:53.939" style="s2">that being beckoned further into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.259" end="00:01:55.290" style="s2">world is also being beckoned closer to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.939" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">myself I don&#39;t know if that makes any</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.290" end="00:01:59.040" style="s2">sense but I think there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:01.380" style="s2">way in which the disclosure of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.040" end="00:02:02.729" style="s2">project these projects that were you</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.380" end="00:02:04.759" style="s2">know and I and I say we because I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.729" end="00:02:07.170" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.759" end="00:02:11.370" style="s2">you&#39;re also absorbed in these projects</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.170" end="00:02:13.100" style="s2">right I mean project in a very I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.370" end="00:02:15.230" style="s2">very equivocal ii and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.100" end="00:02:17.030" style="s2">that there are these there&#39;s a network</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.230" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">of interrelated projects that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.030" end="00:02:23.330" style="s2">happening right now and you and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.040" end="00:02:25.250" style="s2">perhaps serve are on different axes of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.330" end="00:02:28.610" style="s2">the project but they&#39;re part of the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.250" end="00:02:31.670" style="s2">project fundamentally right and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.610" end="00:02:34.010" style="s2">right the revolute the resolution of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.670" end="00:02:39.110" style="s2">modern spiritual problem and the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.010" end="00:02:40.310" style="s2">that that problem then disseminates</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.110" end="00:02:42.860" style="s2">itself into all of the satellite</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.310" end="00:02:44.780" style="s2">problems that we mistake for the problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.860" end="00:02:47.690" style="s2">right yeah and and and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.780" end="00:02:50.090" style="s2">translates into our our our politicking</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.690" end="00:02:55.970" style="s2">and that kind of thing so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.090" end="00:03:00.070" style="s2">for me as i as i immerse further into</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.970" end="00:03:07.190" style="s2">the work myself becomes more and more</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.070" end="00:03:10.970" style="s2">disclosed to me which is to say my my my</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.190" end="00:03:12.890" style="s2">necessary role was the greeks damian</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.970" end="00:03:14.930" style="s2">maybe of something like diamond yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.890" end="00:03:17.150" style="s2">exactly yeah yeah it&#39;s a diamond yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.930" end="00:03:20.030" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s right that&#39;s right very much</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.150" end="00:03:21.950" style="s2">so yeah very much so right that that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.030" end="00:03:23.630" style="s2">hermetic diamond that&#39;s that&#39;s the how</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.950" end="00:03:25.730" style="s2">we usually think of arrows right the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.630" end="00:03:29.570" style="s2">thing that flips between domains mortal</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.730" end="00:03:31.490" style="s2">and divine that bridges ourselves of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.570" end="00:03:32.570" style="s2">finitude into ourselves of infinitude</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.490" end="00:03:34.480" style="s2">because I think what&#39;s meant by the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.570" end="00:03:36.680" style="s2">divine double in some sense and then you</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.480" end="00:03:38.690" style="s2">put a bit of a character Guardian spin</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.680" end="00:03:41.570" style="s2">on it but it&#39;s really the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.690" end="00:03:44.600" style="s2">aspect the infinite aspect that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.570" end="00:03:47.930" style="s2">composes the synthesis of self and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.600" end="00:03:49.400" style="s2">think in some ways much of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.930" end="00:03:52.520" style="s2">responding to right now and I say we</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.400" end="00:03:55.000" style="s2">because I&#39;m implicated is a loss of you</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.520" end="00:03:57.800" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.000" end="00:03:59.960" style="s2">no longer being able to find the divine</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.800" end="00:04:03.260" style="s2">spark of the eternal within ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.960" end="00:04:11.020" style="s2">right that connects us to the Li an</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.260" end="00:04:17.020" style="s2">exhaustible and and so I guess the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.020" end="00:04:17.020" style="s2">the hunt for my divine double is a a</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.350" end="00:04:32.139" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a way of nosing out the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.560" end="00:04:35.490" style="s2">Eternity within within nosing out the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.139" end="00:04:38.460" style="s2">Eternity within the presence of the work</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.490" end="00:04:42.490" style="s2">and the reflection of that eternity is</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.460" end="00:04:44.260" style="s2">something like you know something like</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.490" end="00:04:46.060" style="s2">the devil that you&#39;re talking yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.260" end="00:04:47.860" style="s2">interesting cuz I was me not answering</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.060" end="00:04:50.680" style="s2">your question wrong no when he was with</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.860" end="00:04:53.380" style="s2">you yeah yeah well there&#39;s there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.680" end="00:04:58.000" style="s2">aspect of humility to your answer which</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.380" end="00:04:59.800" style="s2">but when he was saying that that you had</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.000" end="00:05:02.110" style="s2">this sort of glimmer of feeling that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.800" end="00:05:04.330" style="s2">have you know a gift for philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.110" end="00:05:06.760" style="s2">I was thinking that my feeling about you</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.330" end="00:05:08.979" style="s2">was that you&#39;re kind of a poet</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.760" end="00:05:12.789" style="s2">or at least I get a really poetic sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.979" end="00:05:13.840" style="s2">in you in your writing which I thought</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.789" end="00:05:15.310" style="s2">was very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:18.850" style="s2">so it&#39;s interesting you&#39;re not slide</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.310" end="00:05:21.220" style="s2">yourself my friend yeah well I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.850" end="00:05:23.910" style="s2">philosopher for sure you know I do my</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.220" end="00:05:26.950" style="s2">best to try to understand philosophy but</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.910" end="00:05:29.650" style="s2">in the past might I&#39;ve pursued</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.950" end="00:05:32.740" style="s2">songwriting and written above a poetry</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.650" end="00:05:34.270" style="s2">and then I&#39;ve moved on to sort of being</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.740" end="00:05:38.770" style="s2">this kind of blogger</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.270" end="00:05:41.440" style="s2">of some kind so so I feel like I I come</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.770" end="00:05:46.360" style="s2">from from that that interest in actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.440" end="00:05:50.349" style="s2">poetics rather than rather than let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.360" end="00:05:53.020" style="s2">say straight up you know political stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.349" end="00:05:54.099" style="s2">or anything like that you know and and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.020" end="00:05:58.139" style="s2">was thinking about what you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.099" end="00:06:01.720" style="s2">about this sort of stale political air</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.139" end="00:06:05.500" style="s2">that we get in and then trying to find a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.720" end="00:06:08.740" style="s2">sort of language but that liberates us</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.500" end="00:06:10.330" style="s2">from that in some sense hmm am I am I</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.740" end="00:06:11.889" style="s2">making am i are you following what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.330" end="00:06:15.010" style="s2">saying yeah yeah perfectly yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.889" end="00:06:16.930" style="s2">yeah absolutely absolutely yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.010" end="00:06:18.820" style="s2">that there&#39;s a great for me there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.930" end="00:06:23.160" style="s2">a great relief in finding the right</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.820" end="00:06:25.539" style="s2">category of problem to grapple with</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.160" end="00:06:27.400" style="s2">because the problem formulation like</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.539" end="00:06:29.110" style="s2">like god it&#39;s everything which is why</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.400" end="00:06:33.150" style="s2">your question so act right because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.110" end="00:06:33.150" style="s2">the right question and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.180" end="00:06:36.870" style="s2">I mean so much of public discourse is</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.800" end="00:06:40.170" style="s2">simply premise done on ill framed</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.870" end="00:06:45.570" style="s2">questions and and entering into an arena</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.170" end="00:06:47.610" style="s2">that has been that&#39;s been entering into</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.570" end="00:06:52.350" style="s2">in it like you know an arena that has</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.610" end="00:06:54.060" style="s2">been cordoned by by an ill-fated</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.350" end="00:06:55.980" style="s2">question means that any discourteous</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.060" end="00:06:57.750" style="s2">course that happens is also going to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.980" end="00:06:59.700" style="s2">ill-fated right it&#39;s sort of like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.750" end="00:07:05.190" style="s2">damming yourself even by entering into</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.700" end="00:07:07.650" style="s2">the discourse right because then because</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.190" end="00:07:09.510" style="s2">I think of that old like that hold the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.650" end="00:07:10.860" style="s2">old Heraclitus maximum of character</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.510" end="00:07:13.020" style="s2">being destiny but then they you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.860" end="00:07:16.560" style="s2">character is destiny we see that about</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.020" end="00:07:18.840" style="s2">about individuals but characterization I</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.560" end="00:07:21.470" style="s2">think to take that in to extend it a</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.840" end="00:07:24.330" style="s2">little bit characterization becomes</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.470" end="00:07:26.670" style="s2">becomes destination so the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.330" end="00:07:29.040" style="s2">characterize conversation the way we</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.670" end="00:07:33.150" style="s2">embody the character of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.040" end="00:07:36.360" style="s2">becomes its its its intellectual destiny</p>

<p begin="00:07:36.360" end="00:07:39.960" style="s2">right because the two things are</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.710" end="00:07:43.080" style="s2">fundamentally linked which is why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.960" end="00:07:44.790" style="s2">which is why that&#39;s why that&#39;s why Plato</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.080" end="00:07:48.330" style="s2">is such a sin oh sure in my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.790" end="00:07:53.120" style="s2">because Plato contains the the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.330" end="00:07:58.980" style="s2">implicit the implicit understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.120" end="00:08:01.590" style="s2">that that intellection is fleshed and we</p>

<p begin="00:08:01.590" end="00:08:05.640" style="s2">and we and we&#39;re always we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.450" end="00:08:07.860" style="s2">tempted to flesh it anyway that&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.640" end="00:08:10.860" style="s2">always resort to as a matter of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.860" end="00:08:13.290" style="s2">we are arguments inevitably devolve into</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.860" end="00:08:15.240" style="s2">ad hominem precisely because we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.290" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">this somehow we have this inkling that</p>

<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:21.240" style="s2">has to be somehow personified and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.100" end="00:08:23.610" style="s2">where the personification of</p>

<p begin="00:08:28.260" end="00:08:34.130" style="s2">necessarily ill-fated but it also means</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.150" end="00:08:37.830" style="s2">that the way we the way we assume</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.130" end="00:08:41.000" style="s2">character in discourse is important and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.830" end="00:08:43.770" style="s2">it has everything to do with you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.000" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">how we T conversations up for one</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.770" end="00:08:46.510" style="s2">another right well yeah we&#39;ll inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:49.900" style="s2">determine house</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.510" end="00:08:51.820" style="s2">that&#39;s what they are well I think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.900" end="00:08:54.850" style="s2">was was kind of beautiful about your</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.820" end="00:08:58.510" style="s2">conversation with ghee and Jordan and</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.850" end="00:09:02.350" style="s2">John there&#39;s a kind of joy in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.510" end="00:09:04.150" style="s2">process that&#39;s that is actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.350" end="00:09:05.770" style="s2">almost tangible you can kind of feel it</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.150" end="00:09:06.610" style="s2">that you guys are dancing with each</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.770" end="00:09:09.190" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.610" end="00:09:11.080" style="s2">rather than sort of trying to crush each</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.190" end="00:09:14.320" style="s2">other in the way that we do with our</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.080" end="00:09:18.040" style="s2">with our personas and egos and and all</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.320" end="00:09:19.450" style="s2">that right yeah yeah well I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.040" end="00:09:21.220" style="s2">just been a pleasure I kind of just feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.450" end="00:09:24.580" style="s2">like I&#39;m along for the ride in those</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.220" end="00:09:26.500" style="s2">conversations because I mean just as</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.580" end="00:09:28.180" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.500" end="00:09:30.250" style="s2">itself there&#39;s a sense in which identity</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.180" end="00:09:33.750" style="s2">absorbs into the process of the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.250" end="00:09:36.340" style="s2">and so you become things you become</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.750" end="00:09:38.670" style="s2">persons that are then seemed to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.340" end="00:09:42.040" style="s2">extrinsic to yourself in the throws of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.670" end="00:09:45.610" style="s2">the confrontations a confrontation sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.040" end="00:09:47.350" style="s2">of implies implies discord I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.610" end="00:09:49.020" style="s2">to imply that by confrontation but</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.350" end="00:09:52.240" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.020" end="00:09:54.010" style="s2">accommodative confrontation in those</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.240" end="00:09:55.690" style="s2">kinds of dialogues that presents you</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.010" end="00:09:59.560" style="s2">with reflections of yourself that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.690" end="00:10:01.420" style="s2">had yeah that&#39;s why that comes back to</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.560" end="00:10:03.630" style="s2">your divine double question right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.420" end="00:10:06.910" style="s2">process of having yourself revealed and</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.630" end="00:10:09.730" style="s2">deepening and widening reflections the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.910" end="00:10:12.340" style="s2">deeper conversation goes you your your</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.730" end="00:10:13.930" style="s2">your reflective image grows in</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.340" end="00:10:16.000" style="s2">proportion to the depth of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.930" end="00:10:18.670" style="s2">discussion which is why significant</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.000" end="00:10:21.040" style="s2">discussions are so edifying it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.670" end="00:10:22.750" style="s2">just because they avail propositions</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.040" end="00:10:26.410" style="s2">that we hadn&#39;t stumbled upon before it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.750" end="00:10:28.030" style="s2">because ourselves are unfurled in the in</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.410" end="00:10:29.560" style="s2">the process of those discussions that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.030" end="00:10:33.190" style="s2">why they come out of them sometimes just</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.560" end="00:10:36.220" style="s2">so utterly changed because it&#39;s like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.190" end="00:10:38.080" style="s2">different now you know and that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.220" end="00:10:40.510" style="s2">think of it enough sort of the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.080" end="00:10:44.770" style="s2">sense of recollection right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.510" end="00:10:46.450" style="s2">the you are in potentia all things that</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.770" end="00:10:48.490" style="s2">can be revealed in the throes of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.450" end="00:10:51.210" style="s2">conversations so in a way it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.490" end="00:10:53.500" style="s2">a it&#39;s a kind of psychic homecoming</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.210" end="00:10:55.810" style="s2">which I guess maybe sort of bridges it</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.500" end="00:10:58.630" style="s2">into more of a Union thinking yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.810" end="00:10:59.570" style="s2">notice the you often use the metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.630" end="00:11:01.250" style="s2">of bird</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.570" end="00:11:03.800" style="s2">thing and and I was thinking about that</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.250" end="00:11:05.840" style="s2">and I was and and and being in a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.800" end="00:11:08.810" style="s2">womb and this sort of creative process</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.840" end="00:11:11.720" style="s2">of becoming something and and I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.810" end="00:11:14.000" style="s2">thinking about four guys you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.720" end="00:11:16.100" style="s2">getting together talking and and yet the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.000" end="00:11:17.840" style="s2">metaphor is always about is always about</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.100" end="00:11:20.150" style="s2">birth so I know that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.840" end="00:11:22.580" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean to bring gender into</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.150" end="00:11:27.590" style="s2">the subject we&#39;re so anima possessed but</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.580" end="00:11:31.460" style="s2">but but but but but that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.590" end="00:11:33.680" style="s2">like something that gets guys very</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.460" end="00:11:36.170" style="s2">excited or something that make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.680" end="00:11:39.380" style="s2">because perhaps because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.170" end="00:11:41.930" style="s2">they&#39;re not actually giving birth yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.380" end="00:11:44.390" style="s2">biological birth but but they want to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.930" end="00:11:47.090" style="s2">involved in this process of giving birth</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.390" end="00:11:49.160" style="s2">to ideas or that&#39;s right well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.090" end="00:11:52.760" style="s2">that&#39;s the the only way in which police</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.160" end="00:11:54.290" style="s2">Asst is available to us is is you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.760" end="00:11:55.970" style="s2">and that&#39;s why there&#39;s such a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.290" end="00:11:58.970" style="s2">such a deep powerful</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.970" end="00:12:04.370" style="s2">that&#39;s why literal literal physical</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.970" end="00:12:06.290" style="s2">poesis and and artistic polices are so</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.370" end="00:12:08.390" style="s2">affined to one another if there&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.290" end="00:12:10.790" style="s2">powerful assonance between those things</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.390" end="00:12:14.210" style="s2">is because we have a sense in which they</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.790" end="00:12:18.050" style="s2">are they are there is a continuity of</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.210" end="00:12:19.900" style="s2">nature between physical birth and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.050" end="00:12:23.030" style="s2">kind of police that we associate with</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.900" end="00:12:25.280" style="s2">you know with with craftsmanship or or</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.030" end="00:12:27.140" style="s2">whatnot and that kind of the way that</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.280" end="00:12:29.060" style="s2">they&#39;re analogically bound to one</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.140" end="00:12:30.500" style="s2">another I think again is something that</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.060" end="00:12:33.910" style="s2">we find all the way back in Plato</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.500" end="00:12:39.170" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a very very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.910" end="00:12:45.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.170" end="00:12:47.870" style="s2">as though there&#39;s a symbolic embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.560" end="00:12:49.880" style="s2">of one in the other and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.870" end="00:12:52.760" style="s2">something about that symbolic embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.880" end="00:12:56.480" style="s2">there&#39;s some it&#39;s the the erotic</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.760" end="00:13:00.950" style="s2">symbolic embodiment of the of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.480" end="00:13:03.380" style="s2">notional and the somatic that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.950" end="00:13:05.210" style="s2">it&#39;s in a way it&#39;s indispensable and</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.380" end="00:13:07.730" style="s2">it&#39;s and that&#39;s often much of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.210" end="00:13:10.850" style="s2">been lost to us right because of our</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.730" end="00:13:12.560" style="s2">many modern many modern dualisms and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.850" end="00:13:13.360" style="s2">on and and all and all kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.560" end="00:13:15.309" style="s2">have contributed</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.360" end="00:13:18.639" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to oversimplify the problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.309" end="00:13:20.769" style="s2">or or foisted on any one perpetrator</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.639" end="00:13:22.569" style="s2">because that&#39;s often unfair to and</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.769" end="00:13:25.089" style="s2">people do that a lot but I think that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.569" end="00:13:26.350" style="s2">find ourselves so disembodied like</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.089" end="00:13:27.970" style="s2">you&#39;re young you and I were talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.350" end="00:13:31.420" style="s2">about that in our letter correspondence</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.970" end="00:13:34.059" style="s2">right so yeah and there&#39;s this longing</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.420" end="00:13:36.279" style="s2">for intimacy is another word that I I</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.059" end="00:13:39.850" style="s2">see comes up a lot in your discussions</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.279" end="00:13:42.730" style="s2">is this intimacy and and and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.850" end="00:13:44.709" style="s2">the well the relief that I felt in</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.730" end="00:13:47.220" style="s2">discussing this this letter what are you</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.709" end="00:13:49.660" style="s2">doing this letter process with you</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.220" end="00:13:53.019" style="s2">wasn&#39;t was to be able to communicate in</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.660" end="00:13:56.049" style="s2">that way with the person I was find that</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.019" end="00:13:59.049" style="s2">a lot of communication you know has</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.049" end="00:14:03.489" style="s2">agendas to it and and that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.049" end="00:14:05.529" style="s2">and and it&#39;s it&#39;s very refreshing to try</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.489" end="00:14:09.489" style="s2">to enter a space of just pure creativity</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.529" end="00:14:11.860" style="s2">and whatever you happen to be doing and</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.489" end="00:14:14.619" style="s2">you know I was being set up with this</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.860" end="00:14:16.509" style="s2">other person and right away it became a</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.619" end="00:14:18.309" style="s2">tagging istic because apparently were</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.509" end="00:14:20.410" style="s2">supposed to be on have different points</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.309" end="00:14:21.850" style="s2">of view about something and it just</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.410" end="00:14:23.860" style="s2">became painful and I didn&#39;t want to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.850" end="00:14:26.259" style="s2">it but but there was something about</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.860" end="00:14:29.079" style="s2">about your writing that just it was like</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.259" end="00:14:30.339" style="s2">and you always use this metaphor in your</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.079" end="00:14:32.369" style="s2">writing - you always talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.339" end="00:14:36.879" style="s2">breath I felt like I could breathe</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.369" end="00:14:38.829" style="s2">within your your world of writing so so</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.879" end="00:14:40.569" style="s2">that was very nice and also felt thank</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.829" end="00:14:43.119" style="s2">you for so I was felt that there I felt</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.569" end="00:14:44.949" style="s2">that way too I was for you thank you and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.119" end="00:14:47.290" style="s2">I felt that I could I could I could take</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.949" end="00:14:52.259" style="s2">something of yours and expand on it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.290" end="00:14:54.939" style="s2">and that there was some kind of real</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.259" end="00:14:56.860" style="s2">something really happening which it</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.939" end="00:15:01.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t always really happen in in your</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.860" end="00:15:02.559" style="s2">sort of daily life and that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.600" end="00:15:04.899" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.559" end="00:15:07.269" style="s2">especially virtually I mean it almost</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.899" end="00:15:08.860" style="s2">never happened on online this course</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.269" end="00:15:10.540" style="s2">it&#39;s the kind of thing that often only</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.860" end="00:15:12.419" style="s2">happens when people are mutually</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.540" end="00:15:15.339" style="s2">disarmed by their physical proximity</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.419" end="00:15:16.720" style="s2">right there&#39;s some there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.339" end="00:15:19.899" style="s2">humbling about being in physical</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.720" end="00:15:23.139" style="s2">proximity to somebody because you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.899" end="00:15:26.740" style="s2">to acknowledge that there is more in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.139" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">offing of the situation then there is</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.740" end="00:15:30.880" style="s2">the semantic content of your discourse</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:33.040" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s what physical</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.880" end="00:15:36.940" style="s2">proximity does to people that disarms</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.040" end="00:15:39.399" style="s2">their more invective impulses sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.940" end="00:15:41.080" style="s2">so I&#39;m not if not all the time but when</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.399" end="00:15:42.700" style="s2">when when people get together to</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.080" end="00:15:44.320" style="s2">discourse I think because there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.700" end="00:15:46.209" style="s2">much in the dynamic of the physical</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.320" end="00:15:48.690" style="s2">confrontation that has nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.209" end="00:15:53.830" style="s2">with the propositional content mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.690" end="00:15:56.050" style="s2">that that marginalia that that that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.830" end="00:15:59.350" style="s2">intuitive marginalia the edge of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.050" end="00:16:01.450" style="s2">conversation gets to spill in to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.350" end="00:16:02.920" style="s2">dynamic a little bit more mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.450" end="00:16:04.660" style="s2">which is something also true if now the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.920" end="00:16:06.279" style="s2">video conferencing that we&#39;re able to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.660" end="00:16:07.600" style="s2">which is also nice right because you</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.279" end="00:16:10.060" style="s2">have all of the things that aren&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.600" end="00:16:11.740" style="s2">propositional content some of some of</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.060" end="00:16:13.660" style="s2">that at least can then pour in some of</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.740" end="00:16:15.850" style="s2">it all of that of course is oh yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.660" end="00:16:19.480" style="s2">all of that context of course is is</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.850" end="00:16:21.520" style="s2">removed from the virtual interaction and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.480" end="00:16:26.980" style="s2">I think that&#39;s that&#39;s often why it</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.520" end="00:16:29.050" style="s2">becomes it becomes opaque because it</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.980" end="00:16:32.440" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s nothing - there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.050" end="00:16:34.270" style="s2">nothing - there&#39;s no humiliating again I</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.440" end="00:16:36.540" style="s2">mean it in a sense of like humility</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.270" end="00:16:41.860" style="s2">there&#39;s no yeah there&#39;s nothing - to</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.540" end="00:16:45.940" style="s2">properly to properly espouse humility</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.860" end="00:16:47.620" style="s2">within it and and that&#39;s why right and</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.940" end="00:16:49.839" style="s2">the video gives you a bit of that not</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.620" end="00:16:53.279" style="s2">the whole picture but a bit but it does</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.839" end="00:16:55.930" style="s2">also yeah it disarms you in a way and</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.279" end="00:16:58.180" style="s2">which which you you kind of feel like</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.930" end="00:17:00.670" style="s2">you&#39;re like a false god on the internet</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.180" end="00:17:02.410" style="s2">and on some level you&#39;re like a demigod</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.670" end="00:17:05.620" style="s2">right you feel like you can do all that</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.410" end="00:17:07.569" style="s2">you have all this power yeah yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.620" end="00:17:09.970" style="s2">you don&#39;t you but but but then it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.569" end="00:17:12.910" style="s2">a sterile kind of power until it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.970" end="00:17:14.800" style="s2">grounded in intimacy and no maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.910" end="00:17:16.959" style="s2">why you can this birthing let metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.800" end="00:17:20.260" style="s2">keeps coming up because we&#39;re so longing</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.959" end="00:17:22.689" style="s2">to be grounded in intimacy because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.260" end="00:17:25.059" style="s2">so pulled out of it all the time I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.689" end="00:17:28.960" style="s2">so i think that i think sterile is</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.059" end="00:17:31.170" style="s2">exactly the right word for the for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.960" end="00:17:33.850" style="s2">virtual discourse most of it most</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.170" end="00:17:36.730" style="s2">because because the people are to</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.850" end="00:17:38.830" style="s2">themselves on like on I mean social</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.730" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">media is an easy whipping boy but you</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.830" end="00:17:43.320" style="s2">know it&#39;s easy it&#39;s an easy whipping</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:46.110" style="s2">for a reason I suppose the way people</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.320" end="00:17:48.240" style="s2">are on something like Facebook or</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.110" end="00:17:50.250" style="s2">comparable social media outlets is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.240" end="00:17:53.100" style="s2">you know they&#39;ve they&#39;ve conceived of</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.250" end="00:17:56.899" style="s2">themselves as something something fixed</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.100" end="00:18:00.149" style="s2">inside time that has that is bounded</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.899" end="00:18:04.820" style="s2">that is bounded and has a particular</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.149" end="00:18:08.700" style="s2">essence of identity that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.820" end="00:18:10.679" style="s2">relatively unmoved for so now that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.700" end="00:18:13.769" style="s2">were talking about it a persona yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.679" end="00:18:16.289" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re creating a persona all the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.769" end="00:18:18.480" style="s2">time you&#39;re sort of all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.289" end="00:18:20.220" style="s2">that&#39;s why there&#39;s no there&#39;s and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.480" end="00:18:22.440" style="s2">that&#39;s why at the end there&#39;s a brittle</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.220" end="00:18:25.049" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a brittleness to that</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.440" end="00:18:26.789" style="s2">persona because we all know that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.049" end="00:18:29.309" style="s2">not real um</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.789" end="00:18:32.159" style="s2">but yet people continue to invest in</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.309" end="00:18:34.259" style="s2">them and I think riddle is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.159" end="00:18:37.230" style="s2">strong enough a word I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.259" end="00:18:39.110" style="s2">there&#39;s a violence even and you know how</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.230" end="00:18:43.379" style="s2">people communicate these days like</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.110" end="00:18:46.049" style="s2">anyway yes no you&#39;re right yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.379" end="00:18:48.899" style="s2">right you&#39;re right yeah so whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.049" end="00:18:52.169" style="s2">opposite of fertile intimate interaction</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.899" end="00:18:53.580" style="s2">is that&#39;s the kind that happens that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.169" end="00:18:55.110" style="s2">the kind of how that happens on these</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.580" end="00:18:56.850" style="s2">platforms because all we&#39;re concerned</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.110" end="00:18:59.039" style="s2">about is how we appear like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.850" end="00:19:02.279" style="s2">problem it&#39;s like all we&#39;re concerned</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.039" end="00:19:06.750" style="s2">about is how is semblance you know how</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.279" end="00:19:09.509" style="s2">we seem and and that&#39;s not like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.750" end="00:19:12.830" style="s2">just not a sustainable way to live it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.509" end="00:19:15.980" style="s2">just not it I mean it has very specific</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.830" end="00:19:23.879" style="s2">instrumental utility at times word</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.980" end="00:19:27.600" style="s2">exercising you know certain you know you</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.879" end="00:19:30.600" style="s2">have to play that it has I get the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.600" end="00:19:32.490" style="s2">basic and the most basic functional</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.600" end="00:19:35.669" style="s2">sense it has some utility but as a way</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.490" end="00:19:37.860" style="s2">of investing of yourself I think it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.669" end="00:19:41.190" style="s2">think it&#39;s fundamentally misguided and</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.860" end="00:19:44.190" style="s2">I&#39;m actually not convinced people make</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.190" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">many arguments some more compelling than</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.190" end="00:19:49.470" style="s2">others for why the existence of these</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.039" end="00:19:54.950" style="s2">virtual tools I mean specifically the</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.470" end="00:19:54.950" style="s2">social media kind why they&#39;re virtues</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.220" end="00:20:01.889" style="s2">whether whether virtues redeem their</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.029" end="00:20:04.109" style="s2">their moral failings and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.889" end="00:20:08.549" style="s2">convinced at all that any of their</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.109" end="00:20:11.340" style="s2">virtues are sufficiently redemptive to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.549" end="00:20:13.919" style="s2">justify their existence frankly it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.340" end="00:20:15.989" style="s2">bit of a hard it&#39;s a bit of a it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.919" end="00:20:20.909" style="s2">of a hard line to take but I really well</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.989" end="00:20:22.859" style="s2">I think I think it&#39;s 99% noise and if it</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.909" end="00:20:25.619" style="s2">ever gets to a level where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.859" end="00:20:28.200" style="s2">little bit more signal than noise or a</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.619" end="00:20:30.840" style="s2">little bit more good way of putting it a</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.200" end="00:20:36.330" style="s2">little bit more content and and and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.840" end="00:20:40.049" style="s2">bullshit where you know and then just a</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.330" end="00:20:41.970" style="s2">little bit more wood wood wood but at</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.049" end="00:20:43.769" style="s2">least at least allow for something like</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.970" end="00:20:45.929" style="s2">I think what you guys are doing actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.769" end="00:20:49.679" style="s2">in your and your four-way conversations</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.929" end="00:20:51.899" style="s2">that that strikes me as something new in</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.679" end="00:20:55.529" style="s2">the positive sense because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.899" end="00:20:57.179" style="s2">you&#39;re creating a a four person mind or</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.529" end="00:21:00.570" style="s2">something you&#39;re creating a team a team</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.179" end="00:21:02.369" style="s2">mind and it&#39;s like like John was saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.570" end="00:21:03.599" style="s2">in that conversation that he probably</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.369" end="00:21:06.119" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have thought of that without</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.599" end="00:21:07.710" style="s2">the other three people being there so if</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.119" end="00:21:09.419" style="s2">that that kind of that mech that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.710" end="00:21:11.549" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of mind-blowing to me</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.419" end="00:21:13.349" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s like that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.549" end="00:21:16.440" style="s2">that that&#39;s the sort of counter reaction</p>

<p begin="00:21:36.149" end="00:21:40.440" style="s2">that I think I I do hold that obviously</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.639" end="00:21:41.999" style="s2">I would have to otherwise this exercise</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.440" end="00:21:45.749" style="s2">would be hypocritical of me I do hold</p>

<p begin="00:25:02.300" end="00:25:11.780" style="s2">okay what was this yeah so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.800" end="00:25:15.470" style="s2">you know I I was I was I have so I have</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.780" end="00:25:18.950" style="s2">a very sort of the matrix of my family</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.470" end="00:25:21.770" style="s2">life was very encouraging and the proper</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.950" end="00:25:25.910" style="s2">sense of the term and and also just very</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.770" end="00:25:29.120" style="s2">just very affectionate and very and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.910" end="00:25:31.130" style="s2">open hoping in the sense that you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.120" end="00:25:33.500" style="s2">there weren&#39;t a lot of aside from just</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.130" end="00:25:38.260" style="s2">being generally you know responsible and</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.500" end="00:25:40.870" style="s2">and competent and being just being</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.260" end="00:25:44.210" style="s2">adjusting to the degree that he become a</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.870" end="00:25:45.890" style="s2">a well-put-together person there weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.210" end="00:25:48.230" style="s2">a lot of there weren&#39;t a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.890" end="00:25:49.850" style="s2">prescribed expectations as to what I</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.230" end="00:25:51.740" style="s2">needed to do or be and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.850" end="00:25:53.510" style="s2">thing and also that we were back rounded</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.740" end="00:25:57.140" style="s2">religiously insofar as the family was</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.510" end="00:25:59.480" style="s2">Catholic but but it was Catholic in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.140" end="00:26:02.510" style="s2">very equivocal sense of the term I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.480" end="00:26:04.250" style="s2">or perhaps a very typical sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.510" end="00:26:05.330" style="s2">term I think for many Canadian Catholics</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.250" end="00:26:07.490" style="s2">you know you have the Christmas and</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.330" end="00:26:12.010" style="s2">Easter Catholics and we were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.490" end="00:26:14.390" style="s2">that but my my parents are both</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.010" end="00:26:16.280" style="s2">religiously open by disposition which</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.390" end="00:26:19.030" style="s2">means that they had an appreciation for</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.280" end="00:26:21.830" style="s2">the fact that it was and is important</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.030" end="00:26:23.810" style="s2">but also that the way that it is going</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.830" end="00:26:26.470" style="s2">to be articulated in our lives doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.810" end="00:26:31.130" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.470" end="00:26:34.340" style="s2">overweening or or or or tyrannical or</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.130" end="00:26:38.059" style="s2">dogmatic so I think I was lucky too</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.340" end="00:26:40.720" style="s2">have I was lucky too right off the bat I</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.059" end="00:26:43.970" style="s2">was raised into a family that had a</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.720" end="00:26:46.220" style="s2">relatively well-adjusted idea of what of</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.970" end="00:26:48.320" style="s2">the fact that that a religious a</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.220" end="00:26:53.990" style="s2">religious life and education and</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.320" end="00:26:59.360" style="s2">literacy was important but that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.990" end="00:27:06.529" style="s2">that it had to be it also had to be had</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.360" end="00:27:08.090" style="s2">to be mitigated by by by a realization</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.529" end="00:27:10.820" style="s2">that there you know there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.090" end="00:27:15.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.820" end="00:27:17.870" style="s2">that&#39;s not working right now about it so</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.830" end="00:27:21.409" style="s2">I think I you know I kind of got that</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.870" end="00:27:25.070" style="s2">that was like that I kind of came with</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.409" end="00:27:30.260" style="s2">that and and I think that was that</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.070" end="00:27:34.250" style="s2">disposed me from the beginning to be to</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.260" end="00:27:35.870" style="s2">be I think what it did actually when I</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.250" end="00:27:38.120" style="s2">think about it when I think of my sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.870" end="00:27:42.440" style="s2">of my younger self I think and not that</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.120" end="00:27:44.899" style="s2">I know I could certainly become I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.440" end="00:27:47.090" style="s2">know like like the best yeah like it</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.899" end="00:27:51.260" style="s2">like any other young man I could be very</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.090" end="00:27:54.279" style="s2">I could be very sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.260" end="00:28:01.370" style="s2">recalcitrant about about these things</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.279" end="00:28:03.020" style="s2">but I think that ultimately I think that</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.370" end="00:28:05.809" style="s2">my foot my family life did is it</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.020" end="00:28:07.429" style="s2">indoctrinated me and indoctrination me</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.809" end="00:28:10.279" style="s2">inoculated me wow what a Freudian slip</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.429" end="00:28:18.230" style="s2">it inoculated me against the dangers of</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.279" end="00:28:21.289" style="s2">both of both fundamentalism and a</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.230" end="00:28:23.179" style="s2">Fletcher gotcha I think that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.289" end="00:28:25.309" style="s2">did like the great the great gifts that</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.179" end="00:28:29.779" style="s2">my parents for instance gave me I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.309" end="00:28:32.029" style="s2">among many of the great gifts implicit</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.779" end="00:28:35.630" style="s2">me they didn&#39;t close it talking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.029" end="00:28:38.419" style="s2">dogmatic religion or no or to all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.630" end="00:28:41.360" style="s2">poetry from you with you know the sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.419" end="00:28:43.960" style="s2">of positivist yeah they didn&#39;t they were</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.360" end="00:28:48.549" style="s2">not hostile toward it but they were also</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.960" end="00:28:54.909" style="s2">not they were also know</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.549" end="00:28:59.529" style="s2">not yeah they were not mired in problems</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.909" end="00:29:01.989" style="s2">of literalism and and so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.529" end="00:29:04.299" style="s2">that kind of got now beyond that I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.989" end="00:29:06.369" style="s2">that they largely left me alone to to</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.299" end="00:29:07.830" style="s2">figure this out for myself but I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.369" end="00:29:09.940" style="s2">that that was a heck of a good start</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.830" end="00:29:15.369" style="s2">because and that I had an appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.940" end="00:29:20.379" style="s2">for all that I didn&#39;t know and and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.369" end="00:29:23.109" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t there wasn&#39;t but I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.379" end="00:29:26.979" style="s2">prescribed - I wasn&#39;t prescribed to dawn</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.109" end="00:29:28.809" style="s2">any specific garb or affiliate with his</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.979" end="00:29:30.399" style="s2">was avid tribe and that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.809" end="00:29:32.979" style="s2">and now what that did is I think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.399" end="00:29:36.999" style="s2">gave me a bit of a feeling of Mattacks</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.979" end="00:29:40.119" style="s2">ooh a feeling of being in between that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.999" end="00:29:43.989" style="s2">that&#39;s still I still have and I struggle</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.119" end="00:29:45.879" style="s2">with it it isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t day I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.989" end="00:29:49.019" style="s2">think it has advantage to me in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.879" end="00:29:51.789" style="s2">ways but it has also it has also</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.019" end="00:29:54.609" style="s2">challenged me in a lot of ways because</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.789" end="00:29:57.369" style="s2">even now I&#39;m always in between I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.609" end="00:30:00.999" style="s2">always always in between categories of</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.369" end="00:30:02.859" style="s2">thinking and that&#39;s very very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.999" end="00:30:05.229" style="s2">that&#39;s right I mean you wanted like</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.859" end="00:30:07.570" style="s2">that&#39;s my story basically every part of</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.229" end="00:30:10.299" style="s2">every leg every leg of the journey is</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.570" end="00:30:12.700" style="s2">simply another version of being in</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.299" end="00:30:15.309" style="s2">between categories of thinking and in</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.700" end="00:30:19.119" style="s2">between in between disciplines in</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.309" end="00:30:21.999" style="s2">between commitments in between camps and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.119" end="00:30:25.959" style="s2">I just perpetually perpetual in between</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.999" end="00:30:28.349" style="s2">this of course now with a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.959" end="00:30:30.509" style="s2">eff a little bit a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.349" end="00:30:33.579" style="s2">philosophically and literate I</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.509" end="00:30:35.709" style="s2">understand that there&#39;s some there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.579" end="00:30:37.419" style="s2">symbolic significance to being in</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.709" end="00:30:39.700" style="s2">between and I think this is why I always</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.419" end="00:30:41.469" style="s2">come back to the the nature of Eros that</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.700" end="00:30:43.929" style="s2">hermetic nature of Eros right for the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.469" end="00:30:45.489" style="s2">diamond by the socratic diamond as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.929" end="00:30:47.499" style="s2">perpetual in betweenness and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.489" end="00:30:50.589" style="s2">identified very very very closely with</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.499" end="00:30:52.690" style="s2">that my friend Alexander talks about a</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.589" end="00:30:54.879" style="s2">shamanic caste he does something called</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.690" end="00:30:56.649" style="s2">no-no madala G where he looks at early</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.879" end="00:30:58.719" style="s2">tribes and he said he says there&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.649" end="00:31:00.750" style="s2">4% of the population there kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.719" end="00:31:03.450" style="s2">between they go in between tribes</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.750" end="00:31:05.280" style="s2">you know they&#39;re they could be diplomats</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.450" end="00:31:07.980" style="s2">or they could be you know they could be</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.280" end="00:31:09.540" style="s2">priests well more like shamans or now</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.980" end="00:31:11.130" style="s2">they would go in between oh they would</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.540" end="00:31:12.720" style="s2">always be the end right well because</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.130" end="00:31:17.430" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t yeah it wouldn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.720" end="00:31:20.970" style="s2">fixed you know well that their role</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.430" end="00:31:23.490" style="s2">would be would be that would be would</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.970" end="00:31:25.170" style="s2">would not be a fixed role within the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.490" end="00:31:27.320" style="s2">tribe but somebody who could go outside</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.170" end="00:31:30.600" style="s2">the tribe and talk to other tribes and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.320" end="00:31:32.430" style="s2">mm-hmm that makes any sense it does it</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.600" end="00:31:35.280" style="s2">makes a lot of sense I can t very much</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.430" end="00:31:36.960" style="s2">relate to that as well and you yeah do</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.280" end="00:31:37.530" style="s2">you feel that of yourself as well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.960" end="00:31:39.960" style="s2">definitely</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.530" end="00:31:42.810" style="s2">yeah yeah because well first of all I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.960" end="00:31:45.030" style="s2">in between by virtue of living in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.810" end="00:31:48.210" style="s2">foreign country so I&#39;m in between Canada</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.030" end="00:31:50.580" style="s2">and horse and I&#39;m in between in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.210" end="00:31:52.380" style="s2">sense that you know I&#39;ve been a</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.580" end="00:31:55.050" style="s2">practicing Buddhist since I was in my</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.380" end="00:31:56.640" style="s2">20s so and I&#39;m in a Christian you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.050" end="00:31:59.430" style="s2">and I have a Christian you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.640" end="00:32:03.870" style="s2">worldview so so I&#39;m in-between sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.430" end="00:32:05.370" style="s2">you know sort of that and when I when I</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.870" end="00:32:08.130" style="s2">hear you talk about that and want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.370" end="00:32:10.020" style="s2">hear I hear John talk about that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.130" end="00:32:12.780" style="s2">religion of without the religion or</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.020" end="00:32:15.750" style="s2">something like that it&#39;s like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.780" end="00:32:18.420" style="s2">I think being an in-between person is</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.750" end="00:32:20.070" style="s2">somebody who sort of has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.420" end="00:32:23.010" style="s2">sympathy for a lot of different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.070" end="00:32:25.200" style="s2">people and different views of worldviews</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.010" end="00:32:28.500" style="s2">and and sort of relates to the world</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.200" end="00:32:30.570" style="s2">through through a kind of kind of I</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.500" end="00:32:33.840" style="s2">guess you know just sort of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.570" end="00:32:36.660" style="s2">sympathy rather than then judgment or if</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.840" end="00:32:40.530" style="s2">that makes any sense I think it does I</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.660" end="00:32:44.640" style="s2">think it I think flitting in between</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.530" end="00:32:47.720" style="s2">different different camps does give you</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.640" end="00:32:47.720" style="s2">a a certain</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.420" end="00:32:53.860" style="s2">oh yeah I think it requires a little I</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.640" end="00:32:57.870" style="s2">think it requires a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.860" end="00:33:04.240" style="s2">pliability and and and flexibility and</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.870" end="00:33:06.790" style="s2">agree and agreeable agreeableness I have</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.240" end="00:33:08.470" style="s2">over hats I&#39;m very low on that test</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.790" end="00:33:11.050" style="s2">actually I&#39;m are you well then</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.470" end="00:33:12.970" style="s2">interesting okay that&#39;s a medicine I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.050" end="00:33:16.660" style="s2">lower I&#39;m lower probably lower than you</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.970" end="00:33:18.820" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m not I&#39;m not an in-between</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.660" end="00:33:22.540" style="s2">diplomat type of person I&#39;m in between</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.820" end="00:33:24.160" style="s2">and in the sense of of being probably in</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.540" end="00:33:26.740" style="s2">a more ID tagging istic way than you are</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.160" end="00:33:29.280" style="s2">like I refuse to be this or that right</p>

<p begin="00:33:57.640" end="00:34:02.530" style="s2">rejecting rejecting the premise of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.470" end="00:34:03.910" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s like you&#39;re wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.530" end="00:34:06.730" style="s2">you&#39;re wrong because the question is</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.910" end="00:34:09.340" style="s2">wrong so sorry I&#39;m outside the arena on</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.730" end="00:34:11.880" style="s2">this one yeah I die yeah I have a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.340" end="00:34:13.960" style="s2">that I have a bit of that obdurate</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.880" end="00:34:18.520" style="s2">temperament to when it comes to just</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.960" end="00:34:22.720" style="s2">refusing participation in fact it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.520" end="00:34:24.850" style="s2">funny entering into this world this this</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.720" end="00:34:26.320" style="s2">world of this world of discourse that</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.850" end="00:34:28.900" style="s2">you and I are instantiating in this</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.320" end="00:34:34.530" style="s2">conversation I had a lot of apprehension</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.900" end="00:34:39.370" style="s2">about doing it because yeah - right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.530" end="00:34:41.950" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s well because it had</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.370" end="00:34:47.260" style="s2">all the dangers of all the dangers that</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.950" end="00:34:49.270" style="s2">I was always so weary of I was just</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.260" end="00:34:50.470" style="s2">talking about this with a friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.270" end="00:34:52.720" style="s2">the other day I feel like I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.470" end="00:34:54.460" style="s2">alternating between the dangerous of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.720" end="00:34:57.040" style="s2">imposter syndrome dangers and then the</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.460" end="00:35:03.010" style="s2">inflation dangers and so terrified of</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.040" end="00:35:07.450" style="s2">both of them that that I often my</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.010" end="00:35:09.760" style="s2">resolution often defaults into and into</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.450" end="00:35:12.910" style="s2">some kind of some form of abstinence</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.760" end="00:35:15.160" style="s2">which is not a you know it is an</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.910" end="00:35:17.050" style="s2">instinct and not a properly</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.160" end="00:35:19.060" style="s2">contemplative solution which is why I</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.050" end="00:35:21.700" style="s2">think the foray into these discourses</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.060" end="00:35:24.280" style="s2">for me has been helpful yeah I need any</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.700" end="00:35:24.730" style="s2">disposition anyway you do it anyway</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.280" end="00:35:27.070" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.730" end="00:35:28.930" style="s2">even though somehow I remember just the</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.070" end="00:35:30.940" style="s2">first kind of video conversation I have</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.930" end="00:35:34.120" style="s2">with people feeling this incredible like</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.940" end="00:35:36.370" style="s2">resistance to the whole thing like with</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.120" end="00:35:37.660" style="s2">the earphones and in the screens and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.370" end="00:35:39.400" style="s2">everything it&#39;s just like what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.660" end="00:35:41.410" style="s2">is going on here and what yeah what am i</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.400" end="00:35:43.300" style="s2">doing why am I doing this and what is</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.410" end="00:35:45.640" style="s2">this it&#39;s like alien territory or</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.300" end="00:35:47.860" style="s2">something and that&#39;s right I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.640" end="00:35:49.540" style="s2">more comfortable with it as time goes by</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.860" end="00:35:50.980" style="s2">but I&#39;m not comfortable with it I</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.540" end="00:35:53.590" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say I was comfortable with it I</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.980" end="00:35:58.150" style="s2">would say I said I say over time it</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.590" end="00:35:59.860" style="s2">becomes a medium that that I can swim in</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.150" end="00:36:03.730" style="s2">a little bit but right in the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.860" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">of yeah it feels it feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.730" end="00:36:09.550" style="s2">struggle right</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:11.410" style="s2">well your your sort of your your your</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.550" end="00:36:13.990" style="s2">courage and toleration of it I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.410" end="00:36:16.030" style="s2">exceeds mine because you I think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.990" end="00:36:18.580" style="s2">actually entered into discussions with</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.030" end="00:36:21.880" style="s2">people that are that are like overtly</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.580" end="00:36:27.400" style="s2">opponent conversations right yeah have</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.880" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">you done yeah yeah I&#39;m not I&#39;m not yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.400" end="00:36:31.600" style="s2">I I tend to I tend to have a fighting</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:33.820" style="s2">spirit with people yeah that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.600" end="00:36:35.080" style="s2">yeah right right so maybe that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.820" end="00:36:38.230" style="s2">the temperamental difference so we were</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.080" end="00:36:41.440" style="s2">just yeah sort of continent on - yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.230" end="00:36:43.300" style="s2">yeah because I think that that a</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.440" end="00:36:45.010" style="s2">conversation at least a public</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.300" end="00:36:47.980" style="s2">conversation that&#39;s inflected with</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.010" end="00:36:49.750" style="s2">genuine debate yeah I mean it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.980" end="00:36:51.790" style="s2">thing if it&#39;s if it&#39;s in the socratic if</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.750" end="00:36:54.220" style="s2">it&#39;s in the if it&#39;s in the Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.790" end="00:36:56.440" style="s2">spirit of challenge for the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.220" end="00:36:58.600" style="s2">resituated yeah that&#39;s one thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.440" end="00:37:03.460" style="s2">great that&#39;s just part of that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.600" end="00:37:05.560" style="s2">that&#39;s part of philosophy but if it&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.460" end="00:37:07.890" style="s2">well if John John John always calls it</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.560" end="00:37:13.870" style="s2">Philo an Ikea if it&#39;s if it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.890" end="00:37:16.380" style="s2">if it&#39;s a if it&#39;s a game that is if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.870" end="00:37:19.890" style="s2">a game that&#39;s going to figure a victor</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.380" end="00:37:23.279" style="s2">then I&#39;m I&#39;m just disinterested who</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.890" end="00:37:25.109" style="s2">cares about winning yeah yeah yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.279" end="00:37:27.390" style="s2">both in both lose as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.109" end="00:37:28.979" style="s2">concerned like do you know not and now</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.390" end="00:37:34.910" style="s2">it&#39;s funny I I and I don&#39;t know how I</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.979" end="00:37:34.910" style="s2">feel I don&#39;t know how I feel about I</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.269" end="00:37:42.269" style="s2">mean so much of the academic culture is</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.029" end="00:37:44.789" style="s2">is frames its discursive arenas in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.269" end="00:37:51.019" style="s2">form of debates that have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.789" end="00:37:53.819" style="s2">winners or losers and I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.019" end="00:37:57.119" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that whole enterprise is</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.819" end="00:37:59.729" style="s2">just watched and should just be really</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.119" end="00:38:02.849" style="s2">quit right or or if there is some</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.729" end="00:38:04.789" style="s2">utility to it it has its place and its</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.849" end="00:38:07.079" style="s2">place has just become inflated and</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.789" end="00:38:09.150" style="s2">encompassing I&#39;m not sure how I feel</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.079" end="00:38:11.940" style="s2">about that yet but I think I might have</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.150" end="00:38:13.950" style="s2">an insight into that well anyway I often</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.940" end="00:38:16.559" style="s2">bring in a you know masculinity I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.950" end="00:38:18.960" style="s2">talked a lot about masculinity often</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.559" end="00:38:24.839" style="s2">because it&#39;s such a taboo topic and and</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.960" end="00:38:26.069" style="s2">and nobody likes to talk about it and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.839" end="00:38:30.150" style="s2">think that I think there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.069" end="00:38:32.400" style="s2">about about guys men who they need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.150" end="00:38:34.229" style="s2">fight on some level sometimes in some</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.400" end="00:38:37.319" style="s2">kind of a way and if they&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.229" end="00:38:38.940" style="s2">in an academic setting maybe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.319" end="00:38:41.160" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re not doing it in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.940" end="00:38:43.769" style="s2">setting of war like maybe there is sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.160" end="00:38:45.749" style="s2">of a healthy form of fight of a fight</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.769" end="00:38:47.369" style="s2">you know I know people who loved you</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.749" end="00:38:49.349" style="s2">know love that kind of thing I love to</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.369" end="00:38:51.960" style="s2">be a nag and get into it just get into a</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.349" end="00:38:53.789" style="s2">good scrap with somebody there&#39;s a place</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.960" end="00:38:56.130" style="s2">for it you&#39;re right it&#39;s important well</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.789" end="00:38:58.049" style="s2">because it&#39;s because implicitly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.130" end="00:38:59.910" style="s2">it&#39;s an inextricable part of our nature</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.049" end="00:39:01.979" style="s2">and it has to be exercised and</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.910" end="00:39:04.319" style="s2">integrated and so then the question</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.979" end="00:39:05.759" style="s2">becomes how do we integrate it let me</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.319" end="00:39:07.279" style="s2">ask part of what Peterson&#39;s project is</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.759" end="00:39:09.859" style="s2">right the especial of existential</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.279" end="00:39:12.299" style="s2">responsibility is about integrating</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.859" end="00:39:13.950" style="s2">integrating and situating aggression</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.299" end="00:39:16.140" style="s2">within the psyche in such a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.950" end="00:39:19.499" style="s2">becomes subordinate to the holistic hood</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.140" end="00:39:20.940" style="s2">of the self and I think that that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.499" end="00:39:23.009" style="s2">think that&#39;s a--that&#39;s a deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.940" end="00:39:25.739" style="s2">meaningful project deeply meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.009" end="00:39:29.280" style="s2">project I think my sense is though that</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.739" end="00:39:31.950" style="s2">it&#39;s a project that cannot be conflated</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.280" end="00:39:34.050" style="s2">with the project of genuine</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.950" end="00:39:36.780" style="s2">philosophical inquiry like they have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.050" end="00:39:39.170" style="s2">somehow be disliked they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.780" end="00:39:41.970" style="s2">dispossessed of one another&#39;s influence</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.170" end="00:39:43.860" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know how that happens</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.970" end="00:39:44.940" style="s2">exactly like it&#39;s sort of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.860" end="00:39:46.110" style="s2">when you when you&#39;re when you&#39;re when</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.940" end="00:39:48.390" style="s2">you&#39;re when you&#39;re having a tiff with</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.110" end="00:39:51.510" style="s2">somebody sometimes it&#39;s good to sit down</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.390" end="00:39:53.580" style="s2">and just just throw down fight it out</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.510" end="00:39:56.700" style="s2">yeah maybe not physically or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.580" end="00:39:59.370" style="s2">physically but sit down have your</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.700" end="00:40:02.010" style="s2">argument but I think there has to be the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.370" end="00:40:06.480" style="s2">game you&#39;re playing is not a game of</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.010" end="00:40:11.070" style="s2">propositions it&#39;s a game of it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.480" end="00:40:13.050" style="s2">a baser game of resolving latent</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.070" end="00:40:16.050" style="s2">aggression that then threatens to engulf</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.050" end="00:40:19.530" style="s2">your propositional fingering and and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.050" end="00:40:22.140" style="s2">I think once you resolve that and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.530" end="00:40:23.940" style="s2">resolving it just means indulging it for</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.140" end="00:40:26.490" style="s2">a period of time legs within safe</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.940" end="00:40:28.200" style="s2">parameters but indulging it do that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.490" end="00:40:30.510" style="s2">what that&#39;s what wrestling it would be</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.200" end="00:40:32.160" style="s2">right it&#39;d be two people&#39;s right respect</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.510" end="00:40:34.320" style="s2">each other maybe even love each other a</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.160" end="00:40:36.240" style="s2">lot wrestling it out like physically I</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.320" end="00:40:38.850" style="s2">mean that&#39;s right that seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.240" end="00:40:41.400" style="s2">beautiful thing if the right spirit is</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.850" end="00:40:43.140" style="s2">is behind it that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.400" end="00:40:45.870" style="s2">that&#39;s right exactly and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.140" end="00:40:48.510" style="s2">combat of sports like things like MMA or</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.870" end="00:40:50.820" style="s2">you know boxing or like there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.510" end="00:40:53.340" style="s2">that they&#39;re so popular and it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.820" end="00:40:55.170" style="s2">like we found a relative I mean safe as</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.340" end="00:40:57.030" style="s2">a relative term I suppose I might get</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.170" end="00:41:00.120" style="s2">pretty intense but we found a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.030" end="00:41:03.740" style="s2">safe arena in which to exercise the</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.120" end="00:41:07.080" style="s2">aggressive impulse and and give it</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.740" end="00:41:09.960" style="s2">geometry within a game that can that can</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.080" end="00:41:11.370" style="s2">control it and that can that can</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.960" end="00:41:12.690" style="s2">integrate it now I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.370" end="00:41:14.850" style="s2">a perfect integration but it&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.690" end="00:41:16.500" style="s2">it&#39;s an attempt to do that and I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.850" end="00:41:19.020" style="s2">there&#39;s a place for that there&#39;s a place</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.500" end="00:41:21.840" style="s2">for that but I kind of think of it but</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.020" end="00:41:24.840" style="s2">more into personally and and more and</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.840" end="00:41:27.240" style="s2">more conversationally I think it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.840" end="00:41:28.560" style="s2">of like it&#39;s sort of like the difference</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.240" end="00:41:31.730" style="s2">you know you&#39;re you&#39;re having a conflict</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.560" end="00:41:34.770" style="s2">with somebody and there are genuine</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.730" end="00:41:36.810" style="s2">there are genuine like there are genuine</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.770" end="00:41:38.640" style="s2">perspectival problems that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.810" end="00:41:40.920" style="s2">that you need to sort out with one</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.640" end="00:41:42.930" style="s2">another you know you do need to engage</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.920" end="00:41:45.960" style="s2">to a Socratic process of under</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.930" end="00:41:50.309" style="s2">standing the situation so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.960" end="00:41:52.260" style="s2">so that you can that you can bring sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.309" end="00:41:54.390" style="s2">of elucidation to a problem but</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.260" end="00:41:55.890" style="s2">sometimes before you can actually do</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.390" end="00:41:57.720" style="s2">that like when two people meet each</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.890" end="00:42:01.550" style="s2">other yeah there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.720" end="00:42:05.280" style="s2">film that said that just came out called</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.550" end="00:42:09.720" style="s2">marriage story yeah I saw that yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.280" end="00:42:11.609" style="s2">yeah and thinking about that as well and</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.720" end="00:42:14.010" style="s2">there&#39;s you know there&#39;s that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.609" end="00:42:15.869" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.010" end="00:42:16.950" style="s2">there&#39;s so much I mean there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.869" end="00:42:18.720" style="s2">ambivalence it&#39;s fraught with</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.950" end="00:42:22.500" style="s2">ambivalence which is what makes it like</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.720" end="00:42:24.690" style="s2">very very similar its but and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.500" end="00:42:29.069" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m not married so you you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.690" end="00:42:30.839" style="s2">probably ear are you so you you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.069" end="00:42:33.210" style="s2">speak for experientially on this topic</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.839" end="00:42:36.230" style="s2">than I can but anyway I guess the point</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.210" end="00:42:39.630" style="s2">is that there&#39;s all this sort of latent</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.230" end="00:42:41.550" style="s2">aggression that that that exists sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.630" end="00:42:45.059" style="s2">beneath the surface but both parties</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.550" end="00:42:53.160" style="s2">both both both spouses are trying so</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.059" end="00:42:55.740" style="s2">hard to be as to touch me as my civilly</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.160" end="00:42:57.839" style="s2">as possible</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.740" end="00:42:59.549" style="s2">you know and then a guy just bangs his</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.839" end="00:43:01.380" style="s2">head against the wall enters the wall</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.549" end="00:43:03.720" style="s2">right right well then they had that</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.380" end="00:43:07.290" style="s2">scene where they nurse Throwdown and</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.720" end="00:43:09.180" style="s2">it&#39;s is ostensibly about resolving their</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.290" end="00:43:11.339" style="s2">circumstances and coming to a shared</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.180" end="00:43:13.740" style="s2">understanding but there&#39;s no hope of</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.339" end="00:43:16.829" style="s2">doing that until they have their</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.740" end="00:43:18.270" style="s2">opportunity to throw down and to tell</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.829" end="00:43:19.530" style="s2">one another how much they hate one</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.270" end="00:43:21.000" style="s2">another and how they&#39;ve ruined each</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.530" end="00:43:23.099" style="s2">other&#39;s lives and that they wish each</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.000" end="00:43:26.490" style="s2">other were dead and then once they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.099" end="00:43:28.170" style="s2">got that out of the way then from that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.490" end="00:43:30.750" style="s2">think this is no it&#39;s no coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.170" end="00:43:33.180" style="s2">from that from that point on it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.750" end="00:43:36.390" style="s2">a fulcrum for the story because after</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.180" end="00:43:40.309" style="s2">that point in the story they actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.390" end="00:43:44.220" style="s2">start to be able to cohere what around a</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.309" end="00:43:46.349" style="s2">more sustainable and viable model for</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.220" end="00:43:48.180" style="s2">their relationship going forward but</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.349" end="00:43:50.940" style="s2">they need to they need it to have that</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.180" end="00:43:52.890" style="s2">absolute Throwdown but the real</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.940" end="00:43:55.170" style="s2">aggression we&#39;re able to do that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.890" end="00:43:56.700" style="s2">real aggression is in to just the being</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.170" end="00:43:58.800" style="s2">nice all the time now</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.700" end="00:44:00.630" style="s2">the real aggression like the real</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.800" end="00:44:02.700" style="s2">aggression is before the actual physical</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.630" end="00:44:05.250" style="s2">aggression comes out yes yes self</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.700" end="00:44:06.930" style="s2">containment and which which Lee saw this</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.250" end="00:44:10.950" style="s2">self-hatred and then this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.930" end="00:44:12.960" style="s2">pussyfooting around and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.950" end="00:44:15.510" style="s2">everybody&#39;s trying to be Noble and you</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.960" end="00:44:18.060" style="s2">know they&#39;re both trying to be be</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.510" end="00:44:19.650" style="s2">something and yeah that&#39;s right it gets</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.060" end="00:44:21.060" style="s2">very painful until until that moment</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.650" end="00:44:23.460" style="s2">where you have this this physical</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.060" end="00:44:25.440" style="s2">release or this like that suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.460" end="00:44:28.890" style="s2">there&#39;s suddenly they can they can they</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.440" end="00:44:30.750" style="s2">have some reality or some yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.890" end="00:44:33.810" style="s2">right yeah yeah you need that like</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.750" end="00:44:38.990" style="s2">moment of just sheer that that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.810" end="00:44:41.250" style="s2">tempest of it because because they like</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.990" end="00:44:43.079" style="s2">they have to realign the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.250" end="00:44:47.490" style="s2">they&#39;re that kind of conversation just</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.079" end="00:44:50.400" style="s2">devolves into into into gladiatorial</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.490" end="00:44:52.740" style="s2">combat after a while is because they</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.400" end="00:44:54.750" style="s2">have to abandon the pretense that their</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.740" end="00:44:56.280" style="s2">conversation is about any of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.750" end="00:44:59.970" style="s2">propositions that they&#39;re making to</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.280" end="00:45:02.310" style="s2">unknown right and and the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.970" end="00:45:05.880" style="s2">propositional content simply serves to</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.310" end="00:45:08.880" style="s2">gesture to the the authentic source of</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.880" end="00:45:10.920" style="s2">the conflict and and and but they need</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.880" end="00:45:13.440" style="s2">they need to trade in exchange the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.920" end="00:45:16.020" style="s2">propositions in order to find their way</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.440" end="00:45:20.369" style="s2">to the crux of the conflict and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.020" end="00:45:23.460" style="s2">allow it to to to to emergent and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.369" end="00:45:26.250" style="s2">come forth and be aired and addressed</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.460" end="00:45:30.180" style="s2">properly so that after that point they</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.250" end="00:45:32.369" style="s2">can actually start to have to converse</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.180" end="00:45:35.369" style="s2">so they can have the proper Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.369" end="00:45:38.250" style="s2">dialogue you know so they&#39;re nothing</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.369" end="00:45:41.940" style="s2">do not just caught in these webs of you</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.250" end="00:45:44.609" style="s2">know self-doubt and you know trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.940" end="00:45:45.990" style="s2">be good or bad or whatever that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.609" end="00:45:48.390" style="s2">that&#39;s right and that&#39;s I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.990" end="00:45:50.819" style="s2">that&#39;s when subtext is rendered rendered</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.390" end="00:45:52.680" style="s2">well in any piece of art it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.819" end="00:45:54.569" style="s2">with that right it has to do with what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.680" end="00:45:56.040" style="s2">what really are we talking about when</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.569" end="00:45:58.680" style="s2">we&#39;re talking to one another right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.040" end="00:46:01.470" style="s2">are we are we are we talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.680" end="00:46:04.710" style="s2">relation that is epistemic ly oriented</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.470" end="00:46:07.109" style="s2">or are we talking about a relation that</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.710" end="00:46:08.819" style="s2">is that is that is adversarially</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.109" end="00:46:09.829" style="s2">oriented and if we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.819" end="00:46:11.779" style="s2">latter</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.829" end="00:46:13.819" style="s2">propositional content all its going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.779" end="00:46:16.069" style="s2">do is it&#39;s going to dig us in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.819" end="00:46:18.170" style="s2">direction of our of our adversarial</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.069" end="00:46:20.150" style="s2">tension so hopefully if we&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.170" end="00:46:24.079" style="s2">our lessons from that then we simply let</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.150" end="00:46:26.869" style="s2">the adversarial tension erupt yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.079" end="00:46:29.869" style="s2">have it stay so that we can move on and</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.869" end="00:46:32.239" style="s2">then maybe there&#39;s a yeah well we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.869" end="00:46:35.749" style="s2">to get it maybe this could this this</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.239" end="00:46:37.430" style="s2">touches on sort of the our original</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.749" end="00:46:40.609" style="s2">conversation which was about monsters</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.430" end="00:46:42.890" style="s2">right mmm no it touches on on you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.609" end="00:46:44.869" style="s2">being able to live with let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.890" end="00:46:47.479" style="s2">monster in yourself or being able to</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.869" end="00:46:50.989" style="s2">allow it to come out and to see it and</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.479" end="00:46:53.719" style="s2">because because if you bottle it up for</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.989" end="00:46:57.229" style="s2">your whole life you you know it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.719" end="00:46:59.660" style="s2">do damage to you on some level mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.229" end="00:47:03.319" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s right that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.660" end="00:47:06.289" style="s2">right that&#39;s exactly it will it will it</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.319" end="00:47:08.630" style="s2">will always mmm we&#39;re always possessed</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.289" end="00:47:11.390" style="s2">right and then the question is how are</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.630" end="00:47:16.099" style="s2">we possessed what&#39;s the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.390" end="00:47:21.680" style="s2">possession mmm yeah that&#39;s right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.099" end="00:47:23.779" style="s2">right that&#39;s right so let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.680" end="00:47:26.569" style="s2">maybe take this opportunity if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.779" end="00:47:27.859" style="s2">mind stretch it to kind of to turn to</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.569" end="00:47:30.049" style="s2">turn the attention a little bit in your</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.859" end="00:47:31.459" style="s2">day go for it oh all kinds of stuff</p>

<p begin="00:55:12.930" end="00:55:16.680" style="s2">experience because you you come to</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.850" end="00:55:19.890" style="s2">yourself in the throes of some some very</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.680" end="00:55:23.600" style="s2">meaningful exercised and then when you</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.890" end="00:55:25.920" style="s2">pass through it to the other side of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.600" end="00:55:30.270" style="s2">you&#39;re changed because you know that</p>

<p begin="00:55:45.870" end="00:55:49.650" style="s2">right rhythm you know caught in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.550" end="00:55:55.500" style="s2">right flow whatever whatever metaphor we</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.650" end="00:56:02.760" style="s2">may choose here it&#39;s a neck stasis of an</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.500" end="00:56:04.950" style="s2">experience but it also means that it it</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.760" end="00:56:08.940" style="s2">ruins much of the rest of your life</p>

<p begin="00:56:14.070" end="00:56:19.860" style="s2">gray and you know not interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.370" end="00:56:23.220" style="s2">yeah everything seems to be so inane and</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.860" end="00:56:24.960" style="s2">and dumb and banal by by comparison and</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.220" end="00:56:28.490" style="s2">and I struggle with that a lot I</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.960" end="00:56:33.560" style="s2">struggle with being overwhelmed by by</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.490" end="00:56:37.110" style="s2">over I mean meaningfully overwhelmed by</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.560" end="00:56:39.570" style="s2">by um by activities that seem to have</p>

<p begin="00:56:39.570" end="00:56:45.120" style="s2">eternal gestures and as it were right</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.230" end="00:56:47.580" style="s2">that partake of between the gestures</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.120" end="00:56:50.160" style="s2">that are better better better about the</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.580" end="00:56:52.880" style="s2">always as best Paul Fenech really say I</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.160" end="00:56:56.430" style="s2">love the way he makes that distinction</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.880" end="00:57:00.450" style="s2">but but then when you have to when you</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.430" end="00:57:03.660" style="s2">have to then come back into the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.450" end="00:57:05.190" style="s2">day-to-day yeah and that&#39;s the hard work</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.660" end="00:57:08.280" style="s2">actually I think in a way it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.190" end="00:57:10.740" style="s2">embodying that it&#39;s like yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.280" end="00:57:11.650" style="s2">really hard it&#39;s really hard to embody</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.740" end="00:57:15.310" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.650" end="00:57:20.770" style="s2">it is some people are very grounded and</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.310" end="00:57:24.820" style="s2">they they need to climb upwards you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.770" end="00:57:26.590" style="s2">other people are sort of in a sublime</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.820" end="00:57:28.630" style="s2">realm when they have to climb downwards</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.590" end="00:57:30.820" style="s2">into the body or something I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.630" end="00:57:33.760" style="s2">if that makes any sense I&#39;m just it does</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.820" end="00:57:35.050" style="s2">it does uh-huh it does and I think it</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.760" end="00:57:36.940" style="s2">has something to do with that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.050" end="00:57:38.820" style="s2">something to do with being neither here</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.940" end="00:57:41.350" style="s2">nor there that we were talking about -</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.820" end="00:57:47.980" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s something about - just</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.350" end="00:57:51.930" style="s2">being um I think that that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.980" end="00:57:59.650" style="s2">something simultaneously freeing and</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.930" end="00:58:05.650" style="s2">challenging about having a assuming the</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.650" end="00:58:08.530" style="s2">identity of uh of an amateur when it</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.650" end="00:58:10.510" style="s2">comes to these kinds of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.530" end="00:58:14.830" style="s2">and I and I still think of myself that</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.510" end="00:58:16.860" style="s2">way um so do you know the Italian root</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.830" end="00:58:20.680" style="s2">of the word amateur right</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.860" end="00:58:22.660" style="s2">it&#39;s like mature is something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.680" end="00:58:25.110" style="s2">love being a lover of something right</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.660" end="00:58:27.430" style="s2">right no I&#39;d forgotten that</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.110" end="00:58:29.770" style="s2">thank you for reminding me of that yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.430" end="00:58:33.970" style="s2">yes something rather than a professional</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.770" end="00:58:36.570" style="s2">right uh-huh yeah right right yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.970" end="00:58:40.810" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.570" end="00:58:44.530" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s right so that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.810" end="00:58:46.840" style="s2">that bespeaks the point beautifully but</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.530" end="00:58:52.780" style="s2">the challenge in that is that when you</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.840" end="00:58:54.490" style="s2">do something as an amateur I was trip</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.780" end="00:58:56.710" style="s2">just happy just before we started</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.490" end="00:59:01.300" style="s2">talking about a discussion with a friend</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.710" end="00:59:05.590" style="s2">of mine about how how dysphoric and dis</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.300" end="00:59:07.570" style="s2">regulating love can be and there is</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.590" end="00:59:09.970" style="s2">something dysphoric and dis regulating</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.570" end="00:59:11.590" style="s2">about espousing an amateurish love</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.970" end="00:59:19.630" style="s2">towards something so ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.590" end="00:59:21.640" style="s2">important it&#39;s very vulnerable isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.630" end="00:59:23.710" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very it&#39;s very extreme</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.640" end="00:59:24.680" style="s2">vulnerability I think it is extreme</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.710" end="00:59:26.270" style="s2">vulnerability but</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.680" end="00:59:27.710" style="s2">but I&#39;m starting to realize like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.270" end="00:59:29.450" style="s2">starting to realize that the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.710" end="00:59:31.520" style="s2">vulnerability is actually the only way</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.450" end="00:59:32.839" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.520" end="00:59:35.000" style="s2">going to properly conduce the</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.839" end="00:59:37.460" style="s2">transformative experience required to</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.000" end="00:59:40.309" style="s2">then progress further I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.460" end="00:59:42.619" style="s2">right characterized wait right you need</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.309" end="00:59:45.500" style="s2">like you need it I&#39;m starting by should</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.619" end="00:59:49.190" style="s2">so you know I shouldn&#39;t be so quick to</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.500" end="00:59:51.470" style="s2">generalize my my my my reflexive</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.190" end="00:59:54.980" style="s2">insights but I think I need it and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.470" end="00:59:57.290" style="s2">think I&#39;m starting to realize how</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.980" end="00:59:59.240" style="s2">essential it is I didn&#39;t know I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.290" end="01:00:01.250" style="s2">you can stick with your original and</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.240" end="01:00:08.140" style="s2">insight and say that it&#39;s it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.250" end="01:00:10.910" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the only way yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.140" end="01:00:12.339" style="s2">yeah took it in a way I guess if I was</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.910" end="01:00:14.240" style="s2">to put a more sort of existential</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.339" end="01:00:15.819" style="s2">formulation on I would say the</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.240" end="01:00:21.770" style="s2">realization that you are not yourself</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.819" end="01:00:24.319" style="s2">the realization not to be oneself comes</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.770" end="01:00:26.359" style="s2">with the comes with an existential</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.319" end="01:00:29.710" style="s2">prescription that you must take the</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.359" end="01:00:32.930" style="s2">steps to be oneself you know and like</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.710" end="01:00:35.240" style="s2">realizing the realizing the in identic</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.930" end="01:00:37.549" style="s2">allottee I think is very helpful like</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.240" end="01:00:39.230" style="s2">when you wake up one day and think no</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.549" end="01:00:42.549" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m not being myself</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.230" end="01:00:45.650" style="s2">right now that naturally like</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.549" end="01:00:51.760" style="s2">automatically it invokes that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.650" end="01:00:53.660" style="s2">it&#39;s correlating the longings</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.760" end="01:00:56.950" style="s2">prescription yeah the longing the</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.660" end="01:00:59.390" style="s2">longing right yeah the realization that</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.950" end="01:01:02.630" style="s2">somebody wants to spirit the despaired</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.390" end="01:01:04.880" style="s2">to despair not to be oneself yeah some</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.630" end="01:01:07.460" style="s2">wise person once told me I said you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.880" end="01:01:08.990" style="s2">where do I start I was like where do you</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.460" end="01:01:10.640" style="s2">start and you always start with longing</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.990" end="01:01:13.730" style="s2">right that&#39;s what that&#39;s where you start</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.640" end="01:01:16.970" style="s2">hmm yeah that&#39;s right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.730" end="01:01:19.250" style="s2">exactly exactly you start with your we</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.970" end="01:01:21.710" style="s2">start with insufficiency and longing or</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.250" end="01:01:23.210" style="s2">your that&#39;s right that&#39;s right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.710" end="01:01:25.220" style="s2">right and then I think what you try and</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.210" end="01:01:27.170" style="s2">do and this is what that I mean this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.220" end="01:01:28.549" style="s2">this is precisely the Socratic project</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.170" end="01:01:31.790" style="s2">is you take that inkling of this</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.549" end="01:01:33.829" style="s2">insufficiency and then you reproduce the</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.790" end="01:01:37.099" style="s2">insufficiency at every level of your</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.829" end="01:01:38.240" style="s2">awareness so that you actually compel</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.099" end="01:01:39.860" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.240" end="01:01:43.520" style="s2">comprehensively to turn in the direction</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.860" end="01:01:44.780" style="s2">of what will be more saving right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.520" end="01:01:46.640" style="s2">like that&#39;s what that&#39;s that the</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.780" end="01:01:48.290" style="s2">function of the Platonic myths that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.640" end="01:01:50.000" style="s2">what the function of autonomous people</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.290" end="01:01:52.369" style="s2">like Jonathan there&#39;s notice that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.000" end="01:01:57.430" style="s2">the function of Plato&#39;s myths was to</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.369" end="01:02:02.950" style="s2">imbue the the more somatic appetitive</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.430" end="01:02:05.900" style="s2">parts of the psyche with the same</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.950" end="01:02:08.150" style="s2">dissatisfaction as the intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.900" end="01:02:10.940" style="s2">faculties so that you you you</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.150" end="01:02:14.500" style="s2">essentially you embody the descent the</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.940" end="01:02:16.790" style="s2">intellect sort of the intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.500" end="01:02:19.820" style="s2">dissatisfaction becomes embodied</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.790" end="01:02:21.619" style="s2">somatically and become and so that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.820" end="01:02:24.890" style="s2">can coordinate yourself more</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.619" end="01:02:27.830" style="s2">comprehensively to refocus on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.890" end="01:02:29.960" style="s2">project of of orienting yourself to what</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.830" end="01:02:31.790" style="s2">will be more satisfying right so if</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.960" end="01:02:34.940" style="s2">there&#39;s something about like filling</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.790" end="01:02:39.020" style="s2">yourself up with dissatisfaction is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.940" end="01:02:43.360" style="s2">project that seems awfully strange out</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.020" end="01:02:43.360" style="s2">of context but I think in many ways I</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.630" end="01:02:49.130" style="s2">think it&#39;s dissatisfaction is something</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.760" end="01:02:51.859" style="s2">that you have to cultivate before you</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.130" end="01:02:53.930" style="s2">can cultivate the project of satisfying</p>

<p begin="01:02:53.930" end="01:02:59.750" style="s2">embody your dissatisfaction so</p>
