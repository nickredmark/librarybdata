<p begin="00:00:06.819" end="00:00:15.190" style="s2">attitude towards psychedelics was overly</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.809" end="00:00:16.960" style="s2">I think restrictive I think he had you</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.190" end="00:00:18.310" style="s2">know he wrote some famous letters I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.960" end="00:00:20.020" style="s2">actually released some videos on this</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.310" end="00:00:21.789" style="s2">channel a video on this channel that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.020" end="00:00:23.589" style="s2">been watched over a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.789" end="00:00:25.230" style="s2">times regarding what Jung said about</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.589" end="00:00:28.029" style="s2">psychedelics it was something that</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.230" end="00:00:30.730" style="s2">caught on and people are very interested</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.029" end="00:00:34.510" style="s2">in it and you read those comments and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.730" end="00:00:36.550" style="s2">some people you know resonate with the</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.510" end="00:00:38.350" style="s2">wisdom of the words and other people</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.550" end="00:00:39.610" style="s2">like young and really missing missing</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.350" end="00:00:42.280" style="s2">the point here and of course he was</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.610" end="00:00:43.480" style="s2">writing before there had been of Gordon</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.280" end="00:00:45.700" style="s2">not even the psychedelic Renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.480" end="00:00:48.460" style="s2">even the actual the the sixties</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.700" end="00:00:50.740" style="s2">themselves or at least we couldn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.460" end="00:00:53.200" style="s2">them in in hindsight things were still</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.740" end="00:00:56.110" style="s2">in development and he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.200" end="00:00:57.910" style="s2">mescaline and what-have-you and while</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.110" end="00:00:59.980" style="s2">his view I think is fairly too</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.910" end="00:01:01.870" style="s2">restrictive and although from also from</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.980" end="00:01:08.410" style="s2">the anthropological sense as you as you</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.870" end="00:01:10.330" style="s2">mentioned there is a sense that the one</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.410" end="00:01:12.670" style="s2">of the key issues he speaks to is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.330" end="00:01:14.890" style="s2">importance of well if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.670" end="00:01:16.720" style="s2">sort of touch the sphere where the paint</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.890" end="00:01:19.000" style="s2">is made as he turns it if you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.720" end="00:01:22.300" style="s2">to take this rocket ship to some of this</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.000" end="00:01:25.330" style="s2">material then there&#39;s a certain amount</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.300" end="00:01:27.610" style="s2">of responsibility in terms of you better</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.330" end="00:01:30.159" style="s2">be prepared to have to really integrate</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.610" end="00:01:32.020" style="s2">this in a way that&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.159" end="00:01:34.479" style="s2">destructive of you fundamentally and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.020" end="00:01:37.210" style="s2">right as we as we&#39;ve mentioned this this</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.479" end="00:01:38.979" style="s2">integration is something that yes of</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.210" end="00:01:40.540" style="s2">course takes place within and we can do</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.979" end="00:01:42.760" style="s2">inner work and in a practice but this</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.540" end="00:01:45.610" style="s2">also takes place in relationship and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.760" end="00:01:48.070" style="s2">relationships of context and part of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.610" end="00:01:50.200" style="s2">issue was with the sixties is that well</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.070" end="00:01:52.860" style="s2">yeah we can say certain things about</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.200" end="00:01:55.690" style="s2">Timothy Leary and then and sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.860" end="00:01:57.909" style="s2">inappropriate kind of crack down as</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.690" end="00:01:59.620" style="s2">motivated by whether economic reasons</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.909" end="00:02:02.020" style="s2">like stupid political reason like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.620" end="00:02:08.440" style="s2">whole bunch of stuff there&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.020" end="00:02:11.980" style="s2">sense in which we were as a culture sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.440" end="00:02:14.739" style="s2">of quite cut off from an integration</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.980" end="00:02:17.300" style="s2">with those traditions of our history</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.739" end="00:02:20.510" style="s2">which could be though</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.300" end="00:02:22.580" style="s2">context which could help ground the kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.510" end="00:02:25.220" style="s2">of appropriate integration of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.580" end="00:02:27.470" style="s2">material and so mm-hmm sure having a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.220" end="00:02:30.860" style="s2">kind of spiritual traditionalist</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.470" end="00:02:33.110" style="s2">framework the sort of ritual and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.860" end="00:02:35.900" style="s2">know often maybe shamanistic but sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.110" end="00:02:37.490" style="s2">the initiation framework and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.900" end="00:02:40.220" style="s2">containment that comes with traditional</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.490" end="00:02:44.780" style="s2">practice yes yes yeah and I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.220" end="00:02:47.240" style="s2">sort of presents that the the frame of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.780" end="00:02:49.130" style="s2">that as in this house party you</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.240" end="00:02:51.830" style="s2">mentioned there&#39;s a certain like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.130" end="00:02:58.990" style="s2">the moment we find ourselves in is one</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.830" end="00:03:01.220" style="s2">that I think opens itself to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.990" end="00:03:03.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a clearing there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.220" end="00:03:05.960" style="s2">available energy there&#39;s this important</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.770" end="00:03:09.710" style="s2">need to to integrate that which has been</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.960" end="00:03:14.360" style="s2">broken apart and there&#39;s a kind of Wild</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.710" end="00:03:16.520" style="s2">West nurse to some structures that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.360" end="00:03:19.130" style="s2">may come may form now we have loads of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.520" end="00:03:23.690" style="s2">wisdom traditions the lessons in the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.130" end="00:03:25.130" style="s2">in a way right well I mean in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.690" end="00:03:26.720" style="s2">as you alluded to there was more</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.130" end="00:03:29.300" style="s2">conventional structure but as regards</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.720" end="00:03:31.580" style="s2">this stuff the 60s had an extremely Wild</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.300" end="00:03:34.130" style="s2">West kind of approach right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.580" end="00:03:36.080" style="s2">that&#39;s that and that was the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.130" end="00:03:38.660" style="s2">critique of the the D contextualization</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.080" end="00:03:40.880" style="s2">and the dis embeddedness of psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.660" end="00:03:42.140" style="s2">in that period right not respecting I</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.880" end="00:03:44.420" style="s2">mean you know that a notion of set and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.140" end="00:03:46.970" style="s2">setting but like there already was set</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.420" end="00:03:48.770" style="s2">in setting that was back there it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.970" end="00:03:50.930" style="s2">like you have to ask you know the mass</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.770" end="00:03:55.010" style="s2">attack or something what they were doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.930" end="00:03:56.360" style="s2">with the mushrooms yeah but I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.010" end="00:04:00.290" style="s2">you there&#39;s a lot of available energy</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.360" end="00:04:07.900" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s extremely open yeah yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.290" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">yeah I I hear you on that so an</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.900" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">interesting question I have for you is</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.670" end="00:04:17.510" style="s2">and maybe it might be worthwhile to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.410" end="00:04:19.520" style="s2">speak to alchemy a little bit and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.510" end="00:04:21.500" style="s2">kind of mystery that alchemy is shrouded</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.520" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">in and of course Young took a great</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.500" end="00:04:28.280" style="s2">interest in alchemy I myself have found</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:31.330" style="s2">such incredibly helpful and instrumental</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.280" end="00:04:35.030" style="s2">and continually</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.330" end="00:04:37.640" style="s2">right possibilities but found in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.030" end="00:04:41.210" style="s2">phrase solve a at coagula which of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.640" end="00:04:42.680" style="s2">course maps so well on to you know how</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.210" end="00:04:48.860" style="s2">we could think from a cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.680" end="00:04:51.440" style="s2">perspective and so there&#39;s the alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.860" end="00:04:55.670" style="s2">piece and then there&#39;s the shroud of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.440" end="00:04:58.940" style="s2">mystery of that I&#39;m interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.670" end="00:05:01.790" style="s2">relationship between young and mystery</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.940" end="00:05:03.680" style="s2">societies and I&#39;m also interested in</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.790" end="00:05:06.580" style="s2">that frame being something that can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.680" end="00:05:08.840" style="s2">helpful II brought into this and ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.580" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">conversations which can help us</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.840" end="00:05:16.160" style="s2">understand how to appropriately relate</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.840" end="00:05:19.250" style="s2">to mystery now right and what the so</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.160" end="00:05:21.080" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ll stop there yeah yeah yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.250" end="00:05:22.850" style="s2">think that actually does really usefully</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.080" end="00:05:25.850" style="s2">tie together and for the psychedelics to</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.850" end="00:05:27.350" style="s2">I mean you know when we talk about there</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.850" end="00:05:30.050" style="s2">having you know having an appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.350" end="00:05:33.110" style="s2">cultural context in which can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.050" end="00:05:35.930" style="s2">interpret one&#39;s you know spiritual and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.110" end="00:05:38.720" style="s2">initiatory and psychedelic experiences</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.930" end="00:05:40.400" style="s2">it&#39;s true that having something to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.720" end="00:05:43.460" style="s2">that is highly effective right having</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.400" end="00:05:46.340" style="s2">something that allows you to to construe</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.460" end="00:05:48.530" style="s2">what&#39;s happening to you and and a way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.340" end="00:05:50.960" style="s2">making use of it and so on and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.530" end="00:05:52.700" style="s2">right but the tendency very often for</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.960" end="00:05:56.030" style="s2">people that make that critique I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.700" end="00:06:00.440" style="s2">is to then lapse into a kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.030" end="00:06:02.360" style="s2">sort of retro of shamanism right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.440" end="00:06:05.210" style="s2">like what we have to do is is go back to</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.360" end="00:06:07.040" style="s2">the original indigenous model now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.210" end="00:06:09.740" style="s2">not to say that the original indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.040" end="00:06:12.020" style="s2">model isn&#39;t a good one right it might be</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.740" end="00:06:15.860" style="s2">highly effective but like at some point</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.020" end="00:06:17.960" style="s2">somebody made that up right like it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.860" end="00:06:20.510" style="s2">experimental process that somebody made</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.960" end="00:06:21.950" style="s2">up some humans made up or you know I</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.510" end="00:06:23.210" style="s2">guess if you have a if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.950" end="00:06:25.280" style="s2">different sort of metaphysical frame</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.210" end="00:06:27.740" style="s2">maybe it was delivered to them by by</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.280" end="00:06:29.330" style="s2">being or beings but the point is like at</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.740" end="00:06:31.070" style="s2">some point they didn&#39;t have it you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.330" end="00:06:32.540" style="s2">at some point some humans got into</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.070" end="00:06:34.370" style="s2">Mexico and the ate mushrooms for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.540" end="00:06:35.720" style="s2">first time and when they did they</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.370" end="00:06:37.520" style="s2">started figuring out what the hell they</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.720" end="00:06:39.380" style="s2">were going to do with what was hitting</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.520" end="00:06:42.710" style="s2">them right there was a real time</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.380" end="00:06:44.040" style="s2">experimental interpretation that means</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.710" end="00:06:47.370" style="s2">that we should</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.040" end="00:06:49.500" style="s2">ignore the practical wisdoms of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.370" end="00:06:51.990" style="s2">humans that have come before us they</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.500" end="00:06:54.060" style="s2">weren&#39;t stupid right they just didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:06:55.590" end="00:06:58.950" style="s2">knew right we have a different base of</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.660" end="00:07:01.530" style="s2">knowledge but the fact is they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.950" end="00:07:03.480" style="s2">dumb humans are smart they do smart</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.530" end="00:07:05.850" style="s2">things and they do effective things</p>

<p begin="00:07:11.130" end="00:07:15.690" style="s2">people treat magic like it&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.710" end="00:07:17.490" style="s2">superstitious Buncombe and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.690" end="00:07:20.220" style="s2">understand that what it is is a highly</p>

<p begin="00:07:20.220" end="00:07:24.870" style="s2">technologies that have been developed</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.420" end="00:07:27.570" style="s2">around the globe for millennia right in</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.870" end="00:07:31.200" style="s2">order to do certain things and we ignore</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.570" end="00:07:33.210" style="s2">it at our peril but anyway okay so these</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.200" end="00:07:35.040" style="s2">the indigenous practices around this</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.210" end="00:07:36.480" style="s2">stuff were tinkered with they were</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.040" end="00:07:38.630" style="s2">experimented but they&#39;re modeled like</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.480" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">that&#39;s how we develop things</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.630" end="00:07:42.720" style="s2">correspondingly right we can draw useful</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:44.970" style="s2">insights from that but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.720" end="00:07:48.600" style="s2">necessarily mean if we stop there now</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.970" end="00:07:50.220" style="s2">the Western ethos a lot of a time</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.600" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">unfortunately around these things is</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.220" end="00:07:54.930" style="s2">what I like to call a fast food atom</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.840" end="00:07:57.270" style="s2">bomb ethos right so in the Andes they</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.930" end="00:07:59.820" style="s2">chew coca leaves by the quitter have tea</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.270" end="00:08:01.590" style="s2">and it invigorates them and a combats or</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.820" end="00:08:04.050" style="s2">altitude sickness and whatever right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.590" end="00:08:06.360" style="s2">that&#39;s good but no we concentrate it</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.050" end="00:08:09.030" style="s2">down to a white powder and then further</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.360" end="00:08:11.820" style="s2">turning into smokeable rocks like we</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.030" end="00:08:13.890" style="s2">love reducing things to their poisonous</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.820" end="00:08:15.870" style="s2">essence and then consuming them that</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.890" end="00:08:17.610" style="s2">fast food is the same gig it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.870" end="00:08:19.650" style="s2">took food which is good for you and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.610" end="00:08:20.970" style="s2">concentrated into a thing that tastes</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.650" end="00:08:23.040" style="s2">better than food and it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.970" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">nutritious than food and is vastly</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.040" end="00:08:27.090" style="s2">deadlier than food right we saw the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:29.520" style="s2">Bliss point as they call them in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.090" end="00:08:30.960" style="s2">food industry right so we love doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.520" end="00:08:33.630" style="s2">that kind of stuff that&#39;s kind of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.960" end="00:08:35.880" style="s2">the core of the instrumental</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.630" end="00:08:38.940" style="s2">technological impulse in sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.880" end="00:08:40.770" style="s2">Western ethos and that run out of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.940" end="00:08:42.660" style="s2">control within the framework of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.770" end="00:08:44.340" style="s2">initiation of spiritual advancement is</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.660" end="00:08:47.130" style="s2">going to be a problem that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.340" end="00:08:48.600" style="s2">sometimes how it gets and you get hints</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.130" end="00:08:51.120" style="s2">of that in sort of the Silicon Valley</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.600" end="00:08:54.050" style="s2">micro dosing culture which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.120" end="00:08:56.460" style="s2">the joke right and it&#39;s it&#39;s not a fair</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.050" end="00:08:57.750" style="s2">caricature in some ways but like in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.460" end="00:08:59.460" style="s2">sixties it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.750" end="00:09:02.190" style="s2">turn on tune in drop out right leave</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.460" end="00:09:03.960" style="s2">society and now it&#39;s like take small</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.190" end="00:09:06.120" style="s2">doses of lxd to increase your</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.960" end="00:09:09.720" style="s2">productivity coding for Microsoft or</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.120" end="00:09:11.550" style="s2">whatever you know so there are lessons</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.720" end="00:09:12.450" style="s2">to be pulled from the original context</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.550" end="00:09:13.920" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m getting at but that</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.450" end="00:09:16.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that innovation stops there</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.920" end="00:09:18.360" style="s2">it means that we respect those models</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.170" end="00:09:19.920" style="s2">and then we innovate and we combine them</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.360" end="00:09:21.840" style="s2">which is what humans do and what we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.920" end="00:09:23.580" style="s2">always done and that&#39;s especially so</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.840" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">when you consider that like it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.580" end="00:09:28.410" style="s2">well and good to go and consult</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:31.290" style="s2">indigenous models for you know ayahuasca</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.410" end="00:09:33.930" style="s2">or for you know psilocybin mushrooms</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.290" end="00:09:36.060" style="s2">right but what about LSD it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.930" end="00:09:37.860" style="s2">exist in nature does that mean we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.060" end="00:09:39.900" style="s2">have a relationship with it does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.860" end="00:09:41.610" style="s2">that it&#39;s not a useful tool do we just</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.900" end="00:09:43.800" style="s2">use the same tools since we would use</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.610" end="00:09:45.690" style="s2">for a natural component like the answer</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.800" end="00:09:48.150" style="s2">is we have to make it up and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.690" end="00:09:49.680" style="s2">make it up based on what we already know</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.150" end="00:09:52.680" style="s2">and some good inferences and an</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.680" end="00:09:54.740" style="s2">experimental mindset right we have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.680" end="00:09:56.850" style="s2">kind of experiment and make it up and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.740" end="00:09:58.410" style="s2">the reason that I bring this up within</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.850" end="00:09:59.940" style="s2">the alchemical framework is that one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.410" end="00:10:05.360" style="s2">the things that I love most about</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.940" end="00:10:09.089" style="s2">alchemy as a kind of counterculture</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.360" end="00:10:10.560" style="s2">expression of spirituality within the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.089" end="00:10:11.820" style="s2">whole period in which it&#39;s operating</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.560" end="00:10:13.860" style="s2">because it&#39;s always it&#39;s never the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.820" end="00:10:15.660" style="s2">dominant right alchemy as always</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.860" end="00:10:18.110" style="s2">hermetic could tell the sidelines it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.660" end="00:10:21.180" style="s2">always Gnostic it&#39;s always the weirdo</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.110" end="00:10:22.830" style="s2">spirituality but it&#39;s also deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.180" end="00:10:26.070" style="s2">experimental intrinsically inherently</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.830" end="00:10:27.660" style="s2">and not that you you don&#39;t discover the</p>
