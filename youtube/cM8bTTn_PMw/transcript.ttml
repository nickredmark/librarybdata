<p begin="00:00:00.860" end="00:00:05.279" style="s2">good morning welcome to Saturday morning</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.720" end="00:00:06.839" style="s2">roundtable I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be other</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.279" end="00:00:09.120" style="s2">people joining us in a moment if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.839" end="00:00:12.269" style="s2">watching on Facebook there&#39;s a link to a</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.120" end="00:00:13.710" style="s2">stream yard Facebook to join and mile</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.269" end="00:00:16.609" style="s2">we&#39;ll just start you know through what</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.710" end="00:00:20.070" style="s2">have you been up to with your projects</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.609" end="00:00:21.810" style="s2">yesterday we had the first prototype</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.070" end="00:00:23.400" style="s2">planning session where we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.810" end="00:00:26.580" style="s2">actually went a bit deeper into the</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.400" end="00:00:29.429" style="s2">technical part of doing a prototype for</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.580" end="00:00:32.969" style="s2">a web app that was pretty good it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.429" end="00:00:37.469" style="s2">the full hour and it was I think useful</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.969" end="00:00:40.410" style="s2">um tried to avoid going too technical</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.469" end="00:00:43.140" style="s2">but it was more like for people I guess</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.410" end="00:00:45.000" style="s2">sort of in in in my role like aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.140" end="00:00:47.850" style="s2">developers but are the ones sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.000" end="00:00:50.070" style="s2">trying to plan how it works which i</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.850" end="00:00:52.590" style="s2">think is a fairly common position to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.070" end="00:00:56.370" style="s2">in in the projects group so that will</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.590" end="00:00:57.870" style="s2">hopefully be helpful and I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.370" end="00:01:00.359" style="s2">where the project is that right now just</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.870" end="00:01:02.489" style="s2">trying to work on getting the prototype</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.359" end="00:01:04.470" style="s2">out we actually got sort of a new</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.489" end="00:01:06.150" style="s2">version of the prototype released</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.470" end="00:01:08.939" style="s2">yesterday so now there&#39;s like a member</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.150" end="00:01:15.990" style="s2">login and an actual database and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.939" end="00:01:17.580" style="s2">behind it so moving along I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.990" end="00:01:19.140" style="s2">know where I&#39;m at in my project we had</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.580" end="00:01:20.869" style="s2">two solutions this week though we had</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.140" end="00:01:23.159" style="s2">one on suicide and went on self-help</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.869" end="00:01:24.840" style="s2">both of which were powerful</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.159" end="00:01:26.549" style="s2">I found the self health plan I thought</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.840" end="00:01:27.990" style="s2">there&#39;d be more people and it was just I</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.549" end="00:01:29.820" style="s2">reached out to one person we scheduled</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.990" end="00:01:32.189" style="s2">one for Friday and then he was the only</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.820" end="00:01:33.780" style="s2">one who showed up which is fine and but</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.189" end="00:01:37.110" style="s2">they were both good when we had our</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.780" end="00:01:39.630" style="s2">fourth fifth process raising which seems</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.110" end="00:01:42.509" style="s2">to be coming together ribbons and I are</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.630" end="00:01:44.820" style="s2">gonna meet next week to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.509" end="00:01:46.649" style="s2">mission and vision for the process</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.820" end="00:01:48.570" style="s2">raising and only took us four weeks to</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.649" end="00:01:50.270" style="s2">get some innovation so that we can then</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.570" end="00:01:53.220" style="s2">look for more people in order to do the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.270" end="00:01:56.430" style="s2">foundational documents or to go through</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.220" end="00:01:58.979" style="s2">the protocol that loves it that is which</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.430" end="00:02:01.350" style="s2">I&#39;m looking forward to and just playing</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.979" end="00:02:03.659" style="s2">in the attention of having slightly</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.350" end="00:02:05.579" style="s2">different visions but like between this</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.659" end="00:02:07.079" style="s2">and together it&#39;s like between process</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.579" end="00:02:08.700" style="s2">racing and together tech and feel like</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.079" end="00:02:10.410" style="s2">it&#39;s both it&#39;s the flip side of each</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.700" end="00:02:12.480" style="s2">coin it&#39;s like bring your project and</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.410" end="00:02:13.470" style="s2">own it and like how do we help each</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.480" end="00:02:15.240" style="s2">other versus</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.470" end="00:02:16.320" style="s2">okay we all have our own project but at</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.240" end="00:02:18.570" style="s2">the same time how can we create</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.320" end="00:02:21.630" style="s2">something together isn&#39;t necessarily on</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.570" end="00:02:23.400" style="s2">you and for our projects but actually on</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.630" end="00:02:25.830" style="s2">you in for society in our lives you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.400" end="00:02:28.220" style="s2">like that outside and they&#39;re completely</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.830" end="00:02:31.140" style="s2">different like emotions that trigger it</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.220" end="00:02:33.480" style="s2">in the process and so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.140" end="00:02:35.130" style="s2">interesting and then as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.480" end="00:02:36.540" style="s2">before going live but just personally</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.130" end="00:02:40.290" style="s2">I&#39;m dealing with more interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.540" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">health stuff and healing started</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.290" end="00:02:43.590" style="s2">different programs so although that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:47.670" style="s2">not directly related it definitely ties</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.590" end="00:02:51.450" style="s2">into all of that so I don&#39;t know what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.670" end="00:02:52.830" style="s2">would need help with besides just know I</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.450" end="00:02:56.640" style="s2">really don&#39;t know what I would need help</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.830" end="00:02:58.590" style="s2">with yeah I mean stuff I need help with</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:03:03.060" style="s2">I&#39;m getting helpless that was that was</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.590" end="00:03:06.360" style="s2">yesterday&#39;s session perfect yeah well</p>

<p begin="00:03:09.840" end="00:03:14.940" style="s2">we can focus on their project this could</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.420" end="00:03:17.790" style="s2">become an impromptu project raising</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.940" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">there we go we got to talk about I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.790" end="00:03:24.150" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty excited that we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">people in game B projects fact the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.150" end="00:03:29.489" style="s2">rubble wisdom did a podcast on game B</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:31.980" style="s2">and then actually how did you watch it</p>

<p begin="00:06:12.919" end="00:06:18.050" style="s2">and a small thing and kind of gets small</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.900" end="00:06:20.240" style="s2">feedback rather than group stuff so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.050" end="00:06:22.700" style="s2">trying to have some debates in areas</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.240" end="00:06:23.780" style="s2">that I&#39;m interested in but they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.700" end="00:06:28.040" style="s2">really complex</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.780" end="00:06:30.500" style="s2">it&#39;s a nutrition science and stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.040" end="00:06:32.060" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m starting that I guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.500" end="00:06:34.880" style="s2">really the only role update I didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.060" end="00:06:37.520" style="s2">any code this last week on the project I</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.880" end="00:06:41.120" style="s2">was working on someone else&#39;s project so</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.520" end="00:06:45.199" style="s2">we&#39;re doing a no code meeting and a</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.120" end="00:06:49.490" style="s2">local Dallas meetup website so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.199" end="00:06:51.860" style="s2">helping my friend Kerry get a LinkedIn</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.490" end="00:06:53.360" style="s2">login working for her community site so</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.860" end="00:06:56.479" style="s2">I guess that&#39;s mostly the way I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.360" end="00:06:58.400" style="s2">spending my time as faux as far as</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.479" end="00:07:02.350" style="s2">requests I don&#39;t I&#39;ve been thinking it</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.400" end="00:07:06.080" style="s2">would be nice if if someone had some</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.350" end="00:07:08.840" style="s2">debates if anyone like has a topic that</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.080" end="00:07:10.639" style="s2">they want to experiment with but it</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.840" end="00:07:14.210" style="s2">don&#39;t mind playing with a untested</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.639" end="00:07:18.010" style="s2">system on finding agreement and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.210" end="00:07:18.010" style="s2">complex debate would be fun</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.729" end="00:07:23.930" style="s2">what is the number of people you need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.020" end="00:07:25.220" style="s2">be able well I think just me and someone</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.930" end="00:07:29.300" style="s2">else hopefully if we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.220" end="00:07:32.060" style="s2">disagreeing on a topic so it or even</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.300" end="00:07:34.250" style="s2">would be really great is if if two</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.060" end="00:07:36.080" style="s2">people who are knowing know each other</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.250" end="00:07:38.630" style="s2">and uncomfortable having a debate wanted</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.080" end="00:07:40.099" style="s2">to do it through the system and it might</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.630" end="00:07:41.599" style="s2">not even like it&#39;d be nice to do like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.099" end="00:07:42.860" style="s2">live video but some of the debate will</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.599" end="00:07:44.419" style="s2">happen afterwards because it would be</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.860" end="00:07:46.340" style="s2">like oh I need to do some research and</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.419" end="00:07:48.860" style="s2">find the studies that back this up and</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.340" end="00:07:50.449" style="s2">so it could be a series of videos or not</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.860" end="00:07:52.130" style="s2">even doing videos at all and I just be</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.449" end="00:07:53.570" style="s2">like they both have access to the system</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.130" end="00:07:56.000" style="s2">they go and enter data and just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.570" end="00:08:01.639" style="s2">see how the flow goes so those are the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.000" end="00:08:04.400" style="s2">different ways of doing it together</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.639" end="00:08:06.409" style="s2">heimo juice I give an update on oh sorry</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.400" end="00:08:07.820" style="s2">Bentley are you I&#39;ve got a new dad</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.409" end="00:08:12.199" style="s2">you&#39;re probably done Mateus do you want</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.820" end="00:08:17.300" style="s2">to give your update and my update about</p>

<p begin="00:08:24.970" end="00:08:31.400" style="s2">stuff which I I&#39;m not sure at this point</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.430" end="00:08:34.339" style="s2">if I am just luck helps to make it all</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.400" end="00:08:37.010" style="s2">public in one go and I&#39;m just finding</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.339" end="00:08:39.890" style="s2">and looking for more excuses to just fix</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.010" end="00:08:42.709" style="s2">one more bag before go in Eiffel is it</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.890" end="00:08:45.950" style="s2">something that really needs to be fixed</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.709" end="00:08:51.310" style="s2">before there&#39;s always one more Park</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.950" end="00:08:58.040" style="s2">yeah exactly I guess I am just afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.310" end="00:09:05.300" style="s2">releasing it i yeah so I kept doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.040" end="00:09:09.830" style="s2">that&#39;s the route this week also Ariel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.300" end="00:09:19.330" style="s2">project was on like my things and I did</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.830" end="00:09:26.060" style="s2">make progress with and yeah that&#39;s me</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.330" end="00:09:27.770" style="s2">short version muscle we&#39;re done by ten</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.060" end="00:09:29.120" style="s2">minutes a knurled I finished by three</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.770" end="00:09:31.459" style="s2">we&#39;re like we just call it an eight here</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.120" end="00:09:33.080" style="s2">then you guys came on but now what do we</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.459" end="00:09:34.700" style="s2">want to talk about no one has your like</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.080" end="00:09:36.020" style="s2">we&#39;re all kind of before in our projects</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.700" end="00:09:37.670" style="s2">they really have like a Bentley though</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.020" end="00:09:39.550" style="s2">you had something and so like who can we</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.670" end="00:09:42.170" style="s2">think of that wants to have a debate</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.550" end="00:09:45.500" style="s2">yeah we could bounce around ideas for</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.170" end="00:09:48.020" style="s2">topics er so a few is there any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.500" end="00:09:50.240" style="s2">more clarity on what might help pick a</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.020" end="00:09:51.770" style="s2">topic cuz I I know you sort of bender</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.240" end="00:09:53.000" style="s2">topics and every time it gets like oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.770" end="00:09:55.450" style="s2">that&#39;s too complex that&#39;s too complex</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.000" end="00:09:59.650" style="s2">yeah and maybe the problem is how to</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.450" end="00:10:02.930" style="s2">simplify it and so now I&#39;m thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.650" end="00:10:06.430" style="s2">it can be a complex topic I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.930" end="00:10:06.430" style="s2">know how quickly people get bored but</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.610" end="00:10:13.670" style="s2">maybe a way around that is to just take</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.110" end="00:10:17.209" style="s2">turns so you know you you put in a fact</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.670" end="00:10:21.080" style="s2">or maybe two at a time and that way</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.209" end="00:10:22.970" style="s2">you&#39;re always kind of exploring and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.080" end="00:10:24.790" style="s2">maybe a way another way to kind of get</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.970" end="00:10:27.050" style="s2">around that is to let people put</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.790" end="00:10:29.360" style="s2">manually put their confidence in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.050" end="00:10:32.540" style="s2">statement so you could say here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.360" end="00:10:34.430" style="s2">study and that that I think proves my</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.540" end="00:10:36.170" style="s2">point will by like seventy five percent</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.430" end="00:10:39.370" style="s2">or whatever like that and that way they</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.170" end="00:10:42.170" style="s2">don&#39;t have to go deeper than that</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.370" end="00:10:45.050" style="s2">if both both people agree then you never</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.170" end="00:10:46.730" style="s2">have to explore that that data but if</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.050" end="00:10:48.680" style="s2">they if you don&#39;t then you can choose</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.730" end="00:10:51.470" style="s2">which one you want to explore then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.680" end="00:10:53.899" style="s2">a kind of a growing thing when right now</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.470" end="00:10:57.290" style="s2">I feel like kind of like a mark to for</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.899" end="00:10:59.600" style="s2">saying that you can&#39;t I don&#39;t know when</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.290" end="00:11:02.180" style="s2">to release it because at any point it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.600" end="00:11:04.010" style="s2">like well I only have five studies I</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.180" end="00:11:06.590" style="s2">know there&#39;s like five hundred in here</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.010" end="00:11:07.820" style="s2">isn&#39;t that cherry-picking and then but</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.590" end="00:11:10.250" style="s2">that I have to put it out there and say</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.820" end="00:11:12.890" style="s2">this is cherry-picks if you don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.250" end="00:11:14.570" style="s2">with my cherry-picked things your</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.890" end="00:11:18.400" style="s2">responsibilities go fine the studies I</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.570" end="00:11:18.400" style="s2">missed and put them in and explain why</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.520" end="00:11:23.540" style="s2">so now I&#39;m thinking it can be any topic</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.290" end="00:11:25.130" style="s2">but it it would be good if the people</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.540" end="00:11:28.910" style="s2">are really interested in it because it</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.130" end="00:11:31.400" style="s2">is really boring work unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.910" end="00:11:33.290" style="s2">interested in the topic and it could</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.400" end="00:11:35.090" style="s2">yeah so I you know there&#39;s lots of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.290" end="00:11:38.480" style="s2">right now like you know it could be like</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.090" end="00:11:42.550" style="s2">what take a take a proposal like the</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.480" end="00:11:48.080" style="s2">what is it the eight proposals on on</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.550" end="00:11:50.570" style="s2">criminal justice reform I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.080" end="00:11:52.550" style="s2">what what the website was but a family</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.570" end="00:11:54.440" style="s2">yeah I can&#39;t wait so you could choose</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.550" end="00:11:55.760" style="s2">like just one of those or talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.440" end="00:11:59.410" style="s2">whole thing I think it&#39;d be better if it</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.760" end="00:12:02.150" style="s2">was one of the proposals and debate that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.410" end="00:12:04.010" style="s2">although what I posted that on my</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.150" end="00:12:06.130" style="s2">Facebook and Twitter and no one was</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.010" end="00:12:08.780" style="s2">really arguing with any of the apropos</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.130" end="00:12:13.100" style="s2">well cop shouldn&#39;t be people with unless</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.780" end="00:12:19.220" style="s2">they yeah I guess actually the immunity</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.100" end="00:12:21.410" style="s2">one might be interesting because cops</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.220" end="00:12:22.460" style="s2">are often put in situations where they</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.410" end="00:12:25.100" style="s2">have to do things that the general</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.460" end="00:12:26.980" style="s2">public may not understand as being</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.100" end="00:12:29.180" style="s2">correct so if they&#39;re in a jury room</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.980" end="00:12:33.280" style="s2">they could get convicted for doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.180" end="00:12:33.280" style="s2">something that they had they had to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.670" end="00:12:39.980" style="s2">anyways yeah so stuff like that would</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.310" end="00:12:41.720" style="s2">yeah I think now I&#39;m thinking that most</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.980" end="00:12:43.460" style="s2">anything would work I was just being to</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.720" end="00:12:49.130" style="s2">perfectionistic so that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.460" end="00:12:50.780" style="s2">learning process as a game be it men how</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.130" end="00:12:53.050" style="s2">about I invites up at any time there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.780" end="00:12:56.060" style="s2">debate on the page to be like Bentley</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.050" end="00:12:59.900" style="s2">you take it outside but like on this</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.060" end="00:13:01.580" style="s2">very specific debate format yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.900" end="00:13:04.070" style="s2">I&#39;ve thought about that whether it be</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.580" end="00:13:06.020" style="s2">useful if you see one that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.070" end="00:13:07.910" style="s2">talked about it and see whether that</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.020" end="00:13:10.460" style="s2">would work us oftentimes though</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.910" end="00:13:12.470" style="s2">especially recently one of the people in</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.460" end="00:13:15.530" style="s2">the debate tends to be seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.470" end="00:13:16.930" style="s2">disingenuous and the system isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.530" end="00:13:21.250" style="s2">good at handling</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.930" end="00:13:23.500" style="s2">trolls yet it&#39;s it assumes both people</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.250" end="00:13:24.880" style="s2">but if you if there you came just two or</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.500" end="00:13:27.520" style="s2">three or several people that are having</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.880" end="00:13:29.290" style="s2">this we could even take the arguments</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.520" end="00:13:30.700" style="s2">they&#39;ve already kind of made and put</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.290" end="00:13:32.410" style="s2">them into the shore and say well this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.700" end="00:13:34.360" style="s2">where we understand the discussion is I</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.410" end="00:13:37.300" style="s2">think it&#39;d be useful in some of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.360" end="00:13:39.880" style="s2">debates on on how to do admitting</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.300" end="00:13:43.630" style="s2">because everyone and there is genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.880" end="00:13:44.980" style="s2">wants to see game be succeed so it might</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.630" end="00:13:47.440" style="s2">be interesting you know should we ever</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.980" end="00:13:51.690" style="s2">ban somebody when should we ban some</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.440" end="00:13:53.980" style="s2">people and stuff like that but yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.690" end="00:13:57.130" style="s2">kind of like that a lot life actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.980" end="00:14:00.279" style="s2">using it to try to make some decisions</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.130" end="00:14:01.899" style="s2">for the the game B group or like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.279" end="00:14:03.940" style="s2">that as well and even if we aren&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.899" end="00:14:05.320" style="s2">know trying to to make it binding right</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.940" end="00:14:07.660" style="s2">I think just to be like hey here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.320" end="00:14:10.779" style="s2">you know came out in the wash when we</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.660" end="00:14:12.190" style="s2">looked at like what are the values that</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.779" end="00:14:13.810" style="s2">the game B projects group stands for</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.190" end="00:14:16.990" style="s2">right like what do we consider a game</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.810" end="00:14:18.940" style="s2">view project yeah yeah the challenge in</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.990" end="00:14:21.130" style="s2">there is also that it&#39;s not real good as</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.940" end="00:14:24.580" style="s2">far as like you know there&#39;s a part of</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.130" end="00:14:27.190" style="s2">the debate in the group decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.580" end="00:14:28.450" style="s2">process where you&#39;re expanding the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.190" end="00:14:30.220" style="s2">like oh we could do this we could do</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.450" end="00:14:32.650" style="s2">this we do this and then you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.220" end="00:14:34.480" style="s2">paring them down to the best ideas it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.650" end="00:14:36.010" style="s2">really the tool is only really useful</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.480" end="00:14:37.779" style="s2">when you&#39;re testing one idea so some</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.010" end="00:14:41.680" style="s2">sins we should have and anyone that uses</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.779" end="00:14:44.560" style="s2">the f-word right then then you could you</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.680" end="00:14:46.000" style="s2">could do that one that&#39;s not real good</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.560" end="00:14:47.410" style="s2">if you have a couple of options you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.000" end="00:14:49.750" style="s2">try and choose the best one that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.410" end="00:14:52.810" style="s2">not a good tool for that but if someone</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.750" end="00:14:54.550" style="s2">has a specific proposal it would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.810" end="00:14:55.870" style="s2">really good we could also use it in some</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.550" end="00:14:58.810" style="s2">of our projects I haven&#39;t decided</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.870" end="00:15:01.240" style="s2">whether you know we have someone come up</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.810" end="00:15:05.730" style="s2">with a new project idea but I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.240" end="00:15:05.730" style="s2">like I don&#39;t think that&#39;s gonna work I</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.150" end="00:15:12.850" style="s2">don&#39;t know if it&#39;d be beneficial to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.470" end="00:15:14.560" style="s2">person to to go through that level like</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.850" end="00:15:18.850" style="s2">we said part of its learning and trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.560" end="00:15:20.140" style="s2">and failing but would it be helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.850" end="00:15:23.020" style="s2">have someone actually mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.140" end="00:15:25.510" style="s2">show that your that your thing would</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.020" end="00:15:27.190" style="s2">never work a lot of its opinion basis</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.510" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">like does that person have the skill set</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.190" end="00:15:30.820" style="s2">or can they attract the people how this</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:32.650" style="s2">goes that but every once in a while it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.820" end="00:15:34.720" style="s2">you know here&#39;s a here&#39;s a tool here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.650" end="00:15:38.260" style="s2">new economy that I want to bring up our</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.720" end="00:15:39.520" style="s2">new currency and like universal basic</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.260" end="00:15:43.090" style="s2">income is something that I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.520" end="00:15:49.510" style="s2">interested in but I&#39;m very concerned</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.090" end="00:15:55.030" style="s2">about not just the transition to it but</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.510" end="00:15:57.250" style="s2">also is it sustainable and I know some</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.030" end="00:15:58.390" style="s2">of the arguments on both sides but I but</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.250" end="00:15:59.740" style="s2">I still kind of feel like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.390" end="00:16:02.830" style="s2">something out there that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.740" end="00:16:06.010" style="s2">concern an unspoken concern there of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.830" end="00:16:07.870" style="s2">what might what might result in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.010" end="00:16:11.050" style="s2">society button so that would be an</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.870" end="00:16:13.330" style="s2">interesting one as well but does kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.050" end="00:16:16.540" style="s2">have to be a specific proposal yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.330" end="00:16:18.220" style="s2">do you think about doing a fake one like</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.540" end="00:16:21.160" style="s2">you know choosing something that people</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.220" end="00:16:23.470" style="s2">in some fictional universe are arguing</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.160" end="00:16:25.420" style="s2">over so it doesn&#39;t matter and be you</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.470" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">gotta have a limited amount of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.420" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">available but kind of only what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:33.460" style="s2">that show or movie or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.480" end="00:16:36.090" style="s2">I&#39;m reticent to do that I know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.460" end="00:16:38.680" style="s2">gonna your plan doing that for</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.090" end="00:16:40.270" style="s2">Wiki election and I think that does show</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.680" end="00:16:42.280" style="s2">off the wookie election features and</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.270" end="00:16:43.720" style="s2">this sort of thing can show off oh and</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.280" end="00:16:45.820" style="s2">technically I guess I did do that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.720" end="00:16:48.880" style="s2">because the example on my website is</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.820" end="00:16:51.010" style="s2">fiction city deciding to close a street</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.880" end="00:16:54.880" style="s2">right so I have done that so that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.010" end="00:16:59.770" style="s2">I guess if we could find something that</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.880" end="00:17:02.110" style="s2">was more provable than just an opinion</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.770" end="00:17:04.960" style="s2">like if I want say you know who&#39;s who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.110" end="00:17:06.700" style="s2">the best even like who was the best</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.960" end="00:17:10.510" style="s2">actor who played this thing but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.700" end="00:17:11.890" style="s2">really real but know who you know like</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.510" end="00:17:12.550" style="s2">favorite Star Wars character or</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.890" end="00:17:15.280" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.550" end="00:17:17.970" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s all opinion based but who</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.280" end="00:17:23.020" style="s2">should have won Game of Thrones right</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.970" end="00:17:26.170" style="s2">yeah I mean yeah hard but just or like</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.020" end="00:17:27.520" style="s2">the kind of stupid example that came to</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.170" end="00:17:29.860" style="s2">mind was there&#39;s a part in Futurama</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.520" end="00:17:31.450" style="s2">where there&#39;s two two presidents or two</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.860" end="00:17:34.900" style="s2">presidential candidates having a debate</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.450" end="00:17:36.550" style="s2">Jack Johnson and John Jackson and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.900" end="00:17:39.100" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re arguing whether like</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.550" end="00:17:42.420" style="s2">your 5 cent carbon tax is too high your</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.100" end="00:17:42.420" style="s2">5 cent carbon tax isn&#39;t high enough</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.700" end="00:17:45.760" style="s2">I mean hopefully a bit bit better than</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.370" end="00:17:47.260" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.760" end="00:17:49.240" style="s2">but that&#39;s sort of like a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.260" end="00:17:52.630" style="s2">simplistic thing with hopefully a couple</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.240" end="00:17:56.380" style="s2">layers okay yeah I guess I&#39;d be open to</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.630" end="00:18:00.040" style="s2">that I I do want to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.380" end="00:18:02.140" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of debate websites out</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.040" end="00:18:04.270" style="s2">there that have just ended up being a</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.140" end="00:18:06.690" style="s2">place where people argue about these</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.270" end="00:18:10.660" style="s2">kind of fictional things and some have</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.690" end="00:18:12.310" style="s2">there&#39;s debate island and and I actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.660" end="00:18:14.320" style="s2">posted on a debate group and I said this</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.310" end="00:18:16.150" style="s2">is the the nightmare of all of our</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.320" end="00:18:18.700" style="s2">systems are moving towards because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.150" end="00:18:19.960" style="s2">just a group of people just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.700" end="00:18:22.570" style="s2">trolling each other with this debate</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.960" end="00:18:26.890" style="s2">software right in their memes and</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.570" end="00:18:28.450" style="s2">they&#39;re in their fictional you know in</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.890" end="00:18:29.620" style="s2">the fictional verse because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.450" end="00:18:34.180" style="s2">lot of debates on there about Star Wars</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.620" end="00:18:36.730" style="s2">and Star Trek and yeah so I have a fear</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.180" end="00:18:38.680" style="s2">of going down that thing and would there</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.730" end="00:18:40.180" style="s2">be would there be evidence like in law</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.680" end="00:18:41.590" style="s2">these things it&#39;s evidence based and</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.180" end="00:18:43.090" style="s2">it&#39;s like well your only evidence is</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.590" end="00:18:49.930" style="s2">what they happen to show in the movies</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.090" end="00:18:51.340" style="s2">right but but it&#39;s I&#39;m not completely</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.930" end="00:18:53.800" style="s2">closed to the idea but those are my</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.340" end="00:18:55.750" style="s2">concerns it is something that also be</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.800" end="00:18:58.180" style="s2">interesting is as fictional as I thought</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.750" end="00:19:01.480" style="s2">it would be great to kind of popularize</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.180" end="00:19:03.250" style="s2">it a bit is to actually create a mystery</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.480" end="00:19:04.870" style="s2">story so if you think about kind of how</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.250" end="00:19:06.610" style="s2">Sherlock Holmes functions</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.870" end="00:19:09.310" style="s2">he&#39;s like bringing together all these</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.610" end="00:19:11.830" style="s2">facts right that&#39;s very deductive and</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.310" end="00:19:14.860" style="s2">logical so I thought it&#39;d be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.830" end="00:19:17.080" style="s2">to do a short film where it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.860" end="00:19:19.300" style="s2">detective and he has all the suspects</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.080" end="00:19:20.800" style="s2">and their percentage of likelihood of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.300" end="00:19:21.550" style="s2">being the President as you gathers</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.800" end="00:19:23.800" style="s2">evidence</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.550" end="00:19:25.750" style="s2">you know people kind of move up and down</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.800" end="00:19:27.640" style="s2">in their rankings and then you know in</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.750" end="00:19:30.520" style="s2">theory you have enough evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.640" end="00:19:32.230" style="s2">this one person oh I like that because</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.520" end="00:19:34.090" style="s2">then you&#39;ve also got like an excuse to</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.230" end="00:19:34.870" style="s2">kind of have like four or five of them</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.090" end="00:19:37.000" style="s2">like you</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.870" end="00:19:38.890" style="s2">here&#39;s one per suspect and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.000" end="00:19:41.230" style="s2">tell totally different you know things</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.890" end="00:19:43.210" style="s2">and showcase it that seems like it has a</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.230" end="00:19:45.490" style="s2">lot of promise and theoretically could</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.210" end="00:19:47.530" style="s2">take an actual movie and I&#39;ve thought</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.490" end="00:19:49.690" style="s2">about doing and I guess we&#39;d discuss it</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.530" end="00:19:51.070" style="s2">another time just taking a debate and</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.690" end="00:19:53.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a great I don&#39;t know if you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.070" end="00:19:54.840" style="s2">of IQ squared</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.160" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.840" end="00:20:01.290" style="s2">I guess it&#39;s just like you squared but</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:02.640" style="s2">they do debates almost once a month or</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.290" end="00:20:05.310" style="s2">twice a month or something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.640" end="00:20:07.080" style="s2">their formal camera in the name of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.310" end="00:20:08.910" style="s2">but so therefore the formal debate</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.080" end="00:20:10.170" style="s2">process we have five minutes each to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.910" end="00:20:13.020" style="s2">talk and stuff like that and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.170" end="00:20:14.700" style="s2">rebuttals and questions but that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.020" end="00:20:19.040" style="s2">one where I started going through it and</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.700" end="00:20:22.290" style="s2">they they spent so much time not</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.040" end="00:20:27.180" style="s2">presenting evidence that it was really</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.290" end="00:20:28.650" style="s2">kind of boring too so I pulled like you</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.180" end="00:20:31.020" style="s2">know out of their twenty minutes I put</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.650" end="00:20:33.150" style="s2">like four sentences that were actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.020" end="00:20:35.580" style="s2">like pros and cons and evidence based it</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.150" end="00:20:36.840" style="s2">was all convincing you there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.580" end="00:20:38.010" style="s2">people being wordsmiths</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.840" end="00:20:40.860" style="s2">and not actually saying anything of</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.010" end="00:20:43.860" style="s2">substance they were yeah well they were</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.860" end="00:20:45.870" style="s2">being convincing but they were all it</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.860" end="00:20:49.170" style="s2">was all kind of emotional triggers and</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.870" end="00:20:52.380" style="s2">right as opposed to here&#39;s the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.170" end="00:20:56.910" style="s2">that I was just so I politics yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.380" end="00:20:59.010" style="s2">right not keep thinking maybe I see and</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.910" end="00:21:00.930" style="s2">a lot of times they&#39;ll just kind of say</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.010" end="00:21:03.090" style="s2">half of what they mean and they&#39;ll they</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.930" end="00:21:05.700" style="s2">won&#39;t you know they don&#39;t say where they</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.090" end="00:21:07.640" style="s2">got that study from so then if I want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.700" end="00:21:09.810" style="s2">combat that I have to go find the study</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.640" end="00:21:13.400" style="s2">right and then I have to pay 50 dollars</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.810" end="00:21:16.110" style="s2">to have access to it and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.400" end="00:21:17.640" style="s2">but yeah I&#39;m just thinking it&#39;s hard the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.110" end="00:21:18.900" style="s2">other thing is that maybe just hiring</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.640" end="00:21:22.590" style="s2">someone who&#39;s used to doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.900" end="00:21:24.000" style="s2">fact-checking and research and but then</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.590" end="00:21:25.740" style="s2">a lot of times they&#39;ll go down rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.000" end="00:21:27.510" style="s2">trails approving something which</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.740" end="00:21:30.060" style="s2">everyone kind of agrees to so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.510" end="00:21:31.320" style="s2">danger as well that you start filling</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.060" end="00:21:33.030" style="s2">this debate with all the stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.320" end="00:21:35.940" style="s2">actually a lot of people wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.030" end="00:21:37.980" style="s2">argued those points so it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.940" end="00:21:42.290" style="s2">worthwhile to put it in there if someone</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.980" end="00:21:44.400" style="s2">actually has that concern yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.290" end="00:21:47.130" style="s2">personally would be interested in seeing</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.400" end="00:21:49.500" style="s2">what at least one looks like that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.130" end="00:21:51.150" style="s2">like generally agreed upon and like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.500" end="00:21:53.100" style="s2">kind of one-sided I&#39;d be interested to</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.150" end="00:21:54.420" style="s2">see what like how how that boils out</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.100" end="00:21:56.970" style="s2">instead of like an actual active</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.420" end="00:21:59.100" style="s2">contentious thing you know is water wet</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.970" end="00:22:01.320" style="s2">well hopefully that score is fairly</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.100" end="00:22:03.530" style="s2">one-sided there it&#39;s yeah although you</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.320" end="00:22:08.120" style="s2">have to define wet</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.530" end="00:22:09.800" style="s2">huh we uh yeah I did just see a physics</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.120" end="00:22:12.530" style="s2">girl did an experiment where she dipped</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.800" end="00:22:15.170" style="s2">her hand in the boiling hot oil and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.530" end="00:22:16.910" style="s2">was the lyndon frost effect okay if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.170" end="00:22:20.960" style="s2">do it with a slightly wet hand although</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.910" end="00:22:23.750" style="s2">this other scientist had done the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.960" end="00:22:25.220" style="s2">thing with molten lead but he did it</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.750" end="00:22:26.870" style="s2">with a dry hand because he&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.220" end="00:22:29.030" style="s2">you know the transfer of heat isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.870" end="00:22:30.350" style="s2">really that fast right but if you get it</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.030" end="00:22:34.930" style="s2">and then get it out as long as it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.350" end="00:22:37.540" style="s2">sticking to your skin you&#39;re fine</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.930" end="00:22:39.920" style="s2">but yeah that wasn&#39;t so much a debate</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.540" end="00:22:45.740" style="s2">well I guess yeah I guess anything that</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.920" end="00:22:48.080" style="s2">would have a known conclusion would yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.740" end="00:22:49.910" style="s2">it would might be a good example for ya</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:51.460" style="s2">like what does something mean looks like</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.910" end="00:22:54.140" style="s2">that&#39;s 90 percent or above</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.460" end="00:22:56.120" style="s2">yeah like where maybe there&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.140" end="00:22:57.860" style="s2">one that&#39;s like trying to be against it</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.120" end="00:22:59.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s just thoroughly disproven so it</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.860" end="00:23:01.550" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a lot of weight but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.440" end="00:23:04.670" style="s2">yeah and you can&#39;t really do Flat Earth</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.550" end="00:23:07.400" style="s2">because they have so much yeah there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.670" end="00:23:09.170" style="s2">lot of debunk yeah and as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.400" end="00:23:14.150" style="s2">see if I&#39;m good there&#39;s five more things</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.170" end="00:23:17.240" style="s2">right yeah it&#39;s pretty amazing but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.150" end="00:23:19.100" style="s2">I mean if even if flights you know I</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.240" end="00:23:21.050" style="s2">don&#39;t know if adrià you and I could</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.100" end="00:23:22.610" style="s2">think of something that we honestly</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.050" end="00:23:27.290" style="s2">disagree on although I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.610" end="00:23:28.640" style="s2">fairly close yeah a lot of things I</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.290" end="00:23:30.320" style="s2">don&#39;t know do you have an opinion on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.640" end="00:23:32.120" style="s2">universe space you may not want to say</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.320" end="00:23:34.910" style="s2">because of no minds almost the exact</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.120" end="00:23:36.380" style="s2">same where it&#39;s like I like the idea in</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.910" end="00:23:39.500" style="s2">concept I&#39;m worried about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.380" end="00:23:41.930" style="s2">application and like less so about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.500" end="00:23:44.300" style="s2">like that people will get lazy and more</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.930" end="00:23:46.640" style="s2">like how does the Helen does a scale</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.300" end="00:23:50.270" style="s2">like what happens if you have set you</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.640" end="00:23:52.160" style="s2">know 10 billion people and only nine you</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.270" end="00:23:54.220" style="s2">know or and only a billion of them sort</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.160" end="00:23:56.630" style="s2">of won&#39;t want to do full-time like</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.220" end="00:24:00.800" style="s2">contributing towards paying for ubi work</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.630" end="00:24:02.780" style="s2">what&#39;s the cutoff so I just want to see</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.800" end="00:24:05.420" style="s2">some actual examples in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.780" end="00:24:07.460" style="s2">and they keep getting truncated and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.420" end="00:24:09.500" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s one situation where if</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.460" end="00:24:12.230" style="s2">you did the reason score it would</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.500" end="00:24:14.120" style="s2">probably come to like undecided and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.230" end="00:24:16.000" style="s2">in the result is we need to do studies</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.120" end="00:24:18.350" style="s2">and right</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.000" end="00:24:19.970" style="s2">you know so in that case the reason</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.350" end="00:24:21.560" style="s2">score didn&#39;t help at all except if</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.970" end="00:24:23.420" style="s2">someone&#39;s arguing yes I know it will</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.560" end="00:24:24.740" style="s2">work and another person yes I know it</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.420" end="00:24:26.660" style="s2">won&#39;t work you get them in that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.740" end="00:24:28.790" style="s2">okay you don&#39;t know let&#39;s all put our</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.660" end="00:24:30.950" style="s2">money in and do a study together right</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.790" end="00:24:32.870" style="s2">because I think some of the best studies</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.950" end="00:24:34.670" style="s2">are when it&#39;s funded by both sides of</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.870" end="00:24:37.100" style="s2">the argument my passion of people and</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.670" end="00:24:39.530" style="s2">they both get and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.100" end="00:24:42.310" style="s2">seen this where they both get to design</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.530" end="00:24:45.500" style="s2">the study because then when it comes out</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.310" end="00:24:47.300" style="s2">you they it won&#39;t be so easily like oh</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.500" end="00:24:48.920" style="s2">well you you didn&#39;t have any one because</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.300" end="00:24:51.020" style="s2">you know I&#39;m doing a lot of stuff on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.920" end="00:24:52.640" style="s2">on the keto diet it&#39;s like well this</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.020" end="00:24:54.500" style="s2">study shows that kita is dangerous I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.640" end="00:24:56.810" style="s2">like you did not have a single person in</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.500" end="00:24:59.480" style="s2">that study that was in ketosis your</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.810" end="00:25:02.030" style="s2">low-carb was like 300 carbs grams of</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.480" end="00:25:05.990" style="s2">carbs a day and ketosis is fifty to a</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.030" end="00:25:07.580" style="s2">hundred you can&#39;t say you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.990" end="00:25:09.470" style="s2">making lines and they&#39;re taking lines</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.580" end="00:25:11.210" style="s2">and and projecting them out and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.470" end="00:25:15.320" style="s2">like well that&#39;s not that&#39;s not how</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.210" end="00:25:16.190" style="s2">reality works I&#39;m not sure how you could</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.320" end="00:25:18.380" style="s2">do this well there&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.190" end="00:25:19.760" style="s2">interesting episode of mythbusters&#39; I</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.380" end="00:25:21.680" style="s2">would love to see them do again because</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.760" end="00:25:24.110" style="s2">I was like whoa that&#39;s weird it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.680" end="00:25:26.780" style="s2">where they um they tested like if plants</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.110" end="00:25:29.090" style="s2">can react on a polygraph it was based on</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.780" end="00:25:31.100" style="s2">a book called the secret life plans</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.090" end="00:25:33.080" style="s2">which I&#39;ve read and they did the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.100" end="00:25:34.880" style="s2">experiment wrong like just slightly</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.080" end="00:25:36.440" style="s2">because they they did it and they</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.880" end="00:25:38.390" style="s2">actually got a result where it did</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.440" end="00:25:39.740" style="s2">respond and they freaked out and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.390" end="00:25:41.600" style="s2">they kept doing it again to the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.740" end="00:25:44.480" style="s2">plant and it&#39;s not doing like okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.600" end="00:25:46.370" style="s2">it&#39;s you know debunked except that if</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.480" end="00:25:48.110" style="s2">you read the book that&#39;s like the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.370" end="00:25:49.190" style="s2">third sentence is that he kept doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.110" end="00:25:50.330" style="s2">into the same plan that it stopped</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.190" end="00:25:52.130" style="s2">reacting so we got a new plant and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.330" end="00:25:53.630" style="s2">plant started reacting and so it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.130" end="00:25:56.510" style="s2">like the plants get used to you or</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.630" end="00:25:57.740" style="s2">something according to the book and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.510" end="00:26:00.950" style="s2">know as I was really having like this</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.740" end="00:26:02.720" style="s2">sounds kind of hokey and then mints</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.950" end="00:26:04.130" style="s2">Buster&#39;s kind of accidentally proved it</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.720" end="00:26:06.950" style="s2">I&#39;m like okay now I want to see more of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.130" end="00:26:10.220" style="s2">this that&#39;s super interesting yeah have</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.950" end="00:26:11.750" style="s2">one that I looked into in when I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.220" end="00:26:13.130" style="s2">doing my undergrad which was you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.750" end="00:26:15.200" style="s2">over ten years ago so I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.130" end="00:26:18.590" style="s2">it&#39;s been decided but wild salmon versus</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.200" end="00:26:20.690" style="s2">farmed salmon and that wild salmon</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.590" end="00:26:22.760" style="s2">killed a certain farm salmon kills wild</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.690" end="00:26:25.700" style="s2">salmon stock right they farm salmon is</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.760" end="00:26:27.890" style="s2">dangerous for wild salmon and I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.700" end="00:26:29.390" style="s2">eating wild salmon at all I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.890" end="00:26:31.750" style="s2">salmon at all because I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.390" end="00:26:35.540" style="s2">boycotting it and when I looked into it</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.750" end="00:26:37.520" style="s2">there neither the Suzuki Foundation</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.540" end="00:26:40.160" style="s2">which was the environmental Pro while</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.520" end="00:26:42.200" style="s2">you know wild salmon nor the fish farms</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.160" end="00:26:43.640" style="s2">had done this very simple simple</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.200" end="00:26:45.830" style="s2">experiment that would have cost a few</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.640" end="00:26:47.150" style="s2">hundred dollars and proven one side or</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.830" end="00:26:49.549" style="s2">the other but neither side wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.150" end="00:26:50.090" style="s2">prove it right because sea lice it just</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.549" end="00:26:51.620" style="s2">makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.090" end="00:26:52.940" style="s2">all of these wild salmon have so much</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.620" end="00:26:54.530" style="s2">sea lice on them of course they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.940" end="00:26:56.540" style="s2">getting it from the farm salmon like</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.530" end="00:26:58.309" style="s2">logically and then when you look at when</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.540" end="00:27:00.080" style="s2">they go through and the lifecycle of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.309" end="00:27:03.500" style="s2">lice it doesn&#39;t actually make sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.080" end="00:27:05.210" style="s2">because the lice can&#39;t move so like to</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.500" end="00:27:06.710" style="s2">just put particles in the water and see</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.210" end="00:27:09.559" style="s2">where they end up what the currents</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.710" end="00:27:11.059" style="s2">would be so easy and yet none of them</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.559" end="00:27:13.220" style="s2">have done it instead they just wanna you</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.059" end="00:27:15.230" style="s2">know what I mean like vilify farmed</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.220" end="00:27:16.850" style="s2">salmon and vilify wild salmon and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.230" end="00:27:18.080" style="s2">one issue right forget about all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.850" end="00:27:20.299" style="s2">pollution that comes off the farmed</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.080" end="00:27:21.559" style="s2">salmon but like this one issue nobody</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.299" end="00:27:23.929" style="s2">wants to look into because it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.559" end="00:27:26.750" style="s2">easy to pick one side and be like yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.929" end="00:27:27.710" style="s2">believe that yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.750" end="00:27:29.720" style="s2">interesting because it makes me think</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.710" end="00:27:32.120" style="s2">that if you if we did have reason score</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.720" end="00:27:33.890" style="s2">out and wasn&#39;t use that situations like</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.120" end="00:27:36.679" style="s2">that people would see that all this</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.890" end="00:27:38.090" style="s2">arguing just gets everything to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.679" end="00:27:41.809" style="s2">middle and it&#39;s like well if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.090" end="00:27:44.179" style="s2">move that dial do a study which</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.809" end="00:27:48.919" style="s2">oftentimes people really sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.179" end="00:27:52.240" style="s2">don&#39;t want to know if your identities in</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.919" end="00:27:54.410" style="s2">it if you&#39;ve worked for 20 years on on</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.240" end="00:27:55.850" style="s2">fighting this thing and then you ran a</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.410" end="00:27:57.500" style="s2">study and proved that you were wrong</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.850" end="00:27:58.850" style="s2">that would be devastating</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.500" end="00:28:01.130" style="s2">no I don&#39;t think people think through</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.850" end="00:28:03.860" style="s2">that process but that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.130" end="00:28:07.220" style="s2">subconscious back of the mind worried I</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.860" end="00:28:10.490" style="s2">I was digging into my nutrition science</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.220" end="00:28:12.980" style="s2">and I invited a guy who opposes my</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.490" end="00:28:15.830" style="s2">opinions I started reading his stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.980" end="00:28:17.840" style="s2">listening to his podcast and I felt that</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.830" end="00:28:22.340" style="s2">same sort of thing it&#39;s like oh that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.840" end="00:28:24.740" style="s2">good point and that point scares me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.340" end="00:28:26.120" style="s2">like well first of all have I been you</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.740" end="00:28:28.940" style="s2">know for the last four years making it</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.120" end="00:28:31.730" style="s2">or I&#39;m gonna have a heart attack but</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.940" end="00:28:35.270" style="s2">also just the fact I could feel my</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.730" end="00:28:38.440" style="s2">subconscious fighting me on following</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.270" end="00:28:41.350" style="s2">the truth because it breaks my identity</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.440" end="00:28:49.610" style="s2">that was really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.350" end="00:28:54.260" style="s2">experience so yeah so if anyone either</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.610" end="00:28:55.880" style="s2">has a topic and either knows the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.260" end="00:28:58.130" style="s2">hard part is finding two people that</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.880" end="00:28:59.750" style="s2">would disagree so either one of y&#39;all</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.130" end="00:29:02.510" style="s2">would have to actually disagree with me</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.750" end="00:29:03.920" style="s2">on something or we&#39;d have to find</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.510" end="00:29:11.270" style="s2">another person that does that are all</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.920" end="00:29:13.520" style="s2">willing to kind of do it I so yeah so my</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.270" end="00:29:17.390" style="s2">next tactic is to get this guy who</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.520" end="00:29:19.310" style="s2">believes that that is against the keto</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.390" end="00:29:27.140" style="s2">diet and I&#39;m going to have him</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.310" end="00:29:29.360" style="s2">participate and I&#39;m also gonna put it</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.140" end="00:29:30.770" style="s2">out on Twitter to those communities both</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:34.160" style="s2">kind of his community in my community</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.770" end="00:29:43.250" style="s2">and and have them kind of feed in facts</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.160" end="00:29:44.450" style="s2">to it we&#39;ll see if that works so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.250" end="00:29:50.690" style="s2">sorry I didn&#39;t take up the whole hours a</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.450" end="00:29:53.900" style="s2">hot seat but it was a pretty detailed</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.690" end="00:29:57.980" style="s2">sort of nicely wandering conversation</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.900" end="00:30:01.340" style="s2">throughout the various pieces feel like</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.980" end="00:30:02.750" style="s2">it&#39;s masks no masks to to hot button</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.340" end="00:30:04.340" style="s2">right now for that to be a thing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.750" end="00:30:06.170" style="s2">recent scar deals with because it feels</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.340" end="00:30:08.650" style="s2">like not only is the information</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.170" end="00:30:12.020" style="s2">changing everyday it&#39;s also like people</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.650" end="00:30:14.840" style="s2">have their one viewpoint and I find a</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.020" end="00:30:16.220" style="s2">lot of it is also sensory based that</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.840" end="00:30:17.630" style="s2">people don&#39;t want to wear masks so</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.220" end="00:30:19.640" style="s2">therefore they&#39;re gonna find them to not</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.630" end="00:30:21.650" style="s2">wear masks versus looking at the actual</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.640" end="00:30:23.240" style="s2">science and yet it&#39;s very true it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.650" end="00:30:25.880" style="s2">to wear a mask and to not honor that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.240" end="00:30:28.340" style="s2">think that like this actually isn&#39;t easy</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.880" end="00:30:29.810" style="s2">and it costs something but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.340" end="00:30:31.730" style="s2">science and is this good for the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.810" end="00:30:32.900" style="s2">population and then it&#39;s not actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.730" end="00:30:38.270" style="s2">protecting you it&#39;s protecting that</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.900" end="00:30:41.150" style="s2">everybody else and then yeah the people</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.270" end="00:30:44.840" style="s2">I know that don&#39;t wear masks tend to</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.150" end="00:30:49.100" style="s2">believe that kovat is not a hoax but</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.840" end="00:30:52.280" style="s2">it&#39;s so overblown so that gets into the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.100" end="00:30:54.290" style="s2">whole you know is everyone lying to you</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.280" end="00:30:54.559" style="s2">and the truth is yes the media&#39;s lying</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.290" end="00:30:57.080" style="s2">Oh</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.559" end="00:30:58.999" style="s2">Media is exaggerating the government is</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.080" end="00:31:01.580" style="s2">exaggerating but that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.999" end="00:31:03.799" style="s2">it&#39;s not something we should print so it</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.580" end="00:31:08.120" style="s2">kind of gets into that into the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.799" end="00:31:09.590" style="s2">discussion pretty quickly but if I if I</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.120" end="00:31:12.110" style="s2">found someone who was concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.590" end="00:31:14.629" style="s2">the disease but thought you didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.110" end="00:31:17.620" style="s2">to wear a mask I mean actually like we</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.629" end="00:31:21.350" style="s2">don&#39;t wear masks outdoors usually</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.620" end="00:31:22.879" style="s2">anymore unless we&#39;re in a confined space</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.350" end="00:31:26.330" style="s2">like if I was in a protest I&#39;d probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.879" end="00:31:29.299" style="s2">wear a mask but just walking around the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.330" end="00:31:31.480" style="s2">parks and stuff we don&#39;t so that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.299" end="00:31:34.039" style="s2">that would probably be an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.480" end="00:31:35.470" style="s2">yeah that would work if we have two</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.039" end="00:31:37.519" style="s2">people on either side</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.470" end="00:31:39.230" style="s2">one of the other things that I&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.519" end="00:31:41.330" style="s2">up against are just possibly my identity</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.230" end="00:31:45.289" style="s2">and that was like the discussion of free</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.330" end="00:31:47.269" style="s2">speech and like the technical definitely</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.289" end="00:31:49.190" style="s2">no you don&#39;t get to say anything you</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.269" end="00:31:51.289" style="s2">want to me and I don&#39;t get offended like</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.190" end="00:31:56.710" style="s2">you there actually are consequences to</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.289" end="00:31:59.480" style="s2">your actions but is that like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.710" end="00:32:02.269" style="s2">that may be one of the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.480" end="00:32:04.519" style="s2">you saw the debate when you frame the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.269" end="00:32:06.590" style="s2">question so there&#39;s several things</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.519" end="00:32:08.299" style="s2">that&#39;s like saying you know is this</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.590" end="00:32:11.690" style="s2">person racist or not well once you</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.299" end="00:32:13.879" style="s2">define racist don&#39;t you have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.690" end="00:32:15.860" style="s2">definition the answer is the person is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.879" end="00:32:17.059" style="s2">yes both is racist and isn&#39;t racist</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.860" end="00:32:19.490" style="s2">because racist has multiple definitions</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.059" end="00:32:21.350" style="s2">and they fit some and not the other so</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.490" end="00:32:24.139" style="s2">when you frame it down it&#39;s like and</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.350" end="00:32:26.990" style="s2">really the amazing exercise of just</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.139" end="00:32:29.929" style="s2">clarifying the actual question solves</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.990" end="00:32:31.970" style="s2">the debate and that may be one of them</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.929" end="00:32:33.409" style="s2">but it&#39;s still good to go through the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.970" end="00:32:34.639" style="s2">exercise a lot of times you have to put</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.409" end="00:32:36.080" style="s2">here&#39;s the statement in there and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.639" end="00:32:38.929" style="s2">when you start putting the facts in and</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.080" end="00:32:41.179" style="s2">people realize oh we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.929" end="00:32:42.799" style="s2">two different things and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.179" end="00:32:44.179" style="s2">they argue about the definition race in</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.799" end="00:32:46.669" style="s2">which I don&#39;t I don&#39;t ever argue about</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.179" end="00:32:48.499" style="s2">definitions there&#39;s very few words that</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.669" end="00:32:50.179" style="s2">have a single definition and so we just</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.499" end="00:32:51.499" style="s2">agree which definition were talking</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.179" end="00:32:52.759" style="s2">about or what two definitions we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.499" end="00:32:55.460" style="s2">talking about that&#39;s two different</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.759" end="00:32:57.700" style="s2">answers and and we&#39;re settled we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.460" end="00:32:57.700" style="s2">agreement</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.049" end="00:33:07.369" style="s2">yeah what was the I did that Thai tribe</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.450" end="00:33:08.250" style="s2">and I forgot what your what your topic</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.369" end="00:33:14.760" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.250" end="00:33:16.470" style="s2">I free speech oh yeah I yeah so to put</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.760" end="00:33:20.690" style="s2">this in you&#39;d have to have a very</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.470" end="00:33:24.090" style="s2">specific statement because yeah the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.690" end="00:33:25.650" style="s2">thing about fries it&#39;s free to say</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.090" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">whatever you want and it&#39;s free for that</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.650" end="00:33:32.130" style="s2">other person to call you whatever they</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:33.360" style="s2">want back including cussing at you and</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.130" end="00:33:35.760" style="s2">telling you you&#39;re an idiot</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.360" end="00:33:37.650" style="s2">okay be yelling you down as a part of</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.760" end="00:33:41.880" style="s2">the free speech process if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.650" end="00:33:44.630" style="s2">like it it&#39;s when I have the government</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.880" end="00:33:46.950" style="s2">put you in jail for speaking yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.630" end="00:33:48.060" style="s2">yeah so but but that would be an</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.950" end="00:33:49.380" style="s2">interesting discussion because I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.060" end="00:33:52.320" style="s2">often times they are getting at</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.380" end="00:33:54.300" style="s2">something else like that&#39;s their what</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.320" end="00:33:57.350" style="s2">they&#39;re saying is their intuitive thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.300" end="00:34:00.630" style="s2">but if you if you explored it with them</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.350" end="00:34:01.650" style="s2">it&#39;d be something that does get into the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.630" end="00:34:03.450" style="s2">whole conversation about deep</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.650" end="00:34:05.070" style="s2">platforming which is interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.450" end="00:34:08.820" style="s2">know someone&#39;s going to a university</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.070" end="00:34:10.409" style="s2">should they be allowed to do that or you</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.820" end="00:34:14.669" style="s2">know they&#39;re allowed to stand on their</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.409" end="00:34:17.070" style="s2">street corner and say it so that would</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.669" end="00:34:19.320" style="s2">be and then and then whether there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.070" end="00:34:21.300" style="s2">allowed whether whether they&#39;re legally</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.320" end="00:34:22.590" style="s2">like have a right to do it and then even</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.300" end="00:34:24.330" style="s2">if they don&#39;t have a right to do it</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.590" end="00:34:26.100" style="s2">should we still allow it even if they</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.330" end="00:34:30.179" style="s2">disagree with us right so that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.100" end="00:34:32.010" style="s2">thing that&#39;s a separate debate the point</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.179" end="00:34:34.260" style="s2">could be true and what could be false so</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.010" end="00:34:38.820" style="s2">that would be that yeah that would be</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.260" end="00:34:40.620" style="s2">another interesting topic great timely</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.820" end="00:34:43.320" style="s2">one should JK Rowling be cancelled</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.620" end="00:34:46.080" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s the question he can go</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.320" end="00:34:49.169" style="s2">through but but there&#39;s no evidence like</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.080" end="00:34:51.570" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s all emotion right like</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.169" end="00:34:53.909" style="s2">there is no scientific paper it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.570" end="00:34:57.720" style="s2">feel very strongly this way or I feel</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.909" end="00:34:59.010" style="s2">very strongly this way there is no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.720" end="00:35:00.540" style="s2">like you can disagree with the thing and</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.010" end="00:35:02.880" style="s2">not have work like is there so many</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.540" end="00:35:06.830" style="s2">broad like the matrix of whether you</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.880" end="00:35:09.840" style="s2">agree or disagree is itself very complex</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.830" end="00:35:12.210" style="s2">and do we cancel women for lesser acts</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.840" end="00:35:14.190" style="s2">than we canceled in that was actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.210" end="00:35:16.020" style="s2">what came up for me this week and I it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.190" end="00:35:18.000" style="s2">like I think we do but I don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.020" end="00:35:21.390" style="s2">evidence right so is it just my feeling</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.000" end="00:35:24.240" style="s2">or is it so have we been doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.390" end="00:35:32.849" style="s2">as opposed to should we I mean I guess</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.240" end="00:35:34.859" style="s2">your summation but have we been yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.849" end="00:35:37.650" style="s2">that might be going back go back to we</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.859" end="00:35:39.390" style="s2">need to do a study on that not not that</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.650" end="00:35:41.880" style="s2">we have to run an experiment but someone</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.390" end="00:35:44.430" style="s2">needs to sit down classify what is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.880" end="00:35:46.650" style="s2">cancellation what are the and then take</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.430" end="00:35:51.960" style="s2">maybe a random sampling happy&#39;s in it so</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.650" end="00:35:54.359" style="s2">that does I think get into a I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.960" end="00:35:56.760" style="s2">interesting to talk to someone who said</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.359" end="00:35:59.549" style="s2">we say we don&#39;t because I often find we</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.760" end="00:36:06.660" style="s2">have higher expectations for how women</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.549" end="00:36:08.519" style="s2">and people of color speak in general but</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.660" end="00:36:11.460" style="s2">yeah whether there&#39;s evidence that there</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.519" end="00:36:13.019" style="s2">might be studies I mean there has been</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.460" end="00:36:15.720" style="s2">studies showing that women tend to get</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.019" end="00:36:18.390" style="s2">on after up with more in meetings than</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.720" end="00:36:21.690" style="s2">men so you could use that as evidence to</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.390" end="00:36:23.130" style="s2">say well we can just kind of there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.690" end="00:36:28.019" style="s2">there&#39;s a high chance that that</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.130" end="00:36:29.670" style="s2">correlates to social media right but so</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.019" end="00:36:31.559" style="s2">that would be interesting to look to see</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.670" end="00:36:35.369" style="s2">if there are any studies on that but a</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.559" end="00:36:40.039" style="s2">lot of things like that and what reasons</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.369" end="00:36:40.039" style="s2">for kind of leads me to is often what</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.609" end="00:36:44.339" style="s2">it&#39;s great to kind of know whether</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.539" end="00:36:45.660" style="s2">that&#39;s true or not but really what what</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.339" end="00:36:47.789" style="s2">are what are we getting at when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.660" end="00:36:50.130" style="s2">exploring that issue we&#39;re we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.789" end="00:36:54.230" style="s2">there&#39;s some sort of reaction it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.130" end="00:36:56.789" style="s2">should we then think twice before</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.230" end="00:36:59.339" style="s2">canceling women that because we know</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.789" end="00:37:01.920" style="s2">that there&#39;s a bias what&#39;s the action</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.339" end="00:37:03.359" style="s2">what&#39;s the conclusion of that being true</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.920" end="00:37:04.500" style="s2">that what&#39;s the action we&#39;ll want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.359" end="00:37:07.589" style="s2">take and let&#39;s kind of debate that</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.500" end="00:37:09.779" style="s2">action rather than whether this fact is</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.589" end="00:37:10.680" style="s2">true yeah cos n it becomes the office I</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.779" end="00:37:12.119" style="s2">think you&#39;re like well we&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.680" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">cancel women when they say anything</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.119" end="00:37:15.420" style="s2">because we know that we&#39;re biased</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.680" end="00:37:16.859" style="s2">against them so then we never cancel</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.420" end="00:37:18.900" style="s2">them and it goes the opposite way right</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.859" end="00:37:20.549" style="s2">and it&#39;s like okay let&#39;s not look at it</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.900" end="00:37:23.130" style="s2">let&#39;s look at the actual thing that was</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.549" end="00:37:26.880" style="s2">said and do we cancel that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.130" end="00:37:28.410" style="s2">based on this I do wonder how you handle</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.880" end="00:37:29.490" style="s2">the opposite side of that which is I</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.410" end="00:37:32.819" style="s2">think it&#39;s true that we probably do</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.490" end="00:37:34.559" style="s2">cancel women and people of color easier</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.819" end="00:37:34.830" style="s2">for sort of smaller infractions but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.559" end="00:37:36.780" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.830" end="00:37:39.300" style="s2">also men people are more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.780" end="00:37:42.540" style="s2">believe claims against them without</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.300" end="00:37:45.930" style="s2">evidence it&#39;s like you know Johnny Depp</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.540" end="00:37:47.610" style="s2">was a good example ever hurts a sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.930" end="00:37:49.140" style="s2">has something about you turn it up great</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.610" end="00:37:50.460" style="s2">you&#39;re canceled your movies cancelled</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.140" end="00:37:51.870" style="s2">you&#39;re gone forever</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.460" end="00:37:54.450" style="s2">and then the recordings come out were</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.870" end="00:37:57.330" style="s2">like Oh turns out maybe that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.450" end="00:37:59.580" style="s2">happened and then nothing really came</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.330" end="00:38:04.170" style="s2">out of that like then finding out that</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.580" end="00:38:05.550" style="s2">she was lying and you to me at least</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.170" end="00:38:07.950" style="s2">that sounds like it&#39;s kind of two sides</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.550" end="00:38:09.870" style="s2">of the same coin like how how are the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.950" end="00:38:11.370" style="s2">various groups treated in trying to</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.870" end="00:38:15.360" style="s2">figure out if they should be cancelled</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.370" end="00:38:19.980" style="s2">or not yeah when really I guess in that</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.360" end="00:38:24.900" style="s2">whole situation is I would like to write</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.980" end="00:38:26.670" style="s2">up a more objective way to determine</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.900" end="00:38:28.700" style="s2">when we should so I&#39;d have a proposal</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.670" end="00:38:31.230" style="s2">saying we should cancel people win X</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.700" end="00:38:32.610" style="s2">situation occurs and then that would</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.230" end="00:38:34.380" style="s2">also that would help with both of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.610" end="00:38:36.870" style="s2">canceling too much too little because</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.380" end="00:38:38.370" style="s2">then it&#39;s not such so subjective it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.870" end="00:38:40.220" style="s2">more objective of course once you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.370" end="00:38:43.410" style="s2">stuff like that people will game it but</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.220" end="00:38:49.530" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s probably better than in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.410" end="00:38:50.940" style="s2">kind of group it kind of encourages mob</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.530" end="00:38:52.200" style="s2">mentality when you don&#39;t have any sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.940" end="00:38:53.700" style="s2">of guidelines and they don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.200" end="00:38:55.530" style="s2">rules I think it&#39;d be guidelines and</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.700" end="00:38:58.140" style="s2">people can point to it say well in this</p>

<p begin="00:39:08.400" end="00:39:12.630" style="s2">the different categories they fit in cuz</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.470" end="00:39:14.340" style="s2">I found it like throw us trying to find</p>

<p begin="00:39:18.930" end="00:39:22.560" style="s2">roadmap for that part of it is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.370" end="00:39:23.970" style="s2">might help figure out what we could talk</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.560" end="00:39:26.310" style="s2">about couldn&#39;t talk about and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.970" end="00:39:28.170" style="s2">where you have gaps in like oh this is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.310" end="00:39:33.960" style="s2">cool topic but there there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.170" end="00:39:35.220" style="s2">there like many examples no so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.960" end="00:39:36.990" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing maybe we should do a</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.220" end="00:39:39.900" style="s2">blog post on what makes a good reason</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.990" end="00:39:41.430" style="s2">score or debate because yeah that I was</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.900" end="00:39:42.690" style="s2">thinking too secondly well that all kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.430" end="00:39:44.630" style="s2">of comes out in the debate but then I</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.690" end="00:39:47.010" style="s2">keep thinking oh yeah I&#39;ve been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.630" end="00:39:48.750" style="s2">pooh-poohing ideas</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.010" end="00:39:51.150" style="s2">let&#39;s throw out this whole thing and</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.750" end="00:39:55.920" style="s2">maybe be easier if I would come up with</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.150" end="00:39:57.720" style="s2">here&#39;s here&#39;s the the narrow topic type</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.920" end="00:39:59.700" style="s2">that I think would be useful so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.720" end="00:40:03.869" style="s2">I&#39;ll make the I&#39;ll put that on on a</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.700" end="00:40:05.670" style="s2">to-do list and although a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.869" end="00:40:08.040" style="s2">I&#39;m making it too narrow and I really</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.670" end="00:40:14.970" style="s2">just need to play with it so I need to</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.040" end="00:40:17.310" style="s2">stop being so over optimizing I know</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.970" end="00:40:20.430" style="s2">habit one of the hard things that I have</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.310" end="00:40:21.480" style="s2">to sort of come to grips with with wiki</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.430" end="00:40:23.310" style="s2">election is when trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.480" end="00:40:24.900" style="s2">problems understanding that some</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.310" end="00:40:26.490" style="s2">problems will be in that we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.900" end="00:40:28.170" style="s2">enough information state right now and</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.490" end="00:40:29.579" style="s2">like being okay with that because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.170" end="00:40:31.170" style="s2">actually the truth right now we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.579" end="00:40:31.500" style="s2">have enough information if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.170" end="00:40:33.810" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.500" end="00:40:34.950" style="s2">cool then we need more information but</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.810" end="00:40:36.690" style="s2">right now you can sort of say you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.950" end="00:40:38.550" style="s2">both sides are a bit right in a bit</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.690" end="00:40:40.770" style="s2">wrong cuz there&#39;s parts but we just</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.550" end="00:40:43.740" style="s2">don&#39;t know enough and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.770" end="00:40:45.690" style="s2">still very valuable because then all</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.740" end="00:40:47.430" style="s2">these people kind of yelling about it on</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.690" end="00:40:51.599" style="s2">social media you can tell them well you</p>

<p begin="00:40:51.599" end="00:40:56.490" style="s2">information to make that conclusion you</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.060" end="00:40:57.839" style="s2">can keep tanked saying it but I I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.490" end="00:40:59.819" style="s2">gonna ignore you now and move on to</p>

<p begin="00:42:27.970" end="00:42:36.040" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the problem what reasons</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.400" end="00:42:39.040" style="s2">course trying to fix is that this kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.040" end="00:42:40.990" style="s2">of give us that what kind of agree at</p>

<p begin="00:42:58.900" end="00:43:06.670" style="s2">make a blog post about that and in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.520" end="00:43:08.740" style="s2">past I&#39;ve posted some topics or actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.670" end="00:43:13.320" style="s2">you can go to pro/con Oregon almost any</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.740" end="00:43:13.320" style="s2">of those well I mean with some change</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.950" end="00:43:21.300" style="s2">that&#39;s if it&#39;s still up there recently</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.369" end="00:43:24.640" style="s2">bought by somebody I can&#39;t remember I</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.300" end="00:43:27.369" style="s2">think this is the one that I yeah I are</p>

<p begin="00:43:27.369" end="00:43:33.460" style="s2">to see so it seemed like for her then</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.780" end="00:43:35.410" style="s2">they always tried to keep the number of</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.460" end="00:43:39.880" style="s2">points even mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.410" end="00:43:42.460" style="s2">which oh I wasn&#39;t a big fan up yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.880" end="00:43:46.050" style="s2">kind of cool though it&#39;s a good proof of</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.460" end="00:43:51.540" style="s2">concept for what we&#39;re both working on</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.050" end="00:43:56.440" style="s2">yeah yeah and actually the CEO from</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.540" end="00:43:59.170" style="s2">pro/con dot org I have a friend who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.440" end="00:44:02.500" style="s2">talking to him about some future work in</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.170" end="00:44:04.560" style="s2">the debate space okay so to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.500" end="00:44:10.020" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.560" end="00:44:20.550" style="s2">yeah yes so the top thing is the 20 20</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.020" end="00:44:23.160" style="s2">euro selection right yeah so really</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.550" end="00:44:25.520" style="s2">almost any of these would work if I</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.160" end="00:44:31.080" style="s2">could find two people that were</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.520" end="00:44:35.700" style="s2">relatively polite and we&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.080" end="00:44:37.290" style="s2">work with a tool in beta right and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.700" end="00:44:39.150" style="s2">thinking the best process would be to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.290" end="00:44:42.270" style="s2">it like a game so each person gets two</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.150" end="00:44:47.340" style="s2">moves before the other person does and</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.270" end="00:44:49.620" style="s2">do it like that yeah I think that&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.340" end="00:44:51.750" style="s2">more more pull to it to get people</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.620" end="00:44:53.520" style="s2">interested what would happen there like</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.750" end="00:44:56.280" style="s2">if the other side sort of didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.520" end="00:44:58.320" style="s2">anything to add but the other other side</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.280" end="00:44:59.880" style="s2">did right like so I go you go I go you</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.320" end="00:45:02.640" style="s2">go I go</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.880" end="00:45:03.870" style="s2">and then you add yours and I have any</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.640" end="00:45:08.070" style="s2">more to add but you still have ten more</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.870" end="00:45:10.680" style="s2">things well I think at the time you</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.070" end="00:45:12.900" style="s2">don&#39;t have anything to add the score</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.680" end="00:45:15.360" style="s2">theoretically should be for the other</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.900" end="00:45:18.600" style="s2">person so if you don&#39;t have anything to</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.360" end="00:45:21.690" style="s2">add then you have to kind of concede the</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.600" end="00:45:24.390" style="s2">debate at that point because you may</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.690" end="00:45:28.440" style="s2">intuitively think you may intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.390" end="00:45:30.060" style="s2">feel that&#39;s wrong and the thing is well</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.440" end="00:45:32.340" style="s2">come back to us when you have more info</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.060" end="00:45:39.630" style="s2">but until now you have some facts the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.340" end="00:45:41.190" style="s2">other person will quote wins and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.630" end="00:45:43.680" style="s2">you just have to find but usually though</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.190" end="00:45:45.360" style="s2">we yeah so that&#39;s that&#39;s the goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.680" end="00:45:51.180" style="s2">get it down to where someone has nothing</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.360" end="00:45:54.590" style="s2">bad yeah that&#39;s the success it worked</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.180" end="00:45:59.010" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.590" end="00:46:04.590" style="s2">and it seems to out are actually facts</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.010" end="00:46:08.850" style="s2">as improving documented facts well you</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.590" end="00:46:13.110" style="s2">can that&#39;s kind of where liens but there</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.850" end="00:46:16.500" style="s2">are times where you&#39;re also talking</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.110" end="00:46:17.580" style="s2">about logic like that doesn&#39;t apply</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.500" end="00:46:20.670" style="s2">because of X</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.580" end="00:46:23.070" style="s2">and also you can put in things like well</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.670" end="00:46:24.570" style="s2">there&#39;s a chance that X might happen so</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.070" end="00:46:29.370" style="s2">if like we&#39;re talking about the disease</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.570" end="00:46:31.020" style="s2">the the the pandemic you know three</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.370" end="00:46:34.050" style="s2">months ago it&#39;s like well we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.020" end="00:46:36.510" style="s2">the are number we don&#39;t know how fast</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.050" end="00:46:39.050" style="s2">this transmits in it&#39;s like well in that</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.510" end="00:46:41.670" style="s2">case maybe we should social distance</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.050" end="00:46:43.290" style="s2">because we don&#39;t know so that&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.670" end="00:46:45.330" style="s2">links to a study or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.290" end="00:46:47.340" style="s2">that&#39;s just kind of like a logical</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.330" end="00:46:49.740" style="s2">conclusion statement that then people</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.340" end="00:46:52.470" style="s2">can pro/con and say well you know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.740" end="00:46:53.730" style="s2">wait for the data to come out because it</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.470" end="00:46:55.710" style="s2">will run our economy and the other</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.730" end="00:46:58.220" style="s2">person is like well by the time you have</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.710" end="00:47:00.540" style="s2">the data if it is a high our number</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.220" end="00:47:03.150" style="s2">because it grows exponentially it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.540" end="00:47:05.720" style="s2">late and a substantial percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.150" end="00:47:05.720" style="s2">people will die</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.140" end="00:47:13.080" style="s2">so that yeah it&#39;s not always facts but</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.710" end="00:47:15.870" style="s2">we certainly encourage fact-based stuff</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.080" end="00:47:20.460" style="s2">and and the other thing is no factors</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.870" end="00:47:22.920" style="s2">ever really proven I guess it&#39;s proven</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.460" end="00:47:24.510" style="s2">but a study doesn&#39;t prove effect because</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.920" end="00:47:26.280" style="s2">people then come in and say why that</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.510" end="00:47:28.790" style="s2">study was wrong and stuff like that but</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.280" end="00:47:34.470" style="s2">they all have a certain probability of</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.790" end="00:47:36.240" style="s2">accuracy right yeah I think with with</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.470" end="00:47:37.200" style="s2">all of this and it&#39;s something that I</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.240" end="00:47:39.570" style="s2">think people will have a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.200" end="00:47:42.660" style="s2">grasping is it&#39;s not that we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.570" end="00:47:44.550" style="s2">what&#39;s like 100 percent true it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.660" end="00:47:46.650" style="s2">seems to be most likely to be true based</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.550" end="00:47:49.620" style="s2">on the current information available</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.650" end="00:47:51.270" style="s2">yeah which is a mouthful and doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.620" end="00:47:52.860" style="s2">give you a lot of confidence for like</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.270" end="00:47:54.770" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re actually saying here</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.860" end="00:47:56.970" style="s2">because people who make sweeping</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.770" end="00:47:58.230" style="s2">generalizations bug this is 100 percent</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.970" end="00:47:59.160" style="s2">true probably aren&#39;t pushing that on</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.230" end="00:48:00.360" style="s2">evidence they&#39;re just saying that</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.160" end="00:48:06.750" style="s2">because that&#39;s their side and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.360" end="00:48:08.220" style="s2">they talk yes I think I&#39;ll do that blog</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.750" end="00:48:10.650" style="s2">post then I&#39;ll probably link to Pro</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.220" end="00:48:13.320" style="s2">condone or because I actually none of</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.650" end="00:48:21.780" style="s2">these are phrased properly well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.320" end="00:48:24.240" style="s2">see but there it&#39;s a good starting point</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.780" end="00:48:26.520" style="s2">for ideas I guess it&#39;s like even like</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.240" end="00:48:28.800" style="s2">the homework one is homework beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.520" end="00:48:30.610" style="s2">which really that&#39;s not the question the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.800" end="00:48:33.610" style="s2">question is</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.610" end="00:48:35.410" style="s2">how much how long has been official and</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.610" end="00:48:37.030" style="s2">what kind I guess I guess if you if</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.410" end="00:48:40.570" style="s2">someone might be arguing if someone</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.030" end="00:48:42.580" style="s2">wants to argue that any work outside the</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.570" end="00:48:47.140" style="s2">classroom is detrimental then you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.580" end="00:48:49.570" style="s2">that could be a debate yes so like even</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.140" end="00:48:51.940" style="s2">the like they&#39;re pro one homework</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.570" end="00:48:54.190" style="s2">improve student achievement and con one</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.940" end="00:49:00.670" style="s2">is too much homework can be harmful well</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.190" end="00:49:03.790" style="s2">those are not opposites yeah true that</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.670" end="00:49:05.560" style="s2">can be the both of those can very much</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.790" end="00:49:07.510" style="s2">be true at the same time yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.560" end="00:49:09.910" style="s2">and it&#39;s also like improved student</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.510" end="00:49:12.280" style="s2">achievement okay but if you structured</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.910" end="00:49:15.250" style="s2">your education around making it prove</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.280" end="00:49:17.410" style="s2">that homework is useful like I was</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.250" end="00:49:19.090" style="s2">terrible at doing homework and actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.410" end="00:49:21.550" style="s2">doing so with that I still did okay and</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.090" end="00:49:22.780" style="s2">tests I think you know everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.550" end="00:49:25.990" style="s2">different it&#39;s the whole like trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.780" end="00:49:31.210" style="s2">teach a fish to climb a tree think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.990" end="00:49:32.680" style="s2">yeah interesting yes that&#39;s where I took</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.210" end="00:49:35.050" style="s2">a look at this site because it did have</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.680" end="00:49:36.100" style="s2">some similarities to wiki lection where</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.050" end="00:49:37.780" style="s2">I was trying to sort of compare like</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.100" end="00:49:40.210" style="s2">apples to apples in that same kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.780" end="00:49:41.830" style="s2">grid and then I saw some of them that</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.210" end="00:49:43.450" style="s2">like when I&#39;ve seen other people talk</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.830" end="00:49:45.460" style="s2">about it it&#39;s a very one-sided debate</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.450" end="00:49:46.540" style="s2">like one side has a thousand things to</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.460" end="00:49:49.060" style="s2">talk about and the other one has like</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.540" end="00:49:50.920" style="s2">two that it refuses to let get proven</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.060" end="00:49:52.240" style="s2">wrong and then they had them like with</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.920" end="00:49:54.400" style="s2">like three or four points each and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.240" end="00:49:58.180" style="s2">like that it&#39;s not a representative of</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.400" end="00:50:00.910" style="s2">what this this debate actually is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.180" end="00:50:02.650" style="s2">yeah and I I thought it was great when I</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.910" end="00:50:07.240" style="s2">first saw that I thought about yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.650" end="00:50:10.990" style="s2">kind of um yeah it&#39;s a bit misleading it</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.240" end="00:50:14.860" style="s2">really seems to lead you to I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.990" end="00:50:16.090" style="s2">despair because every point you look at</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.860" end="00:50:17.710" style="s2">it&#39;s like well those are some good</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.090" end="00:50:18.820" style="s2">points those are some bad points on one</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.710" end="00:50:20.500" style="s2">side and then those are some good signs</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.820" end="00:50:23.860" style="s2">those so bad points on the outside it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.500" end="00:50:25.900" style="s2">like my brain can&#39;t I can&#39;t do anything</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.860" end="00:50:28.180" style="s2">with this information it just leaves me</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.900" end="00:50:31.240" style="s2">to believe that no one knows the truth</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.180" end="00:50:34.390" style="s2">right and yeah on every issue you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.240" end="00:50:35.440" style="s2">like oh we know nothing great right like</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.390" end="00:50:36.550" style="s2">that one thing that you were scared</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.440" end="00:50:38.140" style="s2">about with reason score there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.550" end="00:50:42.950" style="s2">psyche based on that like we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.140" end="00:50:45.360" style="s2">yeah yeah so I found it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.950" end="00:50:47.100" style="s2">in recent score might be the same way</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.360" end="00:50:49.760" style="s2">might be like we don&#39;t have over 10</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.100" end="00:50:53.460" style="s2">percent confidence in anything like oh</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.760" end="00:50:55.320" style="s2">sorry although a lot of times if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.460" end="00:50:57.810" style="s2">talking about should we do this proposal</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.320" end="00:51:00.330" style="s2">or not it&#39;s like well if it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.810" end="00:51:03.210" style="s2">percent better than the other side then</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.330" end="00:51:05.070" style="s2">let&#39;s do it right yeah yeah and there</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.210" end="00:51:06.570" style="s2">are some things luck you mentioned with</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.070" end="00:51:08.700" style="s2">the pandemic thing we&#39;re like okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.570" end="00:51:09.930" style="s2">there&#39;s the like what&#39;s happening well</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.700" end="00:51:12.330" style="s2">there&#39;s all there&#39;s almost a pre</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.930" end="00:51:14.100" style="s2">conversation with okay what is the level</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.330" end="00:51:15.360" style="s2">of confidence like what are the numbers</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.100" end="00:51:18.360" style="s2">that we need to see to say that one</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.360" end="00:51:20.630" style="s2">thing wins over another because you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.360" end="00:51:23.610" style="s2">if there if it has a certain like</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.630" end="00:51:24.930" style="s2">infection rate then when we actually are</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.610" end="00:51:27.870" style="s2">able to prove it it&#39;s gonna be way too</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.930" end="00:51:30.120" style="s2">late and like my whole thing with with</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.870" end="00:51:32.130" style="s2">global warming it&#39;s like it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.120" end="00:51:33.930" style="s2">easy to say whoops turns out you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.130" end="00:51:35.310" style="s2">these parts weren&#39;t right okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.930" end="00:51:38.640" style="s2">scale back up these industries as</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.310" end="00:51:41.600" style="s2">opposed to it&#39;s hard to undo that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.640" end="00:51:46.400" style="s2">and so like I haven&#39;t done a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.600" end="00:51:49.500" style="s2">research the the sign these science</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.400" end="00:51:51.660" style="s2">leaving people I know it doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.500" end="00:51:54.360" style="s2">that two-sided of a conversation but but</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.660" end="00:51:56.370" style="s2">even just that pre conversation of what</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.360" end="00:52:00.240" style="s2">are sort of the outcomes like what are</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.370" end="00:52:01.950" style="s2">the risks involved and how much would</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.240" end="00:52:05.360" style="s2">one side need to win over the other for</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.950" end="00:52:08.070" style="s2">it to actually be like oh it&#39;s or even</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.360" end="00:52:10.320" style="s2">you know we may still want to lead them</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.070" end="00:52:12.750" style="s2">in one directional for another or at</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.320" end="00:52:15.420" style="s2">least say you know ones like business</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.750" end="00:52:17.130" style="s2">and one&#39;s personal health so however you</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.420" end="00:52:22.380" style="s2">lean you know that&#39;s sort of the key</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.130" end="00:52:27.270" style="s2">issues and yeah I&#39;ve been thinking like</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.380" end="00:52:30.840" style="s2">right now if it&#39;s between well right now</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.270" end="00:52:34.350" style="s2">it goes from plus 100 to -100 so if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.840" end="00:52:37.160" style="s2">if it&#39;s like from minus 5 to +5 then I</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.350" end="00:52:39.990" style="s2">have that whole range is undecided but</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.160" end="00:52:41.100" style="s2">later it there may not be only if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.990" end="00:52:43.500" style="s2">like right in the middle would it be</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.100" end="00:52:48.210" style="s2">undecided and that&#39;s like well maybe</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.500" end="00:52:55.980" style="s2">true or slightly true would be helpful</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.210" end="00:53:00.530" style="s2">yeah could be spaceflight</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.980" end="00:53:02.100" style="s2">do we need it and oh it&#39;s too broad so</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.530" end="00:53:03.869" style="s2">that differently</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.100" end="00:53:08.670" style="s2">should we spend public money on speck</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.869" end="00:53:13.590" style="s2">this light should be that to pry the</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.670" end="00:53:16.020" style="s2">space to be privatized I&#39;ve seen a lot</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.590" end="00:53:21.359" style="s2">of debates on this one because of SpaceX</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.020" end="00:53:24.030" style="s2">and Dragon and the booming private space</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.359" end="00:53:29.100" style="s2">business so there are lots of arguments</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.030" end="00:53:32.070" style="s2">and seen actually all that debate on on</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.100" end="00:53:33.390" style="s2">the subject would be cool yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.070" end="00:53:35.250" style="s2">would be really good one I guess there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.390" end="00:53:39.390" style="s2">several debates in that area like yes</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.250" end="00:53:41.040" style="s2">should we allow private corporations to</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.390" end="00:53:42.180" style="s2">liftoff which I guess right now in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.040" end="00:53:43.609" style="s2">United States they do have to have</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.180" end="00:53:46.200" style="s2">permission from the government I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.609" end="00:53:47.910" style="s2">internationally if you have a rocket</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.200" end="00:53:49.619" style="s2">leaving the other atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.910" end="00:53:51.240" style="s2">I think there&#39;s I think you have to get</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.619" end="00:53:57.270" style="s2">approval from some international body</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.240" end="00:53:59.790" style="s2">right now yeah what are they gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.270" end="00:54:05.040" style="s2">about it your jurisdiction now in space</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.790" end="00:54:07.350" style="s2">a really gonna shoot me down it was fun</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.040" end="00:54:11.180" style="s2">is interesting watching one of the Mars</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.350" end="00:54:14.550" style="s2">things because right now no one can own</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.180" end="00:54:15.960" style="s2">anything outside of the earth by</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.550" end="00:54:18.090" style="s2">international treaty now not all</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.960" end="00:54:20.310" style="s2">countries have signed that treaty and of</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.090" end="00:54:22.200" style="s2">course if you if you&#39;re if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.310" end="00:54:23.340" style="s2">space pirate flying out in space you</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.200" end="00:54:25.170" style="s2">don&#39;t belong to any of the countries</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.340" end="00:54:28.680" style="s2">that you know if you&#39;re your own country</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.170" end="00:54:30.300" style="s2">you didn&#39;t sign anything but but the</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.680" end="00:54:32.520" style="s2">other countries could come and wipe you</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.300" end="00:54:37.530" style="s2">off the face of what our planet you land</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.520" end="00:54:39.359" style="s2">on right but yeah yeah that so it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.530" end="00:54:40.740" style="s2">interesting to narrow down those topics</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.359" end="00:54:42.180" style="s2">I&#39;d have to see the debates to see what</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.740" end="00:54:45.090" style="s2">people are actually arguing about like</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.180" end="00:54:46.369" style="s2">are they saying that no privatized</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.090" end="00:54:51.690" style="s2">company should have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.369" end="00:54:53.520" style="s2">create a full rocket right in order to</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.690" end="00:54:56.280" style="s2">prevent companies from being able to go</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.520" end="00:54:58.260" style="s2">out in space or are they afraid of you</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.280" end="00:55:00.900" style="s2">know companies owning asteroids and</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.260" end="00:55:04.020" style="s2">stuff like that and so yeah it&#39;s best</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.900" end="00:55:07.160" style="s2">what - get down - yeah really the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.020" end="00:55:07.160" style="s2">more specific the better</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.890" end="00:55:14.119" style="s2">we got about five more minutes I</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.450" end="00:55:17.750" style="s2">appreciate everyone talking about reason</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.119" end="00:55:20.569" style="s2">score anything any closing thoughts or</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.750" end="00:55:26.450" style="s2">topics or anyone want to promote</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.569" end="00:55:28.010" style="s2">anything in Marty so you&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.450" end="00:55:30.290" style="s2">another project in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.010" end="00:55:32.510" style="s2">Adrienne&#39;s right and that&#39;s private</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.290" end="00:55:32.839" style="s2">right now you have it you&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.510" end="00:55:40.160" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.839" end="00:55:44.500" style="s2">oh it&#39;s it&#39;s a project that I had in my</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.160" end="00:55:48.849" style="s2">mind for like 25 years no longer</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.500" end="00:55:52.220" style="s2">something and it mutated over the time</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.849" end="00:55:54.460" style="s2">until recently I found that it has</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.220" end="00:56:02.140" style="s2">something to do with mind mapping and</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.460" end="00:56:05.170" style="s2">general mapping of stuff and yeah it has</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.140" end="00:56:09.680" style="s2">discussions with the mapping people</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.170" end="00:56:17.030" style="s2">again in general from game B and from</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.680" end="00:56:19.940" style="s2">the brain as well the VRA I mean which</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.030" end="00:56:24.190" style="s2">was very cool and very interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.940" end="00:56:28.309" style="s2">some other people as well and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.190" end="00:56:30.680" style="s2">fortunately for me the thing I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.309" end="00:56:36.079" style="s2">on is slightly different from anything</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.680" end="00:56:37.910" style="s2">else so I&#39;m going to try very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.079" end="00:56:44.599" style="s2">actually finish the prototype and show</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.910" end="00:56:47.869" style="s2">it to ya and then it is something that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.599" end="00:56:56.569" style="s2">am going probably I&#39;m going to use for</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.869" end="00:57:00.410" style="s2">my own making sense of my own salts any</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.569" end="00:57:05.569" style="s2">information because you said something</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.410" end="00:57:08.030" style="s2">that get like this before that you had</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.569" end="00:57:10.730" style="s2">thoughts about other projects and you</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.030" end="00:57:13.460" style="s2">found that if you only had reasons core</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.730" end="00:57:17.000" style="s2">ready it will be easier for you to do</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.460" end="00:57:19.400" style="s2">some other stuff a couple of meetings</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.000" end="00:57:24.799" style="s2">ago so there</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.400" end="00:57:30.440" style="s2">saying we with this I have lots of links</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.799" end="00:57:32.690" style="s2">and information and knowledge pointers</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.440" end="00:57:36.549" style="s2">to knowledge on specific topics that</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.690" end="00:57:42.700" style="s2">would be very good so I put in order and</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.549" end="00:57:45.890" style="s2">see connections between and make a like</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.700" end="00:57:49.480" style="s2">seeing the big picture in one place and</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.890" end="00:57:49.480" style="s2">in on one one screen</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.490" end="00:57:56.359" style="s2">yeah it sounds like fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.559" end="00:58:01.130" style="s2">technologies that maybe you should call</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.359" end="00:58:02.869" style="s2">it since tech like sense making but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.130" end="00:58:05.059" style="s2">a core and the hardest thing about that</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.869" end="00:58:07.160" style="s2">type of functionality is it cuz it does</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.059" end="00:58:11.450" style="s2">so much people can&#39;t wrap their mind</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.160" end="00:58:13.520" style="s2">around it and then people really need</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.450" end="00:58:15.740" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re out trying to market</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.520" end="00:58:17.119" style="s2">it you need a specific use case that</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.740" end="00:58:19.490" style="s2">people can wrap their mind around and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.119" end="00:58:21.880" style="s2">my problem with reason scoring you might</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.490" end="00:58:24.260" style="s2">have this with yours as well as that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.880" end="00:58:25.700" style="s2">it&#39;s hard for me to focus down on a</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.260" end="00:58:29.089" style="s2">single use case because I hate doing</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.700" end="00:58:30.440" style="s2">that but you&#39;re not even it but yeah if</p>
