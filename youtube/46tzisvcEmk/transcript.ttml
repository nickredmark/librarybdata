<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:21.919" style="s2">or a mask or something is to proliferate</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.960" end="00:06:25.600" style="s2">to worship the corona goddess</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.960" end="00:06:26.319" style="s2">the corona goddess and they mounted this</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.319" end="00:06:33.039" style="s2">on the beach you know and decorated and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.240" end="00:06:33.680" style="s2">ordained and anointed this altar with</p>

<p begin="00:06:33.680" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">and biscuits and stuff and wrappings</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:42.880" style="s2">and they worship the corona goddess and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:44.960" style="s2">i started to think about</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.880" end="00:06:46.080" style="s2">um this is where that question i think</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.960" end="00:06:48.160" style="s2">came from one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.080" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">sources of it i started to think about</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.160" end="00:06:53.440" style="s2">how we&#39;re responding</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:54.960" style="s2">to this crisis i i&#39;m known for saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.440" end="00:06:56.240" style="s2">over and over again that the way we</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.960" end="00:06:59.520" style="s2">respond to the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.240" end="00:07:00.080" style="s2">is part of the crisis that we are</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.520" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">wrapped</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.080" end="00:07:07.120" style="s2">up in cycles of responsivity um</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.840" end="00:07:10.240" style="s2">which can get very toxic because</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.120" end="00:07:12.080" style="s2">sometimes we respond even in anger</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.240" end="00:07:13.840" style="s2">you know with a sense of outrage and</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.080" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">justice seeking</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.840" end="00:07:19.919" style="s2">we might tend we tend to proliferate or</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.840" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">reinforce the very conditions that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.919" end="00:07:24.639" style="s2">trying to leave behind</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:27.199" style="s2">just like maybe an ant in a bowl of milk</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.639" end="00:07:27.919" style="s2">curdling the milk in the very attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.199" end="00:07:31.520" style="s2">crawl out</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.919" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">of the bowl of milk um so i started to</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.520" end="00:07:36.800" style="s2">think about</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">this perverse queer strange</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.800" end="00:07:43.440" style="s2">act of responding to a pandemic by</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:46.479" style="s2">treating it as a being as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.440" end="00:07:48.639" style="s2">as something ethereal as a goddess if</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.479" end="00:07:50.960" style="s2">you as something archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.639" end="00:07:53.599" style="s2">and then that led me to james hillman</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.960" end="00:07:53.599" style="s2">who is uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.080" end="00:08:00.639" style="s2">a famous archetypal psychologist i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.680" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">would hate to refer to himself he&#39;s late</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.639" end="00:08:04.479" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:04.800" style="s2">as the founder of archetypal psychology</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.479" end="00:08:08.160" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.800" end="00:08:08.639" style="s2">one of the axiomatic statements of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.160" end="00:08:12.319" style="s2">field</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.639" end="00:08:15.680" style="s2">is that the gods never left</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.319" end="00:08:16.960" style="s2">modernity is the cons is the is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.680" end="00:08:19.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t like to use the word</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.960" end="00:08:20.960" style="s2">illusion but it&#39;s the notion that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.440" end="00:08:24.160" style="s2">world is flat</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.960" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">that uh we live in a world that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.160" end="00:08:30.080" style="s2">entirely or almost entirely</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:33.200" style="s2">of our making right that such</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.080" end="00:08:36.399" style="s2">passe notions like gods and goddesses</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.200" end="00:08:39.200" style="s2">and myths should be relegated to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.399" end="00:08:40.080" style="s2">the the backwaters of history we</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:43.839" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">stuff like baldur or loki or issue</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.839" end="00:08:46.880" style="s2">or ludomari we shouldn&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:49.200" style="s2">those things</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.880" end="00:08:50.959" style="s2">because we&#39;re now sophisticated you see</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:54.080" style="s2">we have technology you see</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.959" end="00:08:54.480" style="s2">we&#39;re rational you see um but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.080" end="00:08:57.519" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.480" end="00:08:58.800" style="s2">the psyche what we call the psyche is</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.519" end="00:09:02.000" style="s2">not in the mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.800" end="00:09:05.600" style="s2">but is ecological that we are</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.000" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">um uh we are</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.600" end="00:09:12.480" style="s2">beyond uh not we i mean the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:15.200" style="s2">is beyond uh just the mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.480" end="00:09:15.519" style="s2">that is in the skull so to speak that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.200" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">larger than our frames of thinking our</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:22.720" style="s2">concepts how we spill through containers</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:24.640" style="s2">and so the archetypes that i have always</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.720" end="00:09:28.000" style="s2">been part of our imaginations</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.640" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">are still alive that in a table a god is</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.000" end="00:09:31.680" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:32.800" style="s2">you know that in a pen or in a zoom</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.680" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.800" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a god lingering nearby there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">of gods a pantheon of beings that we do</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:43.120" style="s2">not know how to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.240" end="00:09:44.080" style="s2">that is lurking like stowaways in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.120" end="00:09:45.519" style="s2">ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.080" end="00:09:47.519" style="s2">that the ordinary is what the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.519" end="00:09:50.560" style="s2">extraordinary seeks to become</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.519" end="00:09:53.519" style="s2">actually that we are already</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.560" end="00:09:54.320" style="s2">here right now in a thick middle that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.519" end="00:09:56.720" style="s2">thick with</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.320" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">different kinds of bodies that we do not</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.720" end="00:10:00.720" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:02.959" style="s2">uh have names for that idea is</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.720" end="00:10:04.399" style="s2">is strong in this question that i ask</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.959" end="00:10:06.959" style="s2">where is god now</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.399" end="00:10:08.160" style="s2">because right now we are in a fix we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.959" end="00:10:12.959" style="s2">in a mess</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.160" end="00:10:16.959" style="s2">as a people as a species and there is no</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.959" end="00:10:20.160" style="s2">saying where where things might lead</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.959" end="00:10:23.600" style="s2">and i i have a sense that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.160" end="00:10:24.320" style="s2">um this is the time for us to call to</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.600" end="00:10:26.880" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.320" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">the ideas of god that we&#39;ve been dealing</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.880" end="00:10:30.079" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:31.440" style="s2">the notion of god as some some something</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.079" end="00:10:34.560" style="s2">transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.440" end="00:10:37.519" style="s2">um seems uh antiquated to me</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.560" end="00:10:39.120" style="s2">or no longer strategically useful right</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.519" end="00:10:40.880" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.120" end="00:10:42.320" style="s2">i think we have to deal with a god that</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.880" end="00:10:44.959" style="s2">is imminent</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.320" end="00:10:46.079" style="s2">and a god that is here hiding in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.959" end="00:10:48.640" style="s2">ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.079" end="00:10:50.800" style="s2">enchanting the ordinary inviting us to</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.640" end="00:10:53.440" style="s2">do some other kind of work</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.800" end="00:10:54.079" style="s2">that reshapes ourselves what am i trying</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.440" end="00:10:57.680" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.079" end="00:11:00.320" style="s2">um i framed this uh this conversation as</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.680" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">an exploration of theo politics now that</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.320" end="00:11:04.399" style="s2">might seem</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.360" end="00:11:06.320" style="s2">um crazy to some people uh theology is</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.399" end="00:11:08.160" style="s2">something apart from politics politics</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.320" end="00:11:09.920" style="s2">is down to earth theology is</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.160" end="00:11:12.320" style="s2">a consideration of beings that have</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.920" end="00:11:14.320" style="s2">beards and look like gandalf or</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.320" end="00:11:14.959" style="s2">something that is outside of our bubbles</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.320" end="00:11:18.560" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.959" end="00:11:20.560" style="s2">you know interaction um and yet</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.560" end="00:11:21.920" style="s2">when i think of a theopolitics and i</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.560" end="00:11:24.800" style="s2">don&#39;t know that i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.920" end="00:11:26.640" style="s2">that word used before i just matched</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.800" end="00:11:30.399" style="s2">together like i said i was high</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.640" end="00:11:31.920" style="s2">um a theopolitics is a consideration of</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.399" end="00:11:35.519" style="s2">how we&#39;ve been shaped</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.920" end="00:11:37.519" style="s2">by an image of god how archetypes are</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:38.959" style="s2">lingering in the ways we respond to</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.519" end="00:11:42.160" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.959" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">and how we are part of fields of</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.160" end="00:11:45.680" style="s2">action and engagement now we might think</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:48.480" style="s2">of ourselves as</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.680" end="00:11:49.200" style="s2">free you know liberal humanism is this</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.480" end="00:11:52.079" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.200" end="00:11:53.040" style="s2">that we are free that we make choices</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.079" end="00:11:55.120" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.040" end="00:11:57.519" style="s2">uh that we decide of course we should</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.120" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">take all that we want is political will</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.519" end="00:12:02.320" style="s2">and resources</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.360" end="00:12:04.720" style="s2">but now we are now learning and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.320" end="00:12:06.880" style="s2">reckoning with the idea with the notion</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.720" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">the invitation that we are not free at</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.880" end="00:12:10.639" style="s2">all we are indebted</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.240" end="00:12:12.880" style="s2">to the world a world that is not made of</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.639" end="00:12:15.200" style="s2">things but made of relationships</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.880" end="00:12:17.360" style="s2">that is in a sense we&#39;re still attached</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.200" end="00:12:18.880" style="s2">to a god of the plantation</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.360" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">and here i&#39;m bringing in the trope of</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.880" end="00:12:22.839" style="s2">slavery we&#39;re still attached to a god</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">that proliferates certain kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:27.760" style="s2">certain kinds of politics certain kinds</p>

<p begin="00:14:37.279" end="00:14:40.480" style="s2">changing they&#39;re programs they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.720" end="00:14:43.360" style="s2">just the results of programs</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.480" end="00:14:44.079" style="s2">your programs in themselves i feel that</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.360" end="00:14:46.639" style="s2">the image</p>

<p begin="00:14:51.360" end="00:14:53.920" style="s2">outside of the conversation about</p>

<p begin="00:15:01.600" end="00:15:05.279" style="s2">but i feel maybe that&#39;s what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.160" end="00:15:08.079" style="s2">be doing today</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.279" end="00:15:09.040" style="s2">moving outside of the intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.079" end="00:15:11.839" style="s2">finding</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.040" end="00:15:12.880" style="s2">the spaces of not knowing dwelling in</p>

<p begin="00:15:12.880" end="00:15:17.199" style="s2">of wounds and cracks in our bodies and</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.760" end="00:15:19.199" style="s2">noticing that that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.199" end="00:15:20.639" style="s2">we need to change that&#39;s where we need</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.199" end="00:15:23.680" style="s2">to shape shift</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.639" end="00:15:25.600" style="s2">it&#39;s the trickster&#39;s call that beckons</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.680" end="00:15:27.839" style="s2">that we need to heed right now the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.600" end="00:15:30.160" style="s2">trickster invites us to move outside of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.839" end="00:15:31.120" style="s2">the plantation that proliferates the</p>

<p begin="00:15:31.120" end="00:15:35.759" style="s2">the trickster invites us to fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.360" end="00:15:39.120" style="s2">so that we can be made in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.759" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">um i&#39;m exploring this and i i want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.120" end="00:15:43.920" style="s2">stop here i&#39;m exploring this in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:47.199" style="s2">the idea of making sanctuary</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.920" end="00:15:49.519" style="s2">in the in the in the terms of uh um</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.199" end="00:15:50.639" style="s2">losing our flesh and becoming different</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.519" end="00:15:53.600" style="s2">kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.639" end="00:15:56.240" style="s2">um composed flesh if you will but let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:16:16.399" end="00:16:22.000" style="s2">that is not the mindset that uh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.199" end="00:16:26.079" style="s2">encouraging right now um</p>

<p begin="00:16:29.040" end="00:16:32.320" style="s2">psycho technologies like whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.800" end="00:16:34.639" style="s2">meditation or</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">uh writing practices or breath work</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.639" end="00:16:37.920" style="s2">something that kind of transforms</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:39.360" style="s2">our own individual perception of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.920" end="00:16:42.120" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.360" end="00:16:45.600" style="s2">and ourselves what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.120" end="00:16:50.160" style="s2">psychotechnologies that would help us</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.600" end="00:16:54.079" style="s2">compost god hmm</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.160" end="00:16:57.839" style="s2">um i would i would offer this</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.079" end="00:17:02.880" style="s2">term i call it feel faji</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.839" end="00:17:06.640" style="s2">and that literally means eating god um</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.880" end="00:17:09.280" style="s2">from the term am triple fragic which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.640" end="00:17:10.319" style="s2">somewhat similar to cannibalism but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.280" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">not quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.319" end="00:17:16.839" style="s2">cannibalism um i think there is</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">there is room for eating god speaking</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.839" end="00:17:23.520" style="s2">mystically</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.839" end="00:17:26.319" style="s2">for us to take the flesh eat and become</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.520" end="00:17:29.440" style="s2">something really different i wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.319" end="00:17:31.240" style="s2">reduce it to um</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.440" end="00:17:32.960" style="s2">so what i hear in your question about</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.240" end="00:17:36.160" style="s2">psychotechnologies</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.960" end="00:17:39.200" style="s2">is i don&#39;t want people to hear from that</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.160" end="00:17:41.520" style="s2">psychedelia or or</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.200" end="00:17:43.360" style="s2">certain practices that invite us to go</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.520" end="00:17:45.520" style="s2">inward</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.360" end="00:17:47.039" style="s2">i would i would think of it as an</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.520" end="00:17:50.000" style="s2">ecological principle</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.039" end="00:17:51.919" style="s2">as an ecological invitation as something</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.000" end="00:17:54.400" style="s2">irreducibly communitarian</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.919" end="00:17:56.640" style="s2">or minoritarian as a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.400" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">politics that might be weird</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.640" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">that is not about composing new subjects</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:05.200" style="s2">that attend to power</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:07.760" style="s2">that attend to the status quo</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.200" end="00:18:09.200" style="s2">but is about inviting an entirely</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.760" end="00:18:12.400" style="s2">different framework of</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.200" end="00:18:17.039" style="s2">acting and engaging with the planet um</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.400" end="00:18:20.160" style="s2">that basically um that basically strips</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.039" end="00:18:23.360" style="s2">apart the very foundations of</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.160" end="00:18:25.440" style="s2">man or the human um and let me take that</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.360" end="00:18:27.520" style="s2">even further</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.440" end="00:18:30.000" style="s2">i think the human when we talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.520" end="00:18:30.240" style="s2">human we imagine the bipedal things that</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.000" end="00:18:33.919" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.240" end="00:18:35.840" style="s2">are you know heads hands and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.919" end="00:18:37.919" style="s2">but but i feel that the human is more</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.840" end="00:18:39.120" style="s2">than that the human is an assemblage of</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.919" end="00:18:43.280" style="s2">bodies</p>

<p begin="00:20:58.480" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">you know that that&#39;s where the spark is</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.039" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">and i feel most of us might be sensing</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:07.280" style="s2">that even right now</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.840" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">um we might be feeling</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.280" end="00:21:14.159" style="s2">awkward like um the questions we know</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:16.960" style="s2">how to ask are no longer possible</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.159" end="00:21:18.320" style="s2">or the ways we have organized our lives</p>

<p begin="00:21:18.320" end="00:21:21.840" style="s2">for instance in india here uh newspapers</p>

<p begin="00:21:31.600" end="00:21:34.640" style="s2">if we can&#39;t send them to school what is</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.280" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">education then</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.640" end="00:21:38.240" style="s2">if it&#39;s going to be held on you know in</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.880" end="00:21:40.000" style="s2">zoom sessions</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.240" end="00:21:41.600" style="s2">my wife and i have been on schooling our</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:43.760" style="s2">children since they were born</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.600" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">we&#39;ve never sent them to school instead</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.760" end="00:21:47.840" style="s2">we see them as part of the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.840" end="00:21:50.720" style="s2">as elders my wife has a name for her she</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.840" end="00:21:52.799" style="s2">calls it transparenting</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.720" end="00:21:54.480" style="s2">where we learn with our kids we treat</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.799" end="00:21:56.640" style="s2">them as philosophers even though they</p>

<p begin="00:21:56.640" end="00:22:01.120" style="s2">and then we embark on research journeys</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.120" end="00:22:03.120" style="s2">to learn through their eyes</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.120" end="00:22:04.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a psychotechnology that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:22:09.679" end="00:22:13.520" style="s2">that might help us find our way to</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.159" end="00:22:16.559" style="s2">potentially wiser</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.520" end="00:22:19.039" style="s2">economies potentially wiser worlds</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.559" end="00:22:20.880" style="s2">but i want to um centralize here at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.039" end="00:22:23.280" style="s2">concept of the human</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.880" end="00:22:24.480" style="s2">what gets in our way is to human what</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.280" end="00:22:27.039" style="s2">gets in our way is this</p>

<p begin="00:22:36.080" end="00:22:39.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the trouble right</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.760" end="00:22:43.039" style="s2">and uh you know a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.600" end="00:22:44.960" style="s2">metamodern integral spaces</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.039" end="00:22:46.799" style="s2">they talk about yes ending like you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:47.600" style="s2">you yes end the previous paradigm or</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.799" end="00:22:51.039" style="s2">take the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.600" end="00:22:52.880" style="s2">the best out of it um like</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.039" end="00:22:55.039" style="s2">before we become like complete fugitives</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.880" end="00:22:58.320" style="s2">is there anything we could learn or gain</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.039" end="00:22:58.320" style="s2">from the old gods</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.039" end="00:23:04.559" style="s2">i like that so we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.400" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">absolutely stuff right and say</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.559" end="00:23:11.120" style="s2">um um</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:12.880" style="s2">that uh and let me put it this way that</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.120" end="00:23:15.200" style="s2">i&#39;ve been saying for instance that even</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.880" end="00:23:18.240" style="s2">whiteness is not evil</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.200" end="00:23:19.520" style="s2">you know many writers will speak about</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.240" end="00:23:22.559" style="s2">getting rid</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.520" end="00:23:25.280" style="s2">of whiteness um and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.559" end="00:23:25.600" style="s2">dismantling it well i want to dismantle</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.280" end="00:23:27.679" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.600" end="00:23:30.720" style="s2">i want a situation where many kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:23:31.360" end="00:23:34.880" style="s2">but at the same time the moment i</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.159" end="00:23:38.080" style="s2">displace</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.880" end="00:23:40.159" style="s2">or treat whiteness as an evil then i let</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.080" end="00:23:42.159" style="s2">it slip away from analysis</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.159" end="00:23:44.000" style="s2">then i let it become something entirely</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.159" end="00:23:44.720" style="s2">different then it&#39;s no longer of this</p>

<p begin="00:23:51.360" end="00:23:54.640" style="s2">or none that&#39;s we&#39;re not abandoning them</p>

<p begin="00:24:38.799" end="00:24:41.919" style="s2">um the old gods i don&#39;t know for now</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.520" end="00:24:44.559" style="s2">brother</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.919" end="00:24:45.440" style="s2">i all i can say is maybe we can learn</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.559" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">lessons</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.440" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s just holding that space of</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:51.760" style="s2">learning from the old gods</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:54.640" style="s2">is just as vital to me as knowing the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.760" end="00:24:57.919" style="s2">questions themselves</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.640" end="00:25:00.799" style="s2">beautiful yeah so let&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.919" end="00:25:02.240" style="s2">turn to some questions oliver king you</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.799" end="00:25:04.559" style="s2">had a question if you cannot mute</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.240" end="00:25:04.559" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.960" end="00:25:11.200" style="s2">hey peter hey bio um so my question</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.400" end="00:25:11.760" style="s2">is regarding you know to extend some of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.200" end="00:25:13.840" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.760" end="00:25:16.000" style="s2">ideas that have been brought up is like</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.840" end="00:25:18.720" style="s2">theophage right eating gods</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.000" end="00:25:20.640" style="s2">or dining on the armor and going to war</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.720" end="00:25:24.720" style="s2">with these old gods</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.640" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">and these are perhaps extensions</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.720" end="00:25:31.679" style="s2">like a marvel cinematic uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:36.080" style="s2">thing right sorry no no it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.679" end="00:25:39.120" style="s2">um so perhaps necessarily these feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.080" end="00:25:42.320" style="s2">like artifacts of anthropoceneic</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.120" end="00:25:44.400" style="s2">ways of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.320" end="00:25:46.400" style="s2">we keep relating ourselves in different</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.400" end="00:25:49.279" style="s2">ways of these gods both old</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.400" end="00:25:50.080" style="s2">and potentially new but there are also</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.279" end="00:25:53.200" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.080" end="00:25:54.640" style="s2">are not yet ready to leave the altars</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.200" end="00:25:55.520" style="s2">upon which they&#39;ve already become</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.640" end="00:25:58.559" style="s2">frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.520" end="00:26:02.400" style="s2">um god or new so</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.559" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">do you have any idea or suggestion</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.400" end="00:26:08.480" style="s2">or narrative about how</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:10.480" style="s2">maybe not we should but how we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.480" end="00:26:13.679" style="s2">relate to these people</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.480" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">in healthy and constructive ways how we</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.679" end="00:26:17.679" style="s2">can persuade people</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">no just relate to them in healthy income</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.679" end="00:26:25.120" style="s2">oh relate to them</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.720" end="00:26:28.240" style="s2">okay okay i didn&#39;t hear them</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.120" end="00:26:30.640" style="s2">well i&#39;m not in the uh in the business</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.240" end="00:26:31.360" style="s2">of um and and i know this know what you</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.640" end="00:26:33.679" style="s2">asked</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.360" end="00:26:35.120" style="s2">um i&#39;m not in the business of</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.679" end="00:26:37.120" style="s2">evangelizing</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">like the world is too complex too</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.120" end="00:26:40.480" style="s2">promiscuous to be reduced to any one way</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:44.559" style="s2">of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.480" end="00:26:47.840" style="s2">um so so i i&#39;m very very</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.559" end="00:26:49.600" style="s2">hesitant to to impose one way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.840" end="00:26:52.720" style="s2">thinking about things</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.600" end="00:26:55.360" style="s2">i only invite here and ethology</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.720" end="00:26:58.000" style="s2">and ethics not morality here morality is</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.360" end="00:27:01.200" style="s2">transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.000" end="00:27:04.480" style="s2">speaking about ethics as imminent i am</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.200" end="00:27:08.320" style="s2">alive to different ways of behaving</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.480" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">um with the world around us um</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.320" end="00:27:13.360" style="s2">and it will not appeal to people in</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:15.039" style="s2">it will not land with everyone</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.360" end="00:27:18.159" style="s2">everywhere the same way</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.039" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">right and i&#39;m fine with that if if</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.159" end="00:27:21.760" style="s2">both of us oliver brother if if we could</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:24.799" style="s2">find</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.760" end="00:27:27.279" style="s2">words to say sentences to construct that</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.799" end="00:27:27.679" style="s2">will immediately change views around the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.279" end="00:27:30.399" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.679" end="00:27:31.840" style="s2">i would i would not say those words</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.399" end="00:27:32.720" style="s2">because i would not want to live in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.840" end="00:27:35.520" style="s2">universe</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.720" end="00:27:37.120" style="s2">where everyone could be persuaded in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.520" end="00:27:39.279" style="s2">same way i think truth</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.120" end="00:27:42.240" style="s2">is reductionistic i think truth gets in</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.279" end="00:27:45.840" style="s2">the way of the expansion</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.240" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">of the amazing complexity that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.840" end="00:27:49.039" style="s2">life so that to speak about it is to</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:52.159" style="s2">lose</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.039" end="00:27:53.600" style="s2">something is to miss a spot somewhere um</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.159" end="00:27:54.080" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know if i&#39;m just riffing</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.600" end="00:27:57.120" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.080" end="00:27:58.799" style="s2">yeah like i said um there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.120" end="00:28:02.399" style="s2">things there are foot around me</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.799" end="00:28:03.279" style="s2">but i want to say that um the way i</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:07.840" style="s2">relate to this</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.279" end="00:28:11.440" style="s2">is to invite is to invite a different</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.840" end="00:28:12.720" style="s2">um way of relating with the world a</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.440" end="00:28:14.799" style="s2">different kind of inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.720" end="00:28:16.720" style="s2">that might bring a collective together</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.799" end="00:28:18.000" style="s2">to ask different kinds of questions to</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.720" end="00:28:20.480" style="s2">compile</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.000" end="00:28:22.480" style="s2">um different kinds of underground</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.480" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">spiritual technologies</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.480" end="00:28:27.440" style="s2">if you will um which we might</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.720" end="00:28:29.440" style="s2">constellate in order to lose our way</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.440" end="00:28:30.960" style="s2">again i don&#39;t want to i&#39;m not speaking</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.440" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">poetically here when i speak about</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.960" end="00:28:34.880" style="s2">losing one&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:35.840" style="s2">i&#39;ve actually sat with healers and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.880" end="00:28:38.240" style="s2">shamans</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.840" end="00:28:40.480" style="s2">that will basically say the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.240" end="00:28:42.559" style="s2">that what we need to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.480" end="00:28:44.480" style="s2">stray out of the ecology that</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.559" end="00:28:46.559" style="s2">proliferates the familiar</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.480" end="00:28:47.840" style="s2">um we need to stray out of there and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.559" end="00:28:50.320" style="s2">only way to do this</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.840" end="00:28:52.240" style="s2">is not to resist and i&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.320" end="00:28:54.320" style="s2">put down resistance we need resistance</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.240" end="00:28:55.279" style="s2">we need critique-based feminisms we need</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.320" end="00:28:58.320" style="s2">all of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.279" end="00:29:01.039" style="s2">but critique can only take us so far</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.320" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">we need other places of power otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.039" end="00:29:04.480" style="s2">and not everyone will find a way there</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:06.399" style="s2">it&#39;s not the next brother</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.480" end="00:29:08.240" style="s2">this is not the next beautiful world</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.399" end="00:29:09.200" style="s2">this is not a manifesto this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.240" end="00:29:11.360" style="s2">utopian</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.200" end="00:29:12.799" style="s2">this is not some kind of aquarian age</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.360" end="00:29:16.240" style="s2">stuff i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.799" end="00:29:18.559" style="s2">i&#39;m just speaking about the modest</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.240" end="00:29:20.159" style="s2">openings the fugitive cracks in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.559" end="00:29:22.720" style="s2">bubble of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.159" end="00:29:25.120" style="s2">that might open up and where we might</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.720" end="00:29:27.919" style="s2">find a way of being alive with the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.120" end="00:29:28.320" style="s2">you know this is really historical stuff</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.919" end="00:29:30.080" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.320" end="00:29:32.159" style="s2">i do you know anything about brazil and</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.080" end="00:29:34.559" style="s2">the killembollas and the favelas</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.159" end="00:29:35.840" style="s2">uh learn about that history for instance</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.559" end="00:29:38.559" style="s2">how they</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.840" end="00:29:39.440" style="s2">how they snuck out you know and built</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.559" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">villages</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.440" end="00:29:43.360" style="s2">had different ways of thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:46.240" style="s2">world had different ways of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.360" end="00:29:48.240" style="s2">about children and schools and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.240" end="00:29:50.240" style="s2">you know i feel that is what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.240" end="00:29:52.320" style="s2">invited to now because i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.240" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">tired of the [ __ ] stuff you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.320" end="00:29:55.360" style="s2">that says oh all we need to do is just</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:29:57.200" style="s2">build a manifesto</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.360" end="00:30:00.240" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m a citizen of the so-called</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.200" end="00:30:02.720" style="s2">global south and the passive recipient</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.240" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">of the good intentions of the west you</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.720" end="00:30:05.120" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:06.880" style="s2">many people come and say all we need to</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.120" end="00:30:07.279" style="s2">do is just do this we have the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.880" end="00:30:10.320" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.279" end="00:30:13.600" style="s2">we just need you guys to work it out</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.320" end="00:30:15.279" style="s2">and it we end up repeating it</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.600" end="00:30:17.279" style="s2">this reinforcing the same things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.279" end="00:30:18.799" style="s2">trying to leave behind so what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.279" end="00:30:20.880" style="s2">when you&#39;re stuck in a cycle of</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.799" end="00:30:24.880" style="s2">repeatability</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.880" end="00:30:27.200" style="s2">my suggestion is we need to fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.880" end="00:30:28.880" style="s2">we can we can find new ways of grieving</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.200" end="00:30:29.840" style="s2">together and i&#39;m not just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.880" end="00:30:32.960" style="s2">crying together</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.840" end="00:30:33.679" style="s2">we can treat grief as activism we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.960" end="00:30:35.200" style="s2">instead of</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.679" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">talking about climate justice all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.200" end="00:30:40.080" style="s2">time what if you know we fall off the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:42.640" style="s2">highway of climate justice and we find</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.080" end="00:30:44.080" style="s2">other concepts like climate saudaji so</p>

<p begin="00:32:06.240" end="00:32:11.840" style="s2">composting i was working at a farm the</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.360" end="00:32:14.080" style="s2">other day and we built a huge compost it</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.840" end="00:32:15.360" style="s2">actually looked like a burial mound when</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.080" end="00:32:18.399" style="s2">it was done</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.360" end="00:32:22.880" style="s2">and just how um</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.399" end="00:32:25.919" style="s2">nothing gets wasted in that process</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.880" end="00:32:29.440" style="s2">but what i was wondering in</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.919" end="00:32:32.080" style="s2">as we sort of consider all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.440" end="00:32:33.039" style="s2">all that we&#39;ve been uh living with that</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.080" end="00:32:36.880" style="s2">maybe now</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.039" end="00:32:39.519" style="s2">we want to discard what</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.880" end="00:32:40.159" style="s2">what belongs on the compost heap what</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.519" end="00:32:42.320" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.159" end="00:32:44.000" style="s2">we just want to burn and put in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.320" end="00:32:46.080" style="s2">garbage</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.000" end="00:32:47.440" style="s2">and what goes on the altar and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.080" end="00:32:49.840" style="s2">almost like is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.440" end="00:32:50.960" style="s2">an experiment we do like how do i</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.840" end="00:32:55.679" style="s2">approach if i</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.960" end="00:32:58.880" style="s2">if i put that politician that just</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.679" end="00:33:00.159" style="s2">i find so much frustration and concern</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.880" end="00:33:01.679" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.159" end="00:33:04.240" style="s2">you know like what if i put them on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:08.480" style="s2">altar instead of right to the refuse</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.240" end="00:33:12.480" style="s2">uh so i just say our approach</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.480" end="00:33:16.000" style="s2">of the problems we seem to be facing</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.480" end="00:33:18.159" style="s2">um how to how to kind of know</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.000" end="00:33:21.279" style="s2">or is it all just we&#39;re in a big</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.159" end="00:33:24.960" style="s2">experiment and we&#39;re trying new things</p>

<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:08.560" style="s2">and it sounds to me like in much the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.160" end="00:41:10.400" style="s2">same way you were describing</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.560" end="00:41:11.920" style="s2">a set of models and mechanisms and</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.400" end="00:41:14.400" style="s2">machines and</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.920" end="00:41:15.200" style="s2">ontological moves that are that are so</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.400" end="00:41:18.000" style="s2">rich and</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.200" end="00:41:19.920" style="s2">new that together they could combine to</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.000" end="00:41:20.960" style="s2">form this kind of a compass for seeking</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.920" end="00:41:23.760" style="s2">out fugitivity</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.960" end="00:41:24.960" style="s2">in in modernity and exploring and</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.760" end="00:41:28.400" style="s2">expanding those cracks</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.960" end="00:41:30.560" style="s2">for us to achieve a breakout to</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.400" end="00:41:32.319" style="s2">reach an outside it&#39;s almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.560" end="00:41:34.000" style="s2">gracious move</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.319" end="00:41:36.480" style="s2">but not in the right accelerations to it</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.000" end="00:41:38.400" style="s2">so my but my question is</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.480" end="00:41:39.760" style="s2">it also sounds like you were asking us</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.400" end="00:41:45.440" style="s2">to revere</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.760" end="00:41:48.560" style="s2">defeatism to what revered defeatism</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.440" end="00:41:52.079" style="s2">being defeated yeah yeah being defeated</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.560" end="00:41:54.240" style="s2">yeah and um i worry that that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.079" end="00:41:55.520" style="s2">that that ask is dead in the water for</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.240" end="00:41:57.280" style="s2">anybody who has skin in the game of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.520" end="00:41:59.920" style="s2">crew</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.280" end="00:42:00.640" style="s2">and and so i&#39;m also worried that your</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.920" end="00:42:03.200" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.640" end="00:42:04.240" style="s2">your lens will die on on the hill of</p>

<p begin="00:42:08.319" end="00:42:15.200" style="s2">moves have done yeah so in what way</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.599" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">can this be deployed and what way can we</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.200" end="00:42:20.560" style="s2">do the ontological bridge work to</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:24.240" style="s2">generate allies faster than we alienate</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.560" end="00:42:26.400" style="s2">the future right right thank you brother</p>

<p begin="00:43:42.160" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">and i think we&#39;re all in very very very</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.000" end="00:43:51.200" style="s2">interesting times right</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.599" end="00:43:52.400" style="s2">the second one is may you be seen by the</p>

<p begin="00:43:55.280" end="00:43:58.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem like a curse right it seems</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.119" end="00:44:00.880" style="s2">like a blessing</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.160" end="00:44:01.920" style="s2">to be noticed by someone in power seems</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.880" end="00:44:03.520" style="s2">like a blessing</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.920" end="00:44:05.119" style="s2">why would they think of that as a curse</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.520" end="00:44:08.160" style="s2">but hold on hold on</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.119" end="00:44:09.119" style="s2">the third one is may you be given the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.160" end="00:44:12.000" style="s2">position</p>

<p begin="00:44:19.920" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">which seems like uh a shocking thing to</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.720" end="00:44:27.119" style="s2">say to an activist of course that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:28.000" style="s2">we want we want to pull down the power</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.119" end="00:44:30.640" style="s2">we want to over</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.000" end="00:44:31.359" style="s2">uh run through the bastille and chase</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.640" end="00:44:33.280" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.359" end="00:44:34.720" style="s2">the royals and all of that and behead</p>

<p begin="00:44:34.720" end="00:44:39.119" style="s2">want to do all of that and install a</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.800" end="00:44:42.079" style="s2">more just system</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.119" end="00:44:43.359" style="s2">this curse is a pause is an invitation</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.079" end="00:44:46.720" style="s2">to hesitate</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.359" end="00:44:50.079" style="s2">about um moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.720" end="00:44:50.960" style="s2">and and and so confidently that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.079" end="00:44:54.079" style="s2">forget</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.960" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">that um sometimes we activate</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.079" end="00:44:58.000" style="s2">in opposition we activate the very</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.960" end="00:45:00.480" style="s2">premises</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.000" end="00:45:01.599" style="s2">that gave birth to our incarceration let</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.480" end="00:45:05.200" style="s2">me put it differently</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.599" end="00:45:08.720" style="s2">that if you if you try to defeat</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.200" end="00:45:10.960" style="s2">or gain a victory over your oppressors</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.720" end="00:45:12.400" style="s2">within the epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.960" end="00:45:14.480" style="s2">that is the condition for your</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.400" end="00:45:18.160" style="s2">incarceration or your oppression</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.480" end="00:45:18.800" style="s2">you risk reinforcing your oppression you</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.160" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">risk</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.800" end="00:45:22.400" style="s2">reinforcing the dynamics of your</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:25.280" style="s2">imprisonment</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.400" end="00:45:26.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like what we know in africa we</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.280" end="00:45:29.359" style="s2">chased away the british</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.800" end="00:45:30.720" style="s2">we chased away uh the belgians we chased</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.359" end="00:45:34.000" style="s2">away the french</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.720" end="00:45:36.400" style="s2">we won but in a sense we lost</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.000" end="00:45:37.760" style="s2">because immediately they they left we</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:39.440" style="s2">pulled up our flags</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.760" end="00:45:40.960" style="s2">and we started to play the game of</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.440" end="00:45:43.680" style="s2">nation statism</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.960" end="00:45:44.880" style="s2">we were already in the game and so even</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.680" end="00:45:46.960" style="s2">though we won</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.880" end="00:45:48.560" style="s2">we lost and so we tell ourselves that</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.960" end="00:45:52.480" style="s2">even here in india</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.560" end="00:45:53.920" style="s2">that if you win at your game you&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.480" end="00:45:55.599" style="s2">so this is the sense of the fugitive</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.920" end="00:45:58.800" style="s2">that i want you to understand</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.599" end="00:46:00.319" style="s2">defeat here is framed in pathological</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.800" end="00:46:03.680" style="s2">terms in modernity</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.319" end="00:46:05.520" style="s2">just like psychopathology um grieving is</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.680" end="00:46:07.040" style="s2">bad i&#39;m trained as a psychologist so i</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.520" end="00:46:09.359" style="s2">know how to put people together</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.040" end="00:46:11.040" style="s2">that&#39;s why we&#39;re called shrinks put them</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.359" end="00:46:14.000" style="s2">back together put them back into the rat</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.040" end="00:46:17.200" style="s2">race and let them be productive citizens</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:18.000" style="s2">but there are spaces of power that might</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.200" end="00:46:21.280" style="s2">be given</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.000" end="00:46:25.040" style="s2">very fugitive mysterious names such as</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.280" end="00:46:27.440" style="s2">defeat such as failure such as</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.040" end="00:46:28.400" style="s2">poverty by the by the way guys i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.440" end="00:46:31.520" style="s2">know if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.400" end="00:46:35.280" style="s2">seen this news article that says um</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.520" end="00:46:37.440" style="s2">the reason why it is a is hypothetical</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.280" end="00:46:39.440" style="s2">that maybe the reason why people in</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.440" end="00:46:41.520" style="s2">africa did not catch the virus as</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.440" end="00:46:44.560" style="s2">much as people everywhere else is</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.520" end="00:46:47.119" style="s2">because africa is poor</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.560" end="00:46:48.319" style="s2">right that this is a new angle to</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.119" end="00:46:51.599" style="s2">poverty</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.319" end="00:46:53.599" style="s2">that vexes the notion of poverty as an</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.599" end="00:46:55.440" style="s2">absolute evil and i&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.599" end="00:46:57.680" style="s2">romanticize poverty here</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.440" end="00:47:00.240" style="s2">but i&#39;m trying to say that there is an</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.680" end="00:47:02.560" style="s2">invitation that may be framed as defeat</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.240" end="00:47:04.640" style="s2">uh that may be framed as failure but</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.560" end="00:47:06.240" style="s2">it&#39;s an invitation to another place of</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.640" end="00:47:10.000" style="s2">power altogether</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.240" end="00:47:13.319" style="s2">okay um the french philosopher de luz</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.000" end="00:47:16.079" style="s2">spoke about a politics of um</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.319" end="00:47:17.040" style="s2">imperceptibility and a politics of</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.079" end="00:47:19.599" style="s2">recognition</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.040" end="00:47:20.800" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think he meant it as two</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.599" end="00:47:24.319" style="s2">binary</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.800" end="00:47:25.680" style="s2">um confrontational dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.319" end="00:47:27.359" style="s2">i think there are places where they</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.680" end="00:47:28.240" style="s2">intersect and they&#39;re places where they</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.359" end="00:47:30.880" style="s2">break</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.240" end="00:47:32.640" style="s2">from each other apologies of recognition</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.880" end="00:47:34.720" style="s2">is about getting our voice out there</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.640" end="00:47:36.559" style="s2">speaking truth to power</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.720" end="00:47:38.960" style="s2">but there is a time when we can no</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.559" end="00:47:40.720" style="s2">longer speak truth to power</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.960" end="00:47:42.480" style="s2">right we can know we have to stop</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.720" end="00:47:44.400" style="s2">speaking truth to power</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.480" end="00:47:45.839" style="s2">um fred moulton i don&#39;t know if you guys</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.400" end="00:47:47.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if he&#39;s been on this show</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.839" end="00:47:48.880" style="s2">fred morton he wrote the book the under</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.599" end="00:47:51.760" style="s2">commons</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.880" end="00:47:52.079" style="s2">he speaks he says categorically one does</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.760" end="00:47:54.160" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.079" end="00:47:55.520" style="s2">speak truth to power and i&#39;ve wondered</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.160" end="00:47:58.240" style="s2">about that statement</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.520" end="00:47:59.599" style="s2">because in speaking truth to power we</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.240" end="00:48:02.079" style="s2">often will reinforce</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.599" end="00:48:03.200" style="s2">power we often will keep power</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.079" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.200" end="00:48:08.880" style="s2">so what do we do we fall away</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:10.640" style="s2">and i&#39;m not saying we do it wholesale</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.880" end="00:48:11.599" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying we replace the politics</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.640" end="00:48:14.559" style="s2">of recognition</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.599" end="00:48:16.640" style="s2">but at least we can supplement that um</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.559" end="00:48:18.960" style="s2">instead of going to the shopping malls</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.640" end="00:48:20.559" style="s2">there are communities in brazil that</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.960" end="00:48:23.599" style="s2">have learned to use waste</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.559" end="00:48:25.440" style="s2">as a form of wealth in the favelas so</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.599" end="00:48:26.319" style="s2">they&#39;re not looking for handouts from</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.440" end="00:48:29.200" style="s2">the government</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.319" end="00:48:30.640" style="s2">if created an economy that is based on</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.200" end="00:48:32.319" style="s2">the things that people throw away you</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.640" end="00:48:34.240" style="s2">might think that&#39;s so distasteful</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.319" end="00:48:35.920" style="s2">but i&#39;ve been there and i&#39;ve seen what</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.240" end="00:48:38.160" style="s2">people are constructing</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:39.280" style="s2">new technologies new experiments with</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.160" end="00:48:42.800" style="s2">the normal</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.280" end="00:48:45.920" style="s2">um so this is what i mean by defeat</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.800" end="00:48:50.480" style="s2">that we need to unlearn our mastery</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.920" end="00:48:52.720" style="s2">our sense of society and sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.480" end="00:48:54.240" style="s2">that gets in our heads so much that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.720" end="00:48:56.480" style="s2">mess up everything</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.240" end="00:48:57.680" style="s2">and finally brother just to end this</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.480" end="00:49:00.880" style="s2">this part of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.680" end="00:49:04.079" style="s2">response trump called my country</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.880" end="00:49:05.839" style="s2">a [ __ ] country and</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.079" end="00:49:07.280" style="s2">especially in nigeria nigeria is the</p>

<p begin="00:49:12.400" end="00:49:14.720" style="s2">called it a [ __ ] that [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.839" end="00:49:17.599" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.720" end="00:49:18.640" style="s2">and most nigerians i know where you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.599" end="00:49:21.119" style="s2">we&#39;re furious</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.640" end="00:49:21.839" style="s2">how dare you do that we have skyscrapers</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.119" end="00:49:24.559" style="s2">we have</p>

<p begin="00:49:26.960" end="00:49:30.400" style="s2">i think they missed the point</p>

<p begin="00:51:15.040" end="00:51:19.119" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.599" end="00:51:23.119" style="s2">kind of strikes a chord in my heart that</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.119" end="00:51:25.280" style="s2">feels so true and so resonant</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.119" end="00:51:26.240" style="s2">especially in this journey that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.280" end="00:51:29.119" style="s2">really been on</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.240" end="00:51:30.480" style="s2">in terms of unlearning a lot of the maps</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.119" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">that i&#39;ve been giving</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.480" end="00:51:34.800" style="s2">and trying to explore this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:37.680" style="s2">territory of the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.800" end="00:51:38.640" style="s2">i think something that i am curious</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.680" end="00:51:42.000" style="s2">about though is</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.640" end="00:51:45.119" style="s2">as i&#39;m as i&#39;m navigating</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.000" end="00:51:47.680" style="s2">this very very dark mysterious i</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.119" end="00:51:49.280" style="s2">i see it as a forest and i&#39;m feeling it</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.680" end="00:51:51.200" style="s2">through my hands and through my feet and</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.280" end="00:51:53.599" style="s2">i feel like i&#39;m using my intuition to</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.200" end="00:51:57.200" style="s2">also know it</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.599" end="00:52:00.400" style="s2">a fear that i hold is that i</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.200" end="00:52:04.640" style="s2">will get lost in places that are</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.400" end="00:52:07.520" style="s2">truly monstrous that are truly um</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.640" end="00:52:08.160" style="s2">i think truly exploitative and truly um</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.520" end="00:52:11.200" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.160" end="00:52:12.240" style="s2">will impact me in ways that um i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.200" end="00:52:15.359" style="s2">afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.240" end="00:52:17.760" style="s2">so i think i&#39;m i want to ask</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.359" end="00:52:19.359" style="s2">what kind what is your recommendation or</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.760" end="00:52:20.880" style="s2">what are your thoughts around the kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.359" end="00:52:23.440" style="s2">of compass</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.880" end="00:52:26.319" style="s2">i guess of the soul that we can build to</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.440" end="00:52:29.440" style="s2">be able to navigate these spaces where</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.319" end="00:52:30.000" style="s2">we can still be connected to i guess</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.440" end="00:52:32.880" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.000" end="00:52:34.800" style="s2">what is true to ourselves through this</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.880" end="00:52:38.319" style="s2">mysterious space</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.800" end="00:52:40.480" style="s2">right right thank you so much sister</p>

<p begin="00:52:52.160" end="00:52:55.119" style="s2">such a</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.280" end="00:52:56.400" style="s2">necessary question to ask and i&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.119" end="00:53:00.960" style="s2">grateful that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.400" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">you have asked that um</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.960" end="00:53:04.960" style="s2">but what comes to mind might seem like a</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:08.720" style="s2">buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.960" end="00:53:10.480" style="s2">diversion um from a direct response</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.720" end="00:53:13.760" style="s2">and maybe what comes to mind right now</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.480" end="00:53:17.920" style="s2">is is your life your own</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.760" end="00:53:17.920" style="s2">do our lives belong to us</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.440" end="00:53:26.480" style="s2">because if my life belongs to me then</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.480" end="00:53:29.040" style="s2">it&#39;s um it&#39;s a poor life by default</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.480" end="00:53:30.000" style="s2">it&#39;s poor because there&#39;s not much i can</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.040" end="00:53:33.920" style="s2">do with it</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.000" end="00:53:37.040" style="s2">um i like to think of myself</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.920" end="00:53:41.119" style="s2">my life if i could speak of it in</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.040" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">very contractual terms or</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.119" end="00:53:44.319" style="s2">property ownership terms i like to think</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.839" end="00:53:47.599" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.319" end="00:53:50.880" style="s2">as intergenerational that my</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.599" end="00:53:52.720" style="s2">failure belongs to many kinds of bodies</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.880" end="00:53:55.440" style="s2">not just human bodies but non-human</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.720" end="00:53:58.800" style="s2">bodies i&#39;m an animist at heart you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.440" end="00:54:01.119" style="s2">a new materialist so my body is not mine</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.800" end="00:54:02.800" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a part it belongs to a</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.119" end="00:54:07.520" style="s2">parliament of beings</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.800" end="00:54:10.880" style="s2">and voices and possibilities um</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.520" end="00:54:11.440" style="s2">and that means um and i i probably don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.880" end="00:54:14.079" style="s2">know why i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.440" end="00:54:16.000" style="s2">prefacing what i want to say with this</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.079" end="00:54:16.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s probably necessary to say this</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.000" end="00:54:19.520" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.880" end="00:54:20.640" style="s2">um the fears that we have about losing</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.520" end="00:54:23.680" style="s2">our way</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.640" end="00:54:26.800" style="s2">um or messing up</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.680" end="00:54:28.559" style="s2">or strain into because strain is very</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.800" end="00:54:31.200" style="s2">fearful business</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.559" end="00:54:32.800" style="s2">especially when you&#39;re found and cuddled</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.200" end="00:54:34.720" style="s2">and cradled in</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:36.480" style="s2">modernity just stating in the womb of</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.720" end="00:54:38.640" style="s2">modernity as we are</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.480" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">the invitation to become lost is</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.640" end="00:54:42.880" style="s2">frightening</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.839" end="00:54:44.799" style="s2">and even i speaking this to you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.880" end="00:54:46.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how that looks like every</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.799" end="00:54:50.319" style="s2">time right</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.240" end="00:54:51.839" style="s2">we can only approach it in modest ways</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.319" end="00:54:53.680" style="s2">and the approach there&#39;s no arrival</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.839" end="00:54:55.599" style="s2">sister there is only the approach</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.680" end="00:54:57.280" style="s2">the approach is the sacred not the</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.599" end="00:54:59.280" style="s2">arrival right</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.280" end="00:55:00.720" style="s2">um so maybe the reason why i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.280" end="00:55:03.920" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.720" end="00:55:07.119" style="s2">a bit of that fear might be alchemized</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.920" end="00:55:10.160" style="s2">into curiosity or even</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.119" end="00:55:12.559" style="s2">joy when we realized that our failure is</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.160" end="00:55:16.000" style="s2">also part of how the world materializes</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.559" end="00:55:18.319" style="s2">how the universe materializes that um</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.000" end="00:55:19.119" style="s2">the shrinking away from the dark spaces</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.319" end="00:55:22.480" style="s2">which were</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.119" end="00:55:25.599" style="s2">mostly conditioned to behave you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.480" end="00:55:27.200" style="s2">or to be like as modern citizens as</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.599" end="00:55:30.440" style="s2">modern subjects</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.200" end="00:55:32.240" style="s2">um shrinking away from animal alien</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.440" end="00:55:35.520" style="s2">subjectivities</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.240" end="00:55:37.359" style="s2">that is is a problem in itself</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.520" end="00:55:38.960" style="s2">and and maybe the invitation to see</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.359" end="00:55:42.319" style="s2">ourselves as large</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.960" end="00:55:44.319" style="s2">as diffracted as widespread you know is</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.319" end="00:55:45.760" style="s2">already answers that question in a way</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.319" end="00:55:49.359" style="s2">and don&#39;t fear too much</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.760" end="00:55:52.240" style="s2">in fact fear is a gift treat the fear</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.359" end="00:55:53.760" style="s2">as an offering and treat it in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.240" end="00:55:56.000" style="s2">company of others</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.760" end="00:55:57.920" style="s2">find ways of listening to elders those</p>
